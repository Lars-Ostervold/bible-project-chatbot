creation, in contrast to the feeble gods of Egypt.KEY 
THEME

the Hebrew prophets
...and in the New Testament to speak of God’s 
future justice.EXODUS 7:14-11:10; 12:12

the first worship song in the Bible, which looks back 
to the Exodus and forward to Israel’s entry into the 
promised landKEY 
THEME
5KEY THEMES
The word “salvation” is used for the first 
time in the Bible to describe the Exodus 
as act of divine deliverance.
The song claims the Exodus event shows 
that Israel’s God is the true God among 
all others.
The song looks forward to a future 
Exodus that will involve God bringing 
Israel into the promised land, saving them 
from hostile nations, and settling them in 
his presence.EXODUS 15

grumbling and complaining against God.KEY 
THEME
6KEY THEMES
Lack of food and water cause rebellion 
and anger against Moses and God.
While God provides Manna (Hebrew 
mah-nah = “what is it?!”), quail, and water, 
the grumbling of Israel introduces a dark 
theme in the story: Will Israel respond 
properly to the God who has rescued 
them? EXODUS 16:2-3; 17:1-2

BSTUDY GUIDE FOR EXODUS PART 1 CHAPTERS 1-18   8The book of Exodus begins with Israel’s divinely-
blessed multiplication and later enslavement by 
Pharaoh. How does the connection to God’s 
promises to Abraham give a wider perspective 
on the problem of Israel’s slavery? What’s at 
stake if God doesn’t redeem Israel? 
Work through all the passages about Pharaoh’s 
hard heart and God’s power in Key Theme 
2. What perspective does the story offer us 
on human moral freedom when its in conflict 
with God’s will? How does God demonstrate 
his patience in the story? At what point does 
Pharaoh reach a point of no return?
After reading Exodus 12-13, try to explain to 
someone in your study group the meaning 
of the sacrificial lamb in the dinner and the 
meaning of the blood-on-the-doorframe ritual. 
How does this symbolic meal transform your 
understanding of Jesus’ last supper with his 
disciples. 
How does Israel’s grumbling in the wilderness 
raise questions about their own gratefulness 
to God? Are their complaints reasonable? Why 
does the attitude of the Israelites seem so 
ridiculous after the Exodus story in chapters 
1-15? What is the story exposing inside our own 
hearts about our own grumblings against God’s 
character?DISCUSSION
