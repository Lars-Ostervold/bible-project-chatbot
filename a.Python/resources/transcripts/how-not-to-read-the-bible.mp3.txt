everybody Welcome to the Bible project podcast in today's episode we are near the end of a series we've been in for a while call the Paradigm series we have been exploring what we mean when we say our Bible project mission statement which is we want to help people experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus so we've been unpacking and that what we ended up calling Seven Pillars of the Paradigm we've been trying to recover an ancient Paradigm that is faithful to the design and intention of the scriptures themselves and trying to reshape what we think they are and what we should do with them in light of that and so what we're doing today is often we interview Scholars are authors who were riding on similar topics that we've been learning from so that's what today is we're going to interview a pastor and Professor Dan Kimble he is a pastor of a church
 which phase 3 planted almost twenty years ago now down in Santa Cruz but he's also an Adjunct professor at Western Seminary and he has written a few books but he has a really neat story he has a passion and dedication to Jesus to the scriptures and really helping people discover who Jesus is by learning about the scriptures and so we're going to interview him today cuz he is up putting out a new a new book that's right along the topics of what we've been talking about in the series book is called how not to read the Bible and it just came out in 2020 and in it he addresses all of these disturbing and important and common questions that a lot of Christians and people who are exploring the Christian faith has so he starts off with questions like why is it okay for God to kill children and not Harriet things like that it's got endorsing him in this property is God commanding gender inequality so these are really tough questions and he provides him
 that resume allows a paradigm that we've been talking about in in the series so he provides some tools for how to read these difficult passages were able to sit down with Dan do this interview so let's get to it
 so yeah Dan you're here we're going to talk about your book first of all thank you for writing this book down yeah thank you for your inspiration over the years to and this very the kind of discussion Chrissa you're here too and John you're also on the scene conversation and a podcast series that we're in right now about the Paradigm with which people approached the Bible the unspoken assumptions that we all approach the Bible with four different Traditions approach the Bible with and so in the series were trying to expose those unspoken assumption that can't Tinker with them and ask what are the most ancient assumptions that we should come to the Bible with that will help us really hear it on its own terms your scripture on its own terms so we've been friends for a number of years and we've been having this conversation for a lot of years and so what school is that what you've done this book is translate a lot of your learnings and convictions person
 play in pastoral Ministry into a really accessible and actually like funny like a fun and funny book but it's talking about some serious and important things like there is a lot of resonance between what we're talking about right now in this Paradigm discussion and what you're writing so I'm super excited that we get to offer this to our audience has a really engaging and practical resource maybe before we jump into the book and these topics to the first tell us a bit of your story Dan how does a how does a guy end up in pastoral Ministry adjunct faculty member at a seminary and having a deep interest in how people understand or misunderstand the Bible how does that happen to a person I grew up in Paramus New Jersey which is right by a New York City and I was a great upbringing there I didn't have Ace of any type really I wasn't against God I just thought there was some sort of God
 growing up there there's actually I went to college at Colorado State University and while I was there you know like they have these little pamphlet for that kind of give out at your first week of school type of thing and the different campus groups I walked by a little kind of pamphlet about Christianity and it had a focus on its Jesus being the only way or something like that and I don't know why but that statement that Jesus is the only way and then I opened up this little pamphlet and was looking at it and it had some of the Bible verses which I assume we're the ones that we are all one way to God and all that that's haunted me so much Mike the cushions really believe this and I had my parents telling me to go to church or anything so it was kind of like is this true is this what Christians really believe I hadn't thought about it ever before I only can say like it got me on like if this is true I certainly should want to know about this then and I went into a deep dive for no reason again I just think it was God
 remind me to him when I started questioning and started like reading books on the origin of the Bible and I bought a Bible for the first time out in Colorado and the big defining moment was is that my friends who aren't Christians started seeing me by bible stuff and I came home one time and they were gathered like in the living room and I walked in and I could tell they were talking about me and then it wasn't a plan an intervention but it was kind of like an intervention they said we're kind of worried like you're buying all of this Christian stuff and I don't know like what and then they just started describing they said well you know Christians at that time the end times like the Rapture and I was kind of big encryption subculture and they start to think like you know that you're waiting for the end times to come in and and one girl that is actually dating at the time she said like he does like creativity and they started telling us stuff and then I'm like
 is this true like they were asking out of concern Mike how do I know it's not a cult-like people get into Cults and they don't realize they're getting into Cults right though it caused me to actually stay is this true and really started diving into a lot of apologetics stuff and looked at different world religion so that's my my entry interface was that way and then I was into music and went out to the England London four-year plan in the pumpkin rockabilly band that's why I first said I'm a Believer in Jesus now and then I went to Israel for 5 months and lived on a kibbutz that could have the time and I was graduating college in the bass player in the band got a job in the Bay Area I moved out here and what compelled me saying I get to testerone Ministry and Ministry was that if what the scripture say is true and it's not a cult and Jesus is who he is I'm like I want other people to know that and that has been my compelling absolute motives for everything since like
 got to hear about this then you're about him and what are the barriers that people have against Faith to try to clear up and that's how I got into everything volunteering at church playing drums and then fill Comer dad of John Mark Comer is the guy that brought me on staff at Santa Cruz Bible Church right back and a Ministry sense not to speak to pastor of starting a church would be a good idea what I remember of our conversations over the years is that much of what you're doing in the book is processing years of conversations which is a lot and lots of people in your community about their struggles to read the Bible because being in Ministry let you know that we planted in his Faith Church in a 17 years ago now in Santa Cruz and being pretty immersed in listening to people's opinions and live special younger people University students and these are the difficulties and barriers to ask questions that keeps her passing up
 and over and over and over again that are causing people to think you know what was the good book and scripture is no seen the posters and evil book Christians who were raised in church has the whole lives end up giving up Faith because ironically of reading scripture and what they thought about it or what they're looking at it now as adults vs. just kids when they come to that point and so it's very strange that the Bible is being used to discredit Christianity and leave evenly spaced and that's why I wrote this because there are responses and the same motive like people have to know like the Bible is actually a good book not a evil book so that's why I wrote this to address the primary some things that we hear you have a Prelude in your book titled becoming atheist by reading the Bible describes an experience it's really common both to Christians and non-christians is this exactly what you're talking about now or tell us more about that for Christian depending on the church but there's so many like
 great wonderful churches that taught Bible but didn't teach what is the Bible and as like in a teenager's and we all get to a point of questioning things which is really good but all of a sudden you're looking at the Bible with fresh eyes and seeing these topics of slavery and the extreme amount of violence and all of these things that you know Bible verses that seemed to really demean women and all set now as young adults they're like oh my goodness like I didn't know this was in there and it's causing Christians then to be challenged about their face and that's kind of a new a lot of the Mantra out there I go to the prayer room just one particular time and there's a young woman in there and she was crying and I thought it might have been like a boyfriend break up or something and I'm like I can I pray for you about she's like I just need to ask you should I come not a Christian and you've been telling us to read the Bible and and then she said I started reading it and then I started getting really scared because she talked about Jesus a lot and I like that then I'm reading about a talking
 make the slavery in the early chapters and she said this very thing I'm worried I'm joining a cult and I'm getting very scared and she was upset and this was a non-Christian coming in June 13th Varsity I was Billy intelligently trying to process what was taught in the Bible so it's very real and atheists have it when I say atheist I'm talking about the militant atheist most atheist or kind loving wonderful people then there's the militant ones and you'll see tons of memes and and things that are saying reading the Bible causes you to be an atheist many of them say that I just found a read this to you it was a by the Winnie the Pooh author I never read this code before AA Milne Winnie-the-Pooh and he says this about the Bible he says the Old Testament is responsible for more atheism and agnosticism and disbelief call it what you will then any book ever written it as emptied more churches than all of the counter attractions
 Cinema motor bicycle and golf courses so I never heard that from Winnie the Pooh author about slavery and misogyny the balance of God whether Jesus is the only way it's it's like yeah these are really hard questions and the encouragement to the invitation to really dive in and wrestle with them both for those friendly to the Christian faith in those who wouldn't call themselves Christian is a really good invitation but not an easy one it's an important one though the Eldorado I am in the more I just think it says with great respect the Christian is just feels like it's insane that Christians don't want to read their Bible more desperately to know cuz I like how do you mess with her all our beliefs come from mission to Steve at church culture it should be where it's the origin of where we're learning about Jesus and faiths and beliefs from and yet now that some people are
 reading the scriptures more these things are what's popping up and being pointed out more if they like you shouldn't believe John I'm curious you know you had your own Journey that you shared about on the podcast about struggles with the Bible as I remember you telling that story over the years that the legion necessarily question everything you believe out everything but it made you frustrated with the Bible says interesting to think about these different experiences of people have just about The Oddities in challenging stories in the Bible to really want to read their Bibles I always think of how difficult it actually is Through the Bible and the one example that's has been standing out to me the most because Tim sent me this chapter just randomly for a completely separate thing it's in the first book of the Bible
 let's say you're trying to read the Bible in a year and you're cruising you're going through some hard stuff and then you get to Genesis chapter 38 I think it is and it's about Judah and his daughter-in-law and it's like sexually explicit gnarly and you're just like who's the good guy what's happening it's just like if you didn't want to give up back with the talking snake like I don't know how you're going to get through this chapter so this whole series of us talking about what kind of literature it is I was never given a framework for how to think about the literature was just this is God's word jump in and got him to talk to you through it and then you disappear like that and I'm just like wow like maybe I should just not read it and you say I did you said something actually if I leave enough passed orally which I should have added on to be right there because I think that has been a problem where you feel like read your Bible read your Bible read your Bible and then you just opened up and read it without understanding what it is and how to
 that can lead to actually a lot of confusion versus understanding what the Bible is and being taught more of how to approach it in to read it and what to expect in it so I think you said something really important I think every Christian probably knows you should read the Bible but we don't do teaching what is the Bible and how do we approach it in read it
 your audience is people who are face friendly Bible friendly and who are still open to and trying to read the Bible and you're trying to give handles on some of these really difficult issues when you are learning how to read the Bible and then actually reading it book structured into kind of six main parts and the first one is great you're really great at making clever text honey butt sisters main part is called never read a Bible verse for you'll have to Believe In Unicorns so what you mean by that and the thing about the unicorns but also trying to communicate something I think pretty foundational about what the Bible is what it what kind of book it is and how you should approach it and not the first section of the book like mention six parts of the one is kind of foundation apart and then we addressed the difficult issues of violence and slavery in women in those type of things but when it says never read a Bible verse in others Nepal
 just named Greg koukl and he would use that phrase and so I got the phrase from him and he is basically saying the church in general can really great at playing Bible verses about memorizing them putting on coffee cups and different like things like that and so often then using just buy for verses can lead to a lot of confusion about where it's from where it is in the story line and we have misused the Bible not intentionally but what's happening now is a lot of the anti Bible folks are guilty of the same thing they're pulling out Bible verses out of the grand story and then pointing them back at Christian and Christians aren't ready to respond they're getting very confused so what's up with unicorns I didn't know about the unicorns until my barber I never get my hair cut by a Christian Barber and the reason not that Christians can cut hair it allows me the opportunity to have conversations with barbers in this is another one that is going to and you know some of my personal faith and believing
 please listen to print time I came and he's like I didn't know you believe there's unicorns and I didn't know what he's talking about and then he's like those unicorns in the Bible and he then told him I called you see this and he saw it online and there's like it was on Pinterest I think there's memes and stuff to talk about Bible verses that like numbers I think in different places that will use the word unicorn if I look them up and sure enough you can type in unicorn and Bible and they'll be memes with graphics and Bible verses that talk about unicorns and at first glance if you don't know anything different you'll say look at this crazy stuff in the Bible but then this is a really easy one Kristen all it takes though if you do look at it the word unicorn was used in the 1611 King James translation so it's now put up on memes and Graphics which certainly is clever and it makes you feel awkward seeing him but when you look into it and that case it was simply a translation error if they didn't know what other word to use and today you'll see the word wild oxen because
 it is most likely a wild ox with a prominent horn that they were talking about that we know up today that back then they didn't know what words to they just use unicorn we made it a video on Psalm 148 which has one of these wild oxen as the main character the Unicorn oxen I wish there were unicorns in the Bible my daughter would be really excited about it why would they choose unicorn I think the word in the Septuagint is the one horned animal and so then they translated it into English as unicorn which I guess that makes sense but our understanding of what a unicorn is is just different than what they meant by a one horned animal things on Etsy people have taken a diagram of like unicorn standing on the shore line will the ark is a floating away and they'll say like we thought it was for a Time
 and that's why there's no more unicorn because he had missed getting on the ark
 so that the takeaway they're really kind of overlapping with what we've been talking in the Paradigm conversations about the unified the Bible is a unified story which means it's inappropriate to just take a lion or a bit out of a story as if it's its own Standalone idea or content or statement so it's really simple point and you're using a funny example with you know that the Unicorn actually fairly High here because if your audience or if you're not informed about what that unified story of the Bible is but you see people using the Bible to promote or prohibit this or that by quoting something says it can just get really unfortunate real quick so this the funny example but of course we could go on with lots of examples that are not funny at all and that's an easy solvable one because that was more of a translation error are other Bible verse is not a translation error it actually does say something that can lend itself to confuse
 and distrust of scripture in general but just like in the all these many things like what's going on in my my observations is that this conversation has moved from even academic world into pop culture and you'll see celebrities celebrities that have sixty-eight thousand likes on this tweet and the Tweet was talking about like shrimp and it was saying like look you are you cherry-pick versus and look how crazy the Bible is prohibiting shrimp and tattoos and those type of things from some Leviticus and then it got 68000 like likes and again it's mocking Bible looking at silly Christians are for believing that you shouldn't eat shrimp or touch the skin of a dead pig or the certain things are being pulled out and then mocked and Tommy Young Christian I'm then going to start saying like man I don't want to be silly or I don't want to feel like I believe in something naughty and even though the resurrection
 you put a reaction so people even a man rose again that's so but talking about that that's why this is getting confusing but like you just said you can extract the Bible verse without understanding where in the story line it is yeah your part two of your book has shrimp in the title it's stranger things shrimp slavery and the skin of a dead pig and their you're focusing on some of these really strange laws and the Torah what do you think some of those deep underlying problems with the typical way Christians read these laws is and how can we do that better well say you're looking at these and these are in the scripture it's not a translation notary where it does say you know things when it mentions markings on the body and tattoos and haircuts and dietary laws which turned out to not eat shrimp and don't touch the skin of a dead pig these things are real not a translation error but it's the same thing where we were saying you're reading who was
 written to like never read a Bible verse then you want to ask John Walton the professor from wait unless they like the Bible was not written it was written for us but not to us so we always have to go who was this written to originally and when you look at that as you're looking at the live at a collage you'll find it was written to the people of Israel while they were being moved into a land where there's all types of strange worship rites and practices by the surrounding people groups and God was and his presence was moving into this geographic area and moving along and he was setting commands of being distinct from other people groups but we don't live back then so they sound Bizarro to us and they are kind of bizarre but they they had meaning to the people of that time I mentioned the story of Athena's 1924 and like in Arizona there's a law that says do not keep a donkey in a bathtub
 and that sounds bizarre to us however if you were to go back into 1924 to that town in Phoenix you would find out that there was a farmer who kept a donkey in a bathtub and it washed into a mud Basin applied at a really difficult time getting it out and they had to settle on place like you know Farmer Joe no more donkey in the bathtub right so if you live back then you understood it today it sounds bizarre and that's why knowing the storyline is really important when you see strange Bible verses for how not to read the Bible or how to read the Bible would you recap those for us I think that'd be really helpful for our audience is the Bible is a library not a book and I have next to me here like I've just over the years when I hold the Bible whenever I open it I picture I'm walking into like an ancient library and over to the left or are some overgeneralize thinking about space
 law books and Scrolls over there number to the right there some poetry books there in several hundred years later and then over there there's some letters to these churches that were in the first century and so it's like when I walk into the library I want to go to what section and then if I pull a you know a book that was written for specific church I'm going to read it differently than wisdom literature that was written to the ancient Israelites and so you have to look at the Bible as a library not a book and you don't just pull Shelf books off the shelf and read them all the same so that's the first one the second is the Bible was written for us not to us and I kind of just walked through their importance is that a third one is never read a Bible verse the same thing you always have to look at where in the story line it is it because she on Jen and the early chapters of Genesis where vegetarian in chapter 29 where they were then allowed to eat meat if you just create the Bible verse in the early chapters Genesis anyone's and thin and breaking the commands of that God has laid out for us if you eaten
 later on it changes you have to look at where on the storyline so never read a Bible verse in the last one is all the Bible points to Jesus a unified story that ends up pointing to Jesus and that's major and understanding what the Bible is thinks it's as if we've been friends and talking about these ideas and learning together over the years
 yeah it's a great summary of like the things we've been talking about it a lot faster than how we have
let's shift to one of the stickier topics that you address in the book we have a whole section cleverly titled Boys Club Christianity so you're addressing ways that the Bible portray it as a perceived as we used to anti-women as misogynist it's all all the issues we talked about this fire come into play about individual Bible passages that can be lifted out of context yeah what are the Dynamics at play here this is something that strikes almost all modern readers if they read any part of the Bible at length why you felt like this was you really needed to go with us in the book when I first was reading through the Bible and I see versus like that now just like certain verse about women being safe to childbirth the four women be silent you know don't speak up in church or the stories you know of concubines in polygamy and just certain things that I'm just being honest that I read
 somebody's got it figured out even when I became youth director had a church I'd read those passages and a girl like somebody's got it figured out and I just kind of keep going and the moment that the change for me when I was working serving with young adults the church materials that we going through had a couple references and it was like 1st Corinthians and then some was like what's that and a young woman read the passage out loud remember and I am paraphrasing it but it was at a 1st Corinthians where it says you know women should be silent in the church they are not allowed to speak it a disgrace for a woman to speak in church they must go home and ask their husbands the questions and I remember sitting in that room seeing that verse in hearing it and they're all looking at me and I want to run and hide behind the couch and because I'm like I don't know how to answer it it's always been in there but I've ignored it but I can't ignore it anymore and again you're looking at these verses and there's so many of them
 but in today's world was happening is that you're seeing there's a guy that put it on his truck you know women be submitting be silent going to pick up in church puts on his truck and makes national news and his whole thing is Christian's read your Bible do even though that's in there and so that the emphasis has been women or demeaned concubine slavery of the patriarchal culture and that is the impression that the scriptures definitely give and it took me to them personally like is that true and then have to look in the scriptures to those principles and you find out know that's not true we're not just we're not reading the Bible in the way it was meant to be read by the original readers maybe talk about some of the ways forward that you discovered when it comes to that issue and that's the reason the highlighted is because you do this with a number of issues whether it's slavery in the Bible science in the Bible violence in the Bible and you kind of your trying to take the same Tack and all
 chapters so when it comes to this issue of the role of women in the Bible what were your kind of your guiding lights in your path forward all right well it's because again after you no stone. Don't don't just read the Bible but you know reading it for years now I see it as the full story and all of a sudden if there's a line or two in a story but then if you know the full story you start going like how does that make sense in the full story line of the whole Bible and I always go back to the beginning and then you see man and woman are created equally equal value of equal worth coach serving together that certainly doesn't seem to match up with women be silent and then submit to your husband so then you look through the storyline and then you see what happened when you mince rebelled against God and that way and then things changed but what you don't see we could talk for an hour to stop, stop.
 light is when you see the storyline you'll see that God was raising up women throughout the Old Testament God worked with what you and beings did also so God didn't create slavery that was something that was instituted by human beings and different ways and he was actually coming in and helping correct in a trajectory towards no slavery but same thing with women you'll see that there's women like Miriam Deborah God was using called a prophet so it couldn't have just been a blanket statement all women be silent you get to the New Testament and you put in some basic principles three chapters earlier in the 1st Corinthians passage I'm talking about chapter 11 puzzle is telling women to prophesy and pray so he can't be saying women be silent in all situations the source of specific situation is specific thing I was going on again we can talk about this in our but it's wrong to thin use those Bible verses against women that's not was their intent or their purpose and it's wrong when people do
 yeah this this point is seems really important and it's also just really hard to onboard because you think if if there's a book that is God's word book that is the holy book however you want to think about it and then to say but it wasn't written to you that these letters at like the one more time I was Paula cycle reading someone else's mail those two things feel so opposite like why wouldn't God write a book that's to everyone and then it just big question how am I supposed to engage with a book that wasn't written to me was read to other people that have to cut up parts out that seems like a really hard thing to click over I can stand when you when you do ministry in your church how do you see that that idea Landing for people and then how do you then help them read a book that's for them but not to them always like to jump immediately to application like
 every part of the Bible again for all of these years I didn't look at it like we're talking about now and so special my early years in a Christian and even on a church staff in the Bible was God's love letter to us and and admit it is his love letter of telling the whole story but I immediately would jump to what is this have to do with my life right so I think we were using the Bible and teaching the Bible to always jump the personal application immediately and that is not good Bible study methods to do that so in order to change that church leaders I think you say if we've talked about 1st Corinthians when we're teaching it we usually have a full Sunday just talking about where was Corinth what was going on who are the players that are going. That you might see rising up in the scriptures it's telling the story of setting up where all this came from I mean this isn't just saying this cuz I'm talking to you guys but we often will play the Bible project video
 the church when we start up teaching series on something because the information is out there for people so I think church leaders must pay attention to this so we're not ending up hurting people and we were trying to help them understand scripture I think there's a there's a dynamic here when this issue that you're raising John comes up and as the years go by cuz I feel like this is the underlying theme for years in the conversations we're having and me I keep seeing how there's a close connection between this question and the Very premise is a biblical story which is that this portrait of God is love a God who chooses to interact with the world and be present in the world in and through image bearing humans which means in the story humans are the main way that God is going to embody his will and purpose and communicate in the world and so what God has to say
 is developing along with the human story and that itself is a key part of the story which means that there can't be a moment where it's to everybody
 because of God's the Living God he's interacting with each generation on its own terms and so what are you would have to say now will be based on the wisdom of what he said before but it also it's what God is saying now and it's still to be discovered because that's just the nature I guess of the existence within the story for me personally where that takes me is that when I'm looking for God to give me the like the list of rules or the list of answers that would answer every question that I might have in a way it's like taking away the responsibilities I have as a human to live by wisdom and to learn to discern God's will Here and Now based on the story that says if I want the Bible to do the hard work but the spirit is asking us to do by cultivating wisdom to understand how to live out the vision of the biblical story here and now what's that makes any sense so say what you're saying but it's such a mystery and gods
 spell revealing things so does that mean that everything's a mystery ethics and morals that I can then just sort of because that's kind of a criticism that or a taking advantage of things that way so is everything up for grabs that says love God and love your neighbor when she was about sex or just us in the community or treatment of the poor would come up you would appeal to these walls ancient laws but then drive wisdom from them that over how I transcended time and place but one thing Jesus didn't do was just like Paul vs. out of context he would quote like a law but then drive this wisdom principal would transcend and my response but I'm sure you get that question to Dan like oh my God said this here but then he says this year so how do we know God won't change his mind to tell us something
 no I'm hearing that more and more so that's why I was using it up till it's just to say that you know there are things that are Mysteries and thinks we wish God would have been clearer about but then there are many things that he was very clear about in the New Testament not running again through the author's New Testament then we can cling on to those and have more confidence in what the true Tsar that we can know and then less Stranglehold on to other things that may be like were not quite as clear yes what you're saying is there's these elements of the biblical story like or claims about the nature of human beings which has more or less ethical implications about how we should treat each other and shouldn't and while those might be worked out in different ways at different moments in the biblical story you can point to every part and be like yeah don't murder it's very clear like it's not very difficult sexual Integrity is a super high value how human beings treat each other sexually it's like really and
 all throughout the biblical story that's what you're saying there's these kind of seems that just don't they don't shift but then we have other ones like when it comes to slavery for example where you do watch God working with a culture where it's at but pushing it in the direction and a Redemptive Direction which is happening is making the Bible so mysterious that we can't have any troops that we can hold on to that would not be accurate you just going to do some rest it up really well just then what it is it was that movie The Perfect Storm like several things going at once I think what's going on what's causing so much of the confusion is that there's a wave of the church overall didn't teach we did what I did earlier almost incorrectly like read the Bible and then just put it out there and didn't talk about what is the Bible and how do we read it right now so there's that out there then you have generation or two now that are growing up even if
 questions that don't know how to read the Bible or what's in it and even there's a lesser degree of Bible knowledge from so many and then you have the rise of the accessibility to clever memes and information out there that are pulling up Bible verses that usually out of context as well and criticizing the Bible and it's catching so many people off guard and if you don't know the scriptures then you don't know how to defend or think of it and that's what's under my name so many people's face and keeping people away from face because they would want to be part of such a crazy crazy call CS Lewis wrote a really amazing you're up something and it's really been wanting to me because he talks about the amount of information that's out there any talks about the importance of Theology and he said that she said theology is practical and this is our Thai theology to me is studying scripture to understand what God is left
 he says in the old days when there's less education and discussion perhaps it was possible to get on with a few simple ideas about God but it is not so now everyone reads this was written in the 1940s and lectures everybody Reeves everyone hears things discuss consequently if you do not listen to theology that will not mean that you have no ideas about God it will mean that you have a lot of wrong once bad muddled out of date ideas for a great many of the ideas about God which were trotted out as Novelties today are simply the ones that real theologians tried it centuries ago and rejected there's so much information out there today about Bible God beliefs and that's why understanding the Bible is more important than ever before I mean I can sell my body actually reacting to this gation it's so important because I think least we have sold unintentionally created Christianity to be in contemporary times
 Church activity and music and so many people they based their faith morning activities of churches in good things in the songs but everything we do is coming from somewhere ideas of who Jesus is coming from somewhere and all of a sudden slavery versus are pulled out and don't eat shrimp and don't play football and women should be silent and submit also needs are being raising to the surface then you'll be really shocked when these things are brought up and it'll be harder to deal with them a bunch of times but he said if some 137:9 and the verse I'm just reading the Bible verse alone and says happy as the one who takes your babies and smashes them against the Rocks so you take that verse and I'm looking at them right now I can pop it up with a nice meme in the graphic and someone ironically took animated like a little heart symbol out of their hands with the sunset and that Bible verse underneath it
 I'm saying like look at your God so happy it's the one who smashes babies against rocks that's in your Bible you reading it what are you do you look at it where was Iran in the Psalms what are the Psalms there's poetry and expressing emotion and you have to look at who said that that's not God's words that's the psalmist writing those words what was going on at the particular time if I command that you're reading it's someone who it was a poetic expression of someone who's experiencing horror and grief because it was from the destruction of Jerusalem in the Captivity and they probably did the way people would kill her if eclate would they would throw babies against the ground to kill them on their capture City and therefore someone's riding out like for justice and anguish and pain and that's that little verse that's not God commanding something where are saying that's what he'd alike and that's what's important Lee than convincing people Christianity and if you believe in the Bible you are crazy and even in a cup
 yeah when we read that we're supposed to grieve with the poet and we're supposed to feel like it's really dark and painful
that's what scares you have three final parts of your book and they relate to the conflict some people feel between science and the Bible when they read the Bible Christianity's relationship to other religions so the idea that Jesus is the only way to God and then Divine violence and the Old Testament those are three really difficult topic and I'm curious to know and your experience which of these are coming up the most and your church or with people you talk to and if you could just give us a snapshot of some of the main themes underlying these chapters well with the science one and you guys have done some excellent work on Genesis course but I think what to a non someone outside of the church generally what's portrayed about the Bible is that it's either a a young Earth talking snake like a car version in The Jungle Book understanding of the early chapters of Genesis or it's nothing and I think
 painted like it's only one way or the other and if you doubt it then you're doubting God's word. Just think it could be anything different and so we've set up a horrible tension for many young people to even face as they start thinking more combined science but then when you start looking into Genesis and you start realizing the questions that God was communicating to the people of Israel were not the questions that that we have today they weren't asking the people of Israel thing coming out of Egypt after 400 years and slavery in a policy has to culture and understanding the world view you know of how they saw the land Sky know they're asking like how do we worship this God we worship this God like the Egyptian gods like I have you survived out here right our questions are how do you explain the transitional fossil records and question about the Earth start from primitive amino acids on all of these things they're not the questions that they had and then we try to read into text questions that was not meant to answer
 unfortunately then that causes fall out because there's people's lives that are confused about this near the science is obviously there's so many of them can God defy science absolutely believe in a man that physically rose again from the dead and I would die for that and then you can explain that other than God intervene but let's not argue about things that shouldn't be arguing about like that cuz she becomes a dividing line and really tough that's why I addressed the science issue and they weren't asking if dinosaurs can the Ark by the way. Just like in that was a very interesting star for the red understand it will be Legends it's the storyline of God in the beginning even Karen Armstrong who wrote the book The History of God his son Jesus talks about salvation and we believe that's through the atonement of what he did on the cross
 you're saved and all that it's not saying that we're at we're exclusive and we're nowhere better than other people but you look at the whole storyline of humanity and the Bible tells of that then when Jesus makes total sense when you see the whole story line then you see how other worlds Fates make total sense you know they were developing things that weren't about the one true God as they spread across the planet and in different things so like the world religion questions obviously really big but you have to look at it in the story line again in the violence one is tough bottom line God did use violence violence happened at the cross was violent but God is not a random violent using monster who just killed people for no reason and it's the criticism all jealous and Petty and just start killing people when God use violence there were reasons for it and that's why knowing the god of the whole Bible so important is that we trust that God and when he did use violence than I trust but let me ask you guys if this because this is a danger well
 violence in their God would never use violence so that didn't really happen the Israelites just made up those stories and they recorded them in scripture so don't worry they were they really didn't happen how would you answer that I haven't heard that take actually becoming more common but yes play in the violence in the Old Testament by saying that the Israelites wrote what they just thought it would be good to write about their God how they would portray events that happened in their time they would attribute them to God and to God and acting on their behalf or something but that we don't have to take that seriously that portrayal of God he was inviting was about to bring the hammer on Jerusalem right and that's why his many warnings about Jerusalem but at the same time Jesus himself is claiming to represent
 embody God's mercy right to the people that he's warning that's a question I always have at that point is if we're going to attribute all portraits of God's violence just two human misunderstanding you have to carry that on to Jesus's own view of his father bringing Justice on Jerusalem ya to meet a lot of things start to unravel she could have that direction and it seems like Jesus and Hebrew Bible authors just had a deep sense that God is the author of life and so he can give it and he can take it away and the wind God does that he does as a last resort and as a form of justice and that's hard for me but I think based on Jesus's own teachings to drive from his reflection on the Hebrew scriptures that seems like that's something he would want his followers to take on board and the main point there is that it's God's prerogative not even representatives of God to be doing that on God's behalf
 cuz that always goes poorly John mentioned earlier there's a lot of crazy violent morbid stuff in the Bible but a lot of them are human beings doing it not under God's command and it recorded the horrible stories but that doesn't mean God was for those things happening if you seen the The Scary Mary video of someone took Mary Poppins in for those that don't know Mary Poppins is the Walt Disney film about a good nanny magical Nanny that comes in and help the family so she's all like loving and caring and but what they did was they took the movie and extracted a few points of the movie where he knows like her staring at a kid and then that the bike is like sucked up into the chimney or then locked into the closet or the end she might look mean for a second I just capture that quick part and then they put it together and like a 60 second clip called Scary Mary and at the end it says hide your children
 but if I only saw that I would think it was a horror film and scary Mary if I don't know the whole story and then all the bits of that clip where truth they do come from the story I think that's kind of what's going on with the Bible in many ways that they're extracting little pieces putting them together to create something but you have to know the whole story she understand wait a minute that's not that's not marry this isn't God you know God is compassionate and loving and kind and patient and that's the god of the Bible not just this one specific story your things they might piece together to portray him in all of these ways so knowing the whole story so critical that the entire book and what I appreciate it is you are articulate in a very easy to read book that you're dressing dents topics but it's written in such an accessible
 and you're dressing so many of the same key issues that we're trying to address helping reshape how people read and understand the Bible so I sit right there so much alignment and that's also cuz we've been learning a lot of the same things from about the same people of the last few years so I'm excited for the book to be out there and to see how people respond to it I hope people find it really helpful cuz it's a dressing things not in a way that we really believe it too yeah I would plead plead plead with youth leaders especially and even children leaders to teach about this stuff early cuz when they then get to college or they start as you would he's thinking you were in high school as well and also now they're looking at it talk and saying all of these teachings and these short little bitch that sounds so authoritative and confident But there again if they're doing the same fault of there and how they're teaching it please teach about the stuff early on so that then when they do see things that I
 oh it's not catching me off-guard as much anymore and once you understand the basic principles like you know that you guys teach me all the time then when you see disturbing things it doesn't shake you up as much because they're still disturbing but you'll be like okay there must be more to it or let's look at what's going on and so I just beg I beg parents and youth leaders and church leaders to please teach about this stuff earlier on two Children and Youth and Young adults meet everybody should but especially especially then yeah so you could send them to 12 hours of hammering away quick and accessible and delightful but thanks so much for sharing your work and for all of your kind words well thank you I said I can't simply shade but I'm so thankful to the Lord all the time or what you were doing so I can't express that enough I'm getting emotional thinking about right now
 right back at you and John when you're writing on those clear glass boards and then you and John fused together and had the idea it's so wonderful to see how God has been using you to it the most important thing really is understanding scriptures cuz all of our Lives come out of that what we learned so and we can respond to
