we're beginning the third and final movement of a scroll of numbers this movement begins with a seemingly insignificant little story it's about the daughters of a man named on the hot seat. Car dies in the wilderness and he has no Sons just these daughters which means when it's real gets to the promised land and the land is dispersed among all the tribes of Israel every family gets a portion but God he will have a son to inherit his portion to the Five Daughters come before Moses and all the leaders of Israel and they say you know what this doesn't seem right why should our branch of the family tree be cut off from the edenland just because we're women but the thing is this is how God instructed his real to disperse the way to the Sun what you have is this group of daughters who are bringing to Moses and Yahweh the fact that there's a gap in the laws of the Torah there's a scenario that the laws don't address
 the laws as currently stated will lead to what they're trying to say is Injustice the whole Branch will be lost from the family tree just because women can't inherit land and what God says they are right there shouldn't be a family that loses possession of the land just because there is not a patriarch this all takes place in an ancient patriarchal setting what made these women think that they could approach Moses and make an amendment to the law there is a narrative in the Torah that talks about male and female as partners ruling over the Eden land together and that the Garden of Eden story God's original commands in Genesis one was to male and female let them rule within the logic of the Torah these daughters are to be seen as appealing to God's core original heartbeat for a partnership of male and female over the land is important remember where this is all heading is real is to be a kingdom of priests and a new abundant.
 didn't land it's a big Nationwide reboot of Adam and Eve's original calling to be God's priests in the Abundant Garden of Eden and so if this generation is like a new Adam and Eve there is no coincidence that you have here a story about men and these women saying hey we can possess and have responsibility over the land to I'm John Collins is his Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I begin the third movement of the scroll of numbers in a quick apology you're going to notice as we began talking that when we reported I was dealing with a bit of a sickness
 thanks for joining us here we go
ATM John hello hi
 so we're in the third movement of numbers Bobby bar in Hebrew by made by yes in the wilderness otherwise known by the thrilling title of the Book of Numbers man yeah we have been talking your way through the book which has a lot of parts stories laws poems really this girl has it all in the Torah and this last movement consisting such a book from chapter 26 to 36 of numbers it has among what for most people are probably the least interesting
 courtesans Torah fantastic and my goal over the next three conversations is to show you that this is actually so cool and fascinating the stuff that's going on in here okay so that's my mission should we choose to accept it that's a great challenge I'm excited to see how this goes yep maybe first let's take an overview just catch the big picture showing okay so numbers has three large movements that and the number scroll itself is the third Scroll of three scroll Mega unit at the heart of the Torah so the Torah has five Scrolls
 think of it like a sandwich toward meeting the first five books of the Bible first five books of the Old Testament Hebrew Bible the outer books The Genesis scroll in the Deuteronomy scroll saw the first in the fifth match as a frame around the Torah in all kinds of ways and we've kind of talked about that before and then the first Genesis scroll tells the story from Human to the death of Joseph and the Exile of Jacob's descendants down in Egypt waiting to go into the promised land and at the end of the Genesis scroll Jacob the patriarch speaks a promise of blessing and hope over his children with the hope that they'll go back into the land the Deuteronomy scroll and with the descendants of Jacob now a network of tribes and they are waiting outside the land to still go into the land
 to fulfill that hope that Jacob died hoping for at the end of the Genesis grow so similarly you have Moses dies at the end of Deuteronomy speaking words of blessing and hope for the Twelve Tribes waiting for them to go into lamps that's a very intentional design parallelism between Genesis and to Romulus the frame around the Torah then in the middle of the tour of three Scrolls Exodus Leviticus Numbers Exodus begins with slavery in Egypt and then the first movement their Liberation From Slavery second movement of Exodus is going through the Wilderness on the way to Mount Sinai and then the third movement is there at Mount Sinai
 matching that is another little mini sandwich within the sandwich
 so matching Exodus you hop over Leviticus and go to the fourth scroll which is where we've done with Family Dollar in the wilderness and so what school is how the movements of the numbers scroll is designed as a mirror opposite of exodus so the last movement of Exodus is about the building of the Tabernacle where God dwells among them the first movement of numbers is about the arrangement of the camp of Israel around the Tabernacle at its Center and there's all this parallelism between it the middle of Exodus is that wandering through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai in the middle of numbers does about wandering through the Wilderness leaving Mount Sinai and there's matching Wilderness grumbling stories then that's what we talked about the last, three conversations the Wilderness do Rebellion stories
 so what's interesting now is that the first section of Exodus which is all about Pharaoh's dread of Israel he attempts to curse them and kill them off three times these are the enslavement of pharaoh at the beginning of Exodus but then on the third attempt of Pharaoh's attempt to kill Israel God raises up a delivery for Israel and that's the person that Moses interesting Lee the Wilderness journeys of Israel culminate with another king being fearful and Dreadful of the Israelites and that's the king of Moab and so he also has three attempts where he tries to curse and Destroy Israel
 that makes sense yes yes it makes sense I am really worried this is hard to follow oh okay auditorily yeah yeah okay so this makes a lot of sense so what you're saying is Genesis and Deuteronomy the beginning and the ending of the Torah they match and they're like outer frames that leaves in the center of the Torah three Scrolls excess of Atticus and numbers and then kind of work as one big Mega unit you could think of it as the big meat Patty would like the bond of the Torah but there's a lot of complexity and how these are designed and in fact Exodus scroll on one side and the numbers were on the other side Leviticus 23 in the middle of each other and all sorts of ways it's like when you zoom into the middle of the sandwich and you realize there's not another one layer of protein in there or meet
 or Beyond beef there's actually three there's three patties in the middle and low and behold the middle of the middle is a it's like okay here's what it is two slabs of tofu
 with the vegan cheese in the middle
 why would the two matching slabs of tofu our Exodus numbers in the vegan cheese is Leviticus in the middle into the like meat of the Torah sandwich you realize I'm dealing with a new sandwich yeah and so the sandwich now within the sandwiches exelsa Pittacus numbers the new pieces of bread say our exes and numbers and the new meat Patty is Leviticus yep I mean this out fractals work you're like looking at a fractal at one level and you see a sandwich and you move into the fractal and lo and behold there's another sandwich exactly sandwich fractal that's right and so what you're showing us is that Exodus and numbers match and all sorts of ways in Reverse to like Exodus move forward and the numbers does the same movement but then backwards backwards they start with The Showdown with a king and a king of Egypt they go through the
 and then they get to Sinai and they get the Tabernacle tractions yeah that's right so that the Tabernacle can be in the middle of the camp and then we hang out in Leviticus and the meat of the sandwich and then when we get out to the other side we reverse the Tabernacle is kind of established the order of it and then they go through the Wilderness and then what you're saying is this third movement in numbers is matching the first movement and Exodus the transition from the 2nd to the 3rd Movement of numbers matches the way that The Exodus Crowell begins correct and so we ended our last conversation with the stories about bailing the Pagan Sorcerer And what I didn't highlight but I'm highlighting it here because we're at the hinge between the second and the third movement of numbers
 is that numbers the king of Moab a guy named block it says that he has dread of Israel in his land because they are many and too Mighty and it's exactly the same words used to describe pharoah at the beginning of Exodus pair looks of the Israelites in his way up these guys are really beautiful what he says exact same thing as my land or many and to MIT and he has dreads of the Wop is a really unique word use a just these two points in the Torah scribe these two kings responding to Israel as the fruit for multiplying people do to clear hyperlink saying hey what's happening with the king of Moab bolic is were ripping off of all the themes and ideas as that we established with this other king who was horrible and enslaved Israel as a king of Egypt that's right in the king of Egypt in Exodus chapter 1 and 2
 three attempts to destroy Israel in the third attempt blows up in his face cuz it results in Baby Moses floating into his house similarly the king of Moab makes three attempts to curse Israel through hiring a pagan Sorcerer And this the third attempt that really blows up in his face because it's the third attempt that result in the cursed turning into a blessing in the third blessing is a promise that God makes that a seed a royal seed will come up out of the waters that Israel no joke LOL yeah that's right you read that Moses came up out of the waters into the house of Fara signaling the future defeat a pharaoh in the waters so now the third attempt of the king of Moab there's a promise of a future seed Royal seed who will come up out of the waters to be victorious King over Israel's enemies okay so the Future King from the
 find of Israel that will rule the Nations is set on analogy to Moses write who was brought up by God to bring victory over Egypt so the past Exodus Deliverance is now being set on analogy to a future excess Deliverance to the Future King that's really that's really significant because you'd like to go because at this point in the story they've been liberated you know they have the trouble in the wilderness but they're past that now and they're going to go into the promised land it almost kind of feels like great the store is winding down like we're getting towards the end like if we're watching a movie you would feel it like okay we're moving we're about to like find the end of this movie the resolution is coming this kind of one last Showdown and then it's over but here then all the sudden you're saying by putting this blessing from Balaam about the
 that's going to come it's kind of like saying hey stay tuned there's going to be a new new Exodus with a new Moses with a new Moses yeah totally and this is all setting us up for the scroll on the other side of Deuteronomy that's going to match the sending of numbers which is about the new Moses is Joshua whose name means Yahweh brings salvation so just as just as Moses was to Egypt so now a new Moses will be to the Nations that are opposed to God's purposes and this is all setting us up for the Book of Joshua in the entrance of the Israelites into the promised land which is what the final movement of numbers is all about which is going to be about when you go into the land here is how I want you to begin to prepare to be a holy people in the land cuz all you've been is a holy people enslaved or holy people
 in the wilderness so we need to prep the people to live under the rule of a new Moses who will guide Is Real by God's wisdom and instruction and that's what this final section of numbers is about but the story of Balaam is this pivot that's what this is is it's the melody the Wilderness has become like a purifying flood that has allowed all the Israelites who didn't want to enter into the good land of God's promise and rebelled against him seven times over in the wilderness 7 rebellions yep that's the generation that is dead except for 3 Moses Joshua and Caleb and Moses himself has come the time and so as we pivot and we waved goodbye to the Balaam stories what we're going to come across in this new movement is a new census that will number the new generation of the the second generation and it matches
 Numbers chapter one which is why the book of numbers is called The Book of Numbers census since it's what he said
 census has the other can't be right that's like octopuses okay yeah I'm with you actually not octopi octopus that's what I mean like let me look up since its plural since I sent the fact that there are two cents I in the Torah and the first one Pierce in Numbers Chapter 1 numbering the generation that came out of Egypt the second one appears at Numbers chapter 26 numbering the children that back this generation who are now going to be the ones to enter into the promised land in those two senses list kick off the first and then the third movement of the number scroll to attack the kind of sticks out so yeah the Book of Numbers actually really exciting and fascinating but it has a lot to do with keying into the literary design of the number scroll
 but I understand the literary design of the number of scroll you have to see the sandwich with in the sandwich of the Torah yeah numbers The Book of Numbers is designed the way that it is as a mirror opposite of exodus on the other side and without seeing that parallelism and the design parallels The Book of Numbers feels and reads to most people like a jumble of narratives and laws that it's really hard to understand their sequins that's one thing I've noticed by talking about literary structure it's helped me appreciate why it feels like sometimes stories are random feels out of sequence or feel ya just unnatural in a way that's exactly right in other words and memorize this is many conversations with God in the first movement of numbers the stories are actually out of chronological sequence like there's chronological notes in the numbers one through twelve and they're all out of order
 so some things have happened like this was a month ago but then you skip a month forward then skip 2 months back and it's because especially in the Torah and general there's a macro sequence like a macro time sequence going from creation to the death of Moses outside the land but when you get internal to each scroll the organization and sequencing of stories and literary units is often out of chronological sequence so there's some other guiding principle for why these scrolls are arranged the way they are and symmetrical design in order to invite the reader to meditate on things that are paired in symmetrical designs is one of the main features of the Torah yeah so is a lot of payoff for understanding the design of numbers so that's kind of nerdy stuff and it requires also whiteboard drawings their charts so we tried to do that verbally but we're going to do is transition into the final movement of numbers which we kind of been tearing up somatic leave it's about the taxes generation is almost
 play dad except for Moses Joshua and Caleb and so we're going to restart that generation with a new census and then the last eleven chapters of numbers are about preparing the Next Generation for life not in the desert but for life looking forward in the Promised Land
okay so you won't be surprised that there are three main sections the last chapters of numbers 26 to 36 sections to the third movement it's there's a lot of material a lot of really diverse stories and laws in the section and I still have some work to do on the literary organization of this so I think where I've landed is kind of its native design but I'm still tweaking the edges so what am I to do actually is just kind of I'd like to zoom in on some little groups of stories and kind of show how when you read stories next to each other and compare them you can see bigger themes emerging and the major theme of this is how is the next Generation to live in the promised land when I actually almost all the laws of the Torah are given to Israel while they're in the wilderness or at Mount Sinai and that's cool
 but the laws are of many of them are specified for people who are living on the go in the nomadic lifestyle and the land is going to be settled existence okay so we're going to get a whole lot of new laws yet the section full of laws okay interspersed with narrative so far for laws we first got the 10 the big giant yes at Mount Sinai Mount Sinai then we got 42 more what was that called this Scroll of the Covenant Covenant code for the school of the Covenant yes what it's called in Exodus 20:4 and then that's it right for a little bit well know then you get all the instructions about the Tabernacle in to get all these are some of the Tabernacle and the commands to build and specifications of how to build all those are given by God to Moses and those are numbered among the 613 commands of the Torah so those are laws in the toilet and then you the building of the Tabernacle and then in Leviticus
 you get all sorts of laws related to the ritual around the Tabernacle the sacrificial rituals around it so how to do the sacrifices how the priests work within the space that's Leviticus 127 you also get a bunch of the Holiness and Purity laws correct write a center of living is right is about how to purify the Israelites through water rituals and sacrificial rituals from any contamination that comes from contact with death through bodily fluids and all that it is that it are we done with laws no that's the limit of Kiss 11 through 15 leading up to the day of atonement then the last third of Leviticus is about Mortal Holiness our moral purity of the people and then about their ritual calendar that creates a set of rhythms where they live all the feast days as the fractals of the Sabbath
 turns into monthly turns into annual turns into 7 and then 7 x 7 will do Palais and so those are all among the 613 Commandments Dora yeah and then we get into numbers and we have the census we are the is the commands about how to order on the Tabernacle order those counted in the 600 the threat yeah yeah and how to make the camp ritually pure as they travel through the Wilderness and then the second movement of numbers is really not any lies they're there all right we just didn't talk about them cuz there wasn't time yet but actually there's three blocks of laws matching the three big blocks of rebellion stories 7 Rebellion stories but they are arranged in three blocks and each block there's a rebellion stories followed by a collection of laws and it's so cool like how that section works but we don't have time to talk about it a lot a lot
 who sang know that all of it kind of has in mind being a Wilderness people almost all of them are locked into the Wilderness setting and so what you get here some in the S section of numbers but all now in the last is culminating how the wisdom of the laws given to the Wilderness generation needs to be transformed into wisdom and guidance for life in a settled land all of a sudden we have a new context yeah this is usually significant for this last section cuz we're going to see is how laws principles and wisdom of the laws given to the Wilderness generation are going to be picked up and transformed and because the context is changed and that's actually what makes this second so fascinating okay so that's the big idea is that this is going to be a group of narratives and laws all pointing towards preparing to live in the land and
 one last macaron up before we look at some stories and laws is that this generation is being set on an allergy to Adam and Eve who were taken from the land of the dust and death human in Genesis 2 was formed Out of the Dust outside of the garden outside of eating and then God pick them up and arrested them who's know his name is a very arrested them in the garden he planted and said the trees the abundance it's all yours but he gave one command about one item of obedience that was trust so through all kinds of hyperlinks this generation which is now the younger Generations children who need to learn your back from that and so it says this this is like Humanity being reborn at the Gate of Eden they're about to go in and God saying okay when you go in here is how I need you to live so that you can truly have life
 cuz if you don't live this way you're going to find yourself exiled unto death the first he didn't had one simple rule that's right totally only eat of the tree of knowing good and bad and he gave it to the human after he put them in here it's inverted there in the wilderness outside still about to go in and they're going to get a lot of they're going to get a lot of a lot of rules yeah totally analogy between Eden and the promised land Israel and human outside Eden is going to be drawn upon and developed in multiple parts of this still eating eating everywhere man it's like if you don't get eaten you don't get the Hebrew Bible it's like like a key to unlock the Mysteries
 okay all right sweetie I didn't look at some stuff and let's do so I'm going to have us just look at the first three stories that essentially makeup chapters 26 and 27 in this is all going to be focused on the Next Generation so chapter 26 begins it says then it came about after the plague and that's the another wave of divine the last wave of God's justice against the rebellious generation there was a final rebellion was that the bronze snake one know the final culminating rebellion was after all the blessings that God spoke on Israel through Balaam they have one more Rebellion it's actually outside the 70 it's the 8th and it replaced the golden calf and so there's a lot of deaths and idolatry and ritual sex happening and it's it's an important story but we don't have time to talk about everything so after that whole debacle that was like it registers the last
 gasp of the rebellious generation after that we spoke to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to Aaron. The first high priest is dead now too son this place saying take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from 20 years old and upward by their father's household whoever is able to go to the war in Israel and so they go on to take the census and it's essentially verbatim how they do it is revealed them to all chapter 1 of how they took census of the previous generation the one thing it's interesting here is that multiple times in the census as their listings through Clans or tribes basically any time they come to a clan or tribe that was involved at one of the rebellion's from earlier in the book it'll stop and summarize the story so it's a census it's telling you about the Next Generation
 contrasting them to their ancestors sang listen to this next Generation they didn't you know they were kids so they watch their parents do stupid stuff but this generation you know was spared from all of that so it's lots of retellings of that but what's really interesting that one point when you get to the clans of the two sons of Joseph you get to verse 33 and you get to this one sub-clan of Manasseh who is the son of Joseph and you learned about this guy named zelophehad zelophehad it's hard to say Ian in English and you know I'm just I forget what it means I'm looking it up real quick here looking up and color Baumgartner Hebrew Aramaic lexicon devil Testament the meaning of this personal name is uncertain
 I thought I was going to see how interesting ooks right it's made up of two Hebrew words at least the consonants are cell is the word for shadow or refuge and then is the word from something that's terrifying so a shadow from Terror that's what Marco note Empire Martin note interesting a shadow From the Terrace View cool names Refuge villain named what not but it means he's a refuge he's The Refuge from the terror so you like name it's like your dad if I kind of what you know like a a protective mother or father is to their Shadow means Refuge Shadow is a key biblical image of Refuge oh yeah yeah not shadow in the bad sense like the place of Darkness yeah it's Shadow like what a tree provides from the Sun okay
 it's a better term shade from Terrace food from the name is going to have a hard time and what you learn is he has no Sons but only daughter's and the names of his daughters were mostly Noah hoglah milk and tearzah and there's lots of debate about the meanings of these daughters names like milka means Queen Noah means the light that's not Noah that's a different one it's it's not no off in terms of rest it snowed and it means something delightful for beautiful here forgive a whole lot me in tears that means like a sparkly something a pleasure Beauty
 and my flight hoglah I think my class is spelled the same letters as the word sickness. Definitely fit anyway they have interesting names at least a number of them are names of like Beauty and Sparkle and queen this information so it's a preview for the next door that's going to happen after the census lists it's okay there's a guy with no Sons only daughter's and then you're going to hear at the end of the census all the way down here that you get the the summaries of the census and the numbers the last lines are there was not one among them who were numbered in the previous census by Moses and Aaron all that generation died except Caleb and Joshua and this is the next little preview for another story to come so there's a little try out here the Begins the section you get the census
 football is next to the story about that guy zelophehad in his daughters and then we'll follow as a story about Joshua this is all about the Next Generation
okay so here's the story the story is rad man so the daughters of zelophehad the son of Heather the son of gilad son of my dear son in Manassa from the family of Vanessa from the son of Joseph it we already learned that it's a hyperlink linking it up to the previous chapter his daughters came in there and in case you don't remember here's the names of the daughters again the list them and they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders at the door of the tent so they come to the little eating hotspot yeah that's about as far as they can go totally yeah I think the point is is that they are coming to the center of you always present to coming before y'all way and here's what the doctors say they say listen our father died in the wilderness he wasn't among the group The Gather themselves to rebell in the rebellion of Korra
 but you know he died for his own stunts like all that generation did the last thing they say is but he had no sons and here's the thing why should the name of our father be withdrawn or missing from among his family just because he had no Sons so give us the land possession among our father's family with Ponder on this there's some assumptions that work among their request that are really important that make their request standout yeah well just the cultural norm of you pass on your inheritance to your sons and your daughters don't get anything right your daughters would marry into other families and be part of their inheritance know where is the biblical narrative assumes and takes place in a patriarchal social structure so the narratives assume that because of that was the culture
 context for the ancient Israel would it be then that God has to do that right it looks like an English you might try zelophehad but it's zelophehad zelophehad heard we got clear throat and he has an inheritance from his dad he's going to have a future land inheritance this is all about. It's about a land where the hair to it's because that's right they're going to like divide up the land by Clan correct and so everyone's going to get their own piece of it yeah and so they're here saying hey we're not going to get a piece of our fathers late and in fact no one is because he has no son yeah and that's a shame
 yeah yeah why should our branch of the family tree be cut off from the edenland just because we're women and he didn't have any guns that's their argument so okay so here's what's fascinating what you have is this group of daughters who are bringing to Moses and Yahweh the fact that there's a gap in the laws of the Torah there's a scenario that the laws don't address and the laws as currently stated will lead to what they're trying to say is Injustice a whole Branch will be lost from the family tree just because women can't inherit land that's their argument so here's what they say about the story first five so Moses brought their case before the Lord that weird case it's the word Miss pot it's a legal argument so they they went to
 door of the tent of meeting cuz that's where you bring a case to Yahweh we spot is the word for justice justice yeah yeah so in argument advocating for just relations in the community car show in Hebrew Justice and a case for justice or the same word correct cuz it's like Moses didn't spot this Gap in the Torah that interesting people in the community and as their context is changing right like the culture is changing we're going to go from a nomadic migrant Camp to settled life in the land and the laws that may have served previous generations don't address this new Circumstance the none of us could have foreseen has there been laws about how land is dispersed so far in the Torah oh well actually there was a lot just given in numbers 26 I just didn't take time to
 it's right near the end which is saying hey when you go into the land divided up the land for each tribe by the population numbers of the tribes of the census numbers kind of match land amounts by proportion and divide them by law and assign them to the tribes and so the Assumption here is that you know all the names listed in the list were mad and so the next stories about this group of daughters who say our names weren't put in the role and when the land gets divided so that's our argument but what's the Nerdist drawing attention to the fact that they have a Miss pot they have a case for justice and if their case is neglected their argument is that there will be a wrong it will happen in our community and Moses didn't spot it who spotted it is these five daughters so Moses brought their Miss pot before y'all way
 and Yahweh spoke to Moses sang the daughters of zelophehad are in the right you will surely give them and inheritance possession among the brothers you will transfer the inheritance of their father does that the first God addresses this particular case and says they're right this would be wrong for a family to not get land just because it will be women who won't be the owners and overseers of that land so let's change that let's address that in this case and then a state that turns into a general law we're watching the formulation of law legal reasoning so God says in fact tell all the sons of Israel If any man dies and has no son then the inheritance will go to his daughter but let's say they have no daughter give the inheritance to the father's brother's when it starts working down the chain of relatives all the way down and that's the story
 transverse 11 if its father has no brothers gives his Heritage to the nearest relative to the nearest relative this will be a new statute ordinance to the sons of Israel and that's the end of the story
 I think this narrative is hugely significant well first of all it's a narrative about how the laws of the Torah or not comprehensive they don't cover every possible scenario so what does one do when the laws of the Torah don't address a certain area of life will what you do is you go this is what Jesus is doing you go to the laws is wisdom you say what what are the heart of the laws all about hold on Moses's go straight to y'all and we ran into this with the Passover what does guys say it Passover is why should we be withdrawn from the community the same thing that the doctors say
 yes for the Passover thing Hyperlite is everything okay and that was when the it was just a little kiss where Passover is done in the second week of the New Year first month but then there's all these like Purity laws given to them about hey if you're like ritually in pure you got to go outside the camp and then someone's like wait hold on a second what if I'm really into her during Passover I can't go and do Passover have to be outside the camp like that's ridiculous like Passover is important and the most likely Enemy Bring the Seahawk exactly other words there are unforeseen circumstances and we don't have a lot for this so Moses goes before God and gets a new revelation that is based on the wisdom inherent within the earlier commands but it's a new formulation yeah that's exactly right so this narrative is actually in a matching position now here
 in the last movement of numbers I was at those are matching their lives within the number scroll oh those are both in numbers and numbers the Passover narrative was in the bun got it of the numbers scroll sandwich numbers is itself a new understanding in the middle and now we're in the band on the bottom and then they have matching narratives that are mirrors of each other and these are the two ones and their two stories in the first one is about those guys in Passover in this story it's about these daughters and the possession of land and the right of ownership of real and so what Moses dad's is he gets Divine guidance for this new situation before we get to Jesus like this you know let's say I'm a second temple Jewish person reading this and I'm reading this and I'm noticing okay that's all these laws it's not,
 pensive they are being interspersed between narratives these laws are teaching me something and then you get to these two stories stay this one we are you okay it's going to be situations where the lock code that I have is not comprehensive enough and then which case what do I do and here you go okay well you have our priest-king guy right thing by the priests go and talk with God and update the code alright easy peasy as long as you've got the prophet priest king guy that's right ready to roll and I've been told multiple times our Prophet priest king guy is about to die this is like one of the last things he does so yeah let's just register that point the laws
 incomplete
 and there will be moments when we come up against the law that doesn't address the situation or if we just applied the laws we had from the past it will actually result in Injustice not because the law wasn't good and its context but because our context is changed this narrative is drawing explicit attention to the fact that God's commands were given in contacts and then when the context changed it requires it requires Divine wisdom to hear how the heartbeat of earlier laws needs to be applied in new ways and here it's about gender Dynamics and the possession of land
 so here's where I think that Adam and Eve in the eating stuff that's in here is that what's the logic here up till now land possession in Israel has been talked about within the patriarchal framework that was just common to the ancient near East and ancient Israel but then these daughters bring their case and what God says is they are right there shouldn't be a family that loses possession of the land just because there isn't a patriarch what if there are young women who can become matriarchs and exercise Rule and authority over a piece of land in the Clans and God says that is right
 so the question is is God turning back to some wisdom principal in earlier law and there isn't a law that addresses this but there is a narrative in the Torah the talks about male and female as partners ruling over the Eden land together and that's the Garden of Eden story and the 7-Day narrative Genesis 1 and then it's complement in the Eden story of Adam and Eve in the garden this is my interpretation my case of what's going on here is that this narrative is showing some like young Eve figure and now we're outside eating and they're coming and saying what only Adam gets to rule the land and have land passed down God's original commands in Genesis 1 and 2 mission was to male and female let them Rule and be fruitful and multiply so I think within the logic of the Torah
 these daughters without knowing it but I think for the reader these daughters are to be seen as appealing to God's core original heart beat for the partnership of male and female over the land and that's what these daughters appeal to and God says they are right that is what I want what I want is Sons and Daughters who can rule and have responsibilities in the land together then the god updates the law that's remarkable man at least I think that's remarkable. I'm taking their I do what does God mean when he says they are right what do you mean to say things don't change here there will be something happens that's wrong that's the implication you could say that What's Happening Here is that their rights that that their family Clan shouldn't die out and so
 because of that they get to keep the land under their son's right yes yes but their argument is why should the name of our father be withdrawn from among his family cuz he had no son that's one then the second argument there is give us land possession among the father's brother's so another words name and land the assumption is being able to be settled in the land with a family connected to the family name flourishing in the land that that shouldn't be dependent on only having male inheritors there should be male and female inheritors who can keep the family name in the flourishing family in the land but just to be you know the push back on it is what I would imagine the argument back would be it's only given to the women as a concession when there wasn't meant to get it and then
 when when there is now going to be new kiddos it's going to go to the med again if they have sons yeah that's right so it's like protecting the the name of the family Clan but it's not all the sudden saying like hey I look it doesn't matter male or female like it's going to pass down equally like it doesn't that's right it doesn't make this like massive change what you're saying and Genesis 1 your say you're reading is is there's an equality there you had created a few men as male and female yeah that's right as the image of God he created them so both of them are the image of God male and female and we talked about this to where you see in the narrative where Adam the human was split into and given his razor his like delivering help delivering helper the one becomes two you just get the sense of like the significance of the equality now that's a rabbit hole
 because you could read a lot of new testament letters and it feels like there's a sense of some sort of patriarchy and you can read the New Testament letters and see a lot of mutualistic quality inn in the same letter within the same letter or going down we're just trying to read the Torah on its own terms or so you here which is really cool is like yesterday the the law of God is not shown is complete and we have these narratives that are like teaching us something about what do you do when you come into a situation where the law is it complete whether that's a context changing or it's just that things are a little bit more nuanced than the law is prepared to instruct for in which case in this is the second narrative we seen this you have your Prophet priest king figure go and talk with
 Yahweh and give you an update at law yeah there's a second Point what you're saying here which is the gender Dynamic of daughters and sons yeah that's really fascinating and so let's just put a pin in it and say like that's really cool fascinating thing that in this very patriarchal setting you would get a story like this I think I'm going to pull up the pin and look a little more and I think this is often the dynamic especially the modern readers have and the specially modern Christian readers have when we read the laws of the Torah cuz we're sitting thousands of years forward post Jesus post Pentecost and what we can see is that the spirit has been leading God's people on a journey that has had genuine steps forward in terms of a more perfect realization of the ethic and up the good in the communal life of God's people and what I'm saying is
 the laws of the Torah are not a perfect expression of the ideal will of God for all people all times everywhere this law saying the laws were given address to certain moments and then to see watch the law of God in the instruction of God develop and then get developed in the teachings of Jesus Jesus Christ explicitly says I haven't come to set aside the tour in the profits but to fill them full with like the Torah and the laws or like a cup but there is still more there's still more fullness so what they're pointing to it so The Sermon on the Mount is a point where jesus takes the earlier laws pushes their logic and the heartbeat of their wisdom even further and so I think what's Happening Here is we have a moment with in ancient Israel would that Dynamic was already in place and there was Jesus wasn't innovating
 by saying there's a wisdom to the Torah that takes the the wording of the laws but then uses that as a launch pad to explore the wisdom in and apply them in ways that aren't even more faithful to their meaning and that's the dynamic happening here but Moses doesn't go back to Genesis chapters 1 & 2 no not letting you know what there's wisdom underneath this and this is part of the Torah and so yeah you guys can have land he goes to pee pee go see out and that's right that's right but we see Jesus do he takes the Torah and he finds wisdom principles and he says we can use the wisdom of the Torah to fill for what God wants for us to be complete but I'm saying it's a little different than that even what I'm saying is that the structure of the Torah invites the reader not Moses invite to the
 to see this generation going into the land with all kinds of parallel to Adam and Eve in Eden and so if this generation is like a new Adam and Eve there is no coincidence that you have here a story about men and these women saying hey we can possess and have responsibility over the land to what I'm saying is the fact that it is a story about men and women having a shared responsibility over the new Eden land this is this story's way of recalling that shared responsibility of Adam and Eve Over the Garden that's not something that I'm saying the people in this story are doing everything but the construction of the Torah and the way this generation set on an LG to Adam and Eve I think is a part of the stores meaning for the reader based on what the authors doing and once you see that then you can see that
 Jesus is like the Fulfillment of a long tradition of biblical authors and Prophets saying that the laws of God are perfect and good and wise but true wisdom can never be locked into just one context because contacts always change this creation develops and so you going to need to depend on the laws the wisdom of the Torah to take you into new territory so that you can discern God's will even when there are no loss of ply or the laws as originally were to don't apply which means you need God's wisdom to see how they apply in new ways and that's what this story is about
 yeah so I put some reason I think I just like this one as as much as I like the Passover one back earlier because it's a cool hyper link between Genesis 1 and 2 and this generation in the land it's about male and female with shared responsibility over the land and then also it's showing a dynamic in the tour itself the Jesus clearly saw and saw himself filling and carrying forward when he said I didn't come to set aside the Torah and Prophets but to fill them full and that's his introduction to the 6 case studies where he says you've heard it said in the Torah and I say to you what God wants us to do is take the wisdom of the laws take a further into the new creation and yet Jesus doesn't give us some sort of comprehensive like rule book for being human or how to take wisdom principles forward only three chapters
 but man it's like there's a universe in those three chapters there's a universe of wisdom for all of life there's not a universal law for all of life but there's a universal wisdom drive from the loss okay so let's hash this out I want to be a person who listens to God's voice to a small heart and listening and then with God says this is the way I'm like okay that's the way I don't have a Moses figure who's coming down off of mountain and sound like here's the new like here's the new lock code I can't go to pee. I think you have one yeah I mean I have one I think you do but I do yeah really yeah I think he sustained in your existence right this very moment you talking about himself
 spirit of God spirit of God. And I'm kind of trying to catch you off-guard a little bit but I think I think that's what Jesus and the apostles would want us to okay but there's a difference right between like here's a guy we can all see him yeah right yes okay are you sure that's there is it that's an important difference so y'all can see this dude he can go up the mountain and we could come to me like a Moses like here's the situation I want to do Passover I'm unclean like what do I do or you can imagine it's like a Moses like here's the situation like my wife died and whatever you do whatever the situation is in your like what should I do and then Moses like that's a good question I'll be back and then I watch him go up the mountain come back down here is the law and we can just tell us what to do Moses it would be great if I didn't have to exercise any life moral read
 for thinking of my own just give me the instruction I'm being facetious obviously you're making it sound like it's a bad thing to ask Moses but here like this is like if you have a Moses that's right it in person to go ask a threat and so
 that guy doesn't exist or maybe he does exist but like the relationship isn't such that he's like standing there in the flesh and that you can talk to him right geez us is the greater than Moses who has given us a spirit is clearly presented as a new Moses Prophet priest king figure The Sermon on the Mount is him doing in his day what Moses was doing right here and then for us post-resurrection and Pentecost the spirit sent by the father and the son to be the presence of Jesus in our Mist I think is our equivalent of the Prophet priest king that we consult I mean yeah I think this all the way back to years ago our our series on the book of Acts this is precisely
 a parallel set of problems that the apostles faced in the first decade of the Jesus movement which is Jesus's Israel Messiah to create a Remnant among Israel to participate in the renewal of Israel so that the nation's can be blessed and within the Hebrew Bible that is mostly depicted as Nations incorporated into the national ethnic entity that is Israel and what starts happening on the ground is the non Israelites start following the way of Jesus and the spirit that came up on Messianic Jews starts falling on Cornelius a Roman Centurion and his family and so the way they go consult well then the question of the ground is you do these not Jewish followers of Jesus have to needs our help sized baby circumcised and follow the
 virtual feasts and night cuz of the laws as stated say they're supposed to do Sabbath get circumcised ecosure that's what the law say the Torah of God says that so what they do is their version of luck with the daughters do hear their version is what we called the true slim Council in Acts chapter 15 all the way starting back in chapter 10 leading up to it at the book of Acts so what they do is they get people from all sides of the experience they get the Jerusalem leaders they get people who think the laws say right now in Israelite Israelites we all have to live by the Los totora and then they get people who think that there's the spirit pushing us in a New Direction and they get non Israelites who actually have been stilled by the spirit and the following Jesus in these communities
 Antioch and they all come together and pray and read the Bible and debate and argue and then they they collectively discern what the prophet priest king is telling them well that's not happening anymore what's not happening anymore this Collective discernment of spirits it's not well I mean think it happens to all the time I would like to believe it does but what you don't seem to see is just a fracturing of yeah I know God wants this over here and it's very clear and so we're going to build this tradition and we've got it right and then another group saying like a no-go actually God is saying this and they all come together and pray and read the Bible and instead of a kind of goes there sometimes they have and sometimes they do sometimes they don't and sometimes they have it
 this is this is this the journey the debacle and the Beautiful Thing That is the history of the Jesus movement I'm not saying that the history of Jesus followers throughout the world have embodied this perfectly what I'm saying is the biblical narrative offers us the model and ideal and resources for how to do this work
 and whether or not we do it or have you think it's possible you think it's like
 I have to think it's possible or else I don't really want to be a Christian I have to think it's possible but when you look out at the landscape of Christendom is a lot of cool beautiful things yeah but you got to agree that like there is a lot of fractured of course yes as much if not more than Harmony in agreement I mean Eden and every one of these councils that we might attempt is you know full of factors personal desire and ambition traditionalism genuine like trying to adapt the way of Jesus to look at some sort of foreign or antithetical story or will the items I'm not saying is easy saying it's complicated.
 this was a conflict that these daughters introduced they brought a legal case to the 10th of Yahweh we got and it was a big deal and acts he was a huge dick during the council I mean that was a massive decision and I'm sure everyone was down with it but I'm not saying it's simple I'm not trying to but I'm just trying to say there is this ideal and a model given within the biblical story for what the community is to do when it faces these moments
 this feels significant for for some people maybe this won't feel significant but I think for many people especially someone comes from my background where if you see something like an ax where they have to kind of figure it out you would say well yeah like in the Bible there was still you know the spirit was working things we can figure it out but then it all came to a close and now our only job is to just follow what the Bible says like that was in a my and so the spirits not going to come and like hell you some new thing in fact that's super dangerous like that's where you're going to get heresy that's where you're going to like and yeah and the whole thing could fall apart but let me just insert what the apostles discern in Jerusalem is oh my gosh this is not a new thing what they find in the scriptures
 is the realization of not something new but something very old in others what they discover is that oh my gosh incorporation of non just realized it might feel new but actually it's a deep it's The Logical conclusion hidden so deep within a biblical story but until we came to this moment we didn't ever so you're saying the same thing with this door here where Moses he goes the Yahweh but in the Torah is as a reader that why you're like well I've read Genesis 1 and 2 male and female both are inheritors of the land together as partners is not new at all we're not in today. Do what all does not Innovation I see it it's a more perfectly realizing the Deep inner logic of God's will throughout the spirit will talk but he'll never contradict the scriptures right but contradict
 what level on the surface level wording of the laws of the Torah because then you have to decide like what I'm trying to simplify what the ideal is and that this Dynamic is anticipated within the biblical story I'm not saying that actually pulling this off as simple but yeah you and hope you have you have hope that the people of Jesus can in like new ways come together and read the Bible and pray and hear from the spirit and go oh yes this is here we hadn't seen it like we can all stack hands and say God is telling us something new that is old
 I have hope and a half to have hope I don't have optimism I have to have hope there have been these moments in history of the Jesus movement and I have to believe that there will continue to be and that all of those moments so rare as they are are Pointers forward to a New Creation or people can live in Discerning the will of God together in a way that unites and creates peace I have to believe that otherwise I mean I used to say otherwise I'll just go skateboarding to play golf or something but it's like what's the point of that so
 I have to have hope that this is possible and I've had little taste of it in local church communities that I've been a part of receive a little moments of unity and Godspeed new wisdom that actually hold you know but I think this this is what has made the dynamic of the Jesus movement what it is as a world changer throughout history not always perfectly of course not is perfectly cuz it's humans and Russ I've eaten but anyway in the fact that we're having this conversation based off of the story and numbers 27 verse 1 through 11 about the daughters of zelophehad I love the Hebrew Bible man it's so awesome anyway and you were going to show us I think three stories and I was going to look at next about Joshua will actually set us up for some other things going on in this section of numbers but
 I think this is perfect when God's people transition generations and are on the horizon of new circumstances it requires new with them to find the old wisdom that was always there that's what the story is All About the section of the Book of Numbers otherwise known as in the wilderness
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continued in the third movement of numbers and we look at Moses passing the Baton of leadership to a man who's going to inherit Moses's Splendor a man named Joshua the ideal human figure the high priest depicted as a shiny shimmery figure and then Moses it does the shiny shimmery figure and so Joshua here is depicted as someone with the Splendor of Moses to and Tyler Bailey Lyndsay Ponder with the show Ashland Heights and Mackenzie bucks men have provided the invitations for our annotated podcast in a wrap Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make is already paid for by the thousands of people just like you so thank you for being a part of this with us hi this is Andre and I'm
