where in the last chapters of the Genesis scroll and we're talking about the stories of Joseph these stories bring together all the themes in Genesis in the beautiful Symphony Genesis begins with the idea that all humans are the image of God himself and in the Joseph stories we see Joseph becoming the image of the K when you see Joseph cruising in The Chariot you like that's fair was Chariot and it's a guy dressed like Farrah wearing his ring and necklace but it it's slightly different it's an image of pharaoh the Genesis scroll begins with the promise that the seed of a woman will come to strike evil in the head crushing it and while he does he himself will be struck and stuff adjust the story becomes a real important narrative in the pattern of the suffering servant the god of points to rule that his rule involved in descending down into death on behalf of others so that the
 they're suffering in death they can be exalted and then become a source of life to others and of course if you've been following the long we've been laser focused on the theme of Exile Adam and Eve were exiled from the garden and all of humanity continue separated from God and hear Joseph has sold into slavery locked in prison lost and alone but what humans meant for evil God worked out for good Justice Exile turns into a homecoming he's released from prison reunited with his family he was dead but now he's alive and the story makes you consider if death is the ultimate Exile then the hope of Resurrection will that's the ultimate homecoming the last paragraphs of the Joseph story is Joseph saying hey I'm going to die down here but God made a promise that you would bring us up out of this land and whatever you do take my bones with you when you go up I'm John Collins this is Bible project podcast and today we finished the scroll of Ghent
 thanks for joining us here we go
here we are in the scroll of Genesis just reading stories in the Bible that's right yes and in the current story I wear in about Joseph we are in the pit yeah in the pit in Egypt with Joseph how are you today I am talking about the reality of just that feeling of separation and being lost and alone and yeah that's intense fortunately that is not my current lived experience but it is for my people and I were talking about Joseph and the pit is because we are reading through the whole Torah meaning the first five books of the Bible or as we're calling them Scrolls and in this movement of the Book of Genesis we are tracing the theme of Exile this idea of being separated from blessing from God spread
 and the Adam and Eve narrative it's going outside of the Garden of Eden that's right and just a little detail I said I didn't bring this up the last conversation Adam and Eve were depicted as those who don't know good and bad yet that's what the Forbidden tree is about in the rest of the Hebrew Bible to be someone who doesn't yet know good and bad the only other times of phrases used as though just about four or five other times and in most of those is used to describe children does Adam and Eve are depicted as a moral infants as it were and so the decision they make it the tree is more of a decision of folly then outright Rebellion it is a disobedient to God's command about the tree but their motive for it is not depicted as like willful Disobedience they're not trying to be deceptive yeah rather they are deceived and make a foolish decision it's Folly but then you get and Abraham story and Isaac and Jacob and that's just willful ignorance selfish stupidest right
 but then when you come to Joseph again we're back in the realm of a of a young person a teenager and he's not depict it as being like overly malicious he's just stupid is a tattletale didn't really occur to him like I got my brothers and tell him is a dream special I am that might not be the best move when they're already a little bit frustrated that I'm the favorite son got the special coat so in terms of the four movements of Genesis the first one in the last one begin with depictions of foolish young people as it were fascinating and it's their Folly that begins the Cascade of terrible decisions that lead to Exile interesting parallel between Joseph and Adam and Eve thanks for bringing that up so Joseph he goes out into the field his brothers scheme a deception kind of like the snake and throw him in a pet and then send them down to Egypt as a slave
 these are all symbols of Exile going out going down and when they're their dad hears about the lie that an animal ate him what he says is I'm going to die and go down to meet my son and the gray whose ideas of dying and going to Exile or just merged death and Exile Exile in death the grave the pit outside the home outside the land in the wilderness field where we left Joseph is in Egypt where he said to get some favor but then is the victim of another deception and it's thrown into prison in Egypt which is described as a pet and so now he's in a pit with in Egypt down in Egypt down in the pit so we're going to pick up the store here because the Egyptian Pitt prison that he's in that's the bottom and there's about to happen a pivot moment in the story that's going to invert everything his rest of his story will
 about are sending back to the a place of honor
so in the pet present to officials of Farrah end up getting imprisoned the chief Baker and the chief cupbearer is our English translation that's like the wine the guy in charge of like all of the wine it's Pharaoh's household the title of this guy in Hebrews the musky the one who provide the drink I thought this was the guy like tests the wine to make sure Natalie isn't the word Muscat is the captain of drinking drinking a man the baking and the captain of the drinking most of those the two titles kind of literally translated to Affairs officials end up in the same prison pit that Joseph is in and lo and behold they each have a dream so just like Joe says to dreams marked his high point then he went down down down. Down and here he is at the bottom of this point and what happens again and narrative about to dreams and in these dreams each of these officials in some form of
 Heather has their head lifted up in the dream and Joseph is like a dream hey you know what I think I know what that means I think God has revealed to me the meaning of your dream so for the captain of drinking he says your dream means your head is going to be lifted up in honor you're going to be restored to your job and I guess like awesome I hope that happens and then when the baker has a dream about his head being lifted up he says yes yes your head is going to be lifted up off your body you're going to be executed and then Joseph says Hey listen if your interpretations like actually come true will you remember me and what he says is Genesis 40 do me a kindness by mentioning me to Farah to get me out of here I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and even here I've done nothing wrong that they should put me into this pit this is where he calls it the pit
 he's in prison because of the pet so the dreams become reality the baker's executed three days and the captain of drinking is elevated back to his position in three days and then the last line of the story is and he forgot about Joseph in the pit
 okay so the next story Genesis 41 Sarah has two dreams knows the doubling and it's all about these double dreams so Sarah has two dreams and they're all about bundles of grain or a dream about cows there seven bundles of grain and then 7 cows and the good stocks of grain and beautiful fat cows and then skinny wizard heads of grain and skinny and emaciated cows come and eat up all the good stuff seven bad things come eat up seven good thing and you wouldn't even know that the emaciated cows 87 good cows there's no sign that they that they ate anything all day didn't open up those are his dreams he wakes up and he brings his counselors and he's like I had these dreams no one can help him and so that's when the captain of drinking cuz they're in in the courtroom says he
 free I'm remembering something reminds me I met this young Hebrew slave in the pit and he interpreted like my dreams is what happened like let's call that guy and so Sarah this is Genesis 4114 Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph and they heard we brought him up out of the pit then they had him shave image of like all your hair the hair associated with your old previous whatever Journey that's all cut off and his clothes are changed because new garments and he's brought to Farrah so right there that's a little pivot in the story right there and you can see it a lot the moment we're the guys like I'm shaving the beard that Montage the change of clothes that's pretty iconic for like a change of character a change of Destiny so Joseph comes he interprets the dreams and says hey the seven beautiful good things
 seven years of abundance coming and they are going to be followed by seven years of famine and the family is going to be so intense that it will be like the 7 years of unjust never happened somebody says you know you got to do you have to get a guy who's really wise and Discerning and can make a plan to store up all of the abundance and make a rationing plan so that during the seven years of famine you could survive off of the seven good years and this is Ferris response he said to his servants where could we find a man like this in whom is the spirit of Elohim the ruach Elohim this is the first time that phrase has been used since Genesis 1 verse to The Brew off tell him the spirit of God Appears only in the first movement of Genesis you know as we traced it throughout Genesis 1 to 11 and then it's just gone in Trans Am not being mentioned in the Abraham Isaac and Jacob stories and then this is
 the next appearance and it's about a guy who had dreams about being raised up as a ruler above have an interest and now you hear that he has the spirit and you're like I got punched beginning to smell with Genesis 1 & the Eden Narrative of Genesis to about a human exalted to rule over creation Guided by the spirit. Sarah said the Joseph God has informed you all of of all of this there is no one as Discerning and wise as you remembered what that tree was all about the tree of knowing good and bad yeah the woman said it was good she saw that it was good for eating and desirable for gaining wisdom so there's two paths to becoming a wise ruler of creation right this is a test do I eat of the tree on my own initiative or do I let the spirit of God be the
 one that instructs me the guides me gives me wisdom here's a guy with the spirit of wisdom and that's the way that he says is you are going to rule over my house only in the throne will I be greater than you or the promotion yes he will become an image of Farrah second like the Viceroy or the the deputy call Genesis 1 and 2 imagery hair coming back to us so cool and the same way that humans are meant to represent God and rule over the land here is Joseph being lifted up to image pharaoh and rule over the land and he is able to do so because he has a spirit of Elohim it gives wisdom verse 42 of Genesis 41 then Pharaoh took off his ring stick his signet-ring like it's a ring with an image on it he put it on Joseph hand
 he clothed him and garments of fine linen thread actually simple garments beautiful white clean he put a gold necklace around his neck he had him ride in a second Chariot and they proclaimed before him bow the knee everyone bow down and he sent him over all the land of Egypt the big deal is the Arc of his dreams or his dreams were about being exhausted over his family and over the sun moon and stars and everybody came and bow down to him oh and here it is Bethany and here it is about any yep he becomes an image of pharaoh a second self when you see Joseph cruising in The Chariot you like that's fair was Chariot and it's a guy dressed like Farrah wearing his ring and necklace but it it's slightly different is an image of pharaoh we're exploring the meaning of the image of God but in this
 narrative about Joseph School is cool you know how in our image of God conversations long ago but in our video of one of the proud moments run like that was so cool that are already thought of that was when they're depicting the exalted new human rulers it's a line of people in the video and what they're holding up as their scepters are like pencils and Architectural drawing tool and a ruler did the specific ways that you rule that's right exactly so what school is that was partially inspired by this little connection hear what Joseph is being appointed to is essentially being like a disaster be starting the Bureau of disaster relief in prevention his goal is he has seven years to build a team and a plan to store up enough Reserve food and supplies so that when a food shortage comes there's enough that's how he exercises his rule as the image of God
 filled with the spirit with wisdom joining like the city commission department for fair now he's like you're at like put my chips in with you tell a lie cuz this is a narrative illustrating the being a ruling image of God rulings wisdom and Authority like the venue for that is just the circumstances of actual human life and Community you can be a software engineer and Rule the World by the spirit of God you know or whatever the variety of ways that the human project goes forward are all the variety of ways that you can image God's Whisper
 okay you still need it which is not the land promised to Abraham yeah yeah he's been exalted in Exile so did this pattern here in the Joseph story is the template which whole books of the Hebrew Bible or going to be pattern the story of Daniel is packed with hyperlinks back to the justice story Daniel being exhausted in Babylon just like Jose but after through many tests of suffering and going down into pits with wild animals in them and then also the the Book of Esther Esther scroll is very hyper length in many ways it's in Persian Exile she and her relative Mordecai go through many great test put their lives on the line and then our exalted and save their people and so on so those stories are mad at modeled after the Joseph store because we can see the Joseph story is modeled after all the generations in Genesis going all the way back to the first exile to Adam and Eve were elevated up to rule and then forfeited
 and then went down out of Eden and down and Joseph story is the opposite where he began in the place of rule went down into the pit but then was elevated up out of the pit and noticed the dreams it was two dreams and a royal robe that he was given at the beginning and then the roads are taken and he goes down to Egypt down to prison down into the pit where there's two more drinks and then those dreams began his Ascent up where he interprets Pharaoh's to dreams and he's given new garments and a new Royal robe and elevated to the position of his first two trains that's like a perfect art symmetry in the backup that's right and it's an image of the suffering seed of the woman and he he got he got his he'll like ravaged by the snake so to speak here's a seed of the woman who suffered many deceptions many deceptive turned into a slave turned him into a prince
 and what God does is orchestrate turn the evil that humans keep doing to Joseph and take the consequences of those evil acts and we've a story of exaltation and restoration out of it the Joseph story becomes a real important narrative in the pattern of the suffering servant the god of points to rule but his rule involves him descending down into death on behalf of others so that through their suffering and death they can be exalted and then become a source of life to others that's exactly what's going to happen now Joseph will be in a position now to save his family in the time of famine in Genesis 42 on through the end of the book of the story is going to go back and forth now to his brothers and his brothers and Jacob up in the attic and they're going to realize I hate going to die in this food shortage and so Jacob sends his two brothers down this in Genesis 42 and following go down he says go down to Egypt and get
 get food for us there and it's always described as down go down to Egypt the brothers went down and they're they're going to meet the brother they betrayed. They're not going to recognize him and what Joseph is going to begin to do is craft a whole very The Narrative goes on for three long chapters for just 42 43 44 45 and it's one long testing narrative and Joseph is going to cleverly create all these scenarios where he's going to recreate scenes recreating situations of what they did to him back in chapter 37 so he's going to accuse them of being spies and then he's going to take one brother and put the brother in a prison in Egypt and then he's going to return the money they brought down to the other brothers and say go back home and so he's recreating he just you guys are loaded with cash and you could go back home with food food and money but you have to abandon the brother and so
 do go back up to their land and they could just say like one of our brothers died on the way I got to go get them and animal got them they could pocket the cash and come back with the food but what they do is they tell the truth when they go back to the land but back when the brothers were down in Egypt and Joseph is testing them the first time he finds out you know that his brother Benjamin is still alive and Benjamin is not there but Jacob didn't let Benjamin go down right cuz there's a part of the story we had talked about or Jacob has a new favorite son is Joseph's brother younger brother and Jacob when he sends his brothers down to Egypt to go get food he doesn't let Benjamin go keeps his beloved Son back and so Joseph notices the Benjamins not there with the rest so what he says he takes one brother captive he sends them back and he says if you ever want to see my face again you got to come with that brother the youngest brother is it that you didn't bring so they go
 back to the land and they run out of food and Jacobs like a go down and get more food we can't you know Simeon is down there in prison and the only way he'll leave to see us is if Benjamin comes with us and so Jacob comes to his moment this becomes parallel to Abraham and Isaac having to give up the beloved Son of his old age so that's a brilliant replay of that story now in this generation and so what Jacob finally does is he says I'm not going to do it and then steps in Judah Judah says Dad we are all going to die if you don't let Benjamin come with us and so here's the thing I make a promise to you he makes it both promise I will offer my life in the place of Benjamin and Judah was the one who had the idea to sell Joseph for cash all the way back I was his idea was Judas idea
 and now here is Judah saying we're not going to leave the brothers behind the fact I will put myself in the place of a brother if it Benjamin's in trouble I'll take the hit and Benjamin will come back cuz he's your favorite and I'll surrender my life so think through this story is patterned after Abraham being asked to surrender Isaac after the long history of abrahamson failure. Ask for the life of Isaac back and I don't have to sacrifice and then at the last minute because of Abraham's trust God provides a substitute Ram in the bushes now here is Abraham's grandson he's being asked to surrender his beloved Son Benjamin and Judah offers himself as a substitute if you will be then the father of the tribe of Judah which is the line of the royal priest the Royal of the king yep the line of David
 lineage of Jesus Messiah so profound it so the brothers Jacob says find take Benjamin this is different than Abraham Abraham had to surrender and then the substitute comes Jacob he surrenders what's the substitute is in the next that's so cool and so is it the brothers go to Judo with Benjamin and his care they go down and Joseph sees all the brothers he sees Benjamin breaks down crying he releases the captive brother to come back with them and you makes them a great meal and this becomes a second test he makes him a huge meal and he gives them all the same portion of food except Benjamin to give Benjamin 7 * 5 * a bigger than all of the brothers and then he rigs it so that he puts a special silver cup of divination
 that like the the sorcerers use a sorceress he hides it in Benjamin's the saddle bag of Benjamin's count so you kind of like his like first he makes the brothers jealous like just like activates their job to Mesa jealousy and then when he sends them on their way he sets Benjamin up so that they could easily thrown under the bus totally so I'm he's doing everything to recreate the situation here of his own the trail but the brothers betrayed him so we send people after the brothers right after they leave and then say hey we're missing a cup we're missing a silver cup around here until I what what Joseph official what he says is don't you know that our Master uses for divination and do what do the word for divination is spelled with the same Hebrew letters as the word snake not cash this is Joseph acting the role of the snake but inverting the purpose of the snake the goal is not to dis
 leave the lead people to death the goal is using deception as a means of revealing the truth yeah we talked about this in our test conversations which is what's the difference between a test that is meant to destroy you as a trap yes like throwing you in a pit and then selling you the slavery and a test meant to give you an opportunity to succeed and here it is the test as an opportunity to show that you you have changed yet so at this moment the brothers have money in their pocket they could go back with money and food and it's not just one of their brothers it's Benjamin who they could leave behind this time of these favorite son's anyways you know the climactic scene is the brothers go back in this is Genesis 44 and Judah comes kneels before Joseph need
 knows his brother and he just says listen you can't take this this little guy Benjamin prisoner it will kill our father he'll die of grief he's already lost his other beloved young son we can't do this to him and sit right there and then JuJu's offers him himself in the place of his brother as a substitute in the moment does that Joseph just breaks down weeping and he reveals himself to his brothers so powerful and what Joseph says is listen I know you guys sent me down here by 2 I need to tell you something that's actually got is the one who has been with me down here and he's has raised me up to be a ruler of the nation so that I can save the life of a Remnant in the famine that's what he says save the life of a remnant
 using the language of what God says to Noah about you and the animals in the ark to keep alive seed and to save a Remnant from the from the foot so Joseph is depicted as a new Adam human image of God and he's depicted as the righteous Remnant raised up to preserve the life of seed through a d creation and he's talking to Judah when he does this and of course this is all going to be all about the ending of Genesis which highlights the lion of Judah in the seed of Judah as the source of a royal priest will come in the future going on here says at the end of loot do you know you know what the Torah and the prophets in the writings are all about he says they're about and anointed one who goes into suffering and then is raised up into a place of Glory or honor so that forgiveness can be announced
 in that anointed ones name to all of the Nations and he's summarizing the whole Hebrew Bible and one of the stores in it is the story of Joseph it's a perfect outline of the story of Joseph climaxing in the announcement of forgiveness that he forgives his brothers so what school is that this elevation to rule as an image of God to you know that Joseph is experiencing this Rescue of the family the preservation of a Remnant through whom God can raise up a new seed to be a source of blessing this is all happening in Exile down in the rides god promise Abraham land of blessing and it's not Egypt so what's the deal why are they in Egypt yeah but even though the family has been landed in Exile in Egypt because of their own history of sin and Folly and treachery and betrayal even there outside of the promise Eden land
 God can turn their Exile into a little temporary Eaton refuge and install the wise image of God and create life out of death and that's the message Eden can show up where we least expect it eating anywhere anywhere anywhere when Joseph chapter 45 46 47 he sends a messages just go back to my dad and tell him that the son who is dead does now a life and you guys need to come down and see me down here and listen I'll work with fair and we'll make a plan and you will come down and you will get a wonderful land and you will eat of the good of the land of Egypt the good fruit of the land that sounds awesome and then the name of the land that they get down in Egypt is famously Goshen
 all kinds of goshen's across the United States now in different states go really I don't know if Indiana but the Hebrew word Goshen is the kind of central network of cities around the Nile Delta River in Egypt at that time and Goshen refers to a region that was a border region is a rural board border region outside the city star a little suburb in Egypt call Goshen the word Goshen is spelled with three Hebrew letters the first letter and the last letter r email the chi the last letter is a noon and and the Hebrew word for garden is game alone gun store Garden and then the word Goshen is spelled with key machine known Goshen but the point is the word ocean is spelled with the first and the last letter of the Hebrew word Garden you've made this word play before I think you told me this and yeah I started and I said oh that's like calling at garshin instead of garden
 I can't we we got to live in garshin if you're trying to model Goshen after the word Garden you could do it like you like what Don is to Goshen Garden is to guard this is the suburb of garshin why is it called supposed to remind us of a garden and what you're told is they go down to the land and you get one little conclude her line and they were fruitful and multiply in Goshen and they were fruitful and they multiplied and the garden yes so this would be a great concluding the story of the Bible if it were happening and eaten and if it were all of humanity but in fact it's happening to a small remnant of humanity that is the family Abraham and it's happening in Egyptian Exile but it's a little foretaste of where the whole biblical stories going and it happened through the suffering and exaltation of the Beloved son come on it's like Jesus was really right. Everything was about him
it is so much happening I know we're tracing the theme of Exile but we're we're also talking about the test and were talking about the seed and we're talking about the remnants and would you know like all this stuff the way these narratives work we try to tease it out to be like this is focus on this one thing but it's like so tangled ya tengo like this fluid let me start and you really like it has point you realize like how artistic it is and when we want to like analyze it it's like you're dissecting you know the Frog but there's this living thing happening that like when it all kind of layers in you kind of feel it and it's like this like woah but then I get overwhelmed trying to like keep keeping it all make sense in my mind and way but like but you feel it you're like oh I get it it really is like you have the climax of a movie musical score for the symphony right if you sit through
 some musical event you know that comes to a climax and like all the Melodies In the songs the instruments all come together in one big thing it's overwhelming but then at the same time you're like but they're in Egypt and they're like all the sudden now the franchise like yep wait for the net this equal the perfect the last literature unit corresponds to the last chapter of Genesis is chapter 50 and that's that is it's truly like the Cliffhanger because Jacob is now reunited with his sons they're living in garshin fruitful and multiplying and then the day is Drawing Near for Jacob to die and just right there you you remember oh yeah we are not in Eden death is the number one sign that we are outside the garden so what he does is he gets Joseph and then his sons and he says listen
 I know Stu me that you won't leave my body or bones down here in Egypt I can't die and stay here in Exile so he says make me go up from Egypt after I die and bury me up in the land of Canaan in the cave bat cave of machpelah that my grandfather bought the Abraham yep yeah this was the this is the moment Abraham over the piece of the promised land he bought a field that had a case and was surrounded by trees to change the 23 the phrase Cave of machpelah is the Hebrew word play cuz it looks like the words nakedness and then lock play La La Means I'd like a double or a girl that's right this is where I got confused yeah you said the naked pair and I was thinking of a piece of fruit
 pick up the other naked couples the phrase Cave of machpelah it's a Hebrew and it's the word play cuz it looks like also the way that you would spell the naked couple and it's in a field with beautiful trees all around the property I feel the trees and a naked helpful oh yeah and you're told it's by the Trees of mamre which is where Abraham feasted with with the angels into the tree that's in place so where Jacob goes is he says after I dye make your word the word go up is used so many times in Genesis 50 it just hit you over the head so it was all about the decent going down down down down dicho yeah but once you die outside of
 the land he asked make me go up go up go up up up up up to
 the place of the naked couple put my bones and eat it but my bones and eating and it's a symbol of Hope in other words it's a way of Echo and why does it matter where you're buried your dad totally yeah and you could raise interesting questions about you know conceptions of the afterlife that people had it this time but as a narrative image you have to ask why is this whole narrative focusing on a guy saying I want to go back to this place take my body to this place and what is that place it's a place that both in the name of it and in the symbolism of a field with trees and what happened there with Abraham as a Eden moment it's all about the Return to Eden the hope for a Return to Eden that even death cannot prevent God's plan to restore the life of Eden to his people and so that's how the book ends is there still play Sweet we saw it and stress
 I drew slum in a valley where it's very customary to be buried oh yeah it's called the valley of key drone up linking up is it go away from Jerusalem up the Steep hillsides of the Mount of Olives and there's yeah traditional grave burial sites all over and I hope there is to be buried there is this hope of being resurrected in the first into Jerusalem right to be buried on the hill side that faces the temple where the temple used to stand the symbol of hope hope in the resurrection buried there and that's what Jacob asks for and gets here very similarly and then actually the last paragraphs of the Joseph story is just saying hey I'm going to die down here but God made a promise that he would bring us up out of this land and whatever you do take my bones with you when you go up so you could say it's like just a
 sentimental thing like I just want my bones to be there yeah but this is at the end of a scroll that began with the story of the human rulers right being stupid being given access to live eternal life then he ran away from their exiled from that cuz of their Folly out down from the high place outside where they died and now here is a guy two guys who are going to die outside of their little version of Eden and they're only request is that they ascend back up to the Eden land even if they die they hope in the about the bones going up to the Eden land and you're just like okay whatever one thinks about is very common in biblical studies to talk about that the idea of Resurrection was very late development in the history of Israelite religion really only became clear in the second place second temple period and saw all of that aside the met the narrative message of Jay
 says in the shape that it's in right now I think it's about that very thing the hope of the bones rising up to eternal life what else is the scroll about if death is like the ultimate Exile then Resurrection is the ultimate homecoming it's the only appropriate way to resolve the problem created with the Garden of Eden story when you go to the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel 37 the valley of dry bones I think he gets it man is he kill 36 is about how God's going to create a new Eden in the promised land that was spread all the nations then the next Vision he have is that the valley of dry bones which is about God's spirit filling up the bones to recreate a new family for Abraham and then the next story is about the reunions of the tribes Joseph and Judah so that the divided too can become one and you're just like that whole section of Ezekiel for example is a meditation on what went wrong and Eden is going
 to be reversed in the new creation so I don't think it's inappropriate to say that you finished the Genesis scroll and what you hear is the author painting of a picture to generate hope in the resurrection and the hope for his new creation that's certainly what is eel sauce here and I think that's what Jesus taught here to its remarkable alright well we're going to continue we just finished Genesis but we're not we're not stopping are we John we finished Genesis bus stop and let that sink in don't think we've ever had a sentence like that next week we are going to do a Genesis kunar so I guess we haven't finished Genesis proper but we will respond to your questions next week and then we'll Begin The Scroll of Exodus
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we begin in the scroll of Exodus and in the first movement of Exodus we will trace the theme of God's name even though in Genesis the narrator and the characters have been engaging Yahweh by that name all the way through there's something very special about the new or the renewed revelation of the name of Yahweh and the names meaning Moses and the Israelites after generations of being enslaved to Egypt the question of the the cultural identity and the religious identity of the Israelites in these chapters are really up for grabs cuz they have been dominated by an oppressor that claim to be like an incarnate deity that is pharaoh and the gods of Egypt were told are also a part of oppressing the people and so the revelation of the name attached to the liberation of a people is all connected here you always rude
 healing is character in a new way in the story we're going to camp out on the repeated phrase that all through this section of yahweh's plan that people come to know the name of the Alvin the show me Venture forth so we take the road out Bible project is a nonprofit's we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make is free to use our videos this podcast are graduate-level classes and our new mobile app it's all free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us hi this is TJ and we're husband and wife from Monmouth Oregon church we used to buy a project in our own personal study of the word and we like to use the videos to help teach our daughter about Jesus our favorite thing about the Bible project is how it's him and John breakdown really complex topics and make them easy to
