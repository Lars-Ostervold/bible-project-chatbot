morning Tim. We are going to leave here and I'm serious and you both selected some questions for us to walk through and let's jump right into it yeah lots of questions kavya is always there's more than that we can dress but we try to notice the repeated themes and then fine in the dress the ones that are kind of like getting the most repetition so we do our best great questions for just love the quman are because I think it takes the stuff we've been talking about and makes it really practical and we get to hear how these things affect people's real life or at least consider and ask the question of how they affect people's real life questions around the Paradigm Series where we looked at the type of literature the Bible is and this first question is from Eliza in Australia
 Tim and John I'm Lisa from Caracas tralia I have a question about the Paragon series I have two young kids that I'm trying to raise Christian but I'm confused of how to communicate the depths of the Bible to them I don't want to taste them that it's immoral rule book but I want to give them a good foundation based in the Bible through modeling and setting an example but I was just wondering if you had any tips for passing on a good paridon to view the Bible tickets thanks yeah this is such a good question lots of different ways almost a whole history the project but I feel like there's an uptick reason why how to how to communicate this to kids feel like it this question is coming to me from both our staff team more often and then I also just throw all sorts of other ways that you could have avoided the question a little bit yeah I'm curious to know what you guys think because we all have kids and mine is
 Warriors old Serena help tell me how old your kids are again for me I'm kind of embarrassed to say that this question is I guess a Biblical Theologian I'm embarrassed to say that I get scared to read the Bible to Serena because it's so weird and it's hard to explain it to a four-year-old so this is definitely something I'm wrestling with an appreciate the question want to hear what you guys think but I'll kick ass off I think I'm more comfortable with talking to Serina about how much God loves her and in terms of attachment Theory wanting her to like know that she's loved and she's secure those things come easily and I focus on them a lot when it comes to reading the Bible is interesting she's been she's been the one that has said God stories tonight the other night she said she was like Mama I want to read the story
 about the ink the ink on the door or we start flipping through at the Picture Bible and I'm like giving blood the reading and I kind of stutter over words like blood until in those stories and so I realized as I was reading to her this was two nights ago that I'm trying to communicate the Paradigm were talking about in here and in a couple different ways so when I noticed is that I say out loud to her as we're coming across things that are different like the sacrifice lamb and putting Blood on the doors that this is really weird we don't really do this today but it totally made sense in their in their culture so I can a different time than ours isn't that interesting she's kind of just like I know I do that and then the next page is like Pharaoh's Army chasing the Egyptian or chasing the Israelites into
 see the picture there's a picture and then it says that the sea swallowed them up what's swallowed I'm like well they were chasing the Israelites and trying to hurt them and oppress them as slaves we talked about that and so to see closed over them and they died what do you think about that and I can hear myself like I'm trying to invite her to be curious and tell me what she thinks like if she's upset about that that's fine if she feels fine about that that's weird because like that's good, cuz they're trying to hurt them like well yeah. Also you know he's sad when people get hurt and suffer when they don't trust him and and then I can see myself ya talkin through the story and then also flipping from the story to the story of Jesus and a picture Bible That's super easy to do it's like I have to remember when we were just reading this other story about Jesus sacrifice and flip to the story of him
 Arenacross, like this lamb you know it's going to kind of like what's going on there so this is some of the things I found myself doing also I guess just keeping the overarching story in mind so when Egyptians are drowned in the sea and the Israelites are rescued it's like yeah you know God was working this big plan of rescue for the whole world he really wants the whole world to know him and he's going to work through this one family she's like okay next story for you guys cuz it's a Jesus storybook Bible and actually it does seem to highlight the theme of rescue throughout so we will connect. It connects things to Jesus it highlights the theme of rescue I appreciate all that also find myself changing words and parts but developmentally I think that
 is it Tim you and I have been working this amount amount which is nothing we've been doing on the podcast yet well and so I was doing that with the kids get the few of the teachings that were relevant but we caught up with that and so I just started actually heard our friend Rudy was doing this just read through every story has read them as stories and kind of the way that we're doing it as as we're telling the stories were connecting the themes so when we get to the story of Abraham giving away his wife are lying about his wife being his wife but being the one who's supposed to be The Blessing about you know just asking the kids like what is it what does it look like when the people that God wants to use and blasts don't trust them what happens and so just trying to try to walk through the stories that way
 is best I can I get to stories or I'm just like I don't know and there's tension span sometimes sometimes can work with the stories and sometimes they can't I don't have this that on the picture book one with me Tim is you said that a number of times that the Bible is not a kid. Yeah I'm stuck with that because I agree I think but at the same time I think kids are supposed to know these stories grapple with the hard things that have happened throughout history or in the world it's a good way for parents to talk to your kids about hard things like when it comes to other media that aren't for kids I think as parents we intuitively know there's a certain age where they can be appropriate to watch Lord of the Rings trilogy with my kids
 I don't think it introduces yeah yeah yeah whatever you know how do you do that with the Bible because it seems it seems like it's not the right answer to say like I will wait till your 12 and then we'll read the story and yeah but if those stories were like you know what HBO series same the same tension I think yeah what we've done is met similar and we're still doing it it's like a experiment I think I tried to use this individual anchor narratives as like these meditation centers so Genesis 17 de narrative in the image of God man we hung out there for a couple months and I do believe you have a notebook and it's
 they stick drawings you know the videos but you know I mean you get talking about the image of God what is that mean my 8 year old fast. Question and all of a sudden you're like you're talking about ethics and relationships just like meditating on three verses of Genesis 1 the image of God stuff like that so you actually modeling what it looks like to take one page or one paragraph and meditate on it in conversation with your kids and sticking out the application so I guess the wisdom literature. I'm interested in Genesis one at all she wants to skip it and she's like go to the snake with a blood pooling their curiosity though or letting them ask questions if your son super interested in image of God it's like to stay there for the first year
 when when our kids were you know that a toddler age Hurley Elementary we decided read stories about Jesus like that was just reading individual stories and just for me what made the biggest impact on me in my late teens and early twenties but maybe want to follow Jesus what's the stories about Jesus and what he did and that's what of my curiosity into the rest of the Bible is he was constantly talking about rest of this book so I think now we're at a hedge where yeah we're going back in session during the difficult stories of Genesis but I decided to wait until you know they were eight and ten it's really just within the year that we started to talk about yeah the flood sex candles all around a GFI feeling that like something supposed to click over a little bit that they can start to hang it's right but what I've tried to avoid and I think what you're after that Lisa is avoiding
 idea of you read a story and then you come up with a life lesson of like do this like and it's more like what's the message of this particular story and then how do we meditate on that and implications of that for how we want to be in the world or not be in the world and there's a certain age where you can do that and a certain age where you can't do that. You're saying saying like where's the action of it another thing that we've done is actually just using the ancient like the calendar you know so on Friday nights lighting Shabbat candle and just like talking about the seven save us or we do a little hybrid family pass over where we get grape juice and like a turkey basting brush and brush grape juice on the door so cool and he's so excited about it my eight-year-old he's like it's also experiential
 deep learning we haven't lived in a tent in our backyard but they think that Israel for that one I think there are tactile ways to get your kids into the biblical stories to calendar had been my experience was these stories were given to me at a very young age and they became overly familiar and they became kind of dad and boring and so I wasn't interested in them anymore and happened quickly I can remember like just in case was being entirely stories if I don't want that to happen to my kids it's so I waited but just because I felt stock but I think then understanding is Paradigm or help the story that actually come to life and more I think they felt bad because we were just moralizing them
 I just like looking great I heard that one I get it I kind of the point yeah I get the point again versus an opportunity to start to see, all these patterns and beauty and and then connect it to deeper more interesting questions I have about life that kids actually want to think about 2 so I think this conversation has been really helpful for me and this project but I was I was holding off could be really interesting is looking through those Seven Pillars of the Paradigm and thinking of what they mean to a kid your age whatever age it is what is it mean when you're talking about a bible store you're talking about God to bring up those principles you don't like for me I had said I try to always bring up the bigger story that is how God was rescuing the world through this story or this is this was his plan that one is
 right there on the tip of my tongue but the other ones maybe not as much and I wonder what that would look like to intentionally just have those in back of our minds as we're reading to kids are just talking to kids for reading and buy them with my boys were reading through the gospel of Mark right now we're almost done and I got this idea about going into Proverbs but starting with meditating on the tree Choice the human life Adam and Eve not have before the tree and it's a two ways the way of wisdom in my own eyes or the way of the fear of the Lord with his wisdom and where that's the Gateway into the property and so the whole thing is the Proverbs that's what we said know how to read one of her how to read Proverbs universalize is Adam and Eve experience so that every person sees himself as sitting for the tree with a choice it's so I'm kind of excited as a way to frame up Proverbs and then to have a whole season where we're just reading different proverbs
 or the speeches at the beginning but it's about teaching them to see everyday I stand before the tree with Joyce and teaching them categories of choices that are one towards the life of teaching in the skillet hyperlinking the Bible you're just doing with the Bible what is made to do and the nuts because just like what people do it is exciting is we're not like kids education experts but there are and it's probably some of those listening and we'd love to see ideas and curriculum for kids and see if you have stuff send it that way but the pass it along yeah we're really interested all right our next question is from Natasha in Texas from Houston Texas to the episode on the Bible as meditation literature
 I'm wondering how we see this attribute of scripture in the New Testament for example it feels easier or maybe more intuitive to read the Psalms in the Proverbs as meditation literature but it's more difficult for me to see the letters to the churches as meditation literature I would love and appreciate your Insight on this and thanks for all you guys do this was a a bee in your Bonnet I think I was saying that they stand out as not feeling like the rest of the Bible in terms of how there's a lot of care and craftsmanship about every line and how an entire scroll is designed to Fillmore fast and loose and kind of just like like what they were just responses to churches
 Pastor on the go but it did seem like someone who did meditate on the Bible an example of happening on the ground but it wasn't written as meditation lecture at least it doesn't seem that way maybe first Define what we mean by meditation literature in the first place that it's not just sitting in quietly meditating it that we're looking for the ways that the authors read and reread the scripture which I guess is what you're talking about with the letters and then the way is that we are also called to read and re-read scripture and Link things together and see DNR in patterns that it's not just about how the biblical authors read and reread it earlier biblical material it's that the design principles that work it's designed so that it requires multiple readings over a long. Of time and I says to discover all the layers and that when it's been designed that way
 the authors are intentionally thinking about okay let's all this story with these details because later Matilda store with these details and in the middle of this other story these details and for me there's all this cool symmetry but it's kind of a little bit and bedded a layer deeper than sure had a first reading. So what I read the pistol I don't see Paul doing yeah I don't see him being like okay I'm going to answer this question from the Caribbeans and them answer this other one once you think about both questions together then something news going to pop I don't I don't know if that's actually what he's doing but it's just like I'm answering your question yeah I think that's totally what he's doing is just a different types of literary conventions like very often this was in a how to read the New Testament letter is Paul will open with a prayer of Thanksgiving and he'll load that prayer with keywords that foreshadow the seams of the different sections of letter to come fusions Roman
 Thessalonians Colossians they're all like this but it's just it's it's a letter I see what you're saying it's highly designed highly design even though it was a shorter time frame you know maybe months there's intentionality of how they decide what what yeah is and how that prayer works and how the Ducks I'll do my work before example like a narrative in the Hebrew Bible you can diagram fuel diagram of a narrative and you'll see just all this intentionality line after line after line no wasted idea no wasted line and you can diagram yeah but you get these run-on sentences you get like it's doesn't have the same kind of symmetry at kind of start to feel a little bit more random I see things are totally different way everywhere I go and Paul's letters IC expert care in how these paragraphs are designed how they work together
 it's a different literary form Ephesians is a rhetorical Masterpiece of symmetry but also the images that the letters are using how they reflect on your creation imagery authors do this in amazing ways and that's a different genres than the letters but they portray Jesus as the Tabernacle or the light of creation the longest run-on sentence and all Paul's letters is the opening paragraph of the efficiencies that thing is a masterpiece is it a masterpiece with a refriend focused on the Father the Son and they have hyperlinks it's a masterpiece but if you just read it like without stopping Even in our English translation depending on where English translations put periods cuz they have to you can feel like a jumbled but that's no different than how reading biblical story true
 maybe what I'm trying to say I think Paul is a genius and his genius comes through I'm sure when you know how to find it but I don't think he's crafts and things like meditation Let It Shine the same way I'm seeing it happen in the Hebrew Bible but maybe maybe I'm wrong because you like the way you just described his run-on sentence infusions and how it's structured you know has a different design principles and can feel more like his a bunch of topics I wanted to hit and so but even that letter with the poem he has upon the Christ Tom at the center and then every paragraph relate to that pawn in some way but with keywords do you guys think it's also a matter of familiarity and we read Old Testament narratives or poetry there a little bit unfamiliar as far as the genre you know maybe discourse is more like all I've written an essay before there might be more things that come up in there to her poetry that are odd
 or require meditation whereas maybe in discourse it's like I think I can follow this logic cuz you know we're trying to the world of logic of it to not that we always get it right but I wonder if it's a matter of familiarity to what was the question the question was Natasha says it's difficult for her to see the letters of meditation literature in terms of this super intentional artistic design that requires you to re-read it multiple times to really get all the layers of meaning I don't know Natasha that has been precisely my experience with the New Testament letters over the course of trying to read them for the last 20 years is exactly that but they're very intentionally designed and that it's only as I understand the rest of the biblical election more that I come back to the letters in like 10 I never noticed that I'm sure I never saw that paragraph has that at the beginning and ending so now I see it cuz he's ripping off this thing from Psalm 38 or something and
 even been reading the Psalms is it fair to say that it is written from a mind who has been meditating on the Bible and depending on which letter you're in and we're whoever's writing might have added an extra amount of a literary intentionality or do you think it seems like in the Hebrew Bible is an equal level of intentionality cross like every narrative and every yeah it's all interconnected obsessive level where I guess what I'm asking is do you have that expectation with the letters that you're going to find that consistency or is their moments we like whoa this is like there's some crazy stuff going on here is awesome and other times you're just kind of like by I will he just responding to it just depends and it's also a different Paul doesn't live in the same social location as the final Shapers of the Tanakh literature and so he also had a Greco-Roman
 education in rhetoric and persuasion and that's why many of Paul's letters sound a lot like reading other Roman orators of his day so he's you know he was the ultimate cross-cultural amalgamator and so sometimes yeah but the literary tools are Styles he's pulling on aren't from something in the Hebrew Bible but he's framing Hebrew Bible ideas but with maybe a more of a Roman rhetorical technique design principles are different give me different can be drawn but he uses symmetries chasms and repeated motifs difference that you're sensing or you're telling me is there is there still intentional and design for meditation but in a different kind of way based on different social location Paul would want the reader to church too
 read the letter b i l k now we know what to do we know how to think about the specific thing is like no guys to keep reading it and keep bringing it up and eventually you'll figure it out well I think whoever back to the comprehension limits of the audience shouldn't determine the sophistication of author Communicator can communicate and multiple audiences at once and also very all kinds of Next Level things like what a good Pixar movie we have a question on the security of scripture that maybe relates to this if we want to look at that one could call it feels like we're getting into that territory right this relates to a question from Matthew from Michigan hi John Tim and Carissa I really appreciate the work you guys doing this podcast I'm wondering what you would say about the doctrine of the perspicuity of scripture that is in my tradition and I believe an Evangelical circles in general it is commonly believed that the basic message
 salvation is clear in scripture this is generally referred to as perspicuity that requires many many readings many years of meditation in order to discern the true meaning so do you reject the idea of perspicuity do you think that the scripture is simple and clear in any sense thank you very much my purse but Unity he defines it really well here it's the clarity of scripture is the basic message of scripture clear or does it require multiple readings and years of meditation yes and yes yeah I think an analogy we've come to use around here that if you've been listening for a while you probably heard before is that analogy of a symphony that the first time listener or someone with an untrained ear can still appreciate the music they can follow them they can feel the mood and in that sense get the message of what
 play they might even get stuck in your head but after years of study or hearing or listen to the same thing they're going to know more and appreciate more I think another analogy that has has been meaningful to me recently working a Bible project especially as the analogy of art more broadly because I'm seeing what are our team is creating so I'm not an artist at all but I'm surrounded by all the time I want to watch a video one time I can understand it if I watch a video 10 times I can see maybe some connections and color between the seen and not seen that have more meaning or in shapes that like unite these different yeah I don't know exactly what that word means but or a little Easter eggs that are in there when you watch it a million times over so clear understandable but way more debts to be found on every re-read and re-watch angry listening
 grounding the question history so this term has been attached to a particular article in the Westminster Confession of Faith so this was drawn up in the mid-1600s by leaders in the Church of England and there's an article in there it's kind of the Anchor Point for why this term is especially important in more reformed Protestant Traditions hold it up cuz you can Google it it's Old English but it makes for great conversation this is chapter one point seven of the Westminster Confession of Faith all things in scripture are not alike playing in themselves Nora like clear until all people yet those things which are necessary to be known belief and observed for salvation are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of scripture or other that not only to learn it but also the Unlimited in.
 reviews of ordinary means May attain unto sufficient understanding 1600 English so I think that's a that's an excellent description of scriptures you could read the whole Bible and walk away understanding man him as a really screwed-up God keeps working with them but also bringing Justice on their terrible decisions and then Jesus came to rescue everybody and I should probably trust him and there would be a lot of questions surrounding that but that part would be understandable if it is not a hard concept and so that's not what we're saying is that the core essential message is somehow hidden in a riddle what we're saying is that what they say I'm just saying all things in scripture are not playing no more clear to everyone in the same way that's what we're saying so what's the nature of that not alike play
 what's there and all the hundreds and hundreds of riddles and puzzles in scripture are actually full of meaning but they require lots of reading and rereading a meditation and it will happen it seems to me that is you understand all of that stuff more your understanding of the essential message will also deepen and become a more nuanced tense of skid Through Time Symphony analogy music will not have changed little since become way more meaningful your perception of it both music and art because I think comparing literature within that category makes us think about the artistic nature of literature to and how it's worth meditating on to see more and to hear more yeah Matthew we are we are not talking about the essential plane message when were talking about meditation literature were talking about the goal of Fuller understanding deeper understanding requires this
 Moto reading and reflection hyperlinking and that Journey yeah it's very much not on the surface it requires a long time but it you know how to read that way it can become clear I am I experiencing teaching that mode of reading is actually very accessible to lots of people who are anybody really who's willing to put in the time to kind of learned that you don't have to know Greek or Hebrew to English translation with that kind of mindset reflection and meditation but not some special skill that only the elite can have or some special imparted knowledge it requires reflection meditation and learning a set of tools for reading what you're saying to the pillar of a paradigm communal literature was always designed even though it was designed by hyper literary nerds and ninjas but it was for the whole community of this realm and the same
 what are the Christian literature thank you. Matthew Goode great chance to make a good clarification here's a question from Jason and Georgina my name is Jason Cardwell I'm in Columbus Georgia I want to ask about preaching and teaching a church congregation from the perspective of this Bible reading. I'm assuming most people in the pews and never thought in these terms do you think it's more loving and wise to directly confront wrong way to reading the Bible or to let the way it informs the pastor's subtly and gradually nudge people to a different way of seeing scripture great and very practical amongst ourselves because we all have different experiences and pastoral Ministry and in different backgrounds to I think for me I Draw my thing about this question I draw from my educational background and think about you know our goal is that people would be transformed by scripture not just received the right content but to truly Learn and Grow
 and be transformed and when I think about education and some principles that I I really claim to as far as what it takes for people to be transformed there are few things that come to mind I guess I should say I tend to be more drawn toward like gentle movement toward truth and I don't know where you guys land on that but I think it comes from these principles one is that I really believe in creating this equilibrium or curiosity or tension that that kind of tension drives learning so just being able to like raise a question rather than say something exactly I think being able to raise somebody level of curiosity is a really powerful learning and growth stool and related to that I think Discovery learning is also more transformational than just imparting content so being able as much as we can is harder from the pulpit or in a lecture but being able to say we're discovering us together and let's take a look at this is really interesting I'm helping people have that sense of Discovery also a term we use a lot
 location of scaffolding I don't usually use that term in my normal I mean a tenth explain our world but it's it's like we can only build on our on the prior knowledge that we have do we have to know where Learners are starting and you build so you can't move from point A to point B without any stops in between an education this can be really concrete it can be like you have to learn addition before calculus that makes sense but I think with this question it's like we have to start where people are and then move toward point be so gross is good and learning is good it's not about just putting point be out there and saying this is what it is for those reasons I tend more toward this journey of self-discovery but yeah I'd be interested to know what you guys think that that's all coming from its kind of these educational principles
 just my own years of pastoral experience and having to put together a lot of sermons develops and techniques that I just kind of started to draw on and it would just go down to myself so I could actually do them or intentionally but I agree I think this modeling a way of engaging the Bible is the most effective way to do it over the course of a long-term and it will go to church community and so when you when you go when you directly confront something you think is unhelpful but you unintentionally do is alienate people in your community whose they that might the way something is worded is really important to them or their sense of their tradition and so I'm you risk them putting up walls and not hearing a different point of view whereas if you just like do it has ample I would try to always
 just take even 60 seconds to minutes whatever biblical texts we're focusing on for that Gathering to just quick put that paragraph in the context of that section of the scroll for that whole book I would try to always in a sentence or to develop shorthand for and remember the whole story of the Bible is about this and this is how this part fits into that hole so quickly the over the years you're showing people to understand any one sentence or paragraph I need to Anchor it in the bigger context when I was a nanny part teaching in any part of the Bible I always try to select one important hyperlink from earlier in the Bible that is being picked up in developing the section so if you're in the New Testament letters you know like what we're talking about earlier question show me one of the most relevant Old Testament hyperlinks that Peter and Paul are John is drawing on when you're in the song to The Proverbs what are key passages from the Torah
 picked up then son are your modeling that this is all interconnected and to understand one part of the Bible I need to understand these other parts too so those are things that I found helpful overtime and just modeling it is one of the most effective ways yeah I think when people start to see the interconnected nature of the cohesiveness of the story overall it's really compelling it draws people into to reading that way you start doing it by people long and then it's Sparks curiosity and wonder and excitement and then and then you don't have to go and try to deconstruct something you just kind of just jump in and that's a challenge for any Communicator how to do that I love a quote from CS Lewis Reese says reason is the organ of Truth and Imagination is the org
 meaning that I agree with both of you that like I'm always saying how do people change their mind or how do people change how people come to an understanding of the world it's a largely through our imagination being formed and needs to be reasonable and it needs to be bounded in reason but it actually is transformed to imagination and so that balance is really important and I see a lot of teaching just being about let me get you the information versus let me help you, I remember one of the presentations on how people change their mind is through crisis and I'm actually it was broadly talking about how people change their mind and general about something that it's when they hit a point of Crisis or are you call disa collaboration yeah so it's this weird thing where gently nudging and modeling is really good and can Captivate people by the beach
 give the story and just by example but then also having that that other piece of how does this rub up against what you thought before or how does this change what you were thinking before I like there's some value to creating maybe a small crisis not a large disunity in the church or isolate people or elitism but something that just makes people think and challenged and feel uncomfortable that's like a motivator for Learning and growth in order to do that you have to earn trust and you have to create a safe place otherwise if someone in crisis and they don't trust you either you or Chris at either of you do you make a distinction between teaching and preaching
 a man as a blurry middle for me just as a communicator I encounter the Bible as a puzzle that I discover how it works and then I try to recreate that Journey when I teach them the guy that take other people along the journey so I felt I was more of the teacher preacher and then
 yeah I guess that's the word order communicates the white boy that would make sense anyway I think we probably have different connotations that go with those words I don't know if they're all the same, is if we if we're going to I don't know Dover simplify is that teaching is just like let me just like give you a lecture that walks you through all the data points and then preaching is like let me stir in you a desire to love God and to like one is more intelligent and I are both of those I think but we need to just be really intentional about thinking about how people learn and grow whatever you're doing
 Elizabeth in South Carolina on my name is Elizabeth and I'm from South Carolina my question is if the Bible is written and assembled by humans how can we be sure that what we have today is divine what makes it trustworthy as opposed to other religious texts that claim to be divinely inspired thanks for all you do your podcast and videos have helped to soften my heart and change my view of everything especially Jesus that's a great question, at the heart of it at the heart of the Bible trustworthy I like a cheese or trustworthy exactly trustworthy as many ways you could angle it this question one way to say what do we mean when we say trustworthy trustworthy for what in terms of trustworthy to accomplish or do what my personal Journey like life Journey the reason I started reading the Bible was not cuz I cared about the Bible it was because I was compelled by Jesus
 by the stories about him and his teachings that I first heard in a relatable way it really was compelling to me not by reading the Bible but by hearing other people talk about them and those people were people follow Jesus read the Bible and I said I think that's kind of how it's worked for the most part throughout most of history is with people become convinced or compelled to read the Bible and then accept its take on reality not because of the Bible out there are some people who it starts with B read a Bible and a hotel in the Bible is the main encountered can ignore the nine times out of ten it's that the Bible has been put in front of somebody because of a community or friendships are modeling and playing for them poor Trevor story about Jesus's compelling to them and I think that's important in other words you know when Jesus commissioned the apostles at the end of Matthew free sample the Great Commission
 what he says is all authority in heaven and on Earth has been given to me so does a Divine Authority that I am putting myself under when I follow Jesus is the person of Jesus actual risen Jesus the one I'm following and I accept his authority over my life one of the ways that Authority and the way I hear and understand who Jesus is and what it means to follow him is through a Community of Faith in which I read these texts another word scriptures Authority is derivative to an actual person and so Elizabeth for me it actually doesn't start with the Bible it starts with Jesus so I believe that Jesus is human and divine and his resurrection displays him and is what instrument I miss the world's true Lord with the authority to tell me what it means to be human and then I accept that the scriptures are my testimony by the prophets and apostles that tell me the real story about who he is and
 for what it what is going to be in to be one of his followers in the world so in my mind that house things go in that order as opposed to trying to lead with you know I should follow Jesus because there's this super special book in this book is so unique there's no other book that's like it and that proves that Jesus is who he says he is and I just maybe it's just a ejected but I just I don't actually think that's how it works in other words Jesus didn't say all the authority and have a nurse is in the Bible therefore follow me follow me it's the other way around I just think that's really significant I think the Bible is really important obviously we all think that but the reason we think the Bible is important because we follow Jesus and that's why we read the Bible however the reason why we follow Jesus is because of what we've learned in the Bible as a community I heard about Jesus from people who read in the Bible but take it all the way back where did those stories about Jesus come from
 they came from the living spoken testimony of people who were with him and that for us takes the form of the writings of the Apostles that the writings of the Apostles are a literary form of the spoken my witness testimony. Yeah yeah yeah it's so interesting when I heard this question my first thought was my answers are subjective they are I feel like they're my experience it and it's really similar to that it's like you know I think I read and Trust the Bible because I know and trust Jesus why do I know and trust Jesus well both because I had a personal experience of some sort which I think maybe a lot of people would say that in one way or another you no experience in him through the community or resonating with the truth of hearing hearing the gospel for the first time or something and it resonates with the truth it is in you or something it's like all that is
 true and then hearing the story of his death his resurrection from the dead and how how that was seen by people who passed on the story and that this huge movement of Christians was created globally that is a story that my faith rests on and then it's because I can know that person is because I can do that person more through scripture that I want to read it and it's also because he values it that I want to read it but then I think the second subjective reason for me is that reading scripture and seeing a literary beauty is so compelling that to me and my quote this book is really special and amazing and beautiful conclusion you arrived at overtime Downstream yeah and also there might be a prior commitment to seeing the beauty in that text in a way to because when I can't understand something and in this text and let you know
 I'm sure that there is a reason and I just can't see it yet I need to keep reading you know so there's there's some sort of prior commitment in a sense to that maybe people who read there there were religious texts also feel or have the unavoidable implication of being in the modern world is that there are many religious claims contesting each other and that's unavoidable to know that I have neighbors who see the world in a fundamentally different way and accept that that's logically possible and a coherent way to see the world and it's not centered on Jesus I can't ignore my neighbors they're too stupid to know they're not stupid so that's how do you exist in that setting but yet hold the Deep conviction that Jesus is really the key to the universe and since I don't know any of this is the apologetic Enterprise but I also don't want to let the apologetic Enterprise take over this historic way that I think followers of Jesus have come to home
 these convictions about scripture Elizabeth the reason I even have the category of something being Divine and human fully at the same time is because of Jesus who he was who he said he was what he did that made that claim that's what form that category for me and he's not a stickman of an imagination he's not in, page he was an actual person and the accounts about him came down through the living breathing people and testimony that we experienced in the four gospels and my convictions about the Bible or form Downstream from Tinkerbell but by that but it does have this thing it seems strange for us now because those four accounts are a part of the Bible and it can appear as circular reasoning it's like it that but I don't believe the cat's about Jesus just cuz they're in the Bible right it's the other way but it's also they implicate each other in a way that it's hard for me to disentangle it all
 so another words I don't think you can prove that the Bible is divine just by showing literacy education illiteracy of Education in the front or the bhagavad-gita something but when it comes to the person of Jesus there's a unique clamp there that you have to take in about you ate on the iPhone terms and you can accept or reject it cuz she accept it then once convictions about what scripture are you usually follow Jesus reads it and that he says it's all about him and points to him because I I think the tendency is to say Hey you have to believe us because of this book and this book is God's word and so like so just focus on the book and what you're saying is the only reason why I'm interested in this book is because of Jesus and you also are wrestling with there is a circular
 be there because as it's been passed down the stories they've been threatened in the gospels which are now in are in this book but when it gets down to the Corvette's it's not about can I trust this book it's that is my trust in Jesus and Jesus I'm self as a fifth element of the story and so let's jump in we trust the scriptures as a part of our expression of trust in the person of Jesus and the two the two or implicated in each other so I guess there's no answer but I really appreciate the way you just put a fine point on that conversation to keep having over the years okay this is Daniel from Colorado hello my name is Daniel Brent I'm from Denver Colorado have a question related to Paradigm episode 3 hearing about these read actors of the redactions Amor editors
 I think some people listened to that might have fears around the historicity of the Bible and if so if it affects you know whether did these events actually happen on more how do we do that in light of this text what questions you're a good person has to come up I have noticed as you show the literary Artistry like a story the question becomes like oh wait so they told me those details not just to tell me what happened but actually help me understand the significance of this event how do I know that they're not making up something. It's almost like they're two questions one is are the others being too creative in the retelling and what does that say about the truthfulness but then what about Reed actors and editors that are later in time for Maybe original authors money right before we started the show I was talking to Dan our senior podcast producer and he used the word redact in a sentence
 things out of the podcast and it made me realize I mean we don't do that we never say anything weird in here we're glad we're glad those things are redacted but it made me realize that the way we use maybe we don't even use the word redact or edit combinations that I don't think are super helpful when we're talking about the Bible if we don't Define them so to read act in our modern world usually means to censor and to make something appropriate like a huge document and redact it to one page that the public can see your something or to edit something is like to do to improve it or perfect it or something like that and so we're talking about the Bible and read actors are editors are not talking about either of those things we're talking about how later people authors took and compiled sacred text
 they compiled and then they weave them together into a coherent whole that tell the story setting that's important right there also have said that is all part of its picture using those later editors to help shape his word so that has the meaning it needs to have and Tim you gave an example once when her time out this of one of the sticks out which is in Genesis as it refers to people ages where like you get the genealogies and you'll get a specific age is like this person live to be 777 years old and that number is really important number literarily did that person actually die on their 777 Viera was that used as a literary device to help you understand more the meaning of where you're at in in the text and then what does that mean around is it
 sexy telling me history or not and when is it telling me history and what is it not telling me history exactly as it might have happened with video camera footage as you like to say that's a thing that we start at the wrestle with the one question is about you could say the mechanics of the production of Scrolls and traditional literature the shaping of it that's right and then the other one is about how the people and events described in the Scrolls relate to historical events in the creativity of it as we have these words author editor redactor and they imply all these categories from our modern concepts of the production tax we have to get back into how text were transmitted made in the ancient world was super different in how we think about these things and a good example is no matter what one thinks about the authorship of the Torah the first five books in the Hebrew Bible you have to recognize that if Moses even if Moses this
 the author of the Torah in his final shape he had to inherit Source material from everything that came before him that we have in the generator that he had to decide how to use that. So he wasn't the author in the sense of the originator of the material so he was an author of a compiler of pre-existing material sitting down I don't know where or when he would have had the time but sitting down with a collection of Scrolls scraps of material but also with memorize oral traditions and then synthesizing that into something that wasn't passed on to the next generation of scribes and so to be an author and editor was indistinguishable in the history of the making of the Bible like to just call them all authors that's what I've taken up too sometimes composer you know when you think of whoever put the final shape of the songs together was working with collections of collections of collections but
 changing an organizing and probably contributing a number of original Palms to that triangle shape that's one thing the Mechanics Work differently and so that's what we're talking when we have the episode The Bible had editors that's what we met and was the authors and editors are the same the same thing when it comes to how they how material and if it's a narrative how the events relate to historical event that the first thing to say is we don't know like I don't know the snow's dad was actually 777 years old I've no way to verify that this is a yes or no what Genesis 5 does say is it's clearly the beginning of a literary Source cuz it begins Genesis for ends with a narrative in Genesis five begins this is the scroll of the genealogy of the generations of Adam to be clearly like an actual Source document has been plugged in here and woven into the tapestry of the early chapters of Genesis but if you
 many details in that there's so many word-plays hyperlinks to the narratives before and after that it is very clear it's been woven in and the key words have been worked into that genealogy scroll to make it Connect into the motifs and one of them is the unique age of Noah's dad that fits a pattern of the repetition of the number 7 all throughout Genesis 12 11 so that's what we talked about I think there's just your left with a spectrum of now ways to think about it now when we as modern westerners do history you don't do that if you're writing a history document you are allowed to change a detail and try to make it but I do a literary like coming over for you have time that would be then you're not doing history anymore are modern genre of History
 still viewing your text as truthful as communication but it will work in a different way has the chronicle Scrolls in it that retell the story from Genesis to Exile and you can sit down and compare the counterpart narratives in Genesis to Kings that we're likely the actual Source material that the chronicler use and you can watch the chronicler change details and Dobson interpretive purposes right make the illogical points to help readers understand the meaning and significance of what happened between texting event is really helpful because a lot of times we you know we believe that God really did act in history at various times he acted in some events of history at what we have in the Bible is not the actual then it's the text that and is in a sense of God's eye interpretation of that event or God's eye view of that event and so
 it's that inspired interpretation that we are meant to pay attention to rather than trying to understand exactly what happened in history in for it doesn't matter whether I happen to know I think those are not our only choices well alright but that's the official reaction that show people have which is all right you just put me on a slip and slide that goes all the way down to how do I know whether this any of this ever happens when somebody might experience it somebody might also experience is reality is more complex than I first imagined so it's the two opposite ends of the spectrum or that it's pure fiction and all that vacated for lyric creativity and the other end of the spectrum are this is a Verbatim transcript the ancient equivalent of security camera footage of the two ends of the spectrum on those are the two main logical Alternatives and so you know
 an author editor of Steven Moses might have adjusted somebody's age to sit a litter a pattern does not in any way mean this guy never existed sure it just means is it got adjusted to fit a litter a package today to get adjusted to his existence have been fabricated as well as genre is that even logically compelling another words is it reasonable to say somebody's age was adjusted therefore it's likely that this person never existed at all but what if their name is a word play you know it doesn't mean they didn't exist The Book of Ruth starts with the death of two sons named Citgo and done for maclone and Killian it doesn't mean that this family didn't exist what it means is that the narrative that's passing on the meaning of significance of that family story uses Lira creativity
 to represent the events I'm with you people who have a slippery slope mentality might the alarm start going off but I think we're just inviting people to say maybe this is more complex than just the binary section or video camera footage maybe the biblical authors were actually capable of sophisticated historiography it was both creative and trustworthy the word trustworthy and has a good supporting word because you gave an example years ago that it's been helpful for you said when I tell the story of my wife and I meeting is are dating and getting married and yeah right like that story has been redacted supposed to be untrustworthy or untruthful but to actually help you like understand the significance of the events more than maybe even like if we went back and read maybe a diary
 we have that we find some other sales in fact that certainly the case like how could I know the significance of a certain thing that happened at the beach when I was there right only later when you could fit into a story I mean that's how our lives work events happen things happened but we have to make sense of them in a story every retelling involves interpretation and it's the same with the biblical texts I think the question is when the authors were communicating and they were maybe changing an age or they were employing literary creativity was that appropriate in their contacts and did did the audience know whether we're doing and was it truthful if the author said oh yeah I change this to change that with audience will like cool yeah we know you know that's how we communicate what do what do you mean so I think that's where we can't impose our expectations on the ancient genres we have to read them and yeah and then see how they communicate
 yeah somebody wants to take a next-level step into really thinking this through it would be reading for example Mark and Luke and Matthew all at the same time comparing the same stories but reading them comparing details and you'll see it at work open Chronicles and then open the parallel stories and read them side-by-side and you'll see the kinds of things were talking about yeah but then to ask the question what was the points of the author telling it in this way let's rent and then to notice that I'm ancient Israelites didn't see this as a problem yeah they were side-by-side and everyone was fine with it so maybe I should be fine with it and develop maybe some more sophistication with how I think about these questions that's at least what I have been forced to do but actually reading the Bible itself and trying to let what it is shaped my expectations as supposed to do
 way around but I recognize that it's taken me a long time Daniel so I think it's a journey every person has to go on a comfortable to have to start to assess like how do I think I actually happen in human history or not like read a story that feels like a frustrating but again that's not what we're talking about what we talkin about is details about what happened in others the options aren't to know his dad exists or did he not exist it's right here they're the question is like what was his so I have to have this issue my mind as a modern person yeah. Like we're on the spectrum is the story right like and when you're doing that I think some people get concerned that you are you're going to eventually make the whole thing just an on-site inspection then what are you saying it's the nature of reality is more complex
 yeah the nature of how our brains recall events and assigned their significance and meaning is to reshape them yes we can help ya if we recounted this conversation in five minutes we would all tell it differently than today will differ than how it's worth 50 years based on what happens in between reality is complex and the relation of literary text to the events that they recount is complex to and that doesn't mean that nothing happened it doesn't mean the truth doesn't exist what it means is that we are finite creatures and that the way we relate to historical events always involves interpretation and that's the nature of human knowledge is he yeah okay yeah there was there was so that's the end of this Paradigm series we had 10 conversations around seven pillars of the Paradigm is it the end
 really the beginning of a new beginnings we split so that must have been more than ten anyways we had a number of conversation and it is just the beginning because what we want to do is next week we're going to talk about how to act if we use this Paradigm how to how to read the Bible with his Paradigm that actually takes a number of literary skills and there's three literary skills that we realize our whole are whole video library kind of be organized into and we want to introduce you to those skills and then talk about a really cool new experience that we're creating to develop the skills so that's next week hi this is aldana and I'm from Argentina
 found the video of heaven on Earth as a recommended video on YouTube and went and watched it it blew my mind the topics but also the depth we believe the Bible is a unified story to list Jesus is and more at 5 project.com
