pictures of Jonah Bible project and welcome to the 4th episode in our series on Ancient cosmology in this series we looks at the creation story of Babylonia Mariah and Egypt we saw the ideas and images that all of these creation stories had in common and with that in mind we looked at Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 and 2 and we saw how the creation story in Genesis is in debate with these other ancient cosmology God does not emerge from the chaos nor does God need a battle 2 Chaos the god of the Bible hovers over the dark bass using it as a canvas to bring life in order simply with his word in this next part of the conversation we're going to look at the second creation story, Genesis the first narrative and the second narrative in Genesis aren't coordinated and juxtaposed in a nice linear sequence in terms of the events that describe there
 describing the similar type of story but from a different angle of perspective know when you get to Genesis chapter 2 you might expect that the story of creation just continues the world has been made it's been populated but instead Genesis chapter 2 begins again this time with the creation of humanity from a different perspective here it's just one long day there's no time markers in Genesis 2 and the chaos is not a ocean water but it's a desert people notices for thousands of years to human and come last in Genesis 1 humans come first in Genesis to do today on the show while Genesis 1 begins with too much chaotic water that God needs to team with his word Genesis to begins with a dry land in desperate need of water thanks for joining us.
okay what time by Genesis 1 and 2 if we are facing story spend a lot of time talking about changing cosmology and we looked at Genesis 1 verses 1 and 2 and death and how did Jason stay as Waters and darkness covering the waters and then God shows up hovering and now the waters are full potential the same Waters Genesis chapter 1 the water is the first described with the Hebrew word to home which is they're terrifying life preventing aspect to home is like one waters are deadly when they either prevent life where they destroy life they're talking about s to home and in Genesis 1 verse 2 it's when darkness has over the waters The Realm of Darkness and nothingness is over the waters there too but then the next one says but the spirit of God is on the face of the waters and then they're called by different Hebrew word am I am which is the word used to describe water
 is in their neutral or positive life given context rivers and streams and irrigation canals that kind of thing can have two different results have two different meanings depending on who's over the face of them Darkness versus the spirit of God the rest of this one's going to be about how the Breath of God when God speaks breath goes out through to the same words. It's about God's breath spoken to his word going out and separating those Waters and ordering them into life-giving environment for Human Services in verse to go with interesting this was a scholar named Michael Morales Hebrew Bible scholar he wrote the most thrilling biblical Theology of Leviticus that you'll ever read stuff on topic here that's called who can Ascend the mountain of the Lord and then he's got more technical academics.
 call the Tabernacle prefigured Genesis 1 and 2 presents the world and then the Garden of Eden as the archetypal Tabernacle so we'll talk about the one who put it this way it's a capture my attention he says essentially how is it that you get from the dark Waters of to home to Genesis 2 with the River spring up out of Eden giving life to the garden and then spreading out to give life to the rest of the world and there's that narrative Arc between those two appearances of the waters so to speak the transformation of the War Began in The Realm of Darkness has to home but then immediately the spirit of God is there that neutralizes that negativity creates potential out of it then is Genesis 1 and Genesis one with a garden land with humans ruling over creation you like he s awesome after the waters are separated on day two waters above Waters below you don't really hear about the water's anymore in Genesis one the next time you hear about them is in
 it's rather odd digression in the description of the Garden of Eden about all these rivers that River in Eden is really important and keeps reoccurring throughout the whole to this is the river in Eden that it's in Genesis chapter 2 and verse is a spring right yes so here's a Concepcion in Genesis 1 the Dryland emerges out of the waters that God has separated and out of the out of the time so you get the concept of the land coming out of The Waters at stage 3 of Genesis and in the conception of Genesis 1 and throughout the Bible the land is conceived of as a floating of gigantic floating desk abounded desk that's bounded by the Seas I mean the concept C2C in our minds we think of a continent is bounded from sea to Sea and it's floating on those dark Waters that are Benny's for held up by pillars well the reason it doesn't think it's cuz of the pillars got put there yeah that's right
 I pointed out some of these passages the opening lines of Psalm 24 the land is yahweh's and all it contains the world and all who dwell in it for he has founded it architectural language established it upon the Seas and he has founded it upon the rivers the word of interviews Waters and Psalm 24 found it on the CD established it on the waters he founded it upon the yamim which is a word for a large collected pool or body of Mayim the neutral Waters of Genesis 1 verse 2 but then the second word here is the word River now. Rivers establish on the river so just a weird thing to say it's a weird thing to say in our cosmology is those dark Waters that were no rival to Yahweh like they were arrival tomorrow too so putting the land on top of the waters is it kind of taming or containing so whatever
 and that kind of cosmology rivers are Fountains of the deep the channel their way up reverse gravity and are leaking out of the land and is very natural if you dig a well down I guess water down there but sometimes that water like shoots up shoots up through the Earth but comes through in these controlled ways and you can build a whole village around 1 it is and the water never stop so there's a sense that there's a bunch of them down there and the lands on top of them this is where the waters are below and then it's founded on these Subterranean Rivers the channel does deep Waters and needs the land but it's as if the land is a form of control in yahweh's control over the waters sounding the Earth is a way of Yahweh becoming the water wielder is what Michael Morales calls it the controller of water the same way God contain the darkness with light yeah he contains the waters with Lynn and set a boundary says you don't cross here yet which is the shore and then he only allows little bits of
 the dark water than these to leak out in a controlled way so that they don't destroy different life than the flood narrative those things out the chaos Waters above and so you always seen as the controller of the chaos Waters and when it's rain she's just letting a little bit out to give you life and when it's spring he's letting a little bit out to give life to the conception land found it on the Seas there's Rivers under there it would destroy you if Yahweh didn't hold them back so that's your conception of Springs and rivers in this cosmology
so when you get to the Garden of Eden Genesis chapter 2 so here's the basic border the narrative proper begins in Genesis 2 verse 5 horsepower is a transition between the two the first and second cosmology notice it's a five goes on and tells you know us and there was no shrub in any field of the land and no plant in any farming field had sprouted cuz first it hadn't rained and second of all there's no humans remember when we read that one like was the Sumerian cosmology and the pre-creation state to speak focused in on just the absence of civilization since civilization is generated by the gods it's this primeval stay in the past so here we're kind of back to the land being wild and waste accept. The conception is not chaos water yeah just about uncultivated desert land and give me back up really quick I think for the sake of people falling along I don't know if we mention this but there's two creation stories I don't know if we talked about that
 is to narrative that the head of Genesis and we haven't talked through the first one we just got to the second verse in it and then our end of the second one the first narrative 7-Day structure and by the end of the 7-Day structure he's got the whole cosmology and you got humans yet on the land surrounded by water water around it water above and then humans ruling and then on the seventh day God Rest yet and yeah yeah yeah here we go unit comes to a really clear conclusion has concluded notes in Genesis 2 verse 3 got arrested from all the work that he created to make a key words from the opening line and then you get the slow transition note in verse for this is the account of the skies in the land Evans North when they were created in the day that the Lord made the heaven in the arse curtains thing to open up again my
 vacation is like pick up where we left off on the land cultivating making farms in the seventh day were resting I never met him but it picks up and we're not there now we're back and if you're going back to where we are in the Genesis 14 back to when the land hadn't even Penny vegetation was that a 30-30 station and so there's kind of like now we're talkin about the land and a 3 but then also the creation of humans and animals and a six so this next narrative is going into details of both a three and six the first narrative and the second narrative in Genesis aren't coordinated and juxtaposed in a nice linear sequence here in terms of the events that they describe describe the similar type of story but from a different angle perspective so Genesis one is giving you from chaos and disorder to order and Cosmos in the 7-Day time frame
 and it begins with pre-creation cath Waters here it's just one long day there's no time markers Genesis 2 and the chaos is not a ocean water but it's a desert people notices for thousands of years did humans come last in Genesis 1 humans come first in Genesis 24 for the animals animals come before the humans after the humans in Genesis to the Garden in vegetation comes before the humans it comes after the humans so all that today these narratives are more giving you two distinct perspectives on similar realities and Jen really wants to focus in on the dry land
 we began with no vegetation no farms and no humans but God was the water wielder were told of a little flow of water in the next-gen stats for 6 but a flow used to Rise Up from the earth and water the surface of the ground is the image of potential their potential here it's not the Mojave Desert there's a spring here and not spray is connected to the thing the God is going to do what's the English translation say I missed used to Rise Up from the ground we talked about this before stream and Ivy says dreams and then translations that say missed have a foot in a e s v n a s b that means spring or flow of the deep seating up through the land and water the whole surface of saturated the ground which makes month and the next thing may it is a creature of the Mad God forms the human from that wet ground Frost Us in English that means
 I hear it's not in the field Sunday. So from the dust and this is that weird play The Stream in verse 6 is called Ed the Hebrew letters all of tallit and then the Lord God formed a dumb at all if toilet meme so you haven't Ed making mud so that an atom can be made from the Optima which is the word for ground so the Ed the Ed makes Adam from which the atom comes as good and you would never notice that unless you read it cuz we have the word hummus which is a very uncommon English word for soil so then I tried to think of where is it could rhyme like a river what's the English word for flowing water that has h u m s and then God breathed the breath of life into the dirt the mud and becomes a living creature we could spend a lot of time there but we're not next time.
 a garden in Eden the next Rays could be translated to weighs one is in the eastern region or the sahib rephrase Macadam which is a standard Hebrew phrases for a long long long long time ago from ancient times there are some phrases that our conceptions of time of before and behind and so what's behind you is East End to say from the East is a phrase that coming from the time that's passed of em people debate I wouldn't put it past the Sorceress actually mean both be a double entendre here and there he put the human he had formed for the Eda Nessa Temple video so think of the map being drawn he's got a very precise map you have all the DeLand but then within the land there's now a smaller region that's called the land of Eden and then a smaller region within Ethan is the garden it's not the Garden of Eden the Garden Indian as the land of delight you the means to light and within the land of delight there is a garden
 land somewhere in the land you've got the land of the light and then in the land of delight is to the garden and then the next thing there's nine is the two trees first thing so you can aggression in the narrative here makes great sense of humor and have any vegetation The Narrative get put on pause the Forum of the grammar of the Hebrew here in Genesis 2 verse 10 to 2 shift and this whole thing is set even in Hebrew in parentheses as a background comment information in a sentence as being background information for flashback information so you can't tell it in English but in Hebrew it's when you put the word and plus I find guide for herb
 or a noun and then a finite verb because in Hebrew the standard narrative progression is the word and and then the verb and then the noun it switching the word order when you get a noun first and then a verb that's what he brought her telling you pause the narrative may tell me something that's really important but it's not the next thing I happened at the case why don't we have translations with prizzi's sometimes things are marks in parentheses this is a long long parentheses he goes all the way there a 14 on this river flows out of Eden to water the garden is it a separate one than the one that he has a different opinion I think the reason why we're told about the first stream was that it makes the mud and it rhymes with the word human a question is is this the same one and doesn't matter I don't know I kind of like the coordination of the idea that there used to be a spring that became the source of the mud from which the humans
 thank God planted the garden would be nice if that flow of water becomes the river have eaten because it was the flow of water from which Humanity itself in marriage so to speak and it's a different word because at first it was a stream breakfast and that's for the word play probably and then here it's called the river at the beginning of Psalm 24 okay the land is founded upon the Seas established upon the rivers so here is one outflow of the to home beneath the land but God has tamed it in channels that now to become a source of Life flowing out of Eden the first water the garden but then we're told our detail after it leaves eaten from Eden it divides us with one River in Eden but then it leaves eaten and then divides turn to the four turns into foreheads the word had sources of the names and shorten the name of the first is Keyshawn it flows around the land of havilah
 so much gold and Avila and the goal of the land is good aromatic resin and Onyx Stone I love this the Bible so obviously that's must be important important as some kind of fragrant sticky gum substance present and then Onyx interesting both of those substances are very rare to smoke a bulary in the Hebrew Bible that resin the aromatic resin or the Packers only one of the time and he from Fievel and it's what the man that looks like that why yeah it is the bread of eating its eaten Bread close in the desert well it's Hobby Lobby Bread on the way to Egypt has mentioned multiple times in the Bible and it's always one of the last stop to get
 getting to Egypt so this river is associated the word Pichon means gusher Kush means to gush and so the Pichon is the gusher that goes down to Egypt and the gold the goodness of that land is in its gold and jewels okay the name of the second river is also got your two different Hebrew word for gosh it's called The Geek on and it goes around all the land of kush the list of people for a long time the word geekcon is only mentioned one other time in the Hebrew Bible and it's the spring that's the water source of Jerusalem and specifically became a water source through conduit for the temple but the land of kush is the normal rate for Ethiopia south of Egypt and the name of the third river is the Tigris melons familiar that's meth potamia and it goes through all the land of Assyria the land of the fourth river is the Euphrates which we know that one through Babylon
 we can locate on the map correct Deshawn and gihan we have no idea what they referring to who are working within the framework of an ancient cosmology and so was in biblical cosmology it's the land is like a bounded desk then has a center there's actually a ancient Babylonian map of the cosmos that's given from looking above from the top of the snow globe down into it and guess what's at the center of the World avalor shows the two rivers you crazy ideas this is the center of the world and the center's the things that give life to the center of the world are these two rivers rivers so for scholarships think this whole thing is were supposed to be taking Mesopotamia than what they do is find ways to match the gear phone and the Pichon two things going on in Mesopotamia has been one approach
 Ephraim Spicer really significant work just nerding out on four rivers in the modern era there have been people who hold to move your younger position sensor for them this is a preservation of like pre-flood geography which of course would be all different now it's was preserving a geography that it doesn't exist anymore that would be another approach I think another approach is that this is like almost all geography in the Bible before must be a logical geography meaning that just like when you're reading in biblical poetry and Isaiah says that Jerusalem will be elevated as the tallest mountain in all the Earth what is describing it as its theological significance among the nation's not that there's going to be an earthquake and they can dream up list we did the whole video on settings in the Bible places are charged with C logical meaning based on
 what has happened to their or what is going to happen in a place is so low and behold isn't it interesting that the peace Sean is connected with Egypt and the Tigers new phrase are connected with Babylon are these places that are going to be significant in the biblical story of the gihan and the volunteers the name of the show where is rails going to go cuz it's south of Egypt are going down to the region of Egypt that's where they're going to go when they when they go into Exile and each of those lands Egypt when it's presented when Joseph and his brothers together it's presented as like a Garden of Eatin it totally is Pharaoh comes down as like here's the good land and Rich becomes this respite a little temporary even that turns into a Babylon once they're enslaved they're in the same way in the narratives about Babylon babylon.com Das my temporary kind of eaten Jeremiah it's not so bad
 houses plant Gardens plants Gardens in Babylon has eaten language do do here in Babylon what Yahweh did an Ethan in Genesis to that's what Jeremiah is the part of it Jeremiah is doing and then Jerusalem is of course than even type of place with the temple that has the cherubim and makes sense that Drew slum in the Holy Land would be described as an Eden and I've heard you described that other people there I thought it's called the New Jerusalem in new Eden is he killed us has his spies on the way up they find megafruit refer to Egypt and Babylon in those terms that's right it doesn't seem to help their theological can a case know it totally does the whole thing about the story of Abraham's family is Hey listen Abraham I'm going to bless you with the blessings of Eden fruitful and multiply and those who bless you I will bless the family of Abraham becomes this conduit of the blessing of you
 everybody admits sometimes the family of Abraham is lying and treacherous and so they become a curse to the nation's bringing death and destruction other times the nation's bless the family of Abraham and when they do you get little explosions meeting and so the portrait pharoah at the end of Genesis accepting the family of Abraham hosting them giving them the best of the land and did that Pharaoh gets hooked up and saves Egypt from salmon but then the next Pharaoh later he didn't know Joseph and enslaves them and so those who curse you I will curse
so the family of Abraham as an interesting corollary between them and the river becomes the image of God wanting to bring the life of eating out to the rest of the world and the family of Abraham is supposed to be like a Water of Life to the nation's and when they are faithful that happens and when the nation's accept and bless the family babraham you get a little explosions of eaten but they usually are temporary that's why I said a temporary eaten there called to be a River of Life and work in the med for right now there's no reverse it says you are the river but it's an image that Eden is like this epicenter of God's creative life you name the waters makes them fulfill his purpose by turning them into Waters of Life why does the chaos become Water of Life is that River in Eden and that River can go out and bring blessing and richness and fertility to the Nations and the regions that they watch her were told here in Genesis to are precisely the reason
 where is Israel's are going to end up in Exile where they go and they can become a source of Life a blessing or curse there is other places we're being prepared to see Egypt and Babylon and Assyria here as places where the showdown of blessing or curse is going to happen here that's what's happening in this paragraph sounds like a foreshadowing of like a preview now that I've been programmed with this anytime I've got a spring or a bubbling of water coming up out of the ground the desert that's a gift a little gift of Eden popping up out of the ground and those are moments when God wants to turn chaos into order and dry land in the garden and curse and a blessing and you just follow the logic Mane steady just get a concordance out and go to all the stories that happened near Wells and springs is Eden written all over it little eating that Gus and on the big arch where this is going to go is precisely how the gospel authors present Gaga
 to hell and from it flows blood and specifically in the Gospel of John he's working this Motif like nobody's business cuz he portrays Jesus as having a River of Life flowing out of him as he hangs on the cross that's why they get speared in the water comes out tonight and then culminating in the New Jerusalem with the New River of Life flowing out of Thrones got so this is the River of Life is the River of Life flowing out from the Throne of God either they're having to do with me when we go to the last page of the Bible literally the last chapter of the Bible and there's the Throne of God and the lamb Tree of Life Is there for the healing of the Nations and the River of Life is Flowing from beneath the throne that is a Garden of Eden image of this river that was introduced right here in Genesis to but the river's don't just appear at the beginning and end that River of Eden actually punctuates the biblical story line and it pops up in surprising places just like people have visions or me God's presence in surprising places
 it would be a great example of one perfect example is the story of Hagar Genesis 16 Abraham Abraham and Sarah and you told first off Sarah had borne no children to Abraham which is a bummer you can have your own kid but Sarah thinks she's Egyptian and her name is the Immigrant it's the Hebrew word for which where did they pick up an Egyptian slave I was just thinking about Abraham lied Abraham fled to Egypt Cairo wanted his wife and then he lied and put his own wife's safety at risk to save his own neck and fair was so excited to get this guy's sister cuz he saw it was a sister that he gave Abraham gold and camels and all of this and male and female slaves so this slave
 immigrant Hagar is in their possession because of his treachery and deceit to already she has this foreboding sense to her reminds me of Abraham's conniving so their asses what the lowest prevented me from being children sleep with my slave and I will be built up through her and Abraham just like Adam listen to the voice of his wife the same phrases Adam and Eve in the garden and how did that go. So after Abraham had been back in the land 10 years Abraham's wife Sarah took Hagar the Egyptian so he went into Hagar she can see and when Hagar saw that she had gotten pregnant then Sarah was cursed in her sight is very interesting to see how much as she is here she was pregnant she had to go to the spider mistress pregnant and she's like well I'm the fertile one around here this is her chance to
 game status in this household backup on this like maybe we shouldn't spend whatever yeah you know really I'm just trying to get this together will come back you all right anyhow so she dishonors Sarah now everybody's hurting each other basically they take advantage of this slave that they shouldn't have any way and then she begins to dishonor Sarah system cluster as they say Sol instead to Sarah do what is good in your eyes in this language from Genesis 3 the man says that I do what is good in your eyes and so she oppressed The Immigrant The Immigrant this is exactly the verb used the Pharaoh does to the Israelites when they are immigrants they are becoming pharaohs right now enslaving the Egyptian Israelite pharaohs enslaving the Egyptian slave Exodus
 drink of water by the spring that's on the way to sure if you follow the network of geography sure is on the way to havilah sure is on the way to havala which is on the way to Egypt and if you got the Genesis two rivers in your mind you're so I can wait a minute she's on her way to sure she was on the way to Avila Avila is on the way to Egypt I think one of those Rivers ran right through there a little respite of Eatin M and who did she meet there she meets Yahweh the angel of the Lord yeah totally and so this becomes his place where y'all we acknowledge is like yeah they screwed up but go back to submit yourself to your oppressor and let me tell you and then he gives her the blessing of Eden I will multiply your seed so they'll be too many to count and so on so she inherit this Eden Blessing by an Eden fed Spring Way out in the middle of the Wilderness that's what I mean these are a little narrative hint but they keep happening so then all the sudden Springs and Wells this one is connected
 yeah the one in Eden but then two Springs and wells in general become places where life and blessing and fertility happens if Jacob is going to meet his wife at a while Abraham servant finds Rebecca as a wife or Isaac LOL he's a lot of finding wives at Wells and all that is eaten imagery of the life of man and woman coming together marriages near Springs and Wells is the Eden image Israel being out in the wilderness and crying out for water and then God will open up a rock and provide water for his people which is right next to a story about Israel being hungry and then he gives them Manna From Heaven and what is that man I look like the looks just like that the sticky resin the deli I'm Delia is the English translation yeah so now I got the Eden and bread from Eden so what's the weather in The Exodus 15 and 16 so the stuff keeps happening it's like the surprising gracious benefits of eating that me God's people in surprising ways so those are
 the biblical narrative that it appears let's go to the next step so Israel is sustained by the life of Eden on the way into the promised land the promised land in Jerusalem is a kind of like to point out let's try this again they replay the sin of Adam and Eve Jerusalem is up high on a mountain like eatin was described it has a Temple mount on the guy who builds the temple is a guy named Solomon son of David who when he's presented by God with a chance for whatever he wants to rule his 1st Kings 3 what he says is Xena I'm just a little child I don't know good and evil so give me wisdom it's the reversal of Genesis 3 instead of Adam and Eve took wisdom and he's asking for yeah he says I'm not going to take wisdom to know good and evil I want you to teach it to me in the founder of this ya didn't 2.0 we're like stoked we like wow finally a human who will submit to God's wisdom and God stoked totally and so did the next
 chapters begin to paint a complex portrait of Jerusalem has one says I'm a dude he's build in the city gold with his commonness dust in those days were told but remember when we work through this in the day of the Lord series slowly Solomon starts to do all the stuff he's not supposed to do and then creates a huge slave labor force to build his Palace like he feels his temple with like all sorts of oh yeah the stone Lions carved Lions head and he starts to look like Farrah building store city is a slippery little humans so he ends up starting Israel down the road of being exiled out of Eden 2.0 really revealing here cuz I really want to get to is when the prophet look forward on the other side of Babylonian exile to a New Jerusalem what they keep talking about is a new Eden New Jerusalem with a new River of Life coming out that's the next up that kind of watches us into the next
 text Vicky for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we finish off this conversation on Ancient cosmology and then we're going to have a $2 interviews and then after that we're going to do a question and response if you'd like to submit a question we'd love to hear from you record yourself asking your question keep it to about 20 or 30 second let us know your name and where you're from and then email it to info at bible project, and please it would be really helpful if you also transcribed your question in your email it saves us a lot of time today show was produced by Zac mckinlay and then double the show notes are done by Lyndsay Ponder and our theme music from the band tents Bible project is a nonprofit and our mission is to experience the Bible as a unified story that we've to Geneva all of this painting of Darkness it comes to its fulfillment in the life of Jesus we're not going to make a video about ancient cosmology
 but we do have lots of videos on other topics and you can watch those offer free their study notes their Seminary level classes and all of it is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you and thank you for being a part of this with us by this is Doug and I from Lexington Kentucky so I first heard about Bible project probably a few years ago now and I was helping out with the church youth group, you faster just cooking show in these really awesome videos I mean they're just so beautifully put together with these really deep themes in most of the time they were answering questions that I had the Bible that if any of the kids had asked me I would have no one to say so I eventually just asked like hey what are these videos and where are they coming from and they direct me towards the YouTube channel for Bible project immediately I can tell you that I've been watched
 as many videos as I could that very night then, the rest is history three years later I choose the Bible project every single day whether it's the read scripture videos how to read Bible series podcast to come out in each week pretty much every time I open the Bible Bible project is not that far behind my favorite thing about the Bible project is just the level of accessibility that you guys give for people like me that maybe haven't received super-deep training but just in a way that's really super easy to understand we can see just how the Bible works together in each book in on all the context nuances and just really accessible way we believe the Bible is Unified story that leads to Jesus or crowdfunded project by people like me five free video study notes podcast classes and more Atlanta project.com
 thanks guys
