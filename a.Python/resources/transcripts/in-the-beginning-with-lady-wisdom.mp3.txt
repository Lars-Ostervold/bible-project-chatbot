it is John about project in on today's episode I'm joined by dr. Tim Mackey and dr. Krista Quinn and we're going to look at Proverbs 8 the first nine chapters of the Book of Proverbs contain 9 speeches and any speeches we meet for characters that are these contrasting pairs of couples male and female it's like a choose-your-own-adventure from the Eton store dear reader who's called my son you could listen to Adam and Eve the redeemed version who are the Royal father and Lady wisdom and that leads to life or you can listen to the corrupted Adam and Eve the Wicked Man the lady falling and that leads to death and it just for the you the reader then it's like you were back in the garden sitting in front of the trees and you have these voices were vying for your attention and that's the drama of these times these four characters are the foolish woman contrasted with lady with them
 the Wicked Man contrasted with the royal king and it's Days episode we're going to look at a speech by Lady wisdom known as Proverbs chapter 8 we learn about who she is but she values and where she came from so just for moments Yahweh brought me forth this is a 22 then verse 23 I was formed there's 24 and 25 both use the same word I was that's the word I underwent I was the product of labor pain that's the verb for to experience labor pains giving birth so she emerges from God's Own being she is an expression of God's Own Self going out into the world precisely when God is carving cosmas it's actually this particular passage that held the interest of many in the early church for trying to figure out who Jesus was and that is precisely this paragraph that was one among a number of key physical text that was being debated at the Council of nine
 when athanasius in areas were having this debate on was Jesus the first of all of God's created beings or is Jesus in Eternal Divine being part of the Gods own identity in areas appealed to this very paragraph to say that the Green Card Messiah was the first of God's creations because he still got Divine wisdom so this is a charge to question him anyways that's all I had on today's episode thanks for joining us here we go
 Hello friends we get to talk about the Bible as usual and with us today is Tim Mackie High tonight in Saint John Gray and Chris Quinn and we're working on this series which is part of this larger will work on the visual Commentary series and we've been working through different parts of the Bible that are connected to the theme of creation so we did Genesis one we did Psalm 8 and now we are looking at Proverbs 8 which is a really cool reflection on creation from the perspective of Lady wisdom and so I'm going to walk us through your notes right I'm going to play tour guide Proverbs 8 I don't know may or may not be familiar you know what I wasn't a new follower of Jesus all I knew about proverbs where's like the little two lines saying yeah for sure those catchy sayings and then you know maybe after I read it a time or two you know it began with the speeches of the father that are like you know these calls to be wise
 Barnabas Diamond Double stupid not cats. So probably really wasn't until I had start taking the class and biblical literature or an Old Testament theology the prominence of this figure of Lady wisdom really became clear to me but she's a major character in the opening chapters of Proverbs actually the poems connected to Lady wisdom and Proverbs 8 is the kind of climactic speech of this figure in the opening chapters of Proverbs and this chapter is saturated in both creation language and hyperlinks back to Genesis one but also to all kinds of other things that are fascinating and this chapter was a major resource for the apostles to when they were trying to use scriptural language and categories to talk about who Jesus was as both human and black more than human but actually like the god of Israel, among them and so Proverbs 8 ends up having a huge influence
 the Gospel of John in the letter to the Hebrews and Paul's letters so pays off to put in some time with Proverbs a kind of the whole Bible it starts to unlock and pretty cool ways women here speaking in this is a really long speech it's not just a short part is long and she's kind of feels like a mystical woman I love how are artist when they worked on this video created the universe in her flowing hair it's so appropriate because it's like she's woven into the very fabric of creation she's like this beautiful mystical wise lady to very cool figure kind of takes the stage alongside a number of other prominent female characters I think he probably Takes the Cake and terms of the most Cosmic and you know she's as we're going to see she is a literary personification of God's Own Cosmic wisdom so not sense the lady wisdom is in a category all her own in the Hebrew Bible there's nothing else quite like her save the portrait of God himself
 or herself I mean this is where our language does to break the categories right when we did the gods series and we started talking about these characters who really merge this idea between is a real or is this another character she was one that we looked at but alongside her were the angel of the Lord it seems like there's a little bit of like a category of the word speech if you have the speech of God of the wisdom of God spirit and then also the angel for the messenger of Yahweh main ones we looked at I remember when you guys were talking about how the word and the wisdom and the characteristics of God are both distinct from God they're not God himself but they're inherently United with his person talking about the nature and being of the one God the story the Bible is all about and these attributes of God they don't summarize the totality of the Divine Essence in all
 all of it you know infinite variety but it is genuinely a manifestation a character trait of the Divine and so we kind of like categories for it but these personified attributes of God they are Divine and yet humans can experience them as their own entity distinct from but also one with God and hard for me as a follower of Jesus not to use the language given to me eventually by the apostles and then the Nicene Creed and trinitarian categories cuz that's where it all went but the seedbed of this language was right here in the Book of Proverbs so actually we're already getting to like the deep end of the pool by the time you get to the end of Proverbs so let's first just kind of back up to spend a few minutes I'd like to just make some observations about actually just a macro literary design of Proverbs that has some Illuminating things for us to see about this character lady wisdom set the Book of Proverbs in the Hebrew Bible how that all fits together but you guys are going to have to force me not to take like a hole
 half hour to do just that I think it's helpful for thinking about who lady wisdom is and why she used it alongside the voice of a royal father and those two voices that dominate the landscape of the really part of Proverbs who gets macro setting then we'll dive in and read copperstate together does that sound good to get
 all right I think about the whole Book of Proverbs different colors of trying to discern the organizational structures at work in the book as a whole is actually fairly debated mostly because the literary structure of the book of the whole really depends on what you're looking for or what you think is most prominent so I Almost Persuaded that the mention of Solomon in the book is kind of the key macro structural feature and when you look at the mention of Solomon you find his name appears at three prominent plants that I think guard the organizational kind of hinges for the three blocks of it so that's the speeches of chapters 1 through 9 all these long speeches there aren't any of little to line little clever Proverbs in the first chunk which chapters 1 through 9 and that junk be in the Proverbs did Solomon the son of David the king of Israel the next big chunk starts in chapter 10 and it repeats The Heading again it says the proverb that Solomon
 and you don't get that header anywhere else before 10 the Proverbs did Solomon with a line in the Proverbs with Solomon son of David king of Israel and then what you get aren't really Proverbs will you get our speeches long Poetic speeches that explain what the book as a whole is for and kind of said it within the Revival then in chapter 10 you get this little reboot the profits of Solomon and then you get the hundreds and hundreds of the little to no problems so you could argue than the this is just the main division and then the rest of the book 10 through 31 is just one big block of Proverbs except you get to 25:1 and you get another one of these little headings but it says these are more Proverbs of Solomon that the men of Hezekiah the king of Judah collected so as a kiyah is a couple centuries after Solomon still the same Royal line of David some Hezekiah is like cray cray cray cray
 great great great great grandson of Solomon and David and we're told that in Hezekiah today there was another a recollection where new collection made of Proverbs of Solomon and that begins the third main section of the book what's fascinating is that more Proverbs of Solomon go through 25 to 29 and then at the end of the book chapter 13 and chapter 31 are collections of Proverbs and speakers from two other people that are not Solomon's explicitly says it to chapter 30 is called the words of Al Gore nobody knows who he is but it's a great name the King Lemuel the wisdom that his mother taught him and that's the last chapter so you have these three Big Blocks and in the third block you get Proverbs of Solomon and then the wisdom of two other Figures it's almost like the wisdom of Solomon is being carried on by later people but you or you could say that what's going on in these two with the words of Oscar in the words of King lemon
 both of them are Testaments of wisdom that seems to stand outside of the line of Israel's Kings cuz I'll go to the king but he's not an Israelite Kang that's ever mentioned anywhere in the Old Testament it kind of a firm something that we're going to see Lady wisdom says all the way back and what we're going to see his anywhere you see a king or a ruler being wise living wisely and leading with wisdom and Justice they are even if they don't know it living by Divine wisdom and so is this that thing that lady wisdom said back in chapter 8 gets a whole demonstration in the final chapter of the book final chapter of the book also has the epic poem about the wise woman the Proverbs 31 Woman which I know has a whole history attached to it depending on what Christian tradition you're part of that wise woman is an embodiment of all the vocabulary and ideas of lady with them throughout the speeches in chapters 1 through 9 so it does this lady wisdom is ozempic
 and for the speeches at the beginning and the speeches that end the book so there's a lot more to do here but it's just to say the whole book actually has a really cohesive organization and you can kind of see the main themes emergent care we have men and women who are living by the wisdom of God they become these like supercharged super human versions of themselves cuz they're tapping into God's Own Divine wisdom which has both male and female aspects to it with Solomon and Lady wisdom in the first big block and then Lemuel in the wise woman that he sings about his time so I just always thought this is so cool. It just has a different set of entities and a different way of talking about it than anywhere else in the Hebrew Bible super cool yeah do you think that the attributes from Lady wisdom and from the father passing on wisdom to the sun do you think that the father and Lady wisdom are meant to represent a masculine and feminine depiction of God in the book
 Canon feminine wisdom do you think that's part of the role of having those two characters even more specific so John this was the how to read wisdom literature conversation that we had in the how to read the Bible series and for me my last like deep dive into the books of Solomon which is Proverbs Ecclesiastes and the song of songs which we left out that in the video for how to read the book of Solomon the how to read ended up not calling it how to read wisdom literature we just called that how to read the book of Solomon cuz I had a big Paradigm Shift about the function of these books in the Hebrew Bible Solomon of the atom figure if you look at the portrait of him he's another one of these new humans who steps up to the plate to live by God's wisdom and bring the blessing of God the others and he fails precisely because of his well his own Folly and greed for power and then by listening to the voice of his non-israelite wives who seduced him into idolatry and so right there salt
 and his wives there an image of Adam and Eve story of the false narrative in the garden but with the volume up to 11 so you have the greedy power-hungry man and you have this portrait in Kings of Solomon's seductive Queen like wives and together they become this portrait of corrupted wisdom that leads to slavery and death and ultimately died and so I think Proverbs is picking up on these archetypes yeah because we haven't said this yet but in those nine speeches at the beginning of Proverbs this four main characters the four characters that's right lady with him as one but out of the night speeches for main characters and one is it the king that Crystal was referencing and he's paired with lady was done they're both they both speak God's wisdom but then there's two counterpart character yeah that's right it's like the Royal father and Lady wisdom are both mouthpieces for God's invitation to live by his wisdom and Lady wisdom is called Improv
 three a tree of life in the Royal father is offering wisdom that leads to Length of days eternal life but they have these pretty calm at the doppelganger is where they like their counterparts antagonist your counterparts when you have like the story where the clear characters foils to the opposite in the first piece of the father in chapter 1 of Proverbs he starts talking about somebody who's just called The Wicked Man or the violent man and he's everything opposite of what the father is telling you and there's a speech that the wicked man makes and he is like, my son Let's Slender the helpless let's get rich and robbed the poor and strip them of their clothes and we'll get plunder and Duty and tan sounds like Solomon on the bad narratives you know about him and then you also need paste email opposite to Lady wisdom who's called by variety of names lady folly or the strange one
 lady strange and she is constantly inviting the reader and the sun to all of this just like sensuality and illicit sex and adultery and illegitimate ways to get rich basically and so they're these contrasting pairs of couples male and female each each of them are all I think it's like a choose-your-own-adventure story dear reader who's called my son you could listen to Adam and Eve the redeemed version who are the Royal father and Lady wisdom and that leads to life or you can listen to the corrupted Adam and Eve the Wicked Man the lady falling and that leads to death and it just for the you the reader then it's like you are back in the garden sitting in front of the trees and you have these voices who are vying for your attention and that's the drama of these ponds in the opening of Proverbs so I think Chris is put your finger on it and that you've got the father and Lady wisdom Witcher I can redeem dad
 I Nev which are the image of God and it's how God's wisdom is meant to be manifest in the world and so in a way yes you've got this picture of what is God manifest in the world both male and female as the image and this is a cool depiction of that I thought it was really cool that in the very beginning in the prologue the audience is called I mean you said this a couple times but the audience is called the Sun or the child and also young ones or use so it's almost this liminal setting in life may be symbolically because other places the audience is just called all people or all humans or the open the simple so it's like all people are set in this setting of choice where they're discovering what's wise and foolish and the book is depicted in these two ways and the wise father saying hey choose what's good really what brings the most joy for you which is Lady wisdom Cherie Hayes on
 Education team right now is writing a Blog about how Lady wisdoms way doesn't take away Joy it brings ultimate joy and that's what the father's trying to help the sun see which is all about money. We can just end up this whole conversation talking about this Mac Russ Taff the character of my son who spew the reader are in that position is called like you said the Sun the young one but also our translations go different ways and rendering this word it's the Hebrew word Petit which is the simple-minded one but it means the one who hasn't learned anything yet yeah it's related to the word open feta still like the one who's open to everything but committed to nothing it just hit me one day like all this is Proverbs way of conceiving of Adam and Eve before the snake the simple ones they haven't learned good needle yet yeah that adolescent stage of Adam and Eve how are they going to gain their wisdom that's right how are you doing Angel was he assumed backdrop through design patterns and all these hyperlinks for all this
 sons of Adam and Eve you have your own garden test to undergo is you live your life and which set of voices will you listen to the ones that image God's wisdom and God's image is male and female on page one and so of course God's wisdom will have both a male and female portrayal in the Book of Proverbs it just makes sense that it would they couldn't be otherwise really if you think about it and I just never thought about it this way except the last couple years learning how to design patterns work in the Hebrew Bible and all the sudden the lady wisdom isn't just a solo act she's actually paired with with the royal king and together you can learn to find wisdom from the path
I let them into Proverbs 1 through 9 because that's the setting for the lady wisdom speech in Proverbs 1 through 8 so essentially the Royal father and Lady wisdom there going to be speaking throughout the opening speeches and the speeches in chapters 1 through 9 are low and behold themselves organized in a group of three and then within each of those big three sections there's also threes with in threes. It's really remarkable than also pretty cool I think for how difficult but there's three big speeches of Lady wisdom once in each of these groups the first ones in chapter one and she is standing at the gates of a city by the crossroads saying everybody come to me and it's a warning she sang listen man the wicked man is going to eat your lunch you're going to die you're going to be brought poverty and just don't be stupid listen to me that's a first speech by the way the city that's all connected to the Eden idea to on a mountain it's Jerusalem which is the Eden become a
 if you listen to Lady with them you'll find your way back to Ethan in chapter 3 the father gives a speech about lady wisdom and he calls her a tree of life if you listen to them you'll grab onto the tree of life and have Length of days and it's I really like you'll pass healthy bones your bones will like grow fresh and new I especially want that right now his middle-aged so this portrait is emerging of like man play wisdom you got to get some lady with him in your life and so the hold of the speeches build up to these competing voices of Lady Folly and Lady wisdom chapter 7 is this culminating speech of Lady Folly and she wants to get you into bed with her and she's going to ruin your life and take you to the great actually and then matching and contrasting lady Farleigh speech and chapter 7 comes lady wisdom speech in chapter 8 of drama even though it's not a narrative in literary form
 there's a drama of the voices competing and it all comes down to chapter 7 Les folies chapter 8 lady wisdom and then a chapter 9 there's a portrait of lady wisdom builds a house on a hill with Seven Pillars she invites you to come to her table and then you hear a lady and Folly has a house with a feast and she's inviting you to come what you going to do this and then the curtain closes and you move on to chapter 10 and all the little too I'm Proverbs begin so if you know how to discern that dramatic plot design Proverbs 8 is the last major appeal of Lady wisdom that's the basic point it's her like it's her final appeal Magic Mike a courtroom during closing arguments especially in contrast with Lady Folly who does things in secret and her Pleasures are temporary yeah the way of Lady wisdom when I read it I found it to be super refreshing the transparency the words being always true and dependable
 yeah that's a good point yeah she's a straight shooter she doesn't mince her words and she speaks with authority and she calls out to everyone she invites everyone in in public okay so that's the setting is that a fairly clear portrait I think I'm being clear and trying to take us through it but maybe there's something that is not clear or should we dive into proper said yeah so maybe I don't know I'll let you guys read back and forth different sections and we'll just kind of see what's interesting why don't I read the first part and then Chris it can be lady was domestic kind of upsetting lady wisdom on the stage verses 1 through 3 doesn't wisdom cry out and understanding raise her voice at the head of high places by the road at the junction of Roads she stands by the side of gates at the entrance of the city at the entrance of the doors she shouts this part is like we talked about she's at that junk
 in point this is the tests are you going to listen to her and go into the city or not it's a really beautiful image roads are made you said this earlier I think John write that decisions are made at the gates of the city or did we talk about that all we we didn't okay that like in the Book of Ruth you know all the elders gather and they make decisions they're so she's up there helping people decide she's like a player among the leading voices of the city at the gates and the gates is where everybody goes in and out to the Port Authority in this way in every city it's different now of course but that the idea of the Assumption is there's a central place where everybody gathers the leaders gather and she's they're giving her speech and their speech Begins the first movement is verses four through 11 this is what she says to you men and that could be just so people or something right so this is worth naming the assumed in The Narrative of the for boys
 the good ones and the bad ones and who they are addressing is the figure called the sun it's as if Solomon is speaking to the line of David so that's interesting cuz it is it turns out the gender Dynamics at work because the seed of David and the sunship is David is going to come to include males and females of Israel in the remnant and All Nations but how do I know if we'd actually when you encounter a male gender Dynamic that the audience is assumed mail I guess for every person is probably different experience that I'm thinking about that now so in context of the story the characters are male and female especially with Lady Folly and the young son being drawn into a woman's house those are characters that are male and female there so I think yes I read I probably picture the story with those male and female characters but then there are truths that I would draw from that story for myself but yeah maybe you just changing the word two people then doesn't do justice to the characters
 in the story if that make sense still it is addressed in a sense to All Humans but it's being cast in the characters of this woman and Sons are men sons of human and the next line those the more inclusive term all Humanity sons of human bones of a dumb and my voice is to the sons of human gullible ones that's that word for open ones or simple understand shrewdness and fools understand in your heart listen for I speak things that are right and I open my mouth for upright things for my mouth Whispers truth and wickedness is detestable to my lips all the words of my mouth are with righteousness there is nothing twisted or crooked all of them are right to the understanding one and upright to those who find knowledge take my instruction and not silver and knowledge more than choice
 pure gold for wisdom is good more than pearls and nothing desirable can compare with her how much speech is emphasized here so many lines about her speech being right upright true not Wicked not twisted or crooked I know it's going to sound like a broken record about how all roads lead back to Genesis 13 but the focus of that narrative is about a dialogue between a man and a woman and then this deceiver the snake in the whole debate is about who's telling the truth about the word of God whose words are upright and whose words are cooking and that's exactly the way she presents the drama so she's like saying listen I'm not the Crooked one you've been hearing a crooked voice throughout these chapters and it's not my voice and look it up and pisses my words are right and upright and true and righteous and that's who the gullible ones if you don't know the difference between right and wrong
 I'm place that you want to find wisdom I think that emphasis on speech actually has its roots all the way back and the debate about the wise words of God in Genesis 32 resistor translation it is what's the distinction between wisdom and understanding these words are they disappear synonyms or is there some sort of Distinction we should be thinking about as a reference for anybody who wants to follow the Rabbit Trail deeper Michael the fox scholar he wrote I think one of the most thorough commentaries on the Book of Proverbs in the modern era I was about ten years ago each so in his anchor Bible commentary and he has a whole, to adjust on Proverbs 1 through 9 but he has about twenty pages about the wisdom vocabulary all of it it's like short little words that is there a pager to each on all the wisdom words in the Bible it's worth its weight in gold so insightful so wisdom we did this in a private video it's not primarily
 intellectual or mental focused word but it's about know how I think the English phrase that captures the best it's practical applied wisdom of righteousness yes remember the designers and Craftsmen of the tavernacle bar called the field with hook my wisdom when Solomon employees all of these Goldsmith's to do the carving of all the old stuff he calls all who are hook my heart why is it hard for skilled so it's the kind of knowledge that you see them demonstrated through their actions they know their medium and they know the craft and you see their know-how on this play by how they act where is understanding is focusing in on a mindset you are able to comprehend and understand what is the right thing to do or the best thing to do and then hook my wisdom is then you actually making those choices to do it as soon as I can about the Proverbs it's not like you or just knowledge but it's this effective knowledge that is also really connected to
 committed nastu Yahweh in your heart like, Dennis and Devotion to Yahweh I'm even thinking of that relationship between the fear of Yahweh and wisdom there's like a reciprocal relationship there when you are devoted to Yahweh you gain wisdom when you gain wisdom that helps you understand the fear of Yahweh or helps you know him more other Hebrew word the word knowledge or knowing which is the relational reciprocal knowing and being known so we've got three words of wisdom in this paragraph understanding which is about discernment call discernment and then knowledge is about this reciprocal relational knowing there's also an instruction yeah there's stuff that you don't know that you need to know if I may explain it on me and my nine-year-old son is in this phase right now we're anytime you try to help him see that he's doing something that is not the right way of doing it that's not going to work out for him and if anything from Legos
 art project to how he's making his toast or something so I'll be like oh buddy you know what like you need to turn the the little like toaster ever on to this way otherwise you're going to burn your toast and his response to me I don't know where you got this hill just resist me and say I know I know and I'll be like nobody yet I don't think you actually do know because you turned like the toaster oven up to 10 you're going to fry your toast he's like I know that I like but yeah I don't think you do and it just becomes a loop and then I just have to stop and Mike walk away cuz he doesn't want to take instruction
 anyway there in lies I think and insight to all of us just like humans we don't want to think that we don't know something yeah it is really hard and you learn something new it makes you feel there's that big fancy word this equilibrated and it's scary sometimes to have a new piece of information and so yeah it's pretty I love these last two verses in the search part of the speech she's comparing herself to riches well it makes sense right because we all love well but it seems like there's also a deeper side pattern here with how Solomon's relationship with gold totally totally John a major emphasis that his story is the narrator talking constantly about how much gold is totally unnecessary like all the gold Shields and so on so he ended up buying gold
 like that the idea of Desire is brought in here too it's not just saying choose wisdom because it's the right way it's actually nothing desirable nothing we desire and wealth being one of those desirable things can compare with her yeah it's hard to believe that but I think that's what the point of the poem is if we don't believe that we haven't fully met her or experienced her or her goodness this is also Genesis 3 vocabulary the language of Desire The Forbidden tree was desirable for gaining wisdom Genesis 3 Verse 6 and then the very next speech but it eases the word shrewd just like the snake was shrewd but now she's using this shrewdness in a positive way for wisdom I guess it's about desire to become wise in the fear of the Lord in the world via Proverbs isn't just that your strategic and you know how to make successful life decisions including ethical ones but it's also about the shaping of Desire that what
 desire is actually the things that are good according to God's wisdom and that leads to life for you and others and sometimes the right thing to do is not what you desire and how do I come to desire it so that I can walk the right thing anyway
 yeah and that that thing is actually ultimately more like giving and desirable in the long run
 okay I'll keep reading 12 through 16 Her speech continues I wisdom live with shrewdness and I discovered knowledge of strategy and I got translation that's the fear of Yahweh is hating evil pride and arrogance and the evil path and the Twisted Mouse I hate to me belongs Council and planning I am understanding to me belongs power through me Kings reign and rulers carved decrees that are just threw me Princess Rule and Nobles all who judge with Justice I think of the section is she's kind of like pulling out her TV she's like pulling out like yours people who work with me and it's a way of increasing her birthday Her speech is true or she's true and then she's valuable greater than pearls and gold when you see a king or ruler like bringing order and Justice to the land
 can you talk to me they're actually using me whether or not they're going to acknowledge it or even realize it that was me yeah it's kind of like when you're in the advertising world and you had your company's landing page in your life we've worked with apple and Nike until and like I said that's what she said that's really interesting the snake in the garden was the crafty shrewd character but she's like I'm just rude character does the Jesus as being a scent like does shrewd like snakes what is going on I don't fully understand this idea of shrewdness and how it relates to the word is not wasted with moral value in other words here is a Divine figure God God's Own wisdom exercises shrewdness it comes from the Hebrew time ROM and so here it's or ma in Genesis 3 it's Audrey them but it's the same same root word yeah all kinds of figures can have order my or shrewdness I think it's essentially that you know how to
 are you the situation and no what's the advantageous thing to do that will lead to the outcome you desire in the strengths finder that's called strategic right depending on your character strategy is the word in the parallel poetic line shrewdness and strategy which is the word meze moat and stored for you know how to have to plan it will lead to the desired outcome which actually lady folly or lady strange is also very strategic this interesting how both of these characters have these neutral ideas like especially money sex and power and they can be used for evil or they can be good and beautiful things depending who's using them and with a characteristic that's going to be a few minutes ago Chrissa of shrewdness is a desirable skill to know how to size up a situation make a plan that will work the question is toward what end and it's that ultimate end
 that that will determine if your shrewdness leads to life leads to death and she is like if you want real shrewdness don't go with Lady fall at yeah you know I've got the real stuff and it makes sense of this is setting up this way idea of kings and princes ruling because the amount of shrewdness you need to be able to lead a whole group of people wisely or well that the amount of planning and thinking and Council and yeah it's intense that she's calling all Humanity especially the simple and also is empowering rulers and Kings it's great observation are you kind of connecting their image of God in Genesis one but yeah for sure that the poor and the rich to use Divine wisdom is a worldview in which every person is built with the potential to become Royal priests who rule creation with God as an image
 yeah everyone has access to wisdom which is actually exactly where she goes next real quick here just important little word that she uses for the first time here that's going to be key for later when she talks about the Kings raining and rulers I translated it carved decrees usually most translations it's who make decisions or issue decrees the Hebrew word is Hot Topic at the clearing your throat word on multiple fronts what is the actual word till I carve orech out and it's the standard Hebrew word used to refer to decrease or When leaders make a decision and then make it public it's called off and hook or who coached and it refers to the practice of like the Ten Commandments carving
 yeah carving a law requiring a decision into stone and then displaying it publicly and so that carving is key cuz if Yahweh himself is going to be shown to use this carving skill to bring Justice in order later on in the pond but right now it's just important coming up that's the metaphor being used here carving cuz when you carve a law you're bringing order to a situation this corner by my house where it's a corner that coming all four directions there's no stop sign from any direction and every time I drive my bike through it or drive through it I'm always freaked out cuz I've seen it happen so many near accident is chaos at my corner at what we need to do is for someone to carve a decree to bring order to that corner please and strategy and some up right it totally so carving metaphor is about bringing order out of chaos and the anyway you can see where this is going to be going to the creation seems later on so I seriously though I need to
 write a petition should we keep rocking versus 17 through 21 she says I love those who love me and those who seek me will find me wealth and honor are with me and during abundance and righteousness my fruit is good more than pure gold and my income more than gold more than Choice silver I will walk in the path of righteousness in the middle of the roads of Justice to give us a substantial inheritance and I will fill up their store houses that first part of the speech of gaining understanding and that it's better than gold and lead to abundance multiple paragraphs and recover the same ground but then take a little further and develop it so that she's more valuable than gold and pure gold that's literally copy and paste it from the earlier movement but this idea that you can eat lady wisdom
 she grows fruit that you can eat for sure that's a eaten him it's right there she has righteousness and so on to Camping it up now she's not just saying wealth and honor are with me she said you can have it I'll give you the goods if you follow my head and seek and you will find that such a important idea also an Eaton image the whole thing where they hide in the gods look looking for them and so that it becomes this inversion of God looking for people and finding them or people looking for God and finding or not finding him I think it's all rooted in that little scene or God's looking for them and they hide and they come out anyway that verse is cool though I love those who love me those who seek me will find me there's some Assurance there it's not when you seek wisdom there's assurance that you will find her and that's pretty reassuring the climax of her appeal which is a long sweet paragraph in verses 22 through 31 so Chris at do us the honor of reading a lot at the beginning of his way earlier
 his acts of old in the remote past I was formed from the beginning from the earliest times of the land when there were no deep Waters I was first when there were no springs happy with water before mountains were sunk deep before the hills I was birthed before he made the land and Open Fields in the first contest of soil when he established the skies I was there when he carved The Horizon on the face of the deep Waters when he made firm the clouds above when he strengthens the Springs of the deep water when he set a carved boundary for the sea so the waters would not cross his command when he inscribed the foundations of the land I was growing up beside him or did you translate this differently later reason I thought you had I was with him continually daily an object of delight celebrating before him the entire time celebrating
 inhabited world of the land delighting in the sons of human language and just the theme of creation it's just all packed and right here yeah there is so much but what's her main idea here we'll see if she appealed to the people she's worked with as you know establishing her credentials Kings and rulers use me then this is one I think that when she sang I was brought into existence for God's Own Self to use PTO and work with me and I was there before any king or ruler was carving just curious I was there with him when God was carving order out of chaos so I think that's how it sits in in terms of her persuasion which makes this match that second part of speech set a macro-level we've got the first and third part of the speech matching in the second 4th part of speech matching necklace in the tree so I mean mad what do you guys want to talk about somebody cool
 thanks up the birth imagery pretty prominent she's talking about how you always gave birth to her brought her fourth we are what's the deal I did I was riding a reflection of the reflections podcast metaphors on metaphors and so as looking at the birth metaphor but what I found was that birthing childbirth and then God being compared to a birthing mother had a lot to do with both suffering and crisis but also transformation and bringing new life like that new creative life for bigger contacts what you're saying is you've been doing a study on all the places were Gods depicted as a mother giving birth to your nose thing just kind of seems in the different places that metaphor. Saying involves suffering I mean it's a difficult act so there's labor involved so God laborers for people and for creation but it brings forth New Creation which I think is
 probably that imagery being used here the birthing imagery is like compared with creating I mean birthing and creating we even use those things similarly today its transformative but I don't know oh so now here if God is birthing wisdom moments Yahweh brought me forth this is number 22 than verse 23 I was formed verse 24 and 25 both use the same word I was birthed it's the word I underwent I was the product of labor pains is the verb for to experience labor pains giving birth so she emerges from God's Own being she is an expression of God's Own Self going out into the world precisely when God is carving is that same word carve cosmas and noticed the three tiered cosmas hear from Genesis one so you have the Deep Waters and God carves a line and verse 27 to separate the skies from the waters below
 that's day to separating the waters and then verse 29 he carves a line for the sea so that the dry land can be separated from the waters below which stays 3 so it's a poetic commentary on days to and 30 Genesis which is cool using the carving vocabulary just what the kings were doing what God was doing for the whole Cosmos carving Order of Chaos with me here in Genesis 1 when is there something emerging out of God's Own being to go out into the void and participate in the ordering in the carving up of chaos yeah it's his word and his spirit so in other words there's no way this is unconnected this is the author of Proverbs way of reflecting on the word in the spirit but in the slot of word and spirit Genesis one comes God's wisdom yeah they're different ways of Imagining the same thing it's God's wisdom so it's divine but yet it's the aspect of God that
 used to create something other than God's Own Self so it's it's supposed to stink from God and divine at the same time which then look at verse 30 and 31 think make sense of the metaphor shift actually they continue from the birthing in Madrid now that God has burst wisdom for 30 and 31 wisdom describe yourself as a little girl growing up beside him an object of delight celebrating the inhabited world and delighting in humans both the language of delights is used a number of times that's associated with children to play in the laughter of children if you do a word search on it and this is the word laughing right then just a follow-up on that for myself so do you think the birthing metaphor is about that unity and distinction so it's like from the metaphor is like it's from the same body from God's very own self but also as a distinct person is that the
 explain I think so yes in fact all use the words of Bruce wolski he does a better job this is in the middle of page 16 commenting on this he says the Lord is depicted as procreator who also brought forth wisdom the metaphor brought me forth signifies that in The Narrative of the book Solomon's inspired wisdom price father's wisdom and then lady wisdom but it comes from God's Own essential being so Solomon is depending himself on God's wisdom which is depicted as the lady wisdom so while he goes on it's a revelation that has an organic connection to God's very nature and being unlike the rest of creation that came into existence outside of God and independent of his being so it's just saying in biblical thought you have God and then you have what is not got a description and what's the relationship between the two and it's wisdom wisdom is what emerges from God birth and then orders and brings forth what is not God
 here I am a little picture that's not God but I'm giving this personal connection to the very being of God that is through wisdom and he's saying that it's a way of talking about something that is both the stink from God and hustle God again this chapter is the seedbed of the categories is that will give birth to trinitarian thought after the time of Jesus certainly this isn't all the birth imagery is doing but for sure it's one big part of it
 so then help me understand the growing up imagery because to me it feels a little strange that if God's wisdom his Essence is burst forth as wisdom I was just imagine it being fully matured right like what does it mean that wisdom is growing up so this is an age-old question that Christians have had when they read Proverbs in fact it's precisely this paragraph that was one among a number of key biblical texts that was being debated at the Council of nicaea when athanasius and areas were having this debate on was Jesus the first of all gods created beings or is Jesus in Eternal Divine beings of part of God's Own identity and areas appealed to this day paragraph to say that the pre incarnate Messiah was the first of God's creations because he spoke God's Divine wisdom so this is a charge to question him anyways so the Hebrew word
 translate in different ways of verse 30 sometimes it's translated I was a Craftsman beside him or with him or an artisan the Hebrew word is almond a mon and it's not a common word it's may be used in one other place but it's all about what route does it come from and people debate these things so New American Standard ESV translate sit as Master Workman so it's depicting wisdom as like the tool for the contractor because he has to make the cosmos the word also appear as a couple times or didn't form of the word appears to describe someone a nurse laying there a young child who is being brought up or raised up by someone and that's what the King James chose way back when and so it translates then I was by him as one brought up with him there's another view that thinks it's related to the roots that you did word study video on krissa. I'm in route in which case it would mean continue
 and Ivy has gone with then I was constantly by his side so my current view which keeps developing every time I come back to this problem is that I think it's probably a double meaning between the Faithfully constantly and the child image because the birth imagery is so strong in the context of God bringing forth one but the one that he's bringing Force isn't something that God creates wisdom is essential to God's Own very being so the birth imagery I think it's metaphorical because it's about the birthing of creation and so creation emerges from God as he carves and creates but the idea of a being who is distinct from but unified with the key image in the Hebrew Bible for that is the parent and the child father and the son the mother and the daughter and the apostles are going to capitalize on those of the meanings by John maybe that's where we could land the plane on the conversation but think about how John chapter 12 seems to be aware of what's going on in Proverbs that would be good and we don't have a lot of time
 but yeah John 1 he explicitly introduces Jesus as the word of God from the beginning doesn't ever use the the wisdom of God vocabulary does he know what's great is he uses the language and categories of Proverbs 8 but instead of using the word wisdom he uses the word word so it shows in his mind Proverbs 8 and Genesis 1 in our self interpreting you need to ponder them both together yeah like you said the wisdom is in the slot of the word in Genesis 1 in the beginning it's both from Genesis one but also that's what lady wisdom said I was in the beginning with him beside him and so when John says all things came into being through him apart from him and nothing came into being that has come into being it's a meditation on both chapters Proverbs 8 in Genesis 1 in Eternal child of God that is both Divine and distinct from the divined that is with
 God and was God it's hard to think of a better short summary of Proverbs 8 portrait of wisdom isn't it was fascinating is in the gospels there is this real absence of Jesus growing up except for that one little story in Luke that's so as we talked about this idea of growing up beside him I just thought of that story of Jesus sitting at the temple and speaking about his father didn't you know I had to be in the house my father so I think what we're not saying I would probably does not saying there was a time in the pre-christian state when God didn't have wisdom and then he created with them that's not what the metaphors are saying these are metaphorical ways of trying to save something that we don't have categories for which is wisdom is so part of God's essence of nature but it's only one part it's not the whole part God is also all kinds of other things too but that wisdom is is a part through which God has reached out to create and interact with what is not
 that is his creatures God wants his own creatures to participate in that wisdom and sharing that Divine wisdom and so it goes out from God weather metaphors that can do that breathing children speaking and these are metaphors to describe the relationship of God and God's wisdom and it's makes all the sense in the world wide John for example would use these categories to talk about and express his own conviction of Jesus as the Eternal son who was not created but who was with God and was God we're not saying is that Jesus is merely the Incarnation of Lady wisdom or the Incarnation of God speech in Genesis 1 it's like you using those metaphors by then Jesus is how does Paul say at the exact representation of his being the emanation of his glory and the imprint of his nature is Paul effusion so that is a whole other conversation
 final paragraph It's versus 32/36 she says so now sons that made my listen to me how fortunate or those who keep my ways listen to instruction become we don't ignore me how fortunate are the humans listen to watch buy my doors daily who stand at the door entrance notice she's back at the city talking about the doors the one who finds me finds a wife finds favour from Yahweh the one who forfeits me hurts themselves those who hate me love death go to hate me love death high-stakes right there I mean you feel like you've been in a room with the smartest poets and intellectuals in the world when you hang out and talk groups at least that's how I feel then there's so much depth here it's going to take me to rest of my life to plumb The Depths but what a majestic depiction
 he is actually fairly intuitive All Humans there's like probably a way of probably like the more right way is probably way that's more wrong one way is probably more in tune with how this whole thing is supposed to go and one ways Out Of Tune and how do I make the right choices and be the right kind of person that's really what this is about it seems like what we gain from this chapter is the understanding that wisdom's ways are in line with the way of the universe of all creation so living according to wisdom is like living according to the grain of Scots whole creation so there's balance then there's us and there's rightness and then it's ultimately the most desirable choice so there's a warning against like the temporary pleasure and she's saying I actually I bring abundant goodness and true life seems like that's what we gain from this depiction of wisdom and also all those who hate her
