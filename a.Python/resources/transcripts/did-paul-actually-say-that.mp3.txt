it is Jonah Bible project when the middle of a series looking at how to read the New Testament letters these are the small books in the back of your Bible written by the Apostles of Jesus and written to early church movement spread out across the Roman world right now we're looking at the situation of context of the communities who received these letters one thing we're going to look at today that's how it's hard to know when Paul is saying something original and when he's quoting what someone else has said and it might not seem like a big deal but let's check out first Corinthians 7 verse 1 and then IV we see Paul right now for the matters you wrote about so now we're going to expect him to quote something they wrote about and he does it because of the quote quote it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman on quote for their paws on but since sexual immorality is occurring each man should have sexual relations with his own wife and each woman with her own husband
 looking at The New American Standard they do not Mark that phrase in quote marks and so what it forces the reader to do is to put together some kind of logic for the flow thought because it doesn't Market as not Paul's voice the first Bible as a given of the study Bible was a new American Standard I remember struggling with 1st Corinthians 7 trying to figure out pulse line of thought his opening line is it's good for men not to touch with Becky and then in the next line is but because of immorality each one should have his own wife and each woman should have her own husband and then on that reading marriage becomes a concession so look at this verse with two different translations and one could indicate that Paul only approves of marriage as a concession due to our sex drive while the other would indicate that Paul is responding to a specific question the Church of Corinth and ask him and since the original language doesn't have quotation marks
 we have to do our best to figure out where they should go there's a whole plant Paul regularly is quoting excerpts of previous conversations or what people are saying I think the stakes are high in the section of the Bible because again they're so quotable it's easier to take them out of context and thought contacts than many other parts of the Bible and so I think it really pays off to develop a thoughtful set of reading skills So today we're going to look at Paul's quotes in his letters and the importance of using a variety of translations and more that's all I had thanks for joining us here we go
where to finish up the conversation from last episode which is how to read the New Testament letters in their situational contacts yes we should be the last installment of this part of our conversation about the New Testament letters so the big idea has been there's 19 books of the Bible are the shortest books of the Bible are not actually books they are letters in the New Testament they were written by the first circle of leaders who were around Jesus or who met the Risen Jesus and then they planted Jesus communities around the Mediterranean and then wrote letters to them Summer Long another submar long ish and longer than your average ancient letter which will talk about that more in the next part of our conversation but fun fact that I didn't know until recently maybe last 5 years or so is that they're ordered by like 50 yes or Paul's letters cuz it's 13 Paul's letters
 buy length not by the order in which they were written and actually if you read them in the order in which they are written which there's a bit of debate about how some books related together is Galatians the first or is are the Thessalonian letters the first even if you can't decide they're within a few years of each other if you read them in order really fascinating cuz you're actually getting little snapshots of the events of Paul's missionary journey and it's really interesting stuff the Romans is the last the last before the last one he wrote before the imprisonment and then you get would have called the Pastoral Soca Titus and 1st and 2nd Timothy 2nd Timothy he's writing from prison certain that he's going to die and it's almost certainly the last thing that came from Paul but Roman is the caps at the Capstone of his missionary Journeys before the arrest and being in prison for years
 anyway I was interesting to read the letters that way but they are not organized that way in our Bibles today that was supposed to be a little fun fact and then somehow I still a fact even if it's more fun of a fact so yeah contacts contacts contacts has been the theme of our discussion where do these letters fit in the whole story of the Bible talk about that that's one layer contacts. How do these letters fit into the context of the Roman World in which they were written we talked about that and then these are letters these are actual written to communities of people who were dealing with very specific things that's the third layer of contacts what's the situation in which power is writing these letters or John or Peter also known as James so we talked and we just kind of looked through and Galatians and flipping
 and in Corinthians and what you kind of walked through this kind of detective months of how do we see what was the situation context was and it was all right there it wasn't too hard wasn't very hard to start looking for it you can see us there you know I think a lot of Bibles often have a little summary before these letters some of that I think I think that's a common thing she I've seen but then we also looked at a couple examples or one in particular where you have no idea we know the situation in context yes that's right and you just kind of hanging leg well I don't know what this was about correct what was interesting about that example which was Paul just mentioning offhand this practice called the baptism for the dead is that in its context of the paragraph as a whole you actually can get his idea of the paragraph without knowing that difficult background knowledge so again as observe
 if someone else's mail we can get the basic idea even when you don't know the particulars but if we did know the particulars it would probably eliminate why he brings it up but it's just lost history groups like situation in context is very helpful but not always essential I think it's very helpful and I think we should consider it an essential part of the next level studying and understanding these letters but we need to recognize our limits the limits of our knowledge beyond the limits of the genre that the Holy Spirit has chosen to be the vehicle of God's word to those people which is a seemingly also come back to Hawaii in this and then why is your God choose this genre of someone's mail a word to us why tell me why whenever there's a question that's why did God
 why does God I immediately territory question was just the depth of the riches that isn't it isn't ours to know what we do know is what has happened and what the Holy Spirit has given us and then we go so what I would I like to do this finish is that practice that detective work of trying to reconstruct the situation into which the Apostle is writing that method or that approach has been given the name and New Testament scholarship so I wanted to just post the name it talk about a couple of Scholars who have contributed to helping kind of helmet as in tool set and then flush out one example where there's just a lot of payoff program and yeah I think it may be helpful to do in the video although we could choose any of the dips that we've covered but for the video we're going to want and it a conch
 example for each of these levels of context to where I think we'll probably be helpful to use the same letter throughout as opposed to different letters different kinds of contacts has been given the name Mira reading I first came across this in the work of a new testament scholar named John Barclay who I'm just realizing we've already in this conversation that we talked about me reading different about Paul's letter to the Galatians because I threatened the modern history of interpreting that letter people have gotten a little excited about their ability to reconstruct the problem in galatia, who caused the problem and when did it start and what people preaching the other gospel that's right the the Messianic Jewish missionaries who said you have to be to join the ethnic Dish Nation
 you have to become a part of the Messianic family's got so what the hell do they actually look for Unique phrases in Paul's line of thought or something that Jose will be like that's an odd thing for Paul to say and then no reconstruct what I was probably a line from pause Aunt Agnes and he's quoting their words but back at them throwing it back at them in some way that happens in Corinthians a lot exactly where he is like he'll say something and some people will say well that he just quoting yes the people of that day let's take time to focus on this cuz this is important to look up 1st Corinthians chapter 7 with me food for the body to buy food at 1 and just half second but to the first sentence of 1st Corinthians chapter 7 Paul shift in chapters 1 through 6 he's been responding to things that he's heard about reports that he's gotten like maybe we looked at in the last episode that he got a report from the people who
 10 the house church that Chloe is in charge of so in chapter 7 he starts responding to things in a letter that they wrote to him and so chapter 7 begin now concerning the things that you wrote and then the next part of the sentence is it is good for a man not to touch a woman in interview that's a quote if it gets quoted exactly right exactly right so this phrase it is good for a man not to touch a woman as you go on on through the chapter in the next paragraph he goes on to talk about how you like it's good for men and women to get married especially if it's a man or woman who you know has really struggled with self control over their sexual impulse which is like most humans I've ever met Todd glitch in the logic yeah if you don't understand that what he's doing is quoting from the letter so there are some people who have taken Paul to mean or
 that they have developed a Theology of the if you really going to follow Jesus you will be unmarried just like him and so it's good for me and not touch a woman pretty clear because in the very next sentence yes yes it does but since sexual immorality is occurring each man should have sexual relations with his wife they do not mark it up quote about phrasing quote marks and so what it forces the reader to do is to put together some kind of logic for the flow thought because it it doesn't Mark it as not Paul's voice that makes sense I remember reading this the first Bible I was given as a study Bible was a new American Standard I remembered struggling with 1st Corinthians 7 trying to figure out Paul's line of thought cuz he has the longest time it was just like what he his opening line is it's good for men not to touch with me you're contradicting yourself and then
 is the next line is but because of immorality each one should have his own wife a nice woman should have her own husband and then on that reading marriage becomes a concession the ideal is not to get married but because you're all like you know such slaves you're such a setting is you should get married and they asked be first two starts with the but yes and that even like makes it seem more like a concession zactly however if the phrase is it good for a man not to touch a woman is a Lion from some Corinthians who are promoting the celibacy as Superior to marriage and it makes sense why he would begin verse 2 with a butt to contrast what they're saying there's a whole point Paul regularly is quoting the previous conversations or what people are saying but in the original language there's no quotation mark quotation marks it's an interpretive decision some of those are controversial
 yeah yeah I mean this one is probably a bit controversial whether or not it's a quote or not but I'm trying to remember specifically about the food one I think there was just I remember really sensing the like who knows I couldn't I couldn't discern yeah yeah that's right
yeah in the previous paragraph before 7:30 last paragraph of chapter 6 in 1st Corinthians and 6:12 the answer with this line all things are lawful for me but not all things are profitable all things are lawful for me but I won't be Mastered by anyting food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food but God will do away with both of them however the body is not for him reality but for the Lord and the Lord is for the body soap there's something happening here he repeats this line twice all things are lawful for me and then you goes on to contradict it all things are lawful but not everything is all things waffle I won't be mastered then this thing about how food is for the stomach and God will do away with both of them and then he starts talking about the body and immorality so
 if you look at the different modern translations what you'll notice is that different translations put quotation marks are you looking at The New International Version actually I just want to that they want the reader to have to do the homework right yes V for the NIV and Ivy has quotes I switched because you read it lawful for me to what did you how did you read it all things are lawful or unlawful and then NIV says I have the right to do anything with a face quote then not everything is beneficial is not a quotes corrects another was there helping you see that Paul is quoting here against somebody or some group in the Church of Corinth the believes because of their Liberation in Christ they have a new moral freedom and Paul's opinion they are misusing
 and hurting themselves and other people what I want to know is this Paul agree I have the right to do anything or not well what this is going to be is particularly about there's some men in the Church of Corinth who were continuing the tradition of attending Banquets at temples down the street and these are mostly not all of them some of them have female priestesses most of them this is a mail all mail deal and the whole night of worship and sacrifice and banqueting ends with a lot of wine and then income the temple prostitutes so just lots of sex recommends for the most part later on the letter to staying away from the temple but these people seem to have such a condition that listen I don't believe in Zeus oropallo yeah I don't think that idle statue there has any power over me but my friends are going down there I
 freedom in Christ is like go the policy okay so you technically you're not in danger of any spiritual power there but some things are really foolish and I are going to lead you to being enslaved to really destructive habits that's his point and so yours with interesting 12 he's almost certainly quoting somebody that can I have everything is lawful for me Paul contrasts or disagrees but not everything is beneficial he quotes him again. How are you pretty certain that it's a quote or are you just have to get into take a deep dive into the interpretation of the letter the fact that it's the same identical phrase that he immediately contradicts it here's the thing but not all things hears all things are lawful but I won't be mastered and here's where it gets really interesting first 13 food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food and Ivy marks that is a quote
 another was this would be a line where he's quoting I think I sent a lot of pictures of the day or yeah people debate about what this line actually is but it seems to be that listen food is natural it's just material goes into my stomach my stomach for food but then he starts talking about sex Paul starts he contrasts that statement starts talking about sex the body isn't for a morality I think the logic of this lines there's a lot of smart people but the people on the translation committees disagree that think that the quote actually extends longer here would be the quote for the other Corinthians 10 verse 13 through this for the stomach and the stomach is for food listen God's going to do away with all of it and then IV that's the full quote well I forgot about that he has a great yeah okay good for them okay I think the NIV is correct and so do a lot of other really important Scholars on 1st Corinthians the ESV
 has the quote and in the middle of verse 13 through his for the stomach of a sentence with food and quote and quote is does God care what I do with my body does it matter what I do with my body in regard to food or sex if you read the ESV Paul quote a line food is meant for the stomach stomach is meant for food that's what the Corinthian saying and then Paul's response in the ESV does listen God's going to destroy food and the body which is really not Paul's they all know well depends on how you understand this analogy but if you think the pause has a worldview into the physical world is inherently bad and has to be destroyed so that a disembodied non-physical spiritual reality that's eternity is truly what's good then this would make good sense you can say yes
 interpretation call believes in the resurrected body now I guess the question is does he has to destroy one body to create the other so I guess you could still say that that's what Paul means but it seems like the point here as you are saying is what you do to our bodies important yes that's right and so he wouldn't just be like for the body if your body is not important but I wouldn't be your point and because what he's about to go on and say is your body is really important people of God yeah so let's go with an IV then you Corinthians say food is for the stomach stomach for food listen God's going to destroy you both I can overeat I can sleep with a prostitute this body's going away why does God care what I do with the body why does God care what we do on this with a sinking ship surely God wouldn't care about that it's of no value for eternity eternity is not Earth weigh
 call and then if he's reading which I know a lot of people may think it's correct Paul disagrees radically he says no listen first of all the body is not designed to be joined sexually somebody you haven't made of marriage covenant to assumes that they know what he thinks about that then he says listen to body is for the Lord and the Lord is for the body by his power God raised the Lord from the dead and he will raise us too and don't you know your bodies are members of the Messiah himself here so you can see his logic here there's about the body your body is destined for transformation and resurrection and your Resurrection body is infected and so what you do with your present body as a member of the messiah's people is actually you doing it to Jesus's body it's not your body your body matters when it comes to food or sex
 anyhow the whole point is Paul as in more than one letter quoting and in more than one place quoting from excerpts of their letters of the people who write to him with people whose writing to you and that it really Ricky the group did tell me about cuz like anytime I don't like what all saying I could just say I was pulling someone else okay so you have to build up criteria here it's fairly clear because if you try and put together the logic of the paragraph it's really difficult if this is all Paul's voice so the whole question is this is why John Barclay all the way back to this thing if we go back this is why John Barclay was compelled to bring order to the chaos and create key questions and criteria to help you know that you are really what Paula saying really is in response to the guard rails to start rails that's right this is also a really great example
 value of using more than one translation one of the most common questions I hear coming through is what translation of the Bible should I read and I think it'd be a great video to make one day yeah good point but your answer is always use as many as you can as you dare golf clubs that's why they all have a different purpose and the nasb here says hey our purpose is to do to make you work for it we want we want to just be as close to the original possible but then we have the NIV in the ESV are both saying no we're going to we're going to help you a bit more but then by reading both you realize oh there's a discrepancy here and so it's not olly olly oxen free where it's like I can put quotes wherever you're kind of like you've got these translation bodies who said here's what we think and then here's what we think and now you're in the Plainfield I think you know where
 everyone's been that's right and this is a issue specific to the New Testament letters where Paul has to address people in these churches who disagree with him and who have let Paul know about their disagreement and so he has to engage them like you wouldn't let her let me to make perfect sense so this just so you know we're talking about a handful of passages throughout all of his letters where this is really an interpretive challenge
so John Barclay Road essay and then another scholar who's in the Portland area just a few years ago well 2012 I guess also kind of holding it in and dialing in these criteria I learned a lot from this but for some more reading we've already talked about what the side view mirror yeah that's right. All right that's right so here are some criteria that these Scholars proposed when we hypothesize about the situation that the apostles riding at 2 and this isn't just for when they're quoting or not recording this is for how do we figure out the situation contacts yep that's right that's right so the first thing they go to is what kind of utterance some help and I'm saying the word utterance it sounds funny it is a funny word out loud
 are there do you mean like a cow's udder yeah that's right in other words what is that mean that type of letter okay I'm so let's change the type of statement that type of statements letters are Pros discourse pieces of literature that make points develop and support those points in the developing line of thought to communicate something is a statement series of statements that's right and so there's types of statements correctly right off the bat help me understand that what you mean this type of statement types of statements hear there's a question or there's a answer those are two different question answer assertion denial command a Prohibition a very large laundry list of types of statements
 I've never thought about you had a grading statements what kind of statement am I making right now you get the point you get the point every sentence that you are there is a type of statement the question is let's say in one of Paul's letters he keeps hammering a point home with lots of assertions in is this is true of us give some examples hear the bladder to the Galatians saying this many types of statements that's an assertion that's true making a claim about what is true something that you believe is true Paul's letter to the Galatians opens up saying Paul an apostle I was sent not from humans or by a human I was sent by Jesus the Messiah and God the Father who raised him from the dead
 a strong assertive Claim about his not his afraid edsel's to speak through Jesus so right there you can infer why does he need to say that there must be somebody around galatia who sang the Paul he's just a human with his own opinions and you should listen to him so you're saying if there's an assertion you could guess at situationally that assertion Paul is countering someone else's assertion correct or at least we should be open today yeah I know where is he's not writing these letters just to wax eloquent on see all the Seahawks OK Google mode of 8 him that's true because if you're reading a theological essay to be all sorts of assertion that are just trying to create a philosophical Paradigm if a structure theoretical complete statement yeah yeah yeah
 but for the most part there are many criteria and he's all have to work together to make a compelling case for a mirror reading you know the situation in Glacier you need a whole bunch of mutually supporting ideas a criteria but this is one of them there might be a teaching of the opposite of countering another example Paul's letter to Timothy the first letter to Timothy opens up the first paragraph after the kind of necessary pleasantries stuff like Paul an apostle to Timothy grace and mercy to the standard and introductions first paragraph Okay so remember I urged you in Macedonia and I went to Macedonia stay in Ephesus so you can come and certain people to stop teaching bad Theology and stop devoting themselves to myths and endless genealogies these promote controversial speculation they don't Advance Scouts work
 so this is on demand is a command given to Timothy but a very clearly hear it's a command implies that people are either doing or not doing the thing yeah because we're doing the command to Prohibition I want people to stop doing this it presumes like there's a bunch of people doing this that's why you have to write it how many types of statements is Barclays like a line more than I have here I just have for like how cute he does ask it I just think you're what you're trying to do is still out as many different kinds of statements and then the next criteria is the tone of these statements then the next criteria is the frequency of these statements so if there's a certain deny Freedom do I have like because I'm I don't have a complete list of statements and will say I'm not going to be back like yeah but I want to take this principle it seems like you know
 I understand languages they use language so I can just be like okay what kind of statement is this and I could come up with my own words and I could get pretty far with figuring out oh okay because I hear you got Commander prohibition and assertion and we were bouncing around being at the end of that to about reality well I was mistaken about the command it was actually it's a Prohibition clearly approved I want people to stop doing the Commander's I want people to do this or he said he commands yes that someone to go somewhere yeah I want Timothy asked you to stay in Ephesus so that you could come and people you stay in Ephesus command yeah that's right so that you can command people to do this and then he ends it with.
 without all that together and be like okay there's people doing a certain thing Paul has this view on it and this is what he wants to have happened if he does it with great frequency throughout the letter people teaching bad theology based on their interpretation of the early chapters of Genesis especially the genealogies the next paragraph is it goes on to talk about how the Torah is great but these bad theologians want to be teachers of the Torah and they're introducing division it's terrible and so is it go throughout 1st Timothy what you're going to see if there's a certain group of men there's a certain group of women who are creating a lot of problems in Ephesus based on their bad interpretations of the early chapters of Genesis almost every chapter 1st Timothy this problem is going to surface do what you have to do is look at the type of statements you have to look at the tone Barclays to a second criteria look at the tongue does he
 is it just like kind of feel calm about it is also quite a time to use a lot of different translations so interesting because I own I mean it's really hard to convey to town and written language yeah that's a good point here let me just finish the criteria as a whole. Then we can do more examples of frequency in one paragraph in the letter or does it this issue keep coming up and in 1st Timothy it's a good that's a great example because bad interpretations of the early chapters of Genesis keeps coming up throughout the letter specifically Genesis or the group of people associated with that bad Theology and there's a group of men in there's a group of women 1/4 criteria for Barclay is he says consistency this is interesting another words in some letters like in 1st Corinthians Paul is explicitly shifting topics topic to topic to topic about the matters that you wrote To Me
 and Chloe's people now about the matters of the spirit just what I've heard about you and the whole debate is is there one group or one you know type of person or theology Underneath It All it seems like it's there's a whole bunch of different things but for example in 1st Thessalonians there's a broad set of issues the Paul addresses but it does seem like you can tie it all together to one underlying problem which is people who are overzealous about predictions about the return of Jesus and I'm getting really fanatical and irresponsible with it and this really explains almost everything he has to address in the letter to interesting so consistency can I paint a picture of all of the different things that Paul has to address can I pay their, threats or come thread yep and then
 criterias what Barclay calls historical possibility is there anywhere else in the New Testament where I find that this same said issues with a problem is there anything in the posting to test era in the writings of the early church where we see this problem or this type of theology resurfacing Barclays has actually about 45 more criteria but I thought I found this really helpful yeah and this maybe we don't need to put this in the video this is like little bonus stuff for the podcast listeners but I found this so helpful to just be asking this question as I'm reading the letters is there a certain problem that keeps resurfacing the dressing what types of statements does he use to dress up and can I infer from that the bachelor language or the ology of the group that he has to do it again this is all about whether or not I can reconstruct what's happening situationally in these letters can I
 behind my shoulder you can see there's something in the mirror right in the side view mirror of your car got the letter you just read through that first left and there's some problems here the Peter Paul is addressing so if you want to do the safety look over your shoulder and be like I want to figure out a little more here what kind of question should I be asking that's where these criteria become helpful and so is his guard rails so that if if you come up with this hypothesis of like a whole I bet something's happening in the church and you can get him really specific then you go well as it historically plausible so other people that I've had this problem at all just kind of mentioned this one time and now building whole theory around it or is it something he keep coming back to over and over and see in Fancy
 is it the tone of his language does he sound angry and again that's hard and translations the or do they sound like there's urgency of this is definitely this is not intro Bible reading I wouldn't introduce this to people like at level 152 it is not like none of these are correct this would be what you were doing if you're having an intense conversation with anybody good listener being good listeners to the apostles so that we understand the situation that they're speaking into which can then help us get a bigger frame of reference for understanding what the whole letter might could be a book on marriage communication to
 yeah what kind of statement was that often do they make me statements this conversation all the time because sometimes one of us will make a statement that really is an assertion will make an assertion that there really is an accusation yeah right you know boy you slept in this morning and I can't you left me hanging for the boys breakfast and pack their lunch is today what's the deal you're right and that's a valid observation and accusations yes yeah exactly what's a good Romans then and then I actually thought we could tease out all the levels of the three levels of contact all three of you done so far
 he done it for Romans in some previous episode of kinda give me the can Fresh Start.
 Paul's letter to the Romans is the net worth of house churches people who live in in rum capital city of the dominant World Empire that because they are Roman citizens they actually the living room the living room and some of them are Roman citizens I think I've already mentioned this book in our conversation reading recent Book Realm is eating Romans backwards so so helpful and I'm going to actually Implement that in just a moment here but if I look in the first paragraph Paul gives a very clear portrait of where he sees himself in the grand biblical narrative paragraph in a previous episode he is an emissary who's announcing the good news the Apostle mean the possible and that's what you mean been if i m s a i d set apart for the good news when Romans 11 11 opening sentence of Romans he's introducing himself as somebody sent
 if I Jesus as an emissary whose life is given to announcing the good news what's the good news assertion about the Scots son who is A from the Lions David and also who was raised from the dead and declared by that act to be not just the son of David that the Son of God and he is Jesus Messiah our Lord and threw him we've received this gift of being his emissaries to summon all the nations to give their obedience to him through Facebook all Allegiance for his namesake and you know what you all are well I'm paraphrasing here paraphrasing ticket paraphrasing in your own translation on the Fly you could follow along with any translation and you can see what's happening yeah that's right here and then
 all of you who are in rum and you are also called I'm on God's holy people Grace and peace to you so are there you go we've talked about this at length earlier in the series yeah but this is this time for all the nations to first level of context what is happening in the whole story of job in the world that's right there is a cosmic King who is from the family of David Busters from family babraham but is also the Lord yeah the Son of God God second self become human and he is now yeah exalted up sitting at the right hand he's the Divine human image from Genesis one who now rules over all creation and this is spreading to the nation's news is spreading which was so how long to summon All Nations verse 52 believing obedience we're believing loyal allegiance to write
 this to a group of people living in the capital city of the Empire where the emperor lives summoning All Nations to give their loyal trusting allegiance to okay now we're going into the next level of context which is the cultural context of the Roman empire spread what you can't see us out through however it's addressed to wrong what is wrong for a man to have a little city interpretive interpret of reflection why would Paul see it as important to write a letter okay Paul didn't start the church in Rob we know this from the book of Acts and debate about who exactly planted and started it but we know it wasn't Paul so Paul is writing to network house churches us we're going to see by the end of the letter he knows a lot of people there but there's also a lot of people he doesn't know he's introducing himself so that's where he isn't in the biblical story
 and he's riding to followers of Jesus in the room so the next moment of cultural context what do we know about status of followers of Jesus in rum we know quite a lot actually if you go to Acts chapter 18 after Paul left Athens is open for sentences of Acts chapter 18 he went to Corinth and he found a manager named Aquilla who is a native of pontus but had recently come from Italy with his wife prisca Priscilla because Claudius the Roman Emperor had commanded all of the Jews to leave from Claudius expelled all the Jews from the city of Rome that's a big deal yep so what's that back story all about and this is actually crucial to the backstory of the letter to the Romans in 49 ad Claudius expelled juice from rum why did he do this
 well there's a handful of Roman historians who mentioned this was in 49 a.d. there's a historian named suit Aeneas pieces Claudius expelled from Rome
 the Jews who were constantly making disturbances at the instigation of a chrestus and then this is being quoted by another Roman historian named a Rose Dies and these are Messianic Jews correct there's some problem happening okay with Jewish people in relation to a Christus and it caused enough of a disturbance the Claudia said Jews out of here so the word Christus is spelled in Latin but almost certainly his title yeah the Thinkin in the book of Acts can I think of any time where Messianic Jews who follow Jesus or trying to spread the news about Jesus and their other Jews who are scandalized by it and the riots start and disturbances start oh yeah that's why it happens happens Paul's missionary Journeys so just imagine this then you have a community of
 Messianic Jews living in Rome there's disturbances about them related to social unrest Roman governors perceive it as social unrest so they expelled come out and take him out that's right I remember all the first generation followers of Jesus are Messianic Jews so let's say by 49 a.d. you've got network of churches in Rome summer going to be do summer not going to be too has been one day just yeah all the people in your house Church who are Jews as far as we can tell they had to leave let's see the Edict of Claudius I'm quoting from Robert to it his commentary on Romans after the Edict of Claudius was no longer enforced after his death in 54 the band Leader's apparently began moving back to Rum so in other words these Jewish Christians Messianic Jews
 how to be able to go back 5 years later but the house churches that they met when they returned we're no longer a very friendly place for them and here we move into the next layer of context the situation in context that makes sense I were moving through these layers here so we know from Romans sources and the book of Acts the backstory that the church got separated in terms of Jew and Gentile then when the Jews came back something happened that made Paul need to write the letter to the Romans now I feel like you're jumping ahead for for me a little bit and not so they come back and it could be that the house which is like great I'm so slow together back that's right let's pick up where we left but you're saying that's not what happened and you get that from the letter to the Romans the letter the Romans to self the state of the house churches that we see in Paul's letter to the Romans
 is that they are fractured along the ethnic divide of June onto how do you know this this is why Scott McKnight wrote the book reading Romans backwards so let's say let's just three drummers backwards quick skin Romans backwards and for the sake of time if you go to chapter 16 it's one of the chapters that I think modern readers tend to skip over here it's a bunch of greetings Green Thumb play artist kapelos aliens Rufus also his mother and mine and so on but if you really spend some time and if the storian to dig into what's going on here what you're able to reconstruct is about half a dozen house churches that he name is right here he name five different house churches or groups the names are all they're mostly Greek there are some Jewish and some Latin so we got the estimate here look at verse
 17 is Romans 16:17 now I urge you brothers and sisters keep your eye on anyone who causes dissension and hindrances contrary to the teachings that you learned and turn away from those people such men our slaves not of our Lord Jesus Messiah but of their own appetites by smooth flattering words they're deceiving the hearts of unsuspecting people in other words why did he write the letter to the Romans there's a group of people causing dissension and Division in the house churches that are ethnically diverse let's let's use Barclays maybe this is one statement that's right could be that don't cause divisions keep your eye on those who cause Division and don't associate with them this way says there's some group in Rome cuz he says these people are that the actual group
 I think the question is okay where else is it if I read runs backwards where else do I go to see Paul addressing with this division is in the church oh yes it's the previous two chapters chapters 14 and 15 so if we consider chapter 1415 Paul starts describing two groups in the house churches of he calls one group has two titles for these two groups the two groups and Romans 15 he calls one group calls them the powerful in verse 1 the Greek word doona toss the powerful be with me he says now we who are the donut has powerful we ought to Bear the weaknesses of those without power or you say we cuz he includes himself
 among this group has a powerful so we who are powerful should bear the weaknesses of those who have no power and we shouldn't just please ourselves going down I'm skipping down the R7 now we should welcome one another just as the Messiah welcomed you all to the glory of God what he saying in this paragraph is the Messiah made passed away so that non-jews could be incorporated in the family the Abraham so right now he did he paint it as in terms of like rank and power there's a group that has power and Status does a group that's without power and without status and the powerful should accept those without power if you go to chapter 14 he has different terminology for these two groups he calls one the week or the week in faith here I'll just read the opening lines Harris Romans 14 he says now you should accept the one who is
 weak in faith but not for the purposes of passing judgment on his opinions listen one person has faith that he can eat all kinds of food but the one who is the week will only eat vegetables the one who eats shouldn't regarded with contempt the one who doesn't eat the one who does eat should not pass judgment on the one who does eat for God has accepted him who are you that you should judge the servant of another
 to his own Master he stands or Falls and he will stand for the Lord is able to make him stand Force 5 one person might regard one day as more important than another another person in regards every day the same every person should be convinced his own mind so there's some division between two groups of people about food and they agreed that it's okay we're going very recognizable territory here of the June anju kosher food laws about being vegetarian oh yeah oh totally I think of Daniel chapter one but there's me you can eat and Kosher diet but if you're in a room where there non-kosher meat thing is not going to I'm not going to get any of this meat that oftentimes your Kosher diet require toxically makes you a vegetarian plant based diet
 to do is reconstruct care here I'm just going to call Scott McKnight who's this big part of his book he says so you free profile the whole book the week are Jewish Believers Messianic Jews who see themselves in the Stream of God's elect people they know and practice the Torah still probably attend synagogue but they are sitting in judgment on Gentiles especially the powerful of the Christian Community in Rome even though they these Jews passing judgment have no power status he's painting the whole profile here says you got Messianic Jews who were expelled by the emperor. But Paul puts himself in the category of a powerful and he's got to do is say yes it's a Jewish Believers and you profile them they see themselves as truly elect ones they known practice the Torah they probably still attend synagogue and they're sitting in judgment on Gentile
 Barclays criteria why else does he have to say let the one who is weak in faith with the one who chooses not to eat non-kosher food you should not pass judgment on those who will eat any kind of food so that say probation no don't do this thing with your people who are eating kosher and they're passing judgment on people who don't eat kosher you can see that in the rearview mirror then you have to look over your shoulder and begin to look at historical possibility elsewhere in the New Testament is this a thing I do yes so then I can start going into Glaceon through the book of Acts and this is the Jew Gentile Define so if I paint that whole picture stop giving the result now have all of his all of his own study he says the powerful are predominately Gentiles but I don't think his policies himself among the powerful does they believe in
 Jesus as Messiah they don't observe Torah as God's will for them and they have condescending and despising attitudes towards Jews especially Messianic Jews in Rome because they have a higher Superior social status they weren't there and rope around their non-jews who any of them are likely citizens and they weren't just recently expelled if you just got expelled for being in a certain area well sir you are a severe disadvantage of your Social rank got it so the tension between these back to Scott is not just a matter of theological difference that's how often this is painted as these are the chapters about debatable matters that's how I thought the chapter 4 but when he uses the phrase the doona toss and the Audrina tossed the powerful and then on to people without power those are social status terms
 essentially here's the way you know what are you get the goodies at the end of all of this work is that the letter to the Romans isn't an abstract The Odyssey lots of glass a justification it's a pastoral theology trying to unify a church across a divided ethnic line you what he goes through every section of letter and can show how is connected to that it's a dressing specifically that issue now he'll float above it and paint a larger Theology of justification and talked about what we said once you look at the situation of contacts that you can look through and see some grander theology yep that's right yeah man hit he has an exposition of Romans 12 and 13 which are famously this is in Chapter 13 races be subject to the governing Powers all of this
 hey your texts why does he have to say that we're barely ten years away from the Jewish war against Rome and Jerusalem Revolt is in the air would there be a good reason or would there be motivation for Jews in rum Messianic Jews in Rome who give their allegiance to King Jesus to say like just gives a the finger I'm going to give him my taxes have two cousins who are forming a militia down in Judea and they're going to declare war on him and I'll give them some Romans 13 is commanding the way of non-violence and listen but it's not like he's in love with Rome right now he's been beat up but he Paul has a different long game strategy for how to live under Roman occupation and it doesn't involve resistance than violent Revolt so he meant them to pay their
 so to me it a chapter like that seeing it in the context really helps because then I'll so it begins to help us see how we should and should not be quoting that passage in the service of certain agendas in our own day I think that's a whole other conversation but to me that's really where the stash is out this whole approach to reading the letters helps us is I want the way is that Roman speaks to the 21st century to be consistent with not just his words but with what he was doing was its words in the cultural and situation contacts and it requires a lot of thoughtfulness it's a kind of thoughtfulness that isn't always at work and how people quote from the New Testament letters today
I think my biggest a hot out of this whole conversation is that the glasses and while there is theology undergirding them that you can get to you get to it from an understanding of what these letters were dressing and then it takes a lot of discernment then to figure out okay now in my situation in context yeah that's right and my social contacts yeah we're arguably in the same part of the story of the name of the Bible that we are in the same point in the story as the apostles post resurrection and Ascension of Jesus disciples the for the new creation waiting for New Creation setting you and I do to everyone that has no one lives in the ancient Roman Empire in the world today people live under in Empires still
 yeah so there are some similarities yeah how do I take pulse the ology and then apply that to my contacts well its first realizing that Paul wasn't giving you his theology right out the back door and you actually have to then go will what's the context that he was speaking into and now through that lens what can I understand of his theology actually also to the lands of just his theology came from Jesus in the way of Jesus and then through the Hebrew scriptures and then now how do I apply that theology to my contacts and that is not as simple as God said it that settles it kind of reading of the New Testament yeah and if we opened this particular series on the letters I think the stakes are high in the section of the Bible because again they're so quotable it's easier to take
 send out of contact statement contacts than many other parts of the Bible and so I think it really pays off to develop a thoughtful set of reading skills for how to make sense of these letters I think one of the fears of people have is that if you don't just go pay the Bible says it let's take it face value and then apply that thing then you get in the murky Waters and then whose interpretation is Right shirt and then my whole thing falls apart sure I've heard that three Checker beta but that's it that's an extreme but there's there's a sense of the way that you're walking through know there's guardrails layers of context and in this guard rails within how to make sure you're doing this in a way that it has an identity because the face value meaning of Paul's words for example to a 21st century America and reading
 an English like the assumption is what it means to me in English living in Portland is of course it's natural basic meaning and I think I'm trying to poke at that assumption if you like why do I assume that the first thing that occurs to me reading Paul's letter in English is what God means for all people of all time on FaceTime I should give this way more thought yeah and invest in a set of responsible reading skills to understand what Paul is doing so that I can understand what the spirit is saying through Paul's letter to the churches and other contacts and I hope we do the same with want to work with Jesus himself but communication is a lot of work it is understanding someone else communication is a lot of work and these letters were not written to us but God gave them for us for us that's a line that I first heard from the Hebrew Bible scholar John Walton
 how to take some unpacking but as a one-liner I think it gets a really important point across it was not written to me but they're provided for us but through God's wisdom and the work of the spirit it is for me just as a member of the body of Christ and the skillset that we're developing of reading these carefully and doing detective work it is very active participation that then needs to also be in step with God's spirit and a community and a community community of other readers who are also thought which made me the translation that you are using that was a community of people but also the people you're living life with every translation is a product of the community of people reading trying to understand these texts and your own Church community and speaking to you John Deere mower
 we began this conversation in Texas that is also a community of reading and interpretation released it you know they can become one that can help help give guidance to what spirit is saying and what a great skill to develop not just for reading the New Testament letters but we're just living life in our contacts movement sex in your city or your cultural setting what is the spirit up to what's the right thing for you to be doing there is no letter written to you but the spirit is written to you right now you speaking to us but the skills that we developed by reading this way transfer over to how we this is missionary correspondence and yeah I think the most responsible real
 and responses to these letters will be new insights new discoveries about our own cultural context and how we engage them with the good news based on what we learn from this ancient missionary correspondence text we still are going to talk about one more level of contacts correct and if I understand correctly it's just the fact that the letters have a flow in a logic to them that you can understand and so that'll be that'll be our final phone call this literary context literary learning to read each letter from beginning to end as a coherent flow thought other exciting world of things to talk about. You listening to this episode of Bible project podcast you're interested in submitting a question for our question response episode on the letters we love to hear from you you can record yourself asking

 anywhere discussion on the other voices in the room when Paul was riding his letters throughout history readers of the New Testament letters have tended to take their experience and practice of writing a letter that they've been taught and their culture and assumed that's what the apostles were doing when you think of Paul riding one of the letters at least modern westerners tend to do is Imagine Paul sitting by himself may be in a study or a room where he has like privacy if any is producing a single unedited draft that he's got to get out the door or Paul he's pacing the room talkin does a scribe you know secretary getting it all down but still single draft out the door closed so that's a mental image Paul did not have a study he was the traveling missionary to imagine a scenario where the most likely place where you would have room to work in would never be a private place it would be in guest rooms and pins and rest stops
 you would have space for Paul and Barnabas and Timothy to get together and be like dude I need to send a letter to class a fear of the issues these are things I've taught them in the past here's what I want to say and that's these letters could have been in the making over the course of weeks and months then multiple steps Today Show is produced by Dan g o r show notes come from Camden McAfee work on finding a profit in Portland Oregon and we make free resources because of the generous support of so many people around the world just like you thank you for being a part of this with us this is Renee I'm from Virginia I first heard about the Bible project through dang gone them
 to my wonderful cousin Bree on my favorite thing about the Bible project is the book that he got my son m.j. so it's called the read scripture book and if you haven't heard about it check it out on the website your kids will love it we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus wear a crowdfunding project my people like me find free videos study notes podcast and more at the Bible project.
