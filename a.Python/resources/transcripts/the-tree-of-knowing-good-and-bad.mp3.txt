hey this is John at the Bible project in today on the podcast we're going to continue a conversation on how to read the wisdom books in the Bible Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of songs and Joe and like we tend to do refers to spending a lot of time in Genesis 1 through 33 is crucial for grasping why the books of Solomon are what they are in the garden are two trees the Tree of Life With God wants us to eat us and also the tree of the knowledge of good and evil witch if we eat of we will die today we're going to talk about that second Tree in 10 points out that calling it The Tree of Good and Evil is problematic evil in English it pretty much never really connected to moral evil or essential evil and the Hebrew word raw is not evil loads into much cost
 moral meaning if you look at other places in the Hebrew scriptures where that phrase the knowledge of good and bad on Hebrew the knowledge of toe Vandross you'll notice this phrase a way of talking about how mature adult human with discernment between good and bad so in other words Adam and Eve are depicted as being in their moral intensely meaning of the trees are just about whether we will choose evil it's about how we're going to learn wisdom so that we can rule the world with God because he's called a child the roof so the tree represents a choice about two different ways of learning what is Tobin rotten I can take it for myself because it's good in my eyes can happen or hands-off I will allow God in his own time to give me the knowledge of Television Ross sewed thanks for
 bring us here we go
Burger King continue our conversation about the book in the Bible that were calling the wisdom literature which I just learned from you is a modern contract but there's something about these books as a related to wisdom and to Solomon that it's important to understand that the entire Hebrew scriptures is intended for us to find wisdom and is actually called wisdom literature within someone a Hebrew Bible itself yeah and Psalm 119 the whole heap Revival is wisdom of torture it is so important because the whole setup to the story the Bible is is humans trying to decide how they're going to get humans on a quest for what does the provider and definer of what is good and then humans are given a responsibility that right also requires them to have with them about Good and Evil
 what kind of wisdom and what's the best line of that wisdom and how will they get it that's the drama but we need wisdom we need to listen and not just because our lives would be better because we have this calling yes that's right to rule with God that's right and how you going to do that humans are given the responsibility to Bear God's image and to rule it Steward creation on the Creator's behalf that requires decision-making yes and to make decisions you need wisdom how to evaluate in way factors on either side of a decision here but the question is what's your Baseline different metaphor what's your true north on your compass what defines true wisdom and how do you attain that wisdom I think a lot of people will want a guidebook
 a set of rules that's kind of the cleanest way to know what to do when you have a good and bad and in a way in the story The Bible God does give a bunch of laws rules to a people and so it's kind of easy to start thinking like okay well then that's how you get wisdom cuz you just fine though I Divine rule book and adhere to it with your own grit and what does narrative is going to put in front of us is that even when humans get very specific rules and directives from God himself they still prove themselves unable to live by Troopers come because it's not just following a rule the deeper set of issues has are my motives and long-term abbottson character formation you know you can obey rules that are really bad motives would be amazing if you had like an app where like it is any given moment
 because I opened it up and it and it tells you the next right thing to do that sounds terrible
 it is a bit of a dystopia that is a little bit my phone does for me it just does it for things that I don't care about you in there I've given it the responsibility to tell me where to go yeah like Maps lake maps yeah like you don't you don't think about where to turn anymore you let that you let the computer algorithm inside that for you I made a decision that I'm going to focus on other decisions directional guidance to the computer in my visit a tangent but like as a machine-learning Gibson more more advanced we will offload more and more decision that we don't want to make this right I think we have but who decides what can be decided by an algorithm and what should be decided by a human It All We would say has more oil capacities
 grow into Divine like wisdom so that their will and decisions imitate ultimate goodness and wisdom doesn't know I know if this is true Partners so that our Wills are aligned and you don't have to be me and I don't have to be a we can exist as two others in the world who's Will's are aligned but yet I haven't assimilated you into me we can have a unified will that moves the world forward but both exist in our uniqueness and other vest the depiction of God's Will and design for the world on page one and then that's imitated by the human that the humans are one species of humanity but yet they are also consists of others the two and then they are one but also more than one and then nuts explored in the imagery of male and female and and
 until the two become one with no other thing but but it's connected with God wants humans to become wise and to rule the world well on his behalf to create more of the garden that he that he first provided and that's the image of eating from the Tree of Life correct if not I kind of imagine it's like you take one bite here at your set like I Got The Magic Tree of Life Chapel in my belly and now I can live forever yeah well at to be in the garden and got the present ruling with him forever eating from the Tree of Life that's like one package India but that is it's a fragile condition it can be compromised they can be lost all even just on one choice they can all go terribly wrong so rude and who doesn't know that's why it man that's life that's the Eden story is very much trying to connect and the in tune with the way that we experienced life yeah which makes it
 so difficult to imagine what new creation really could be like yeah totally sure so I can because of the fragility I just mention like how easy would it be to screw things up and how can you how can creation get to a place when we stopped doing that yeah yeah yeah yeah well but if you have creatures who have become one with our creator so that his life presents inhabits them the board and the other boys different the Borg is everything gets assimilated into the one that's now a universe of others but that our one true love for one another now we're talking the biblical story line and love doesn't erase the identity of the other it allows them to exist in their uniqueness but it also acts in a way that will sacrificially find a way so that our Wills can be unified in mutual honor
 now we're talkin that's wisdom wisdom is finding that way so in the Garden of Eden this Garden is Eden state is fragile that's the whole point so how it starts cuz God gives the humans a choice he puts them in this Garden loaded with goodness the gods provided by his wisdom you have the two who are one there humans aren't making power plays on each other they both ruling like kings and queens there naked they're vulnerable everything is no nothing is hidden no one is hiding everything's open and everything is received in my life that mean it's right at the same time there exploring and they're still dating and creating correct it's easy for my mind to slip into some sort of like boring Utopia where they are and work is what God told them to do in the garden to care for it and I still imagine there's a
 prizes and disappointments and yet all these things it's not like you never experienced something on comfortable yeah it's just everyone is loving each other and there's wisdom so part of that good setup is in Genesis 2 verse 9 out of the ground and the Lord God cause to grow every tree that is good to the eyes than good for food the tree of life was also in the middle of the garden and the tree of knowing toes and raw good and bad so first the whole garden is full of goodness that's Genesis wine variety variety of goodness the tree of life is there that's got God's providing are the Pinnacle of the that's right but then last thing to be mentioned, the most traumatic thing knowing good and the first time the word is used
 okay I've made a significant development and how I talk about the word Rah that I want to talk about with you cuz I think I found a great English word or at least I think yes I think the English word bad actually does better in English what the Hebrew word raw does and he brought back good and bad in English the tree of good and bad the truth yes dude this sounds really silly right now but it will help us instead of the word evil and English is pretty much never really connected to moral evil more essential evil and Hebrew word raw is not the word good books on good and so good in English and mean moral goodness why can hair really good in a way that corresponds to a cosmic principle of goodness but good so we can get it down a few levels to just me and
 Lake Pleasant or enjoyable it's got a wide range of the great that was a good milkshake cosmically right you know it's just like if I enjoyed it I brought me pleasure was beneficial well that was a good smoothie with all my vitamins fruits and vegetables for the day so Toth has the same refer to moral goodness that corresponds to God's character and wisdom or I can describe it more beneficial can be used in a moral sense the opposite of what we went out to eat or we would say evil but Rock and also mean unpleasant harmful or just some examples and you're saying that situation evil evil dead she might punch two evil give evil loads into much Cosmic moral meaning he's a bad person
 that was a bad decision really bad but also like I was a bad burrito I was a bad burrito go to bed so I'm on like the let's start a movement over the tree of knowing good and bad it's it's worth the perfect we've got we've we've got a lot of history to do then. Give me a little while with this video has a dream he says the Lord showed me two baskets of figs one basket had very Tove figs the other basket had raw figs they were so raw that they could not be eaten they were morally evil figs
 the rotten egg they taste bad whatever they're bad cold and raw good and bad yep there's a proverb about having a rotten tooth a tooth that is raw Mina Rogers would be wrong with it be called Rock in Proverbs 25:19 Solomon when he becomes king in a time of Peace he says God has given me rest on every side there is no enemy and there is no raw mean there's no evil there's no enemy there's no Rah there's nothing bad there's no catastrophes or no famines there's no bad guys have to get me so raw this means harmful harmful situations not beneficial not beneficial
 be used to refer to moral evil in Psalm 140 the poet says Rescue Me O Lord from raw people preserve me from the violent man who devises right in his heart so that people. Let's give a moral agent is raw then it becomes of moral that's right and moral issue that's good maybe that's a big is not a moral age that a person is raw it's evil. Evil is a fig is raw it's just been a bad and not evil if you say if you like if your body was broken and semi you might be bad person can do raw and the doing of Rob will refer to just a harmful harmful act in a bad act and act that brings harm when were there I'm more comfortable using the word evil okay okay then did check this out.
 does raw God what says Jeremiah 18 at one moment I might speak can turn it to concerning a nation or a kingdom to uproot it to pull it down to destroy it if that Nation against which I have spoken if they turn from their raw from the bed they're evil but they're evil their evil if they turn from their moral evil I will relent concerning the raw that I plan to bring upon it so it's God's are evil so what is the raw to pull it down to destroy it and approve it catastrophe Kingdom falling which we would say is is a bad thing it's a bad is bad for the people who are unbeneficial unpleasant harmful distractive distractive but not all destructive anything or evil is morally evil here at least from the perspective of the biblical authors from the perspective of Jeremiah God spoke to do
 raw to Jerusalem by allowing Babylon to come to understand that it's not always able to destroy something it's not a remodel a house you going to do something that someone might experience as raw might from another person's perspective be the exact right thing to do but the good thing to do is the passages where God does raw when Saul King saw a disqualifies himself to be the king of Israel the narrator says God sent a Ross beer and that's right to torment saw often that's usually true that evil spirits harmful I'm amazed he starts to go mad to come at it from a power complex and he's so jealous to guard his own seat of power at 4 many rivals the girls to go mad mad from a power complex is a bad spirit is a roster
 yeah that's right and so it usually gets translated God sent an evil spirit and how many times someone read that and then come to me a crisis like what does he serve evil spirits cuz I'm imagining like a demon at that point but it is a portrait of God that we have to reckon with in the Bible that he will allow or do raw ring about what is destructive for people who do raw for people who do Evil 4 PS4 evil people God will deal with them by doing raw by bringing them down the knowledge of good and bad is not just a only do good because there might be situations where you need to do something that that is tear something down or is to some people feels bad
okay so it's the first. First step is what toven rawr Second Step the phrase knowing toe than wrong and knowing it the Strays appears four times in the Hebrew Bible one of them is the tree here's the other three Deuteronomy chapter 1 Moses says your children your little ones your son's who today do not know tow van draw are going to go into the land so it's snowing toven Rah is a way of talking about a mature adult human with discernment between good and bad 1st Kings 3 Solomon says I am but a little child I don't know how to rule these people for how to discern between toe Vandross So that's what you praise God for wisdom and then and Isaiah 7 the child will eat curds and honey at the time around the time that he knows to refuse raw and choose
 for the boy will know to refuse raw and choose toes at a certain age all three cases it describes children who are yet to mature into a knowledge of toes and Solomon wasn't it into its actual children in one in this it's an adult who's confessing that he is is a like a like a child so what does it mean that to have the first humans that the humans in the garden and they've just been given great responsibility to rule their in their infancy yes they are depicted as children who are yet to mature and so nobody I was picture Adam and Eve like in their late thirties or forties Dawson had his picture of them like 14 or something right like it's like whoa I don't think this is about their age I'm just saying
 Adam and Eve I mean the most of Western art history there white Europeans as being in their moral infancy and of course if we're going to rule the world they're going to have to have wisdom so that what the tree represents is not whether or not they're going to gain knowledge of Tarzan rotten they have to have that we must have that we talked about that but we talked about in terms of just an assumption yeah they're going to rule but you're actually bringing even more of a case saying look at how this phrase is use phrases used about growing into a moral attitude correct that's right cuz member you can be wise but in your own eyes every human and that's perceptive and using their brand has wisdom can become wise question is how will you become wise and what's your Baseline for defining what is the Weis in the gut
 the tree represents a choice about two different ways of learning what is stove in raw I can take it for myself because it's good in my eyes is what can happen or I made from or hands-off I will allow God in his own time to give me the the knowledge of Television raw now that I'm going to allow God to do it that's not explicitly don't talk about but it it's implied The Knowing of good and describes children who will mature there's a choice in front of them and then he says don't take it for yourselves the assumption is that God's going to make them wise they have to take it to his gun and he just said they're going to rule the world okay so from that from their calling as co-rulers then I infer infer that God is going to give them wisdom because they're being described
 as children God that he's called a child to rule children to rule the world and then when we get to the tree we're supposed to see that as an alternative that's right to this assumption which is just hanging out with God and he will give you a I'll give you wisdom what are they doing on there when the wind of God comes just give me when the voice of the Lord comes to walk in the garden at the in the windy time of the day are they what are they doing they doing such a what is that about right at the moment they take from the tree it's as if God shows up for the daily walk and this time they're hiding instead of being vulnerable and open to him who I think we are meant to infer that the tree represents a choice about how wisdom will be attended by these children will they take it for
 cells based on what is good in their own eyes or will they receive it as a gift from God we had the conversation before about the location of this tree because the tree of life is said to be in the center of the garden and also the retrieve know and also there together yeah yeah it's clear in Hebrew means right yeah all these good trees tree of life was in the middle of the garden and also the tree of knowing covid Rock good choice that's there even when you're in the midst of the garden eating of the Tree of Life look over your shoulder and there's the choice so as The Story Goes On then you have the story about tragically the one who is provided as the A's are the Hebrew word for help and it means lack of
 dispensable salvation it's the one who's provided essential other yeah to save as The Rescuer and help her of the man ends up being the first one of the two they both end up being to see if you didn't eat and eating but she is the one targeted and she's the one into getting this wall get is all relevant for the wisdom of torture how men and women relate in the big theme in the wisdom books and the song of songs and it's all keyed off of Adam and Eve in the garden so Genesis 3 Verse 6 when the woman saw when the woman saw that the phrase when somebody sees that God did that seven times Genesis one God saw that it was good now it's the first time a human is seeing that human in value waiting and what she sees is that the tree of knowing good and bad was good God saw that it was good and you get eaten
 the woman saw that something's good now she's about her waiting she saw that it was good and it was beautiful to the eyes it was beautiful in her eyes and the tree was desirable that's a Hamid does the word for covet with Covetous I want that it was desirable to make one wise I could I could have wisdom I could take this wisdom for myself it's beautiful I want it God God said don't, it will kill you but it's beautiful so when she says it's good it was beautiful she's correct that it's good of this looks beneficial to me this looks like a good thing and not only that she's exercising your own wisdom that's even before she eats of the tree she's exercising
 knowledge of good and bad but there's a difference between having the inside of your own wisdom and then acting on it I seem right because like she could be like, in my own eyes that seems good match and then she could go but God said and I can see but then the next raise it was beautiful in her eyes and she desired it so it's not just the evaluate that is good the next step of motive and impulse and I want it I want it I want it even there that's not necessarily no no it's not wrong but I want the thing that God told me he is going to kill me and then you're at the Crux of the choice your Crocs in the choice what am I going to do by the fear of the Lord would be to say that looks good and I want to watch it but I trust God's wisdom that says this is going to kill me
 so I will not take it and she does the opposite she sees it that this looks beneficial to me I want it because having this will be the beginning of me exercising my own moral judgments my path to becoming wise yeah it's it's it's it's desirable to make one wise and then she took me to be slowed down so I guess maybe when I was trying to parse that out the knowledge of Good and Evil isn't the ability to discern Good and Evil on your own terms because she was able to do that without taking of it is actually it's the decision that that I'm going to be the way I live it's more than just knowing good from Evil and this is where the English word know it's more mental yeah mentally oriented whereas the Hebrew word know is experientially oriented Genesis for Adam knew his
 Steve and you became pregnant yet so it's about experiencing
so you're going to say there's all these bits to it well it's just it's the sequence she saw that it's good she's evaluating you can evaluate things is good and bad and not do anything about them right but your help you can't help with you that all the time so that's not bad enough stuff but she saw that is good second step and it's beautiful attractive it's not only beneficial it's attractive which is another thing that you have very little control over what you see is a chance will you find attractive third step third step I want it I want it to be mine because that will give me in the face wisdom so desire desire now evaluation you said that word for The Hobbit is a very morally charged word it is desire to me is a morally
 covet you're making an evaluation on the desire that usually this wrong but it's the same word used in one of the Ten Commandments yeah don't covet your neighbor's house or proper don't have that desire or or is it is it more as it don't act on the desire well the tree is desirable yeah I want the tree is it natural when you see something that's desirable, beautiful isn't that natural or is that something that we actually can untrain or like I'm not how I think the idea is to retrain so ideally she would look at that tree see that it's good noticed that it's beautiful and then desire that's okay I don't want it and then say but God said it will kill me so I trust that even though I desire it it's okay it actually is not the thing that I should desire okay cuz it will kill me
 what are the steps is morally neutral but in the Ten Commandments coveting is not morally neutral don't do it oh I understand well I suppose it doesn't say don't take your neighbor's house yet and Donkey it says don't desire them I guess the Assumption being if you given the Foster that desire you'll eventually take it but it seems like as a difference between automatic Desiring and the perpetuating of that Desiring in your own heart you know like that's rent a like noticing I want that and then relishing that deciding like I'm in cultivating it is when you're like cultivating it where desire is just like that it's parked Within Me Something I see an English the words are separated that way and Hebrew it's one word one word that has that range of meeting okay so in the Ten Commandments talking specifically about the cult of it it's not trying to say like don't have desire
 search for things that aren't yours is there is an analog to this in Jesus points this out in The Sermon on the Mount Airy says you know you've heard that it said don't commit adultery Commandments and then he says but I say to you anyone who looks at a woman with lust has committed adultery in his heart he discerns between noticing someone that's desirable and then actually feeding the desire and yeah allowing it to to grow okay so the whole point is that the first failed Human Action is described as a misguided quest for wisdom and foreknowledge of the good in the bath and so that sets the tone for the whole story then because this miss this misappropriated wisdom is ghastly going to lead to Exile and death
 and it's the first thing of the narrative the woman then she takes she gives to her husband he eats then the first thing to do their eyes were opened my eyes were opened and they realized that their Autumn the word play cuz I Rim could mean like a shrewd and clever but it's also had the word for naked the serpent was our room and I ended up with the humans realizing they are all room but a different different kind of all right and the first thing they do then is provide covering for them for their naked bodies is the first thing to do is hide their bodies from each other so this knowledge ends up dividing them to wear one they were naked no shame the moment that I take it upon myself to be the one by my wisdom to know good and bad it's just all the sudden there is division between us is your knowledge
 good dad might be a little different than mine here so I don't want you I don't want to talk to you am I safe with you it's fascinating consequence is division between him and then they hide from God had for each other they hide from God God says where are you the man says well you know I heard you in the garden and I was afraid I had feared I had fear of you the first time the word fear Pierce but it's fear that did not look at it see how to get CS it didn't keep them from making the decision the fear that they have is now fear of God because I was charging it. I just did the wrong and think the exact thing you asked me not to do it so it's the sad fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord that doesn't lead life it's the fear of the Lord that results from the Soviets who told you that you're naked he says I had cuz I was naked who told you that your neck or did you have that category have you eaten from the tree
 I commanded you sang Don't eat from it then the the man says the woman the woman says take now you have two rolls for Eve now version of it was salvation for the man goodness life multiplication but now you have this eve the he's who did what was wise in your own eyes and this eve Kaka problem and so what he does as he blames their he says the woman that you gave to me she gave to me from the tree and then he speaks to the woman what is this you've done the snake the snake she blames he deceived me so the whole thing falls apart and it's a division between man and woman there's an ideal he's the wise Eve could have led to life and now you have the foolish it is you that tempted to death that leads to death these are fundamental images for the Book of Proverbs yeah and so you walk out of the garden
 hell yeah yeah so and then it all of Exile death the whole thing falls out of this and the rest of Book of Genesis is people doing what is wise in their own eyes and hurting each other you know generation after Generation Z walk away from the Eden narrative saying that humans are ever going to be restored to the Eden ideal it will be like Humanity being reunited with the ID leave that God provided back in the garden without this is where the woman becomes not not a woman but more of an yeah she becomes a personification of God's wisdom to become a well in the Book of Proverbs yeah so we'll get there when we talk about problems but the point is I when I I walk away from the Eden story going man if we're ever going to recover that we're going to need humans who can submit to God's wisdom not take and to find wisdom by their desires but Define it by God's wisdom and command going to result in
 a man and woman not power leveraging over each other one will be for your husband is in the curses and Jen Story of Genesis 3 your desire will be for your husband but he will rule over you it's the opposite of Genesis 1 which is male and female together ruling now you have mail drooling over female it's it's the opposite of Genesis 1 what's in the news our desire again and that weird desires to different word for desire, just extremely rare word that is going to appear again one time in the song song crucial your desire will be to your husband that has led to a lot of yes
 hide from each other once they can't trust each other then the man will rule over the women and that's portray it as the opposite of God's intention yeah it's a yes it's a sad consequence of the division between Adam and Eve now and why did that division happen because they did what was wise in their own eyes
so they go that's the first step in understanding how the wisdom literature functions in the Old Testament is the wisdom literature is going to take that story and make it a paradigm for every human being if thinking through on a daily basis in the grip of it all how do we live in God's wisdom and eat of the Tree of Life versus eating live in the fear of the Lord kind of fear of the Lord that Adam had after that when God showed up not the kind of fear I want that's what you want that that fear but before you make sure but before that will prevent me from doing was wise in my own eyes that's right yeah yeah totally and that phrase is very loaded it's a hard phrase yeah but think the fear that Adam has when God shows up its
 fear he expects judgement the day you eat of it you'll die God shows up in Stormwind immediately after and he is afraid what does God not do them he doesn't kill them Grace yes he not only does he not kill them he provides for them
 I guess I'm skinny yeah gives them that it closed so that's meant to catch your attention God said the day you eat of it you'll die God shows up after they eat of it and they don't die instead he gives him again so it seems like a god you really are some ways you should fear but another ways yes he's way more merciful than you expected him today doesn't mean not to fear him know but it does mean you don't be afraid of him yeah and think if what if I were to have that kind of fear before taking from the tray that's a different kind of fear because it's not the fear of like well if I do it he'll kill me. It's more of the fear and this is where are English translations I think helped us was words like I don't know I mean respect our reverence reverence is maybe better reverence reverence has a bit of a tinge of beer in it right
 take it and then I decide not to take it out of for fear of the Lord so question is what am I feeling drained consequences but also I'm fearing the one who provided all of this goodness for me your fearing the loss of the bat navigation shifts right I have reverence for that one cuz he is the wisest all-powerful provider of what is good so I don't just fear him I've also fear the consequences of doing something he said not to do cuz I I fear the consequences I do everything in sight where you mention how God acts so mercifully it's we don't fear God because he's bad with your God because he's good I think is what kind of what we were you were saying it's a surprise in the story is as the day you eat of it you'll die but everything is God is good
 and so why would he fear God and then moment if there's nothing except for the potential consequence did say the day you either you'll die during that we are the tree here you come I'm going to die but looking back everything got done is good and there is a sense of I don't want to lose that I want to be in a relationship with the one who rides good and there's a reverence for that and then there's a surprise twist which is God is even better than you thought yeah that's right he doesn't kill you he doesn't kill them and gives them a gift but then he exiled them there is cause for the realm of death where they will eventually die but he's more merciful than he sounded long-suffering is more merciful than he sounded when you gave the command which is the only diesel died today either so yeah man who wants to 3 is crucial for
 grasping why the books of Solomon are what they are but to take on board why is these three of the wisdom books Proverbs Ecclesiastes and song of songs no so I'm just making fun songs into a wisdom book now that you'll see it is what it is one why Soloman is attached so the next step is to just just a quick overview of Solomon story because it's designed as an elaborate a reenactment of the Garden of Eden story his story is there's a little sentence at the beginning of Proverbs Ecclesiastes and songs songs that connects it to Solomon in some way a hyperlink in the Solomon but the Solomon Stewart cybermass of hike back to the Garden that's what those little opening sentences are doing the Proverbs time at all together to the story of Solomon back to the Garden wrapping it all up these books are all exploring it what does it mean for human yes to gain wisdom tooth
 my guys with them how do you live by God's wisdom what are the implications of it. So here it is Proverbs how to live by God's wisdom and when you do you will find yourself reunited with the ID leave lady was in a way that leads to eternal life Proverbs Ecclesiastes comes along and says that may be true on a theoretical level but when we live outside the garden Under the Sun in the land of Exile you can just have to settle for hoping for the best because even if you Embrace lady with them you're not exempt from the conditions that we all have to live under your outside the garden and then the song of songs is a poetic reenactment of the drama of being reunited with tidy leaf and Lady wisdom in the final scene of the song of songs is the lover in the Beloved being united under a tree
 an eternal love that overcomes Death final paragraph has the song sounds so good so that's where we listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast next week we're going to continue this conversation on how to read the wisdom books we won't get into the wisdom books yet but will get to Solomon the man who is connected to all the wisdom books will look at his story and how he is replaying the garden story and how he gets so close to filling the test of choosing God's wisdom over his own he's a very complex character one simple ways to say is he's presented with two sides so I can Jekyll and Hyde welcome to the story of Solomon Today Show was produced by Daniel Gumble the music by the band tents the Bible project is a non-profit we're in Portland Oregon we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus via videos this podcast
