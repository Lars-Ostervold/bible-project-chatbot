Play Welcome to Bible project podcast on John and I'm Tim and today on the podcast we get to do an interview with dr. Amy peeler Amy is the professor of New Testament at Wheaton College she's done our research and the water published work on the way to the Hebrews which as it turns out has a lot to say about the royal priesthood and Jesus as high priest in milk is it at all the stuff we've been talking about in our series on royal priesthood Amy has a dissertation and that you can get paperback it called you are my son family of God in the epistle to keep this but there's also a more popular level book that she has an introduction and study guide to Hebrews Ten school series called TNT Clark study guides the New Testament inexpensive will paperbacks little kind of walk you through almost like a condensed commentary flagging kind of info
 interpretive issues as you read through the book so yeah it's great really she's super-smart really articulate and has some great Insight I have two different
all right Amy peeler welcome to the podcast good to talk with you on the number of other podcast interviews about your work in Hebrews in early trinitarian theology in the New Testament I forget where I first heard an interview but I was somewhere within last year and then your dissertation was available as a cheap paperback so that's always great when they're not $100. I really enjoyed it and since we just are finishing this interview is going to be part of a conversation with John and I are having about the royal priesthood throughout the story The Bible and then obviously Hebrews is going to play a significant role so you came to mind and I'm excited that you're here to talk with us thank you for the opportunity love to talk about Hebrews any chance I get
 which is just a bit of your story maybe where you're from and your face background but also how you ended up in biblical studies it's a unique career trajectory and what are you up to know so I did grow up in a Christian home and for that I'm incredibly grateful my mom was Pentecostal and my dad was Methodist and they compromised and became Baptist met in the middle so I grew up in Oklahoma City and if you know much about Oklahoma really Baptist is the dominant option so it wasn't too surprising maybe that that's where they landed and I was very involved in church love my church made a profession of Faith at a young age and then really solidified that in my teen years so very kind of common trajectory I think for someone in my with my upbringing I went to Oklahoma Baptist University and had an incredibly fantastic experience there I entered as a Psychology major wanted to go to counseling is that the way that I was headed but as a junior I took some electives
 biblical studies Life of Christ and Greek those professors were very popular and so we were encouraged to take classes with them Professor was so popular he could get students who were in The Greek to start taking Greek he is amazing absolutely and our professors there weren't widely published because it's a very heavy teaching school but they were so formative in my life in the life of many others so it was probably within the first week or two of that semester and I was a junior that I said oh my goodness this is what I want to do with my life so I went and had a chat with both of them and became a double major at that point and I wasn't quite able to squeeze in my last psychology class as spring semester of my senior year so I didn't quite end up with a double major but I was closed so that's where the joy
 started I did not quite know where it would take me but I knew that I loved studying scripture in an academic way I was very spiritually attuned a young person my mom is a teacher and she's an awesome teacher teaches high school math so it's like putting together a things that I'd always loved education and my face and I'm like you can do both at the same time find me up that's great so you are you went from there you ended up at Princeton for a couple degrees. Right and then you end up getting your dissertation in Oklahoma City in Baptist Life as a 22 year old go straight to the east coast and to a Mainline Seminary I missed home the first semester and my horizons were stretched but I came to deeply love and appreciate Princeton and that's the only one I wanted to stay on I had met Russ Wagner and knew that working with him and the other New Testament faculty at Beverly give
 George Pryce any question black that they would be great mentors as I moved into the field of New Testament studies so ended up spending eight years there and so that was basically r20s AR because my husband and I married in college so we went together to do our degrees he's a musician and got his degrees in church music while you were there still we became East Coasters in a lot of ways because we kind of became ourselves as young adults that are in Princeton so all those programs you hit on the letter to the Hebrews and you'd be stuck to it I mean dissertations the kind of thing where you have the seed interest then you have the excitement phase and then you have the goodness to keep working so but you did all that was Hebrews what are the seeds of this project may be dispersed so you know you published a book that was your dissertation but I'm guessing there's a whole history of what interested you
 about Hebrews I'm always interested to get that before we dive into the ideas in the book cuz it's fun to see how things began I was definitely one of those at church young people who came to Hebrews ten Hebrews 12 the warning passages if you send willfully there no one remains a sacrifice for sins and I was like me because I have send willfully and so it's all over and so I really I I can say that with levity now but at the time it was very intense for me and that was some of the first wrestling play some of the first exegetical exercises even though I wouldn't have known that word so Hebrews had always grabbed my attention at this incredibly powerful even daunting book when I entered the PHD you do have to kind of declare are you a Jesus person or a people person yes I love the Lord Jesus Christ but I knew right away that I wanted to do the
 kizl's I found the Epistles so full of Rich theology that I wanted to go in that direction but then it wasn't until later that I surveyed the field and realized there's a lot of people who do Paul I wasn't confident that I had something fresh to contribute but I had remained Tethered to an interested in Hebrews and I believe that that letter which was so influential in the Theology of the church and it wasn't very crowded it felt like it's a place where I could stuck into they had just formed a group at the Society of biblical literature or reformed it two or three years when I was into my program a new kind of fresh ideas are being done in the paper on the use of exit is 24 in Hebrews 9 in one of our theology classes and from many people that paper became their dissertation and that ended up being true for me
 my son family of God in the epistle to the Hebrews putting a number of tools to work but all along the lines of an argument so quotations from the Greek Old Testament and how the author does that plays a big role but also these other things of father-son language but also the Priestly rolls if you have like the elevator description you think you're going up to the 14th floor how do you summarize what the projects about what you were trying to clarify I was taking a class on classical rhetoric and the first century world and learning the importance of pathos ethos and logos switch 10e many of your listeners will be familiar with this as a very intense argument lots of log off but the ethos of the author is rather hidden right this is a classic thing about Hebrews we don't know who wrote it and what's really unique is the way in which this author puts four words
 scripture instead of Paul who tends to say that which has been written this author introduced his scripture is that which is spoken and the person who does the speaking is God and so it struck me that in a context in which speech mattered so much and persuasive speech was really the epitome of societal power this author said I'm not going to say anything about myself so that I'm going to leave you guessing for Millennia but I want you to hear the voice of God speak and so it really is the character of God that's being constructed and that's when I started I started to study those quotations what kind of character of God is disclosed and what I realized at is that at the very beginning the first kind of image that we get is God as father and I ran with that I realized it in Hebrew scholarship family seems had been dismissed because God is only called father twice chapter 1 and chapter 12
 but I believe that those bookends were quite important and so basically than the summary of my work is to argue that family scenes of family which include father and son that would expand to things like pedagogy and inheritance form a bad Rock from which the author makes his other arguments about the supremacy of Christ about the trustworthiness of God and ultimately about the ability of the audience to endure knowing that they are part of this family is integral to his argument just go back and clarify the first things that's really helpful distinction between black Paul and the person speaking in the Hebrews I forget I think it was a Hebrew scholar George Guthrie I think who is stead of saying the author use the term the pastor oh I love that I saw that in your correspondence and George's work is so good so let's go with that
 the well-being of n o z audios for the box but what's interesting you're saying is that the autobiography of the pastor is really fat grounded intentionally and contrast is like with Paul we're his autobiography is often in the foreground he'll bring it up but then also with scripture Paul with your same one more often say as it is written and quote whereas in Hebrews he'll simply say as God says or or sometimes even as as the sun says or so kind of the conclusion you drawing from that is the pastor wants his audience to hear this message as a just like a present for a contemporary present voice from God and it's fascinating that he doesn't construx he doesn't say God is speaking and then kind of invent Pros it is always the text of Israel that God is speaking
 within that there is Choice there is construction and so there is a shaping of a particular dimension of God character and I think pre-eminently that is that God is trustworthy that's what this audience needs to hear they're waiting in their face and we don't know exactly why but we can make gases but they need to know that God can be trusted and one dominant way in which he supports that is today God is father
 the one thing that's been a sub seem John for you and I as we anytime we working in the New Testament and we're exploring New Testament use of Greek Old Testament or some other version by that the whole rabbit hole but the way that scripture the wording can some for the context can sometimes be adapted or reapplied and knew what is Dustin time surprising ways I guess it's the takeaway released over the years John as you and I have been talking is that it's not just like arbitrary it doesn't represent a carelessness it actually is always very intentional to their goals and their their communication am's I don't know if that bothers you any more still John I remember some we've done some examples near like they changed the wording or they're adapting yeah you know we haven't we talked about it a few times but we haven't really dug in and gotten to the bottom of the discomfort there for sure and there's a lot of in Hebrews Allah
 quoting Andre quoting and it does make me uncomfortable still and I'd love to jump in and kind of look at what what the password is doing here and why it's there if we want to follow this path for a moment the first is that I would highly recommend a new work on Hebrews from Madison Pierce it's on Devine discourse and you might be aware of it maybe you're planning to interview her soon I so appreciate it but I think she's incredibly helpful and this is her dissertation writing dissertations a very precise so I'm actually like really honored that you spent time with mine it's not meant to be treating but our work begins with precisely this question looking very intently at the movement from a Hebrew to agree to what the author of Hebrews is doing the pastor is doing and you can really see the the possibilities for change what's so challenging is of course we can never Shirley say she is intentionally making a difference
 he's doing something different because it could be that his version is warlock at his text is exactly what he's copying down it it's hard exactly to know but then I'd like to provide an example of a place that I think this might be happening and in a way that doesn't at all change the meaning of the ER text to it doesn't change the meaning of of what he's quoting from the Septuagint to the power of His argument and that's a chapter 12. He quotes from Proverbs and right after the running metaphor right we run this race with endurance looking unto Jesus the author and Perfecter of our faith that's a text that people know very well and then it moves onto this theme of you not yet finished your struggle with sent you still have a ways to go in this race and so in order to encourage them he says don't forget that which has spoken to you this encouragement that spoken to you as sons and then it says my son do not despise the discipline of the Lord as far as we can tell us first what
 access to the proverb just has the vocativ son don't despise the discipline of the Lord it seems like the author of Hebrews adds the personal pronoun my my son and I again maybe there's a text out there that we just haven't seen yet but from what we have it seems like he entered Jack's this and what that does 11 level is make it a bit more pasta personal ride it connect to the my son is a little bit more warm and and Smith ingesting son but I think it's more than just sent Missy because if you go back to the first citation of Hebrews in chapter one where the father for the first time is speaking to be son Jesus it's the same two words my son know an English it's often translated you are my sun fit in the Greek it's actually we are smooth and in then the chapter 12 citation it is create move into the vocativ and I made the argument that I think this is an intentional
 just for warm but to put God's address to the Sun and gods address to the many sons and daughters as God says the same thing actually with the same two words so I didn't see that as an infelicitous Edition he's playing fast and loose with the text but he's taking a tax that's clearly about what he's about to discuss the discipline of God than making it more deeply connected to God's father's ship of Jesus Christ which is the setting in which the many sons and daughters experience God as father so don't I don't pretend like that would solve all of your issues because there are many but that's a pretty good example for me of an addition that I think reiterates and defense the intention of the text a lot of what's happening in Hebrews was always really uncomfortable not because I would go back and see way that's exactly what was said but because I don't have any framework for thinking about things like the priesthood
 how milk is a deck fits in there or this idea of the this Messianic son I mean we would talk about these things but when I see the third quoting the Psalms a kind of just felt like he just was cherry-picking lines and then just doing what he wanted with them to make a point I think now that you know Tim and I have been working through these themes so much like its Landing a lot more like I just read through Hebrews again the preparation for this and I'm just realizing wow so much of this makes so much more sense in town so there is that discomfort for those two reasons one is like how was the author tapping into something that I had no idea was going on and what he just playing fast and loose with the intention of that song Or was there something deeper happening and I think that starting to feel more comfortable and then there's a specific times like you just mention where the wording is different and there I have gotten a little bit more comfortable with the just attention of the key
 vanity in the Divinity of this that you know even like we're just talking like his tax may have been different than a text we have that would have been a huge conflict in my mind before we're just like you that that can't be it has to let you know that doesn't that means it's changed and I'd be freaking out but do you know that I think there's more space for that now at the beginning and has like those those bookends could part of your whole specific senior wanting a trace with the family of God is how God relates to his son becomes the model or like a template for how God relates to the Sons & Daughters which is what the last couple chapters is all about it's really loves those two quotes are like an excellent way of saying that everything is going to develop about Jesus Is providing what do you say like a script or a template a mold into which followers of Jesus are to begin to plug in their own life story and about
 outlines not that I'm like milk is a deck but it may be in some way I am to see my own identity more precisely than not because of who Jesus is I guess that's kind of like the shape of your argument throughout throughout the book and I think ultimately that does two things and gives them hope because Jesus as the Pioneer has trod the path and is now seated in God's presence and looking forward to his complete sovereignty so someone 10 is probably one of the most important that he is awaiting this time that all things are put under his feet and so he says as a human who is at gods of course he is the Divine son but having taken on Humanity she is where you're going to end up so there is a sense of it's possible because he's done it and so he gives you this hope that you two will be with God forever that you'll enter the Sabbath rest the have
 play Jerusalem he has lots of different ways of describing that end may be more immediate for them would be this theme of discipline which is really where he's spending his time in chapter 12 and I think that helps make sense of their struggles we learn in chapter 10 that they've had their goods taken away some of them are in prison they're facing shame they're facing persecution and I think the Temptation for them was to say wow where has God gone has gotten left us we've made this confession and now we're experiencing all of these difficulties and actually his answer is Look what Jesus had to go through if you would think the Eternal Sun the Sun that is the reflection of God's glory even he had to go through periods of time that weeping and Shane and Temptation and struggle and he did that because God was his father and God was training him and toward his Perfection if he did
 Escape that then you need to take comfort that your difficulty is actually a sign of God is doing the same thing with you disciplining you on to maturity so I think it's pre-eminently in chapter 5 Jesus's challenge that he faces in light of the Cross is to say to the audience don't be surprised when you go through challenges well in the New Testament write the gospels have it in the language of take up your cross Peter has it in the language of the frequency of suffering and I think the author of Hebrews makes the same claim with the language of discipline into Jesus is how the pastor will called you as a sibling that were a brother that language is was pretty absent from me and I think my tradition and it feels like feels weird actually still to think of Jesus as a sibling you can think of Jesus as a teacher I can think of them as the high priest as the Son of God the mass
 I always things but then as a brother. Just that makes it very very relational in a in a very intimate way yeah like I think it gets to that and the way that I need to run this race like I have a brother who's done it his Humanity really comes to latch there an immediate connection the older brother in the family the firstborn and that's the other language that's used of Jesus played a very important role because so often the fathers would die right mortality the age of mortality is so young and so the older brother would often be an important person who would care for and you do make sure that the younger siblings could could make it in the world so I think they would have an idea of Brotherhood that may be for us as a little bit distant because we just don't have the same realities but yeah it is it is provocative is it striking and I'm trying to reflect this is language that is not
 just everywhere in the New Testament that he is our brother that we are his brothers and sisters still watching the kinship language is meant to bond to the community together right this is what defines the Ecclesia that's your pain but that Jesus is our brother is incredibly powerful it's a way I think the provocation hear of the intense focus on his Humanity right alongside some of the highest christology in all of the New Testament that those things sit right next to each other is one of the reasons I love this book so much, in Hebrews I'm trying to think off the top my head I can only think of one place where it becomes prominent in Paul's letters in Romans 8 where we're crying out as adopted son and we're coaers and use more inheritance language but the language of The Sibling or the brother it would you say it's the most prominent in Whole New Testament in Hebrews
 he's I mean the other place that you get similar themes as in Galatians 4 where he talks about the sun in the slave and not transition but Paul he's very clear about adoption and we don't ever get a dachshund language in Hebrews I find that kind of interesting we definitely are part of God's family but we don't quite have the clarity of the mechanism really the only mechanism is that we are sharers the word he uses asthma tacos where participants in Christ and that's the way that we participate in this family but then the idea that he is our brother and we are his siblings yeah I have a Temptation that I think he Bruce is always the best of everything so that's one thing that the brother language is sibling language I wonder it also brings home is not just the humanity of Jesus by the High Calling of of Humana
 to be the image of God that he quotes from Psalm 8 in Chapter 2 and we spent a lot of time recently and saw May and we spent a ton of time in this project talking about what it means for Humanity to be the image of God and this idea of being God's image is a Priestly roll and mediates God's creation in. Sue two other it's all these things kind of come together and did Jesus being a brother really Elevate that seem a bit as she really raises Humanity up to what was God's original intent and that's precisely what's going on in cellmate like this is the hope that Humanity will Stuart Reign Over all creation Jesus is the first one to realize that fully and then provides the path for others can do the same as you follow me it's interesting he says we do
 see all things under his feet we don't yet see that humans are where God intended for them to be but we know now we have this guarantee that it will happen because Christ has offended and he is raining with honor and Glory as the song for told
 okay good so I said that we were at allows us to take a next up I think into a question I want to ask you so with those bookends with everything he's arguing about Jesus is creating the mold for the rest of the siblings that he's including you know these riding too so if you work through the chunks of the letter he's a certain how Jesus as identity is superior to the heavenly host the rulers of cording Genesis one then to Moses chapter 3 then if milk is a deck chapter seven question response episode and by far the most common set of questions about mckisset except that'll do. Me next time we'll go down that rabbit hole with you but then also after that are in the high priest and I was just thinking about this actually in preparing for this conversation the rulers above the Heavenly rulers Moses make his attack the high priest like those are just random examples those are all deeply connected portraits and ideas even within the Hebrew Bible as each one of them
 the window for the Angels think it's the exalted human so I can Daniel 7 going to be exalted over them but those four examples Angels Moses make his attack Aaron those are all really important in the kind of development of his argument so how how does that sequence and all this comparisons fit in to this bigger call of the pastor to endure and suffer and become Sons to readers at times because of John something you said a moment ago there is so much background assumption that we have to have to really hear this well and much of that has to do with this idea of priesthood and Cole take practice as you study the ancient world you know that not just for Jews but for Greeks and Romans as well this is just bread and butter this is how the world worked you have mediators between the Divine in humans you have rituals and sacrifices and so that for modern people is often unfamiliar but
 Ancient M and I'm stuck I have it I have a student who's coming from India and he said these practices are very common soccer animal sacrifices everywhere I get tea Brews in ways that I do not and so that makes it sound so how that fits into his argument with my first response is that this is a part of their world and so where I think this author is in conversation and building a is it Paul has a lot to say about the Covenant but only very rarely will talk about the Colt Romans 3 that Jesus is the history on the means of atonement but there's not this development and I have a sense that this author says you know there's an entire huge part of Israel's Faith how they relate with God namely through the temple and sacrifice how do we understand that in light of the Christ event and so then Christ superiority over the Angels which the Angels really are in the realm of God doing Priestly service to God there there there
 ministering to God so definitely the qumran community thought of the Angels his Priestly so there's a seam of connection Moses is the mediator between God and the people who to be able to say that this Jesus whom you've heard about that walked on Earth he's from the tribe of Judah he fulfills all of the hopes for the king she also feels all of our longing for a mediator one that will make atonement make at-one-ment between us and God and I I say to my students this is vitally important that he is not setting up all these structures as these were terrible ritual is a bad thing in the temple was a bad idea and blood is disgusting do you think God gave this as a gift to communicate that my God said my Holiness is going to dwell within an Unholy people how awesome is that God could have just said I'm done with you all I want to mess with it. I want to be in your midst and so that holiness
 then was portrayed through Moses and the priests and milk his back and the angels and their presence in the temple and then Jesus is even Superior to all of them so it's a good better argue argument not a bad good argument and especially as we've learned from Jewish interpreters of Hebrews Amy Jo Levine and is a mark Nanos are some of my favorite Jewish interpreters I've been reminded we need to be very closely attentive to how this first century Jew is making this argument about Jesus superiority and we wouldn't have known the power of what she is dead in the cross and Resurrection if we didn't have the cultic system to display what it takes for God's holiness to dwell in our midst I don't know what you're asking to think about you know you mentioned from from India and and I've had some of those experiences to teaching with students who come from essentially non-western
 non secularized into the Western meaning of that term and environments and they just all of this just land so differently this is more thinking passed orally but it really does for a teacher Communicator to sink in each given cultural context how do we communicate the message of Hebrews mean when you can help people transport them do you know what time traveling in the first century stuff but at the same time it raises the interesting question of how how do we contextualize that in our own culture that it is on a search for Transcendence in Ultimate meaning which is maybe without you. Obviously without the Priestly Garb you know that describes an ancient world that's more of an aside but it it raises the fascinating search the Hebrews actually could have a whole new lease on life in Western context if we did that creative work to the Sea for what are the ways the secular material is here looking for ultimate Transcendence and how can Hebrews give us wisdom about how to
 kitten eye contacts I think it's pretty ingrained in the human person because God designed Us in this way that we do appreciate order and beauty and that's much of what ritual and Colt offered and so I mean I'm thinking of Jamie Smith's work Desiring the Kingdom right we find ritual and other places that we long for it and just do it to say that Christianity offers that and all of that the arguments here in Hebrews it might feel repetitive are really getting to that deep need for what is the structure and we recognize that God is above us different than us Untouchable in some ways and so how do we appropriated relationship with God yeah it takes it will take a lot of creativity but I do believe there's a deep need there that people would be aware of the me on my last reading and in this is speaks to what you're saying it wasn't that this was bad and now there's something good but there's this language of this was a I don't know if playing with his shadow or
 foreshadowing but I was just thinking about how the pastor made a point of saying what Moses saw in the sky of the blueprints that was the thing that then this other thing was a symbol of and Jesus didn't go into the holy place of the Tabernacle he went into the holy place of like the cosmic Tabernacle which I don't think I understand what that means.
 join the club OK Google I want you to tell me but but yeah they all this symbolism and it does speak to the something inside of us we were in tune with that symbolism and the beauty of that that it speaks of something grander than we can even kind of put into words and understand. If you have any insight there I think that would be great incredibly debated places which you know Scholars have to have something to eat because we got to write books right but I've learned to describe it or thinking about it and I recognize that these are very contemporary terms but I believe that it's important to this offer to make the argument that Jesus is coming the sons coming becoming human dying and Rising again and it's ending wasn't some kind of plan B I think he wants to assert that yes Jesus is patterned off of so many things that we've seen in the past namely the temple and sacrificial system but it wasn't like God said
 this isn't working out too well let's try something different and so he makes that move and assertion that Jesus is not plan B by saying the things that you saw a functioning and Israel they were actually copying something that was pre-creation that is in the realm of God and he makes that moves with the temple which of course is not the only Jewish reader in the first century to do this what is what is real is the place where God dwells the access to God directly the Earthly Temple appropriate that and actually provides a point of access to God and then Jesus goes up to what had always existed this is what always got had planned I didn't think he would say it that way and interesting Lee if we want to switch their that's precisely the argument he makes about now cuz it's kind of like an ABB a pattern
okay well then you went there and I was about to take us there so we're going to have in addition to this interview with Hebrew Bible scholar Joshua Matthews who did a dissertation on Genesis 14 and mckissock their self or does it be when conversations and they'll be some overlap but with different Focus points so I'm excited about that. So yeah maybe one let's start here where where how does milk is a deck what function does he play with in the pastures overall argument and then there's this other question of how were other Jews other Jewish Scholars and communities what role did Kendrick play in their imagination and theology cuz he's a prominent figure for sure in the Dead Sea scroll Community the qumran community but then he comes up another important to his text to start with Hebrews and then we can rent a little brother that I like to imagine I'm at the psychologizing just a bit I don't know but it's a fun story to tell I think this author is very familiar with someone 10 that's in concert
 right he quoted do almost every book of the New Testament went in one the Lord said to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemies his footstool under your feet okay. That what I love about the Hebrews is that he reads past the assignment this is how I explain it to my students so the assignment is Psalm 110:1 the assignment is Psalm 22:1 will he reads to the later part he needs to the later part system 110 I'm there he discovers verse for the Lord said you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek so if we could imagine a moment a lightbulb moment for him saying this text God the Father spoke to Jesus whom I've heard about and experienced he called him King he also called him priest okay I want to go and see what else I can learn about milk is attack so he does and exegetical work this is his investigation of where milk is attacked a goes back to Genesis 4
 I believe what he discovers in this interaction and he lays it out for us he says look Abraham the patriarch the one that starts the Jewish faith right the one that God called have this interaction with Melchizedek and to the author of Hebrews it's incredibly clear who the superior is in that interaction Melchizedek blesses Abraham Abraham gives him the tie which I'm sure your dad will say the Hebrew there is a little we're not quite sure who's trying to him but he's as well let's just clear this is what's happening interesting in this interaction Melchizedek is superior to Abraham Ethan goes on and make that interesting statement and it's as if Levi was there because we've I was in the loins of his father and so I drawed is a math equation if you have milk is attack is superior to greater than Abraham I put the little alligator greater than sign and then you put Levi under Abraham because Levi is
 it's mine and Jesus under milk has attacked because Jesus is in which order the order of Melchizedek will then you can draw down the math equation and show Jesus is superior to leave till this goes back what I mean it's not a plan B so I believe that it would have been vital for this author to explain a critique how can you say over and over and over again it's Jesus's priests even high priest has he comes from the tribe of Judah which you recognize and 7:14 because if you think especially 2D intertestamental Jewish history it matters that you're in the right line The Maccabees aren't quite in the right line and then the high priesthood Becomes of position that you can just bribe the leader for so there's a lot of corruption that has come to that so how can he make the claim that Jesus is a priest because people would immediately say well he's not Levi and so what he finds in Genesis 14
 that this is always been the case there's always been another Priestly order and in fact that Priestly order has always been superior to the levitical order not the levitical order didn't matter yes God gave them a roll a vital role to play but he finds in Genesis the assertion of Jesus's Superior priesthood even before the priesthood weekends that I think is what the the role that's being played in his argument super clear talked about it we didn't ever say it that's the same place so thank you for the for that Clarity it is interesting in this is something that in doing the the priest rope with project for me really struck me in a new way was the critical viewpoint on the priesthood of the line of Levi and Eren in the Hebrew Bible itself in other ways it's actually hard to find any positive for Trails of levite priests in the Hebrew Bible which begins
 actually make you think the author of Hebrews the pastor he's using milk is a deck to make this argument about Jesus but he's not just creating something brand-new here there's already this suspicion about the institution of the priesthood even within the Hebrew Bible said I found that remarkable really know what they're talking about say that in the first century in particular people will still respect the office like they're still paying their Temple tax they're taking their sacrifices but they realize there was a lot of corruption within the people but they still respect the office so that's an interesting tension it's something that God gave the office is god-given but the people who have practiced it our fallen and even as this author will say they have weakness they have sinned they have to atone for it that's very important he's not the first one to offer a critique against the priesthood for sure before we go to other Jews because I didn't quite dry
 applus thread that I introduced a moment ago I guess I wanted to get to Hebrew 73 which when I work through this with students remains one of the most challenging text and I think you had asked about it in your question so yeah we get someone can for we get Genesis 14 but then you have the statement without father without mother without genealogy having neither beginning of days are in the flash where is that in the text and I'm sure you've done some of the work with rabbinic exegesis it seems like he's doing moves that late or rabbis will make that will if the text doesn't talk about it then we can assume it's not there no I think that's I think the modern readers that sounds odd or end he's not an ignorant reader at all he's not making kind of just creating things you just noticing in the text we don't have a genealogy we don't know where this person comes from 9 or do we hear about his death so in the story he looks like
 the things that we want to say about Jesus that the sun is eternal and that the son lives forever and so then he goes on to say having been made like the Son of God you're means peace forever but that's me is quite important that just as we were saying with the Tabernacle so I've been focusing on how Jesus is in the line of milk is attack in 73 he makes the statement really no kids back as we see him appear and interact with Abraham he's really like the Son of God it is the Son of God who is first no kids that I could like him and then Jesus incarnate comes in his line. You can have that a b a pattern is like he's saying is like the Eternal Son of God and how is so and so I think this is a question is when he's in drawing attention these little details it's not a genealogy we don't know where it came from it could be that he's making a textual observation and then saying there for
 read the text real portrait of milk is a deck boy that sure like the Eternal Son of God and sit in that sense and I think this is a interpretive debate commentators or is he actually making the positive about some kind of pre-existence status for me cuz you know he wouldn't be the only only do it person to to make that argument and for me that's always been the puzzle and I literally it's like a teeter-totter I can see each one of those views this as being compelling absolutely that many of the early patristic readers of Hebrews favored a christophany here favored an appearance of Christ I think that's that's quite possible because what in the logic of this letter you don't want to end up with milk his attack as some kind of competitor with Jesus right I mean he said Jesus is at the right hand it's not like he has to fight milk is a deck for this role and so it's not like it's floating up there like who's better that there's no question
 so I think that christophany reading more easily supports the idea that there's no competition the only hesitancy I have with that is that I always want to reserve a place for the entrance into time the moment of the Incarnation so if the Sun is somehow involved in it appearing to Abraham it wouldn't quite be the embodied sign as we know him from the tribe of Judah it would be some kind of manifestation as angels will manifest in humans and ways that they can be seen and this happens throughout scripture a few chapters later for example exactly just a quick note and it will take another episode to get into similar topics but there were other Jewish Scholars of the time who is Melchizedek as a Transcendent have my figure and lots of questions, that milk is it at
 guarantee the conversation I will have when I say I work on Hebrews first question who wrote it second question whose milk is it I can't say I've ever read the book now they do it to us it's like we don't hear usually a lot of sermons about this fellow but it's it's a great reminder that in the ancient world we see him referred to by to see if I buy filo in second Enoch in the Dead Sea Scrolls light Enoch Jewish leaders are interested in gaps in the narrative and right we know this from rabbinic exegesis like if there's something in the story that's not quite easy to explain and especially if you go back and read Genesis 14 the milk is a deck piece is just out of nowhere like if you cut it out the story makes a lot of sense and so just readers I'm noticing that until they have interesting ideas until you're right some particularly in the Dead Sea Scrolls Community imagined him as Angelic he was a figure that will appear
 at the end of the age to execute judgment on those who are opposed to the ways of God so he takes a very prominent role in the unfolding of their story in Enoch it's a very interesting second Enoch he almost has a like it a miraculous conception he he's born to a very old couple and in fact the wife dies before she has him so it makes me curious about where there's some associations with Jesus's beginning and questions about his beginning and milk his attack it s Enoch might be a little bit late so I don't know that I want to claim that I mean the question is got his check from the Covenant where do we get a priest who knows to serve the most high it's kind of the the righteous the righteous Gentile right at it. That appears I mean I don't think anybody can tie a bow on the kiss attack at this point in history
 food is good all the way back to just your first response it was really actually sing to the role that Mackenzie that plays in his developing a portrait of Jesus is actually very clear that's actually not a mystery you can read the letter in and get it and it's probably the most most important thing next time someone asks you who wrote Hebrews blow their mind and say it was milk is that going to do that
one question two kind of land the plane and this was in an implication of your book we didn't necessarily draw it out in a huge way but about how this early the word that will be is a few centuries later is the trinitarian portrait of God but you know what this is very early although the author does to the pastor to say he refers to the first eyewitness generation as being before him I thought this fascinating but it's very clearly a father-son spirit vision of God the god of Israel but with ice fascinated me is the pastor's not doing systematic theological speculation it's a very practical and pastoral support that vision of God to to work has to work early so in your Reflections on Hebrews how does the pastor give us a model for its showing how the Trinity isn't just an Arcane an interesting thing to talk about with your friends you know expect you to sleep but it really matters in our vision
 we are as the children of God that's a wonderful question let me go back to my first comment about Hebrews how truly is it as a teenager it scared me and we might think of Edwards it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God that's Hebrews our God is a consuming fire that's Hebrews why I appreciate those statements is that Hebrews never backs away from the sovereignty the Holiness even the Judgment of God fascinatingly when he concludes pretty much the rhetorical high point of this letter is in 12-24-12 22 through 24 when they get to Mount Zion right now you have come to the mountain and there's all these angels celebrating and there's these Spirits who've been perfected and there's a God but it when I'm starting my dissertation I still wished he had said God the father of all like the gods went with his arms wide open waiting for know the language is God who is the judge
 I'm all like that's one of the final things that said about the father he never will compromise on God's holiness and even distance from us so if that is the picture that you have of God particularly if if you're Jewish and I think that's right and again and it's amazing that God has given the law and the Covenant and the sacrifices to be in a relationship if you have that picture of God's distance then you have to ask the question what how can I bridge that distance right if I am a created being of God and God is Holy and I'm messed up and get that right like I don't think anyone needs to be convinced about the messed up Miss of themselves or our world then you you long for you have a knowledge that there is a gap to be filled and not for the story of Jesus comes in and I think one possible negative of the way that I'm arguing that we read Hebrews that Jesus is sonship gives us the template for our
 status as children of God is that if we read that in a flat way then Jesus just becomes a really good example right and I do think he's example he's template but it doesn't stop there because we could say Jesus was amazing he suffered he then persevered he was exalted he's at Dot's right and he's been ascended elevated but if that's just a nice story to tell her good example that means very little for us but to have the assertion and then you get this I think without debate in chapter one that the sun is the emanation of God I mean that's the language of the Apollo guzma of God's glory the radiance of God's glory the imprint of God's being he was with God before creation even happened got two dresses and his God and Lord I mean again this author is not sinking in 4th Century trinitarian terms but my goodness the seeds are here soon Jesus isn't just a nice example he is the revelation
 of God who lives this story but even if we stopped there and Hebrews is has most to say about Father and Son but the spirit is present as well so if it was just father and son I think we would still be the left wondering what how am I connected to that story cuz now that the sun has ascended what does that mean to me the spirit who communicates who affect salvation in chapter 9 the spirit becomes the means by which humans can then participate in Christ and so I've done some more work on the spirit in Hebrew stamps the publication of this book and become even more convinced that that's a necessary piece although it's muted to a degree if we can pair it say with with Paul and Romans 8 in particular but it's present and so at the end of the day the author is saying yep there is a holy God and this holy God wants you to endure you can't be flippant about your face but this holy God has given you the power to him
 both by the guarantee given in the sun in the work in the Sun and by the presence of the spirit who is among you and it is that connection that I think ultimately would have given them what they needed to keep running to be faithful and thank you for all of the late nights that went into producing a work like this is every page is packed with inside which means you have had to work for that on every page so God bless and enjoy writing dissertation awesome well I think we could talk for much longer but I think we've addressed some of the main things that touch into the series so thank you for taking the time to talk with us today me so fun. I truly appreciate your work I use it in class often I use it myself when I was had to teach on Ecclesiastes recently and really had no idea what to do and your cheese
 just gave me so much clarity as I move forward in that project so thank you for the ways that you were serving God's people thanks Amy I don't know that it's if it's appropriate to plug or not but I have a much more accessible volume on Hebrews that I wrote with Patrick gray really I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy actually Patrick is just fantastic but that is a much more readable yeah it's in a series called the TNT Clark study guides to the New Testament fairly inexpensive paper bag by the book with ornaments on Mary and the fatherhood of God so that will be out early next year. Billing so I kind of turned my attention to gender studies but I'm writing
 commentary on Hebrews right now so I need to finish that within the next year so awesome, thanks again for talking to us so nice to connect with both of you and I hope our paths cross again
