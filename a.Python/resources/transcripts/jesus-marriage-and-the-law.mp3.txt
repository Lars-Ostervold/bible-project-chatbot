in the scroll of Deuteronomy there are some ancient laws for ancient Israel about divorce and remarriage and it's kind of hard for modern readers because they leave divorce entirely in the hands of men and women had no say whether or not they got divorced and if their husband left them and they go on to remarry their considered in pure the language of women becoming in pure because of the behavior and social power of the men in This Woman's life she becomes a passive victim were all the sudden what what is she to file does she like she has somehow lower value or dignity just because of what these men have done this feels uncomfortable for modern readers and it might be because we're taking our modern sentiment and trying to impose it back into an ancient time or perhaps this feels wrong and strange to us because
 but because it's supposed to be followers of Jesus be part of why it feels wrong for how this woman is being treated is precisely because we hold the values of Jesus from the 7th which is very much about elevating women and children and people because of life's circumstances or social location have real disadvantages of our communities are structured Jesus really cared about those people and included them and brought them to the place of elevated dignity in his community service at 5. So I just want to notice the reason why we're bothered by this law is because we've been shaped by the ethics in the Bible who were bothered about one part of the Bible not just because we're somehow more morally Progressive it's because we actually I've been shaped by the teachings of Jesus Jesus had a deep love and a fervent respect for the Torah he saw the tour as God's wisdom for Israel buddy
 also saw himself as fulfilling the Torah Jesus sees the laws of Deuteronomy has not fully Express in God's ideal for human life he says right here it's a concession to Israel's Hardness of Heart when Jesus wants to get to the bottom of what the laws of Deuteronomy are about he goes to the narratives and Jessica to today Tim Mackie and I were going to talk about not just divorce but the way Jesus read the laws of the Torah and how he found God's wisdom in them and how he saw himself as the Fulfillment phones are calling you listening to the Bible project podcast entertaining us here we go
hey John we get to read some more ancient lost yeah that's what we're doing we're in the Torah were meditating on ancient Israelite laws that laws is it weird that I think that's weird no no I think it's a completely reasonable response that a guy sitting in Portland who grew up in the Northwest should think it's odd I share the sentiment before have and it's just I don't know I mean I get the sense that I actually have people I know have shared this with you that you saying that out loud I know gets many people permission to be honest but they find these parts of Bible difficult OK following a
 a guy that you believe rose from the dead it's already a little bit outside the norm yet whatever the norm whatever the term is I mean we live in a world that Stranger than us that's you know it's true on the flying space Rock and there's dark energy that is pushing the universe into existence In This Moment is beyond my wildest imagination so Define normal the universe is expanding into nothingness so but you and I both and most of y'all who were listening I've been compelled by the life story of Jesus Nazareth and part of being his Apprentice or disciple means believing he is who he says he is who is the raised from the dead Lord of Cosmos over having a nice and so you get to that point and I know many people have had really beautiful experiences I have
 of encountering him but then you get to this other piece which is well he finds his identity not just in a relationship with the father but in relationship to this book yeah we're a people group whose story is informed by this book and who story formed this book yeah sure and yeah Jesus said that these texts are unified in a really important way and they're actually that's nothing new that's what most I can help you thought about this collection of Scrolls years that they were unified and pointing in It Forward Direction when he claimed that his life story was uniquely bringing what the collection was all about to have a next stage of the story ends with what you call fulfillment
 so I'm in on this because I believe in the power of the resurrection of Jesus and I believe in self-sacrificial love and in Heaven and Earth uniting and then this leads me to then meditating on Ancient lock code to find wisdom yeah and so here we are here we are the best to meditate on a story told with in the scriptural Scrolls that Jesus believe spoke a word of God as people word from his father to his people and embedded within that story is the story of God entering into a covenant partnership with the family of ancient Israel
 and this form of that Covenant partnership takes the form of ancient near Eastern Covenant treaties which always have as a part of the terms of the relationship of body of rules regulations statutes and laws that Define what does it mean to be loyal to each other in this relationship that's what all these hundreds of laws in the tour are about ways to be loyal you know we have these in all our relationships so it's not that odd we are what we usually off an unspoken you know if it's like a deep friendship it's not like you ever written up the rules if your friendship somewhere but there are expectations about what constitutes a good friendship you know but I don't have a relationship with anyone where they say hey to understand how this relationship to go really well to I want you to meditate on Ancient near Eastern treaties
 Israel have expectations of some kind of terms and that's right and the Covenant relationship between Galloway and ancient Israel which Jesus saw himself bringing that Covenant partnership do it the filament into the next stage of its story that relationship was formalized with these hundreds of laws and rules that are very much at home within the ancient world where is real lift so we have been meditating on the laws at the center of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy it's rolled it constitutes one long set of speeches from Moses to the children of Exodus generation who are poised there right on the Plains by the Jordan River on
 decide about the cross and going to the land that God is giving them the Eden land because I want to give him and so it began with him retelling the story of the relationship which is how I treat he's often begin in that day and then a set of sermons what we'd like to ask sermons appealing to their minds and hearts and Will's to be faithful in the first movement chapters one through eleven chapters 12 through 26 or Moses it's positing for this new generation entering into a new setting all of these terms of the Covenant relationship that's what we've been doing this is the third now conversation we were meditating on the laws but the second to draw me some of the thread that we've been tracing is about something that Moses brought up in the sermon section which is that the terms of the Covenant the laws God has given to Israel our wisdom
 for righteousness and Justice yeah yeah Deuteronomy chapter 4 the laws are a revelation of God's righteousness that is there an expression of his desire to be in right relationship that's a righteous man's with his people and that they model their relationship to Yahweh which is meant to be a right relationship they model it by doing right by each other and maintaining right relationship through acts of justice and generosity and so we've been meditating on reading these laws the way Moses introduces them which is as a source of wisdom reflection so what I thought we would do is look at some laws in the block of Deuteronomy because roughly from chapter 19 to 25 and the satellites we looked at the last two episodes were from the first section of laws chapter 12 to 18 of Deuteronomy and they were mostly laws about how is real related to Yahweh in terms of worship
 I worship illegitimate worship or about having leaders and social structures that will Point Israel in the direction of faithfulness the album the laws and 9:25 Deuteronomy are very much about inter Israelite relationships in marriage family tribe extended family neighborhood Village it's on so what am I to do here is draw attention to the fact that Jesus meditated on these laws we know that because there's a story of corded Matthew Matthews version of it but we'll look at where he was asked about one of the laws in this section of Deuteronomy and it's so revealing how he approaches it and reads it encounters the Bible scholars that he's talking to a new way of models I think for us a Way Forward of how to read first of all the laws within the narrative context of the Torah and then second of how to read
 That's wisdom literature so we could start with the law with in Deuteronomy, ponder it for a moment and then turned to Jess's treatment like a little thought experiment or we could start with Jesus and then think about the law in light of how Jesus first one
 okay this is one of the only laws it's actually the only law that directly addresses the issue of divorce and remarriage in the entire Torah there's one other law about terms of legitimate or illegitimate divorce than Exodus but this is the only law is it the only lie or is there another one that is about legitimate or illegitimate reasons for divorce that's that's that's a lot about divorce law about divorce and remarriage Mary Thorson be marriage. So there's only two loss out of the 613 laws in the Torah you would think that if the Torah where Constitution comprehensive lochard you would expect that there would be more laws about something as practical and day-to-day life as an integral yeah yeah so it's a good example
 the fact that so many topics are omitted from the Torah and the really important life circumstances only get but seem like random treatment should make us sit back and be like maybe these laws are doing something will different this law is a long long single sentence for well it looks like a big paragraph in our English translations in The New American Standard cuz it captures the long run on sentence quality out of here Deuteronomy 24 verse 1 when a man takes a wife and marries her and it happens that she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some nakedness of a thing in her that I was my only friend has found some indecency in her and let's let's do survey translation
 cuz this is important for me is a conversation with Bible nerds and Ivy has something indecent ESV has he has found some indecency that's exactly what the New American Standard has an RSV has objectionable he finds something objectionable about her King James has he has found some uncleanness in her so just good reminder when you see this kind of big diversion says it's usually a little red flag of like a little meditation puzzle so the phrase literally in Hebrew at about the Vodka it's the word nakedness and thing or matter nakedness of a matter he returned to face and you return the phrase very rare only a one other time that doesn't fully illuminate what is going on here so nakedness in the context of
 marriage and divorce and husband finding something about his wife it was debated like what exactly this means is debated cuz it's paired with the sprays of not finding favour in his eyes because he found a nakedness of a thing in her so the little puzzle there is going to get interpreted in different ways throughout history of Jewish interpretation and Jesus has a particular view on what this means anything cuz there's an interpretation this right and he thinks there's an interpretation is wrong but I get ahead of myself okay so we have an end of the sense that this just when a man takes a wife when he marries there when it happened she finds a favor because he found some nakedness of a thing and when he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and when he sends a route from his house and when she leaves his house and goes and becomes another man's wife then if the latter husband that is my husband
 if that second husband turns against her we're literally hates her and he writes her a certificate of divorce and puts it in her hand and send her out of his house or if the second husband dies the one who took her to be his wife then all that was a gift then there's a big case study multiple ifs the here's the punch line then the first husband who sent her away is not allowed to take her again to be his wife or she has become impure for that is Taboo it's detestable before y'all way and you should not bring sin upon the land which shall we your God gives you as an inheritance okay let's just first just recognize how
 we feel
 it's important not to ignore these really important not to ignore how this makes us feel I've lots of feelings right now how to make you feel I asked you two questions I don't have a good connection to my emotions Tim growing well I think I've already just compartmentalize this in the ancient law code it was a different Society patriarchal society and I'm sure in some way of this is actually protecting women when it gets to the end and it starts talking about she has been defiled yeah you usually are fewer yeah yeah that's just kind of like what the heck does that mean in that that's detestable or near bombination like what does that mean because that that sugars
 me this feeling of like oh we we got to protect women versus like put them in a place we're trying to decide whether or not they're they're pure and impure and their detestable thing like this yeah that's like dangerous territory so we can just name and again this is subjective to our social location but how could it be otherwise so yeah the language of a woman be coming in pure because of the behavior of her husband arrogant selfish men the Arrogant it is interpretation but because of the decisions and Social Power of these men in This Woman's life she did become passive victim were all of a sudden what what is she defiled is she like she has somehow lower value or dignity just because of what these men have done or if you know thought about
 are treated her because in the case study the man in the sheets the divorce correct it's all up to him that's right and so she is just kind of a passive player in the situation and what's interesting is the moment this identified as her being defiled is not the moment when he finds some indecency and then they can just have a thing in her it's if she has married again and the first husband wants to remarry once we're back nuts and not bring sin upon the land really were in a different social setting and it feels bothersome to us because it feels like it's reinforcing issues of the gender value differential and letting you know allowing the men in this situation to just do what they want and this woman to suffer so yeah it was just named that if that's I feel that too and
 that's right there in every person I've ever walked through in a class setting our conversation with this law has the exact same reaction
 and so that's also the reason we feel like that is because we sit in a culture that's had major developments in divorce law in issues of gender equality still developing but we're in a culture that has really focused on and is trying to develop its thinking and behavior on these issues socially so it's interesting I also want to pay attention to the fact that were followers of Jesus and part of why it feels wrong for how this woman is being treated is precisely because we hold the values of Jesus from The Sermon on the Mount which is very much about elevating women and children and people because of Life circumstances or social location have real disadvantages and how our communities are structured Jesus really cared about those people included them and brought them to the place of elevated dignity in this community center
 so I just want to notice the reason why were bothered by this law is because we've been shaped by the ethics which is also in the Bible so we're bothered about one part of the Bible not just because we're somehow more morally Progressive it's because we actually have been shaped by the teachings of Jesus so that's what adds another layer of complication two plus two so multiple things going on here I'll just name for me what I'm have noticed my recent past your Deuteronomy is that almost all the laws and Deuteronomy are hyperlink to and are somehow reflections of things happening in the narratives of the Torah and the almost all the laws
 in Deuteronomy are somehow hyperlinked Reflections and meditations on things happening in stories of the Torah is this happened as well the idea of an Unfaithful wife the golden calf story of Israel at Mount Sinai the golden calf was called by God and then by Moses and act of adultery is so Israel giving its allegiance to another God or to a god of its on making is called adultery which assumes a whole little story that the Covenant partnership between now and Israel is modeled after a marriage covenant until unfaithfulness on this rough part constitutes an act of adultery in the prophets you know go to town with this Isaiah and Jeremiah especially and so if we see this as somehow mirroring story of Yahweh in Israel about a wife who does something exposing and nakedness of a thing and then is sent Away by the first Covenant partner
 and then she goes and joins another Covenant partner becomes even more impossible to repair that original relationship and what's interesting is that both Jeremiah and Isaiah and Ezekiel are all going to run with this and depict Israel sitting in Exile after centuries of idolatry as putting God in the position of if he's going to be faithful to his promises that means reconciling with an Unfaithful wife it's all described in the terms of the interesting so there's something here about this law that it's mirroring the story of Yahweh in Israel and interesting way that I need to think about more except that in the law the husband since the wife away in the story of Israel they go away yeah but it's depicted as you always doing she always sends the people out of the landfill
 is exactly the language used with what God dust out of me in the sense to know there's something going on here about how the laws or commentary on The Narrative of the Torah in the ways that I have a lot more distinctive but what I want to know is that difficult phrase husband finds a nakedness of a thing so what happened in the course of history of Israel and Jewish interpretation was the Israelites needed to actually build up more laws and Community regulations around divorce and remarriage and so this law became a source of a lot of meditation the how to form new laws and rules in Jewish communities about divorce and remarriage and there was a raging debate in the second temple. About the meaning of the sprays nakedness of a thing and so there were some rabbis really joined it with the phrase finding no favor that she found a favor and think that it actually the nrsv translation I think reply
 interpretation with Define something objectionable doesn't like she doesn't please him he find something objectionable no-fault divorce is like I'm done I'm done so in a culture in the second temple period was good historical evidence that still in that. Only men could initiate divorce so when I say no fault divorce we have a category of a man or woman can do that that's right in this culture only imagine the sheets of course that's right so there's some Jewish communities and Bible scholars leadership that took that route there were others Jewish leaders who believe that that phrase nakedness of a thing as specifically talking you know some metaphor figure of speech about nakedness meaning I feel like getting a bed with somebody I don't drink and that that's what's being referred to here so let's watch Jesus
 navigate this conversation on this isn't Matthew chapter 19 and for what was a new testament scholar Ben Meyer in his book The aims of Jesus I don't know why is his treatment of the story that always remember it cuz I felt like my brain exploded aspects of a three huge significance somatic 19th when Jesus had finished these words that is the end of speech in the previous section you departed from Galilee he came to the region of Judea beyond the Jordan Judea is like the county where Jerusalem is this where all the power players are political and religious large crowds followed him so some of these can be Jesus that is the Bible nerds popular bible religious teachers very devout hyper observant but they're not in power they just have
 a lot of social popularity okay so they come to Jesus testing him it's not like they have a legitimate question they want to draw a Jesus into a debate that will expose him show to tell the truth about him just like we got to test people it's to expose the truth about who they aren't you so they want to trap Jesus so this is it lawful according to the Torah for a man to send away his wife for any reason at all so right here they are tapping into the debate around the law in Deuteronomy that we just rats because some people look at the nakedness of a thing as just any objectionable any reason reason that I have is really crucial so they're not just asking Jesus like a random question off the top of their head they are inviting Jesus into a specific debate about a specific
 why the Torah and particular about one popular interpretations so Jesus answered and said haven't you read the Bible so glad that Jesus haven't you read that the one who created them from the beginning made them male and female he's quoting from another part of the Torah there he goes back farther than from the little image of god poem in Genesis 1 verse 27 so haven't you read that a course they have yeah so I quit with the hour or so from the beginning and made them male and female and said for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh and that's from Genesis to write from the Garden of Eden story where are the singular human which becomes too so that those two
 who are other from each other can become one to Covenant to be fruitful and multiply the 7-Day story Christian story alongside the Eden Christian Store yeah but he's doing it to establish a Biblical Theology of marriage before answering a question about divorce about the lot so let's just noticed that when Jesus is asked a question about the interpretation of a law on Deuteronomy he appeals to the larger narrative context of all of the laws beginning with the Eden story is hugely significant Jesus sees himself and what he's doing as somehow recovering or restoring the people of God to the Deep wisdom
 and values that that God has for creation revealed not in the laws of Deuteronomy book revealed in De Pere Christian story about marriage that's what it was and begins yeah so just as an approach for when Jesus wants to get to the bottom of what the laws of Deuteronomy are about he goes to the narratives and Jefferson so that was navigation to Ben Mayer from my attention that is a simple observation but I think with huge implications not just as a way for us to read the Torah but then Myers point was this reveals who Jesus thinks he is and what he thinks he's here to do in other words he is here to bring about some kind of renewal or restoration among Israel to restore them to do the eating ideal
 so Jesus after two quotes he says so you know male and female there was no longer to but there wasn't so what therefore God has joined together let no human separate so Jesus holds reads the eating area to live in the Genesis narrative a saying there's some Divine ideal for marriage when a man and a woman with two others become one as an there's a aspect of the image of God that's reflected the there that is so pure and good and holy and beautiful that it's worth protecting at all cost that's how he reads the narratives of the tour the really high view of marriage superhive you can I was high as you can get yeah it's a mirror of the so the Pharisees respond to Jesus and they say why why did Moses command quote give her a certificate of divorce and send her away if no one should suffer
 a marriage like we're at Moses did it yeah I noticed what they're quoting from is from the F section of the law and if he gives her a certificate to are so they're turning that if part of the law into a command to move on their part that shows how they read the laws of the Torah in other words a day are looking for more than just the actual command of the law they're looking for the implicit command but it's a good question even if you could say was in command and it's clear that it was allowed allowed so why would Moses allow our Command a certificate of divorce if you know divorce is not the Divine idea and he said to them because of your Hardness of Heart get personal so yeah and when he says that they actually talking like Moses doesn't Deuteronomy to all of Israel he's identifying the present generation of Israel as being in continuity with every generation of Israel back to the Exodus
 so because of your Hardness of Heart Moses allowed the divorce of your wives but from the beginning of us not God's way of doing things and I say to you whoever divorces his wife except for immorality is The New American Standard the Greek word cornea and then he goes on and marries another woman commits adultery
 or causes her to commit adultery that's a long Rabbit Trail I think the point I just want to draw attention to is that Jesus sees the laws of Deuteronomy has not fully expressing God's ideal for human life right he says right here at the concession it's a concession to Israel's Hardness of Heart that's really interesting this is huge man like this really why are we reading these laws in the first place because we're Disciples of Jesus and so what that means is I want to read these laws with the framework in the approach the Jesus is modeling here and he sees God's will expressed in the Eden and creation story in a way that is more ideal more more true for pristine and that these laws in Deuteronomy are reflecting many cycles in sogod, dating feeding to the violence and stubbornness in
 failure of humans and so yeah he says you can't just read the laws as if they are as they stand currently in there that we read them as the pure ideal will of God we have to read them in a narrative contacts and he's getting that phrase Hardness of Heart from the narratives the Wilderness grumblings in Exodus and numbers and then Moses summarizes that with the spray that actually this phrase begin talking about Sarah Farris Hardness of Heart and then she read on an exodus you find out Israel is hardening it's hard just like that so let's admit it on then I feel like it's important
so did you bring that perspective to all the laws of the Torah then that this suspicion that there's a concession inside of here yeah I think that's what it means in other words that the law have underneath them the ones who do know example have underneath them a Divine ideal that's being expressed but it's underneath that what it seems like we were saying is underneath it which if you want to get to it and its pure form it's in these stories of the narratives of the beginning of the Torah yeah that's right and there it's not even super playing it's also you have to meditate on it what does it mean to be a God was it mean for the two to become one and the one that become too and male and female is both God's image what does that mean you going to meditate on this but that is where you get to run of the base layer wisdom what you're saying then the laws of the Torah then you're down the line
 God has tried to accommodate a people who have their own culture have their own problems and also our kind of screwed up yeah and that this process of accommodation is happening in the Covenant treaty itself yes and so at a baseline when he come to discover the truth is you have to anticipate and realize there is a combination happening yeah it's as if the laws or form of damage control this is clearly the invitation which doesn't mean the rat that means that they are expressions of God's wisdom and God's ideals of justice and righteousness the right relationship but fully embedded in and taking into account the limits of his Covenant Partners in the cultures that they have it now was that a radical idea or
 the Pharisees we don't get a narrative of the Pharisees reacting to that no actually this is a this is a mode of ethical reasoning that you can find within the Jewish tradition of the rabbi's you read the the body of Torah La meditation that summarizes all of the rabbis of second temple. And then after the fall of the temple to the Romans 78d that's a collection call the mishna and then there's a collection of meditation on the mishnah meditations on the Torah not second level for third level meditation just called to tell me that but essentially what rabbinic or the reasoning of the rabbi's is to take the laws of the Torah meditate on the principles of wisdom underneath that I'm informed by the principles of wisdom underneath all the other laws
 and then they create a more comprehensive body of divine guidance and with lots of disagreement embedded into the conversation so I think what's what's unique is not the Jesus is saying this law on Deuteronomy needs to be informed by the creation story it's what Jesus goes on to say after this conversation is that in the Kingdom of Heaven which is creating an outpost here on Earth that I'm bringing about we're going to do marriage differently we're going to do marriage the Eaton way in my community of disciples really strive for that and his disciples are like oh man which for him means that the Covenant relationship is so sacred the only concession I am going to Grant Jesus is going to Grant is a morality is adultery or not but again he's not giving a full comprehensive treatment of marriage and divorce and remarriage he's going back to the
 question which is what is the legitimate reason for divorce according to Deuteronomy 20:4 is it any reason at all essentially what they're asking him is what does nakedness nothing means anything at all or is it adultery and what Jesus says is look at the Eden story and then it's obviously not anything at all obviously not anything at all because here's the vision for what marriage can be in the Eden story in creation so then what he says is in Matthew 19 verse 9 is that it refers to immorality and then his disciples are so Florida this cuz they're like well if you get married you can't just like the whole can I wear you just did there I think it was significant and I know better to slide a hand when you read this story but it seems like it's Jesus saying here's my position I see I see here is my comprehensive statement only people will come to the
 and be like that's what you just said that only goes right that's right and where you backed it up and said the context of this which isn't super plane unless you understand one what they're quoting from or maybe you do but you also all the people in the story are like anything at all or merely adultery in a Jesus is just saying if those are the two categories then because I'm such a high Vision a marriage like I can't be anything at all to do tree but that doesn't mean it just saying it's not a comprehensive that we can't then say that Jesus wouldn't find any other any other region waishen the door reason divorce among his disciples and he's just a silent on the issue of what are additional reasons where are there additional reason so here it's important that other law
 in the Torah in Exodus 22 list among legitimate reasons neglect or abuse as legitimate reasons for a wife to leave her husband and then also it's interesting this is important in the Apostle Paul if he's working through the issues of divorce and remarriage in the House Church of Corinth Ms in 1st Corinthians 67 he recognizes that what he calls the teaching of our Lord and He references this teaching right here and then he goes on to talk about how however if a husband like leaves his wife because she's become a follower of Jesus then the why should recognize that as valid and he goes on to say and I to have the spirit who seems to think like there's more meditation there's more insight about divorce and remarriage that the spirit has to teach God's people that Jesus didn't explicitly address in this teaching that your references so
 there's some wider conversation happening among the apostles about this the Jesus just didn't dress even though we wish the d-pad so you're right I was not trying to be tricky but you're right I was cycling through that are the correct sequence real quick so there's this pattern Jesus reads of one of the laws of the Torah but he reads it in the context of the larger Narrative of the Torah and specifically hyper linking it to the Eagan store is which are the foundation of pattern at all the stores in the wisdom he finds is that marriage is so sacred it connects to something so important that if your disciple of me we're going to take marriage really seriously that's right and then again but the only reason he's talking about this is cuz they asked him a question about the interpretation of a law in Deuteronomy chapter 24
 you could kind of dial that into the more specifically is that Jesus read the laws of the Torah discovering their wisdom by reading them in connection with their hyperlexia all the way back in the Garden of Eden story is so that's the mode that Jesus is in talking about the lawsuit or so with the time that we have I want to do that with a couple other laws that Jesus never but I think that will bring some elimination and also want to pick some that I remember the first time I read them they really bothered me so let's turn to Deuteronomy chapter 21 Deuteronomy 21 verse 10 when you all that is Israel when you all are living in the land and when you go out to battle against your enemies
 and let's say you always your God delivers your enemy into your hand and you take them away captives that's the narrative seen here you're going to go into the land there's going to be people that don't think you belong there that are going to come talk to you and Yahweh will be faithful to his Covenant promises and deliver them into your hands if you're faithful to him cuz there's lots of other times where they've been unfaithful and God will let their enemies defeat them so this is all assuming like let's say you go into the evening times have been unfaithful and God lets them both but they specifically were saying let's say you go to battle against your enemies and deliver them in your pants let's just pause right there this is clearly comparing this to the story of the Torah and the hyperlink to eat in this is the F part of the yep Dallas for the win over clearly outside of Eden we're clearly in the land of Canaan limit
 twin tribes and Nations and we know that is not got that deal so already God getting involved in the survival in defense of a people group is already if you consider the eating ideal of humans living at peace with one another and with the animal and with their environment already we're conceding to a non ideal reality here when you go out to battle against your enemies are the only reason we're having amazing would have to fight them because we're in the tragic outside of eating spot so it's such a significant we're naming the violence outside of Eden and violence connected to Cannon stories so let's say you take some captives
 and you see among the captives that a woman is beautiful and you desire her and you take her for yourself as a wife then you shall bring her home to your house she shall shave her head and cut her nails she will also remove the clothes of her captivity and will sit in your house and grieve your father and mother for a month after that you may go into her you rephrase for consummating the marriage sex and become her husband and she shall be your wife
 it comes about however that you are not pleased with her but you do not desire her then you cannot let her go or send her out if it happens that you do not desire her then you will let her go wherever she desires and you will certainly not sell her for money but it's as a slave and you shall do no mistreatment to her because you have raped her the phrase has humbled were oppressed her but when a man does this to a woman who he's not married to or doesn't want to be married to it's the word for rape
 so that's the law
 okay so we looked at this when we went to the law we looked at this specific 1 years ago when we went like how to read the law I think was how to read the laws or was during the law theme study so I kind of have makes thoughts because already. Is that okay. Well so I just want to point out that we're in the postseason reality already so we're already got his accommodating the eating ideal two Nations fighting then we also have the scenario where a man sees of a prisoner-of-war woman wants to take her as a wife or like oh my God this is terrible it's real though this happened all them yes pillaging this is a predictable human behavior in this type of scenario that
 male Warriors will plunder take rape women children take them as slaves bring them into their houses this is a horrific reality of human history has been replayed 9th of times so the law assumes all of this notice this is just like the divorce law when this happens if this were to happen also then notice maybe this is what you're remembering the inverse 11 the male Soldier is depicted in precisely the language of the woman taken from the tree yeah the forbidden fruit Desiring seeing Desiring taking seeing what is good cuz I rang it taking it for yourself it's Genesis 3 Verse 6 just with a male subject of the verbs this is very clearly in the territory of concession saying you've done this thing which is not the eye
 this is going after what you want on your own terms and so what you're saying is then what's to follow is regulations to make sure that at least there's some decency and the way that this thing that actually shouldn't be happening goes down like the contrast here is that the soldier can't have sex with this woman right away oh yeah he has to give her the space and dignity of grieving or lost family of Origins and the only then after a month can he marry her and even then if he wants to end the marriage at some point he can't profit you can't treat her as property or do any kind of mistreatment prefer in terms of captives of War
 this is Ian on mitigating elevating This Woman's dignity in a situation where her Dignity of our baby and you could argue and I read this law you know in classrooms where I have numerous students were saying like so you're elevating the Dignity of a woman like this captive woman to some degree but the fact that she has even been taken if that's a lot already has robbed her of it hasn't gone far enough it's not far enough so here I just want to say I feel the same way I was just like a real though I'm glad I mean if there's a woman who now doesn't have a husband and she's not of your people like it's about you know even if it was a thing of like you don't pay Legend take right that there be any situation these situations so let's read this Matthew 19
 so I can order you the cornering you can you please do that alright you two okay we're playing the Pharisees came to Jesus testing him saying is it true that a man can take a woman as a prisoner of war and and marry her and then decide that he doesn't want her anymore is that true is that true and you could even hold in The Next Step because Moses commanded and they turned it into a command Moses on Amanda that a man has commanded that we should go defeat our enemies and take their wives as our own is that
 is that good and Jesus replied to them haven't you read the Torah in the beginning of Brothers don't strike their brother on to death and a man is given his wife as a gift from God not by seeing Desiring and taking and that's as it should be from the beginning and Moses gave this to you because of your hardened Moses gave this command to you because of your Hardness of Heart and your lust for power and land and wanting to take what belongs to your brother and taking women who don't belong to you like Lennox like I told you this would respond I just really transforms your encounter with the law
 and then he would say if there was a debate then he would are on this is about protecting the Dignity of women yes if there was a debate and it was like where do you stay in the debate he would are on protecting the Dignity of women and it would seem yeah I think that's definitely how it would feel to us but I think where he would located is the fact that Brothers are fighting against Brothers over land and resources and people anyway is it would start there and then he would say Moses knew the hardness of your heart he allowed you to take a captive woman but only in on the under certain stipulations but it wasn't that way from the beginning I'm just saying that in the marriage situation there was a debate that came out about does it mean this or you have to take a side he erred on the side of protecting the marriage correct and so I'm just saying in this hypothetical maybe there was a debate and it was weather
 or you could take a woman captive at all and marry her through war or yes you can just have to do in this way and that's the debate and there was about to Jesus at the end of the day after he did there like having you read in the Torah and Lemak and Hardness of Heart in your blessed and all that stuff so yeah just why are you ceasing a captive woman be your wife in the first place. Like if whatever the debate was he would are on texting the Dignity of yep that's right so that's a different encounter with the laws of the Torah than I think any of us should
let's do just another quick one cuz it out Deuteronomy 22 verse 22 if a man is found lying with a married woman lying here being a figure of speech for having sex with married woman then both of them shall die the man who played with the woman and the woman thus you shall Purge the evil from Uncasville
 adultery is a capital offense executes man woman is narratives where men will treat adultery like it's okay with prostitutes. That it is okay but if you don't get the sense that they're like worried about getting killed oh I see you're saying narratives in the tour in the Bible Well correct I mean in Genesis it's like mostly Kings yourself you don't know I'm just going to tell them one of the stories is rape that's Dinah and I'm second in Genesis 34 and then the other story is Judah
 and Tamar and he thinks she should be executed that's right okay that's right yeah yeah but not him okay so there's that and this is actually another case where we can run it through a Jesus Grid in John Gospel of John chapter 8 where a woman was brought to him who had been caught in adultery now curiously the man's not there that's convenient do you run away but they bring the woman the double standard at work in these patriarchal settings is terrible but it's real so this woman has been caught in adultery in the very act now in the Torah Moses commanded us to Stone such women to death than us the license they're taking their hats at the man and the woman and their dialing it in now they were saying this testing him noticed the same thing
 have you here so that they could have grounds for accusing him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger started teaching letters in the dirt such an interesting little I may be like the Finger of God inscribing the laws on the tablets when they persisted in asking him that means you just standing there drawing on the ground aloof yeah she's playing hard-to-get is straightened up and he said to them the one who is without sin among you be the first one to throw Stone then he stood back down begin running again on the ground when they heard it people begin to leave one by one beginning with the older ones interesting detail I guess the longer you live the more moral failures he's had so right doesn't take you long to be like hell yeah yeah I guess I'm just qualified but it's all like the young idealistic
 you know who think he was left alone with a woman in the center of the Court straightening up Jesus said women where are they isn't there anyone who condemns you and she says now they all left in Jesus says no do I condemn you so go and sin no more says he doesn't condemn her what is not saying is there for just go to whatever you want just saying it was okay yeah so late but what he is saying is I'm not going to ask you you yeah you made a choice at least a death but he's giving her the gift of Life staff that which is totally like the motif of the Gospel of John that the world is creating its own world of death and God comes to give a gift to those sitting in death this little narrative is itself an emblem of what the macro story of the Gospel John's the bound but just noticed again Jesus
 himself as the filling some deeper ideal of divine generosity doesn't say that you learned that from the creation story from the Eden story but that's clearly what he's tapping into is that God is merciful and he wants to give life even to those who have made choices that lead to death and Jesus relationship is nuanced and this for me this is been so helpful I want to read the laws of the Torah the way Jesus did which I think means to model this kind of Engagement with the law it's not straightforward you going to have to learn how to do it yeah this last one takes a turn because what is the wisdom underneath of this law of executing my hunch is it's with similar with all of the laws that have capital punishment aside to them in the Torah their instruction about what kinds of behaviors lead to death
 because it's actually the phrase they shall be put to death that appears in a lot of these capital punishment laws of the Torah it's exactly the same phrase you want remote two months exactly what God says to Adam and he when you eat the fruit when he gives you a man if you would like to come and about which tree to eat from and which one will lead to death says in the day that you eat from it through another bad you will surely die in God doesn't excuse them and kill them. Doesn't kill them he deals a severe Mercy by exiling them away from the Tree of Life so that I can think it was good I'm so God damn self. Don't follow through on the capital punishment for Adam and Eve but he does exile them from the Tree of Life he hands them over to the ultimate consequence of their decision which is that it leads to death and so my hunch is that the capital punishment laws of the Torah
 are doing something similar which is clearly that's not Jesus understood it here he made a choice at least a death which is why he tells her yeah don't do that anymore but what he says is I don't condemn you if you made a poor choice but I'm here to give you a gift of life so that you can make a different Choice okay if the purpose of a capital punishment law in the Torah is to show you what kind of activities lead to death and not necessarily to actually command execution of people play with fire here a little bit that's what Jesus is no I'm just saying like using that as a form of meditation is you're going to run into situations like this group right here who are going to say that I would just kill her yeah that seems like a pretty big liability of this type of literature
 add to have passed on to his people capital punishment Covenant laws as wisdom would hurt her wisdom literature yeah not with you what's also interesting is that there are two narratives about the one who curses the name is 24 and the guy Gathering sticks on the Sabbath and numbers 15 and their the capital punishment at least in the narrative is fall through one I'm with you the other clearly something I'm still meditating on and thinking about I'm totally with you that's a question that I have to do but it is a big liability my hunch is that this was actual law in chilaka these laws yeah I think so too and so did many neighboring countries like the threat this was a common thing to execute people that's right but it may taine's in the Torah for a reason Beyond telling you when and when not to kill someone's right the question we're asking is not what ancient Israelites did right
 we're asking is why does an author include these laws selectively was in a literary work called the Torah which tells the story about the Covenant partnership that failed and specifically about Israelites making choices lead to death by gun to a museum exhibit on Ancient Egypt and you look at some burial coffin and you could ask whoever this was taken from what did it mean in symbolize in the coffin room and of tutankhamon or whatever and that's interesting question but there is another question you can ask which is like why did the museum exhibit organizer select this particular piece and put it right here in the exhibit to be encountered before the next thing in to see right after the thing before it what does that mean that's a provocative metaphor because
 and that example I am predisposed to care more about what did the coffin originally mean in its ancient setting him to just care about what is the museum exhibit are trying to do for me is kind of metal thought that like isn't as important but as it pertains to the Torah yeah that is the important thing is that it's actually it's the opposite opposite what did the author mean by putting it here is the most important thing and because of the cultural distance and time and location from me as a modern reader I probably should learn something about some cultural background in its original context just so that I can begin to enter sympathetically your understanding it but that shouldn't distract us from the primary objective which is to understand what somebody's trying to communicate to me in this text which Moses says you read these laws that have been collected here and what you get is wisdom
 go to bed which ought to take us all the way back to the original command about tree that was to preserve and give a gift of life and to protect people from the choices that lead to death since we were saying I think I tell Jesus interacted with these laws you read them as wisdom literature in white of the Garden of Eden stories and I think for me that's kind of giving me some clarity and marching orders for how I want to engage these laws is the view so honestly said at the beginning of the only reason we're reading me is because meditating on them as part of our discipleship to Jesus and there's nothing for it not to dive in and get your hands dirty and meditate that's mixing metaphors to pick way you start using a farming metaphor yeah diving in into a swimming pool getting your hands dirty and dirt and then meditating which I guess this is like really
 cool well that leads us into where we're going next which is the final movements yes in the final Scroll of the Torah getting there so Deuteronomy verse three movements we've gone through the first two we just finished the second movement looking at the laws in this movement in the center yeah we're going to turn our attention to the last movement of Deuteronomy which goes from second half of chapter 26 verse 16 through the end of the scroll at the end of chapter 34 and Moses is going to get start sermonizing again and also put on his like prosthetic forecasting hat for what he sees coming down the pipeline through these Hard Hearted Covenant partners and it's not good and what theme or we can look at blessing and curse the theme of blessing blessing and curse in the finals beaches of Moses into rock
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week for diving into the final movements of the final Scroll of the Torah in the final movement of Deuteronomy we're going to explore the theme of blessing and curse I think we last saw in the Genesis World we're going to meditate on these next three conversations are this focus on the blessing and the curse in the words blessing and curse go off the charts in the final movement of Duke on me and I thought I might be useful to do something I don't think we've ever done before which is read or the survey some ancient near Eastern Covenant release because Scholars have long observed that the language figures of speech and even the rough literary flow of the Deuteronomy scroll follows or has parallels with ancient near Eastern Covenant trees today's episode with producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by then, Bailey and Frank Garza
