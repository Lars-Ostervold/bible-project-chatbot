explain the theme of the cast dragon in the Bible the ton mean in Hebrew I'll show called The Leviathan this dragon and the chaotic see it lives in our ancient symbols to represent the ideas of chaos and death we have seen how when Spiritual Beings aligned with Catherine that are depicted as dragon snakes like to sit on we've also seen how violent human are compared to snakes and sea dragons in the last episode we looked at Daniel 744 sea monsters who depict for human Empire rise up out of the chaotic scene and it. Daniel 7 we meet Dragonslayer a character called the son of man who ascends up to the sky to sit on God's throne and in collaboration with God slays the sea monsters this is all in the bible really and it all brings us to the New Testament where the gospel authors introduced us to Jesus the son of man the Dragonslayer so today we look at how Jesus slays the Dragon
 like when Jesus is confronted by the sneaky satin in the wilderness is Victoria here and so what we're told do is the Slanders going to be back he left him until an opportune time now there's no scene in the future where it says in the slanderer came to him so you're just supposed to be looking for will where's the moment when that happened Jesus also confronts the chaotic Waters themselves you might be familiar with the story The Disciples of Jesus are in a boat on the Sea of Galilee a violent storm picks up and Jesus is asleep they wake him up and say teacher don't you care we're going to die and he got up and he rebuked the win and he said to the Sea be silent and be muzzled he's describing the sea as a monster that he's commanding a mussel fee put on in the Bible it is God who orders chaotic Waters with his word which means the gospel authors are making a really big play the portrait of Jesus telling the waters to be muzzled it's the gospel officers
 longest way they can portray Jesus as Yahweh creator of Heaven Earth become the newest think the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
All rights we are here where is here here is around a table in Portland Northeast Portland but our minds are on the dragons in the Bible seadragons and we are making the big leap yes I'm talking about the dragon in the Hebrew Bible to looking at the gospels did Jesus for to Jesus in a way it's all been about Jesus in the it's been creating the plot line
 and exploring the conflicts to which the story of Jesus is the key pivot in the story climax of a story but if we're here we're here can I love that all right so there's a little summary in the Bible that's kind of crazy ticular Lee there's a dragon very beginning of the Bible didn't actually but he's there. In the sea and this is actually a very common ancient motif of talking about subduing chaos the sea is often used as the primordial ooze uncreation disorder and chaos and in contemporary mythologies to Israel there's always a battle between a storm God and the Sea Dragon who embody
 the chaos of the ocean and they have to just do get out and the storm God just barely wins and so there can be at least enough order for life to continue and in the story of the Bible while God when he creates he has to confront the chaos this battle with it he just talks to him and then when the Sea Dragon appears he doesn't have to battle it he just puts it in the ocean to as it's almost as play and out there in the ocean there's a boundary between the land in the ocean and there's order and what's interesting about that and I've been reflecting on this more and more is that God didn't create like this perfect creation where there's no more disorder no more they are still darkness is still the sea and there's the dragon in it he just created boundaries and he created the opportunity for life and even created this little Oasis Of Life as the garden
 and so there isn't this like man we need to get back to when things were perfect it was like the beginning state was an opportunity to partner with God he put Creation in motion on a journey towards goodness and then he made increasing goodness increasing goodness right and he put his image in humans to partner with him to go on that Journey
 and then so the question becomes what's the deal with the chaos Dragon well he's out there in the sea he's dangerous but man if you're living by God's wisdom and you're partying with him you will learn to subdue all the creatures and that's the Genesis one in but you got them made in the image of God male and female let them ruin let them Rule and subdue the Earth rule over the creatures of the sea and air in the land and so it's a picture of having dominion over Creation with God and so the picture isn't like everything is great and we don't have to worry about anything
 the picture is everything is dripping with opportunity and we don't have to fear chaos because God's on their side and we're going to learn how to subdue chaos like God did with a creative word just gently bringing order to Creation but the story continues with this Quest where you meet the sea dragon and a new contact the snake and the snake is another way to think about chaos but not from the setting of The Cat Waters but from the setting up of the Wilderness which is another way to think of a cast and the snake is no ordinary snake it's like a crafty serpent who seems to understand the ways of God and what we learn is this snake as actually another ruler the rulers of the sky the Elohim who have the snake is like left its domain and now is using the power of chaos to try to destroy him and his relationship with God
 the Tav humans not trust the boundaries that God created and not trust the unity that God wants to have with humans and to go on it on their own and the humans do that
 and now that chaos dragon and death the death of chaos Springs is now a real reality that humans have to deal with not to stop there on the sea but here on the land yeah are the land and then we learned that when the humans deal with their own anger and jealousy and that turns into the violence and murder that is the monster of chaos consuming us just like it did the sky ruler and so you get this really complex image of when humans are confronting what we would call evil will it just be more generally chaos it comes in the many forms of monsters and it could just be the Sea Dragon which is just chaos is like it's like an earthquake or like you know lightning bolt like it's just like it's just the ocean crashing up against the land it's just chaos disruption of order but it also can be what we would call us in like kind of this like conscious like
 attentional like let's actually intentionally bring things to destruction is the word introduced in the cane story to describe when an image of God with intelligence and an intelligence that's part of the way of mirrors God's own mind and intelligence but then chooses a definition of good that's good in so nice and it ends up introducing death into the world instead of more order in life 3 of the chaos Dragon of the seeds chaos we've got the chaos dragon in League with spiritual forces which is that's intense as a thing of nightmares yeah and then we've got the chaos dragon in in ourselves and it's hard to see in ourselves with easy to see it in like a corrupt than other people and when Some Humans Some Humans who have so much power and influence their monster to become so large and unruly and now we're talking about like the kings of the Earth
 the Goliath the Nebuchadnezzar's who like the herods their heads and we will get in tune and so the question is will God slay all of these dragons we know he can order creation he can put the dragons in its place but the dragons are out of their cage they've their new Fantastic forms you know ya spiritual level and human evil and it has gotten so out of hand that went Daniel see that he sees like yeah these crazy hybrid creatures and monsters hybrid monster hybrid mafia ties that are both separate but then all together they are the seven headed 10 horde monster and we know that the arm of God can destroy me more powerful like you do it so come and do it again slay all the dragons slay all the monsters
 which is kind of a dangerous thing to ask for when we ourselves can manifest the monster manifest the monster and then we took this when we looked at the Book of Daniel and and Isaiah of this human who can slay the dragon who is first kind of spoken about in Genesis where does the seed of the woman will strike the head of the snake but also be bitten by the snake yeah whatever means yeah we learned that this anointed one the Dragonslayer will actually like suffer and die so I will suffer and die but then be exhausted to a place of power and rule over the nation's precisely because he allowed the evil of human taken over by Dragon to kill him
 yildiz Life as a demonstration that he is the power cuz he's author of Life the darkest place you can imagine is at the belly of the Dragon yeah but it's in the belly of the Dragon what unit was rescued and it's the belly of the Dragon where a powerful enough seed can transform the belly of the Dragon 2
 and so can you go through the dragon and actually be born into into New Life That's stronger than the dragon and that's this kind of hoped for figure and Daniel it's actually Daniel and his crew become like an image of that yeah yeah they are the seed of David and they go through the belly of the Dragon to go into the fiery furnace they go into the lions den and they're brought out and they're more glorious and when the Daniel had this vision of a someone like the son of man who is coming up with the clouds riding the clouds who is Slade the dragon the news have to say it doesn't tell you how but it's kind of makes you wonder like man how did how did that son of man slay the dragon and be elevated the right hand of God and how did that happen
 and what we're anticipating now is that it's actually going to be somehow through the belly of the Dragon yeah cuz with Daniel 7 was our last conversation what we are told was just at the Dragon the monster was slain and thrown into the fire of God's consuming power and then the son of Adam was exalted sweeten their The Twist on the dragon-slaying story is that it's almost like God doesn't even need to bury his arm and ran the sword it's just throw it in the fire is done with we're going to get a new rule around here are human ruler this is the one God intended after all so it's natural defeat of the Dragon
 it's kind of minimized and the exaltation of the Dragonslayer but the fuse was slain by letting its with him which is the mystery so all of this is just taken for granted that this stuff is in your mind by the author's you need to learn something about ancient dragon slaying stories certainly not how I was introduced to the story of Jesus sing the dragon slaying stories of the ancient world and they're kind of reflected in the Hebrew Bible
 Well eliminate the gospel narratives about Jesus in a major major way so Shelly
 let's just start with we're going to see is an actual Dragon like a straight-up actual dragon snake to look for the word snake or Dragon will you will find the word snake a couple of times in the gospels in a couple of the gospels so what you have to be looking for our ways that this whole Reservoir associations and meanings are brought together so the sea storms at the sea the Wilderness meeting a figure in the wilderness who's trying to test you seems about how human rulers are described how the imagery of Daniel 7 gets pulled up on this is the stuff you have to look for so the gospel narratives activate the dragon-slaying story through more subtle images in hyperlinks so the first place that we look will actually be the perfect example of that and that's where after Jesus go through the waters
 and the wind of God the spirit comes and blow us on him over the waters and pronounces in his baptism you are my son the one that I love and you I'm well pleased the first thing Jesus does he goes into the Wilderness chaos yes which is not the sea but the coordinated image for example it's the opposite of the chaotic Waters but symbolically it's the same thing so I can see yep that's how the Eden Story begin so Creation in Genesis 1 begins with chaos see Creation in the Eden Story begins with in a desert so Jesus goes out to that desert in order to be tested by and then we have various titles for this figure in Mark Jesus is tested by the city which is the title used to describe the tester in the Book of Job the one opposed
 in Luke's version this figure is called Diablo lost which means the one who Slanders or
 connect is the word accusing summer like you know what this guy did that's like that kind of thing this guy's nothing you shouldn't favor him he's guilty so he goes out into the desert and he's faces three test one of them is about food bread bread yep so dramatically it's similar to the test that Adam and Eve underground which is also about food then it's a test about who can save you who's your deliver and why don't you make this about throwing yourself down from the temple make God deliver you on your timeline and by forcing his hand Jesus said no I'll let God deliver me who actually this is rad so I'm going to go to Matthews version so that second test in Matthew he takes him to the stand on the Pinnacle of the temple which is for sure happened he did Jesus didn't actually like do Parkour in like
 can a dream throw yourself down listen for it is written in your Bible Jesus mixes quote he will command his angels concerning you and on their hands they will bear you up so that you won't strike your foot against a stone he's calling from what we call Psalm 91
 and this is a great example of the subtlety of gloucester's so it's this poem about painting the ideal picture of God's faithful one and here in the Psalms it's the king who trust in God and David's been doing that but here it's just a ton describe figure and when you get to the line that the slanderer quotes from him Psalm 91:11 he will give his angels charge concerning you to guard you in all your ways they will bear you up in their hands so you don't strike your foot against a stone that's where the slanderous quote stop and go to the next line you will tread upon the lion and the Cobra in the wilderness creatures the Young Lion and the serpent you will trample down
 come on that was a bad move for the Stayton so this is a poem saying God's chosen one will be protected by God to stomp on the head of the calf monsters whether they are reptilian inform or lions are cobras so Jesus is not going to put my God to the test the third test is about how Jesus will come to power and he said bow down and give you lesions to me and you'll have power over the kingdoms and Jesus says I'm just going to submit to the father
 and then look for 13 the slanderer finished every test and he's left him until an opportune time so we are in the opposite of the garden in the wilderness the tester is not a dragon land dragon it's just the Heavenly being is kind of more laid bare the costumes taking off their took the costume off but he still has the power he still wielding the power of the snake he's trying to lure God's chosen one over the land and Heaven sake put across your brother costume actually yeah yeah totally take him off once you're in League with the K Australian kind of become a hybrid creature such as portrayed is Victorious here and so what were told there was this Landers going to be back slithered away he left him until an opportune time now there's no scene in the future where it says in the slanderer came to
 so you're just supposed to be looking for will where's the moment when that happened and it happens in The Garden of Gethsemane at the end does a good example of where stomping on the dragon or something on the snake is the subtext of this whole texting such stories and it's Jesus gaining an initial Victory is interesting is his victory over the chaos here the cast dragon is using God's word and that was got the gods initial way to deal with the dragons cranes with the work and member the snake in the Garden of Eden also quoted thoughts were trying to twist God's words are just exactly how that yeah how is portrayed here
 but this initial victory of the snake is just about Jesus this is his inversion of the Kane story Kane gave into the void us about how he was going to gain favor and power and he's showing that he's the kind of humor and who won't give in to the muster yet he hasn't defeated the monster in the cosmos at large you didn't Crush that he just has further away
 so that's an image of the Eden snake there are two other stories where snakes and dragons don't appear but the chaos Waters do really interesting stories so there's two stories about Jesus out on the lake of Galilee where is there's wind and storm in both of them the lake is called the sea it is a really big lake but it's not a it's not a but in these stories it's called the see it's really interesting so I'm going to read the verse in Mark 4 starts in verse 35 so when evening came that day Jesus said to them it let's go over to the other side of the water so leaving the crowd they took him along in the boat just as he
 and other Boats were with him and then there arose a fierce Gale of wind waves breaking over the boat so much the boat stealing up bad news situation. When I was going to school in Jerusalem there were a couple weekends were Jessica and I went up to the gallery for a weekend it's really cool up there just a couple hour drive away and we were staying at a hostel like a really inexpensive hostel bike ride down by the lake and
 it's just one of these moments I'll never forget it cuz it was like a nice evening and we're walking back to the hostel and then we just saw and heard these storm clouds come up over the hills from the West
 and within 15 minutes it was just Monsoon and the streets were pouring like let's letting down like the street gutters are overflowing the gutters pouring down with water all rushing on the lake or boats you know and it was just one of those I wish I was on that boat for the boat was fine but I'm sure it was really gnarly out on this but yeah cuz it was like one of these when he's snoring that came up anyway you kind of gave you know Mia pictures how that happens in that same spot the Jesus however was in the stern of the boat asleep on the cushion he's kind of a Jonah to sleep but this isn't asleep that speaks to Jesus is like carelessness it's just as interesting image where it's like no big deal yeah what's the storm
 so they wake him up and say teacher don't you care you're dying and he got up and he rebuked the wind and he said to the Sea two words and Creeks be silent and be muzzled and the wind died down and it became perfectly calm he said to them why were you guys freaking out do you have no trust in me will know you were sleeping and they became very very afraid and said who is this guy that the wind and the Sea obey him to become afraid PCS Holstein here so three things he rebukes the wind this is a great example if you have a digital concordance just search on the language of rebuke you could do it in English also do it by searching for the Greek word
 underneath it and then look at the use of that word in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible how do you do that by the way how do you search the Septuagint oh well I guess it depends on what type of digital search tools you have a gospel Bible software and it's just a couple clicks and then you can just search through that word in the step to how do you do that either you just do command after some get to know what the click but there's some search right now you can change the order in which we read many conversations ago which is when David describes all the times that God saved him describe y'all as the dragon slayer coming to smash the sea
 and one of the ways he described God confronting the chaos Waters didn't Psalm 18 verse 15 when he says at your rebuke of Lord at the blast of the breadth of your nostrils the channels of water appeared in the foundations of the world were laid bare so you split the sea and exposed to dry land by rebuking the water is not interesting Psalm 100 for the waters were standing above the mountains but at your rebuke they fled away Isaiah 58 I dry up the sea with my rebuke and I can make rivers run in the wilderness who this good so this is God saying I have the power to deliver my people from Babylon to contact stress and he says there's two examples I can dry up the Sea by rebuking it the way of thinking about ordering yeah day 3 of Genesis yelling at the waters
 get back call down go away from the land
 the also then the mirror image of that in the Eden story was bringing water to the Wilderness and that's corresponding image-maker rivers in the wilderness so rebuking the water is the common motifs of when the storm God shows up to confront the waters and slay the dragon that's how the biblical authors tweaked it in the Hebrew Bible to describe Yahweh fronting the chaos Waters and now here's Mark describing Jesus rebuking the water has Yahweh rebuking the waters with power over the water the water Tamar yeah and what he says to the waters want to be quiet and exit in our English translations that often it's kind of funny cuz there's two things he says and depending on
 the new American Standard has hush be still
 and IV has quiet be still ESV has peace be still King James peace be still
 so the first word is C Opa Opa which is actually two black stop speaking to be silent probably means besides shut up yeah but then the second word is it my all and I just remember the first time I clicked on it this is I'm looking at the classical Greek dictionary of the talents God and the word to muscle to put a muzzle on a dangerous animals mouth so that it stops like barking so he's describing the Sea of the monster that he's commanding a muscle be put on bring up that muscle and it's interesting the verb is the model to be muzzled and then if you look at all the nouns that are based off it said modi's phimosis it's all about muzzling Contracting a man
 anyway so it's the tool you use to silence or shut something's mouth which with his nana with the muzzle what's this one here phimosis muzzling silencing of death yeah that's in vettius the writing of various balance where Jesus is depicted in the imagery of the Dragon Tamer at least this one has power of the water and the other one is about him walking on the water this is treading on the water a couple talked about that totally soaked Mark chapter 6 I'll just his disciples around in a boat that he stayed on my end and so he sees them verse 48 Mark chapter 6 training at the oars because the wind was against them is another wind comes on the sea
 so about the Fourth Watch of the night middle of the night he came to them walking upon the sea and he attended to pass them by interesting so choked up when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost in there and they cried out so this wording of walking upon the sea passing someone by is taken from Joe chapter 9 yeah and we read this passage a few conversations, and here it's not a compliment right you're too busy to pay attention to me and dragons and you just walked by me and you passed me by trading on the sea off to go slay the dragon and on the horizon somewhere leaving Jobe and his own version of the chaotic see with his Dragon like you're on your way home I'm going to go slay some other dragons in the context of what it is
 Mark picks up just that concept and he portrays Jesus once again as Yahweh treading upon the cows Waters he's like out there like where does a dragon I better go help my dad so again it's not very subtle if you don't know the hyperlinks you would never even see it right there and makes that walk on the sea so much more epic like from like a parlor trick I'd like to look what I could do guys
 get out of the David Blaine would do like this picture of I see you know Yahweh just treading on the seed out to go Harpoon the Beast with me to Peter to PS yeah this is Matthew's version yes which is like back to this whole idea of image of God it's like hey I want you to learn to subdue yes yes yes okay okay this is the next thing I want to look at it better
okay so listen to the last place and here this is a passage where snakes are mentioned this is in Luke chapter 10 so Jesus has been cruising around Galilee announcing the arrival of the kingdom of God and he sent out a ways of his 12-core like recruits to go out and now he's going to send out a larger Circle that's called the 70 and this is only in Luke only Luke has the mention of a group of 70 and it for sure Leah symbolic something about the 72 send it to Jacob who went down into Egypt some sort of renewed Israeli image anyway we're told he would send them in pairs to every town or place where he himself was going to go look like a little
 Preparatory crew something like that it's also there's seventy nations in the table of Nations yeah that's right at the end Gathering of the Nations being Gathering of the Nations yeah yeah speech about how they're too kind of conduct themselves in a basic summer is don't carry any money let got Spirit provide for you through the people that he speaks to tell me to be generous to you don't move from house to house like find one family that down to host you and just stay there for 8 whatever city you enter and they receive you eat what food is there and if they're people who are sick pray for them to be healed and say the kingdom of God has come here so going down for 17 then the 70 came back with Joy saying Jesus
 did you will never believe us even the daimonion spiritual powers that undo good in the world even those are subdued before us in your name so this is the gospel version of God commissioning some people to go out and subdue rule over the animals and subdue the big never but here in place of the beasts are daimonion Rebel Spiritual Beings even the daimonion subject to us and he said to them while you were out I was watching the Satan fall from the skies like lightning
 look I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy nothing will injure you but you know don't rejoice in this the spirits are subject to you here's what you should Rejoice that your names are written up in the skies
 how's that for an inspiring inspiring talk it's just like you to stop somebody to do something and they come back and he's like this good job but don't congratulate yourself too much at the point don't miss the point look at what we can do now I mean how thrilling would it be to experience that just chaotic power that just seems so overwhelming Tolleson realize like I I can subdue this interesting is he said is there people that are sick there in a pray for them they'll be healed and that surely part of what they're referring to people who were his with Jews often do any healing and exorcisms were one in the state are bound together what do they mean I saw the Satan fall from Heaven well that's a great question that's right
 what did he say what did he see so he conquered over he had a personal victory over the slanderer the Tester the Staten out in the wilderness for an opportune time but then as he goes out announcing the rain and the rule of God it's like he's the image of God who is out spreading the rain Rule and authority of God sent back to Genesis 1 let them Rule and let them subdue
 so here's finally an exalted image of God who is God become human to be that image of God and he spreading God's ran over the land and so wherever God's rain spreads its threatens the usurped rain and power of the evil one who is Lord all of the kingdoms of the land to be subject to him every time their undoing the chaos that they're finding and sickness illness is what Jesus saying is we're seeing the cosmic chaotic one like we're seeing his downfall the arrival of Jesus and his kingdom on Earth as it is in heaven threatens any
 skypower the tub the evil one has it's so it's interesting that uses lightning which is fascinating to think like how humans perceive lightning you know before we knew about power to Sky electromagnetism but it would be really wild you a storm happens with storm to storm comes big storm and then I said that shooting fire white balls of fire down on the ground that's the Lily terrify and it wreaks havoc and destruction when it strikes and so whatever that what was that thing doing up in the heavens if that's what it does down here like this good thing that thing's not up there anymore but that's thinking of lightning is like a weapon some reason as a weapon here it's being invoked as like someone falling from their place of yeah so let's go back member and Isaiah where in Isaiah 13227 when we looked at
 the dragon and the Rebel Star that are coordinated symbols talking about some spiritual reality at work in the heavens that has power over the imaginations of human Kings and kingdoms so whenever a community finds itself freed from the reign of that one and see if the kingdom of God and finds healing that hope it's like the Satan falling from lightning it's not like this a thing it is Satan's rule falling to the Earth and then somehow the Satan falling like lightning is coordinated with the spreading increasing ability of Jesus's disciples to
 stomp on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy so now sickness and being under demonic influence is also ways that your those are those are manifestations of those are all the dragon exactly exactly and Little Dragons little serpents of chaos creatures yeah so in a way what Jesus is doing here is commissioning and now celebrating
 other human images of God who can now do what he has been called to come and do which is to take out the snake and usurped the snake you served raw by restoring God's rule over the land through human image but here it's not through his friends and disciples
 now I still want to have a nuanced view of the snake or the the chaos and that there is what we would maybe call just sickness in the like you no body or bodies fall apart yes but then there's like spiritual evil we're like there's kind of this intention let you use the power of chaos the power that makes our bodies fall apart and lets you use that that's like go in League with it and like undo creation like this team up and that's also sign a dragon a dragon a dragon and a feels like
 those become cylinder Maxi kind of hard to pull apart it is that's right that's why Jesus's exorcisms are called healing
 or his healings are sometimes described with the verb to be rescued the form of rescue from the power of the Dragon which is death and mortality in cuz we're here outside of Eden we're in the wilderness we're in the chaos around under the power of the snake to be outside of Eden is in the land of returning to Dustin death where the snake has power to
 pull us back into the grave into the dust from which we emerged and when you say the snake there you're talking about the rulers of the same guy in League with the snake thing I'm saying in the biblical story humans are outside of Eden subject to the power of death which is chaos or the power of the dirt in the dust plus back in but the reason why here is because of that Sky ruler that yeah they put on the the dragon costume
 and so we're here on because of the Dragons power that costume dragons power that's feeding us to the cast Dragon of death in nothingness the consumed thousands of humans every day so Jesus is claiming that he and his disciples represent a kingdom that is opposed to the kingdom of the dragon and is undoing the effects of the Dragon on human bodies and human communities right it's that same of God saying go subdue the Earth and now we just had story after Story of humans being subdued by the monster the Earth subduing them like just creation undoing and here we get a human Jesus and we're not you know we haven't talked about his divine nature so much except for that well he's described as the yeah the ones that Danger Days
 brighten well I mean in Daniel he's he's right the cloud up in the story of the storm he's out there treading on the Waters of Jesus walking on the water or telling the waters to be muzzled
 is the gospel officers one of the strongest ways they can to portray Jesus as Yahweh creator of Heaven Earth become human well yeah and then what did he do he says I want to give this power over to you guys are at with my Chris we're back we're back to Genesis 1 yeah except we're outside the garden right we are ya creating little Eden Oasis but in the wilderness that very much in the territory of the Dragon this Vegas to lose ya and we'll see you in a text conversation Jesus is very aware of this and he's aware that is true confrontation with the dragon and his victory over it will be to let the dragon consume him and that's what we should look at next
 exhibiting to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we look at how Jesus taught his followers to resist the dragon in the world we live in the version of reality thoroughly compromised cuz it's subject to the powers of the grave and the cast Dragon what Jesus needs to open up for us the way to Paradise were to let the power Paradise out and apparently the way to fully enter into the kingdom can only be by letting this mode of existence that were in die today's episode was brought to you by our podcast team producer to for Peltz associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor Dan, editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey mix this episode and Hannah will be provided the annotations for the indicator podcast and wrap it all the music in this episode was provided by Bible project staff Bible project is a crown for the nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus
