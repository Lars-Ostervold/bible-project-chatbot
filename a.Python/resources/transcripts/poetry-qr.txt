 Metaphor and Poetry  
 
[Start of transcription 00:00:07.0]  
Jon Collins:  Welcome to The Bible Project podcast. Today, this episode is a 
question in response on our poetry and metaphor episodes. It was 
the last five episodes talking through poetry, and metaphor, and 
symbolism in biblical poetry. We got great questions from you g uys 
and we're going to respond as best we can. Thanks for joining us. 
Here we go.  
Jon Collins:  Good morning, Tim.  
Tim Mackie:  Hey, there. Good morning.  
Jon Collins:  How are you?  
Tim Mackie:  I'm great. A Cup of coffee?  
Jon Collins:  Yeah, with Deborah on it.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, it was Deborah, the warrior princess from the Book of Judges 
on it. Yeah, it's a beautiful summer day and we're gonna answer 
people's thoughtful questions about poetry and metaphor in the 
Bible.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. Thanks for sending them in. I had a great time discussing 
poetry and metaphor with you. The poetry video is out. Right? But 
the metaphor video is yet to come out.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, the metaphor video will come out in fall 2018.  
Jon Collins:  In the fal l. It will be a season five. It is cool.  
Tim Mackie:  It's shaping up to look awesome. Yeah, really neat.  
Jon Collins:  So, let's jump right in. Ivan.  
Ivan: Hello, Bible Project. I am Ivan from El Salvador and I have a few 
question. I want to ask some que stion about poetry in the Bible. 
How do you identify poetry? For example, in Genesis 1, some 
people say Genesis 1 is poetry, some people say Genesis 1 is actual Metaphor and Poetry  
history. How can you identify if it's poetry? Because I know in the 
Bible there's a lot of poet ry, and there's a lot of narrative. How do 
you identify that kind of stuff?  
 I want to say thank you because you are a great inspiration for me. 
I'm a Christian artist, I do Christian comics and you really, really 
inspire me. I want to say thank you for s haring the gospel through 
sharing the Bible, through sharing Jesus, and please never stop. 
Keep doing your good work. We're going to be watching from El 
Salvador. Thank you.  
Tim Mackie:  Sweet. Thanks Ivan. That's a perceptive question and a question lots 
of people ask  
Jon Collins:  how to identify poetry versus...  
Tim Mackie:  Yes. But the specific question applied to Genesis Chapter 1.  
Jon Collins:  No, that's a great question.  
Tim Mackie:  So maybe just to clarify, and just because the way you asked the 
question is actually the way many people ask it, so you're asking 
what the difference between poetry and narrative is in general. But 
notice even Ivan, this isn't about you. This is about how we've been 
shaped to have this conversation in the modern era. W hat you 
asked was some people say Genesis 1 is poetry, some people say 
Genesis 1 is history.  
 So just notice poetry is a type of literature, actual history refers to 
events. So the real question that we want to be asking is, how we 
tell narrative apart fr om poetry? And what we assume that the role 
of biblical narrative is simply to give us ancient video camera 
footage of the actual history as opposed to narrative being an 
artistic representation of events.   
 So I want to reframe the question to. The quest ion ought to be, is 
Genesis 1 poetry or narrative in terms of its literary form?  
Jon Collins:  So that's great. Now, we talked before, and I don't remember which 
episode it was and what the context was, but we talked about the 
pipe. This is not a pipe.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  That's right.  
Jon Collins:  What was that in context of?  
Tim Mackie:  It was in our introduction to reading biblical narrative.  
Jon Collins:  Okay.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, just that. Yeah, it's a famous painting of a pipe that says...  
Jon Collins:  This is not a pipe.  
Tim Mackie:  ...on the painting, "This is not pipe."  
Jon Collins:  In French.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's French.  
Jon Collins:  And Le pipe [SP] is the only part I remember.  
Tim Mackie:  [unintelligible 00:04:08.04].  
Jon Collins:  What? You know the whole French?  
Tim Mackie:  René Magritte was the painter.  
Jon Collins:  And the point of that was yes, this looks just like a pipe, but it's not. 
It's a painting of a pipe. And it’s kind of a mind bender because 
what's the distinction? Why are you m aking a distinction between 
an actual pipe and a painting of a pipe? And I think that's what 
you're saying with history. History refers to actual events that 
happened in space -time.  
Tim Mackie:  Correct.  
Jon Collins:  And as soon as you then write down tho se events, what you have is 
not the event.  
Tim Mackie:   Right?  
Jon Collins:  You have the writing of the event.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, you have a written representation of the event.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. And then you can talk about how accurate that was to the 
actual event. You can talk about all sorts of things that there's 
different ways you could write down an event.  
Tim Mackie:  Correct.  
Jon Collins:  You could write it down like...What are those people called in a 
courtroom that are just typing down every s ingle word? A 
stenographer?  
Tim Mackie:  Stenographer, yeah.  
Jon Collins:  You could act like that where you're just trying to capture. And 
obviously , it's impossible.  
 
 [05:00]  
 
Tim Mackie:  Even a stenographer's report is a painting of the pipe because the  
stenographer is sitting in one location in the room and can't see 
what one person's doing behind their desks.  
Jon Collins:  They're not typing out what everyone's doing. They're just typing 
out what people are saying.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, all they can type out is what people are saying. That's correct. 
Yeah, that's right.  
Jon Collins:  But they don't know your intentions, they don't know your facial 
expression.  
Tim Mackie:  They don't know what somebody's whispering. They don't know 
what somebody's thinking.  They don't know lots of things.  
Jon Collins:  So you can read that and you can get a good idea what happened 
in the courtroom that day, but that's not what happened in the 
courtroom.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  But even then, a stenographer's report of what happened in the 
courtroom is not what actually happened.  
Jon Collins:  And then you got the people in the courtroom...  
Tim Mackie:  It's a representation of what happens from that person's point of 
view.  
Jon Collins:  Then you have people in the courtroom who come just to paint a 
picture of what's going on because they don't allow cameras in.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's right?  
Jon Collins:   So they're representing the courtroom that day in a different 
medium and that pai nting is not what happened that day. It's a 
painting of what happened...  
Tim Mackie:  It's a representation of what happened.  
Jon Collins:  And so every time you record something, you are making decisions 
of how you're going to do it and what you're going to emphasize 
and why you're doing it. And this is something I've done a lot, is 
when I think, "Is this history?" what I really want to know is did this 
actually happen?  
Tim Mackie:  Correct, yeah. And that's an important question.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. And I  think that's what people want to know with Genesis 1 
and 2 - did that actually happen?  
Tim Mackie:  Did it actually happen? But that's a different question than asking, 
what's the literally form of this text.  
Jon Collins:  So let's first ask what's the lit erary form of Genesis 1 and 2.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, yeah. This is part of your real question, Ivan is just how do 
you tell poetry apart from narrative? So this is back in the first 
episode of the podcast. We talked about this. Hebrew poetry has a 
clear set o f markers that you can tell it apart.  
 Usually, English translations or whatever translation you're reading 
in, many translations often format poetry differently. They break it Metaphor and Poetry  
up into short lines that are kind of parallel with each other. And 
that's mimi cking what's going on in Hebrew poetry. It's short lines 
of three to five words set in couplets or sometimes triads. So two 
lines that are parallel or three lines set in parallelism.  
Jon Collins:  So you're saying one really quick way to check is, did the translators 
format it?  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, you're going to see it formatted as poetry. Like, "Oh, this 
poetry." But our translators don't always do that. There's all kinds of 
palms that are not set apart as poetry. Especially in the New 
Testament in Paul's l etters, he often will break out in a little poem 
and it's not formatted that way in most English translations. So that 
really is the key marker is short, dense lines set in parallel 
relationships.  
 So however you can write a narrative where there's lots o f 
repetition, stylistic repetition, however, it's a narrative. And he says 
that this happened. But a narrative can be poetic. And that's 
definitely what's going on in Genesis 1. Genesis one is a highly 
stylized poetic representation of...  
Jon Collins:  It's kind of a hybrid between narratives and poetry?  
Tim Mackie:  No, its poetic narrative.  
Jon Collins:  Poetic narrative.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah.  
Jon Collins:  But that sounds like a hybrid.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, sorry, it's a narrative that has...  
Jon Collins:  A lot of  poetics in it.  
Tim Mackie:  ...a lot of poetics stylistic elements. If I could just show you charts, 
Ivan, I have all these charts on repeated words and repeated 
phrases in Genesis 1. It's a masterpiece. I mean, somebody sat down 
and counted how many word s will appear and what sentences. It's Metaphor and Poetry  
amazing. Genesis 1 is amazing. So it's highly stylized and artistic in 
its arrangement and design and composition.  
Jon Collins:  But it's not Hebrew poetry.  
Tim Mackie:  But it's not Hebrew poetry. It doesn't have short couplets, parallel 
lines. And it has a narrative form. "In the beginning and God did this 
and God said this." And that was what happened. So it has a clear 
form of narrative, but it's poetic narrative. And so we shouldn't 
think of these necessarily poetry and narrative as hard and fast 
categories.  
Jon Collins:  We have been talking about them that way.  
Tim Mackie:  Well, yeah. And they are clearly recognizable, but there is also a 
spectrum.  
Jon Collins:  Sure. 
Tim Mackie:  They're like two extreme ends of a spectrum. And in between those 
you can have more nuanced categories where a poem can tell a 
story.  
Jon Collins:  Sure.  
Tim Mackie:  Or where a narrative can be stylized with lots of repetition that's like 
poetry even though it's not poetry.  
Jon Collins:  It can be in a structure of a poem with the couplets, and the short 
lines, but then it can draw from elements of narrative and then it 
could be trying to tell a story. It may have the character and a plot 
and all those things.  
Tim Mackie:  That's right.  
Jon Collins:  And in the same way, it can be the structure of a narrative but have 
all these poetic elements...  
Tim Mackie:  Correct.  
Jon Collins:  ...of repeated words and...  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, things set in par allel to each other.  
Jon Collins:  This is an example of the structurally narrative, but with a lot of 
poetic elements.  
Tim Mackie:  Correct, yeah.  
[10:00]  
Jon Collins:  Genesis 1.  
Tim Mackie:  Genesis 1. Oh, did so great. We're just starting to work on 
concepting our series, the video series where we're going to explore 
literary and theological themes in Genesis 1 and 2.  
Jon Collins:  That's right.  
Tim Mackie:  So I've been thinking a lot about that.  
Jon Collins:  It's going to be exciting.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, it's going to be awesome. Good question, Ivan. Thank you.  
Jon Collins:  Can I poke at that more?  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, yeah.  
Jon Collins:  You know, obviously the debate behind Genesis 1 being narrative 
or poetry, often is because people want to know how did t he world 
actually get created. Right?  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, sure.  
Jon Collins:  And if it is narrative, does that mean that it was trying to be kind of 
video camera footage of sorts, but just then in a poetic way?  
Tim Mackie:  Well, that's a narrative presentation that has clear...You know, the 
shape of that narrative goes from Genesis 1:1 to Genesis Chapter 2, 
verse 3.  
Jon Collins:  It's the creation story.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  The chapter breaks actually disrupt the original form of t hat 
narrative. What's interesting is that the author of Genesis or the 
composer, the arranger of Genesis, has put that first narrative 
representation of creation alongside another one that starts in 
Genesis Chapter two, verse 4, and it goes all the way to the 
expulsion of humanity from Eden in Genesis Chapter 3, verse 24.  
 But Genesis 1 and then the narrative in Genesis 2, they're both 
creation narratives in terms of they begin with chaotic disorder and 
they move with God inhabiting the world with animals and then 
humans to take care of it. But the narrative chronology, the 
sequence of events in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 are different. They're 
different.  
 So Genesis 2 has a one -day scheme, Genesis 1 has a seven -day 
scheme. Genesis 1, it goes, "Land, then ani mals, then humans." 
Genesis 2 goes, "Land, then humans, then animals."  
Jon Collins:  So you think it's tipping his hat right away of saying, "This isn't 
security footage kind of representation of if you were there when 
creation was ordered as much as it is  a representation in order to 
communicate really important ideas."  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's right. The biblical narratives are comfortable putting 
narrative representations of creation next to each other that don't 
agree in all kinds of details that we th ink are the most important 
ones. But they clearly don't, because they just put those two next to 
each other. What they think are important are the thematic 
theological themes that are connecting those two stories.  
 And then you go on. You go Psalm 74 is a creation poem. And it 
has God slang a multi -headed dragon and ripping it apart to make 
the sky and the sea. Or Psalm 78 ends with a creation poem of God 
building his temple above the waters and the land is his footstool. 
So there's many creation narratives  in the Old Testament.  
Jon Collins:  Interesting.  
Tim Mackie:  And they all are different representations. Illustration I'm often 
using now is, you can understand the universe by looking at a 
Hubble telescope photograph. You can also understand the night Metaphor and Poetry  
sky by looking at Vincent van Gogh's famous painting, "Starry 
Night." They are both representations of the night sky. And they're 
both faithful representations of the night sky based on the purpose 
of each of those mediums.  
 And so what we should do is hono r the diversity of representations 
and not try and undo them and make them all one because we 
want to know what really happened. Biblical authors are more 
concerned to tell us the meaning of what happened oftentimes 
than just simply what happened. So, of c ourse, something 
happened. We're here. We are sitting here. Creation happened. The 
universe came into existence in some way.  
Jon Collins:  And it's ordered to be this way.  
Tim Mackie:  The Old Testament gives us multiple portraits of what that was 
about, an d I don't think we should try and reduce them all to one 
formula.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah, cool. Chris Powers. This is such a cool name.  
Tim Mackie:  It's awesome name.  
Jon Collins:  I wish I had that name. Feels either like a, I don’t know, like a WWE 
II fight er or like just a superhero.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, Chris is your hero.  
Jon Collins:  He has a question.  
Tim Mackie:  And you're from Illinois.  
Chris Powers:  Hi Jon and Tim. I'm Chris Powers from Carbondale, Illinois. You 
talked about the metaphor of time as a possession and used it as 
an example of a modern metaphor. Then you said that the Bible 
doesn't view time in this way. However, in Psalm 31:15, David says, 
"My times are in your hand," and in Ephesians 5:16, Paul writes that 
"We should redeem the time." Don't these phrases suggest that 
both David and Paul view time figuratively as a tangible and 
valuable possession? Thanks so much. God bless.  Metaphor and Poetry  
[15:00]  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, this is good. This was actually a little detail in our 
conversation about metaphor sche mes time as a possession.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. How much had you thought about that before you 
mentioned it in the podcast?  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, like not at all.  
Jon Collins:  It seems like kind of just a...  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, it was kind of one. However, though,  I do think the biblical 
author’s conception of time is fundamentally different. That's a 
whole thing that I would love to learn more about. My point in that 
moment was just the Bible isn't filled with the same metaphors of 
time as a possession that we use .  
Jon Collins:  We use it so much.  
Tim Mackie:  We use it so much. "I lost time." "Spare some time." "Give some 
time." "Gaining some time." "Buy some time." And the biblical 
authors don't use that kind of vocabulary.  
 However, Chris, you identified two interesting texts. One in Psalm 
31, "My times are in your hand," David says to God, and then in 
Ephesians Chapter 5, Paul talks about "Redeeming the time." So I 
went and looked both those up and thought about those becaus e 
of your question, Chris. Here's what's interesting.  
 In neither one of those cases is time my possession. So in Psalm 31, 
David's whole point is, "My time belongs to you." "My time belongs 
to God." So time isn't my possessions.  
Jon Collins:  It's God's possession.  
Tim Mackie:  It's something God has and that He providentially orchestrates.  
Jon Collins:  So you could say, "I'm saving time for God," or "I'm saving God's 
time."  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Jon Collins:  That'd be a funny way to talk. Like, "You just saved me some of 
God's time."  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. And even in Ephesians Chapter 5, when it says, "Redeem the 
time," it's not because time is mine. It's because time is evil. What 
he says is, "Redeeming the time because the days are evil." And 
redeem is Exod us language. That's purchasing a slave's freedom to 
release them into the promise land.  
Jon Collins:  So the metaphor is "The time is..."  
Tim Mackie:  In slavery to evil.  
Jon Collins:  In slavery to evil."  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. Time's a captive of evil.  
Jon C ollins:  Time is captive. Oh, that's cool.  
Tim Mackie:  And we in the power of the new human, Jesus, are able to free time 
from its slavery to evil and release it into the new creation.  
Jon Collins:  So that's a great example of — 
Tim Mackie:  What a cool met aphor?  
Jon Collins:  It is a cool metaphor. So the common western metaphor is "time as 
a possession."  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, "time's my possession."  
Jon Collins:  Time is my position.  
Tim Mackie:  So if I redeem it, it means I maximize it for my purposes.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. Right. And that's actually how I would typically read that 
verse. "Redeem the time." Okay, maximize my time. I'm not going 
to sleep in, I'm not going to whatever. Which isn't necessarily a 
completely off the mark.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's r ight.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Jon Collins:  But You're saying the metaphor that the Bible's drawing upon is — 
Tim Mackie:  Paul is using...when you look at his use of the word redeem — 
Jon Collins:  The metaphoric scheme in his head, is time as a captive time.  
Tim Mackie:  It's the Exodus scheme.  
Jon Collins:  Time is in slavery.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. Actually, it's bigger than that. It's just the world is in slavery to 
evil and selfishness. And time is one example that can generate 
many different types of people are enslaved e vil. 
Jon Collins:   Well, when he says time, is he referring to like the age.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, exactly.  
Jon Collins:  How we talk about age of sin and death?  
Tim Mackie:  That's right. Yeah, that's right.  
Jon Collins:  So we're in an age that is captive, an d we can rescue the age.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. We can be a part of redeeming the time, freeing it from 
slavery.  
Jon Collins:  But redeeming time seems kind of triad, like, "Oh, I'm going to save 
an hour." But rescuing and age...  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's right .  
Jon Collins:  ...that sounds epic. Right?  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, yeah. Again, our English word redeem has become bland 
from its biblical meaning. So think "purchase" or "rescue." And 
purchase in terms of purchase something that's enslaved so that 
you can fre e it.  
Jon Collins:  But he's not talking about like, organize your calendar better. That's 
not Paul's point.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Oh no, totally not.  
Jon Collins:  His point is that we live in an era that is enslaved to evil, and we can 
be a part of rescuing this era.  
Tim Mackie:  Totally. Yeah, and actually it's the crowning...  
Jon Collins:  It's a battle cry.  
Tim Mackie:  ...crowning statement of a whole series of metaphors in Ephesians 5 
where he talks about "You were formerly dark, but now you are 
light in the L ord," says Genesis 1. And then he talks about "The fruit 
of the light." So all of a sudden the light grows fruit.  
Jon Collins:  It's like a mixing metaphors now.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. And what's the fruit of the light? Goodness, righteousness, 
and truth. New humanity. Jon  
Collins:  Yeah.  
Tim Mackie:  And then he says, "Don't participate in the unfruitful actions of the 
dark, rather shine light on them."  
  
[20:00]  
 
Jon Collins:  Wow. So light is this type of tree that grows fruit. Dark is this kind of 
thing that grows unfruit.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, totally. And then he says, "For this reason," it says - he quotes 
a hymn that they sang in the church, “Wake up, O sleeper, rise up 
from t he dead, and Messiah will shine on you." So now dark is 
associated with death, and light associated with resurrection and 
new creation.  
Jon Collins:  This is so saturated in metaphors.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, this whole moral, yeah, Ephesians 5...And this is very  typical for 
Paul. His mind is steeped in the metaphors of the Hebrew Bible. 
And so he will mix them and combine them creatively. This is the 
whole point that we will make in the metaphor video is the early 
biblical narratives, especially Genesis, are the seedbed of the entire 
Biblical metaphorical imagination. Light, dark death, life, fruit is all 
Genesis 1 to 3 imagery.  
 Then when he says, "Redeem the time for the days are evil," he's 
venturing into the Exodus narrative to talk about time as a captive 
to evil. Yeah, you're participating in the redemption of creation. So 
he's not talking about, yeah, get more efficient with your calendar. 
He's talking about loving your neighbor as yourself, and loving God.  
Jon Collins:  Living like you are ushering in a new  era.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. Living as if you're in the new Garden of Eden, even though 
we're in between time.  
Jon Collins:  Beautiful.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. Chris Powers, thank you. Good question.  
Jon Collins:  Thanks, Chris. Jackson from San Luis Obispo. The ha ppiest place on 
earth, I think that's their motto.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh man, that is a great town.  
Jon Collins:  That is a great town.  
Tim Mackie:  There are a few times and it seems kind of dreamy.  
Jackson:  Hi, this is Jackson from San Luis Obispo, California . I wonder if you 
guys could provide maybe a short list of other commonly used 
metaphor schemes throughout the scriptures. You know, sort of the 
base layer metaphors. To have those in my mind as I'm reading 
through scripture I think would be really benefic ial. Thanks so much 
for all you guys do.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, man, that list of basic metaphors would be really helpful. 
Wouldn't it?  Metaphor and Poetry  
Jon Collins:  Yeah, that would be a fun project.  
Tim Mackie:  It would be the point that we're really making in those metaph or 
conversations and that the video will be about is what we just said a 
moment ago. The book of Genesis is providing you with the core 
base set of visual images and their meaning for the whole rest of 
the biblical story.  
 So I've come across that idea in  many different types of places, but 
I've never seen it brought together as a way of introducing people 
to metaphor in the Bible. That's kind of, it's a new idea for me to 
bring it together that way. And I've been test driving it in lots of 
different setti ngs and I think it really works.  
Jon Collins:  So you would start in Genesis, not in the Psalms.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. What the Psalms are doing is just riffing off of visual themes 
and metaphors that by the time you get to Psalms in the Old 
Testament — 
Jon Co llins: The encyclopedia of production has been set.  
Tim Mackie:  Correct? Yeah, that's right. The mental encyclopedia that Genesis 
gave you has been well developed by the Book of Psalms. So can 
you provide a list? I bet you could do it, Jackson. Seriously, here's 
the mission. Read and reread the book of Genesis 50 times.   
Jon Collins:  Woo, that's a lot of times.  
Tim Mackie:  I'm serious. This is how [someone? 00:23:38] did. Just meditate.  
Jon Collins:  The whole book of Genesis, 50 times.  
Tim Mackie:  Okay, I'm sorry.  
Jon Collins:  50 chapters, 50 times.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, that's a good point though. 50, 50 times. Okay. Do it a dozen 
times.  
Jon Collins:  Okay. I just saved you a lot of times Jackson.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Just keep a list of the most repeated words and themes and you'll 
get a list of about 75 items, something. Some of them will be real 
basic day and night. Light and dark, fruit versus wilderness, life, 
death, but other ones will be interesting like wells. The meaning of 
wells were cisterns or springs  in the book of Genesis or the tent or 
the door of the tests.  
Jon Collins:  So you're you saying every time there's repeated words, there's an 
underlying metaphor.  
Tim Mackie:  No, I'm saying, oh, the book of Genesis by means of narrative 
repetition is bui lding an encyclopedia of images for you and what 
they mean so that when you venture out into the rest of the Bible, 
whenever anything happens at the door of somebody's tent — 
Jon Collins:  So, you're saying if Genesis...  
Tim Mackie:  This is a design pattern is.  
Jon Collins:  Okay. This is more design patterns and metaphor?  
Tim Mackie:  Well, they are the same thing. The design patterns of Genesis...  
Jon Collins:  Become metaphors.  
Tim Mackie:  ...stock your cabinets full of when a narrative takes place at the 
entrance of a tent or a narrative takes place at a well or in 
wilderness you...  
Jon Collins:  It's cluing you into themes.  
Tim Mackie:  The themes of what that narrative is focusing on, and the theme 
that is developing as the whole biblical story moves on.  
 
[25:00]  
 
Jon Collins:  So you saying that an action at the door of a tent is a design 
pattern?  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah.  
Jon Collins:  Connect that to metaphor for me.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, well then. So when you go into biblical poetry and the Prophets 
in the book of  Psalms and you have a whole poem about, "Oh, how 
I longed to be in your tent O Lord. Bring me to the entrance of your 
tent, and so on." But then they start calling the tent, the Holy 
Mountain or the garden or these kinds of things.  
 So what they're doing is they just assume that you've read Genesis, 
like nobody's business and that you know that the tent and the 
garden, these were all Eden images. And this is all about the return 
of humanity to Eden, but we keep screwing it up. So that's what I 
mean is that  Genesis provides you by means of repetition if you're 
tracking with the list of images.  
Jon Collins:  I'm going to read through Genesis multiple times, I'm going to get 
a list of repeated images.  
Tim Mackie:  Narrative images.  
Jon Collins:  Narrative images . And then I'm going to say, "Okay, look at all these 
repeated images." And I'm going to go...  
Tim Mackie:  Just keep my radar up for those images now.  
Jon Collins:  Pay attention to one of those show up and what's happening 
around them.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, yeah, that's right. And you usually see it occur in patterns. 
Baby Moses is thrown into the waters in an ark. He's placed in an 
ark. It's the same word for Noah's Ark.  
Jon Collins:  I wouldn't know that in my English translation.  
Tim Mackie:  That's true. That's unfortunate. And then he goes into the 
wilderness and the next narrative he's standing on a mountain 
where he's meeting God in the fire. You're like, "Oh, wow, that's the 
entire Exodus narrative of Israel in a nutshell."  
Jon Collins:  Going th rough the waters and then meeting God on the mountain.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Through the waters, through the wilderness up to the mountain 
where they meet with God. So Moses' story is the whole Exodus 
story in a nutshell, just in two chapters.  
Jon Collins:  But I feel like we're talking about design patterns, not metaphor.  
Tim Mackie:  We are. The design pattern, they're the same thing.  
Jon Collins:  They are the same.  
Tim Mackie:  Sorry. How design pattern works in biblical narrative, once you get 
those patte rns, then you go into the biblical poetry in the prophets 
and the Psalms and they will start using...  
Jon Collins:  And they're just riffing on the pattern?  
Tim Mackie:  ...the images of those design patterns. But they're doing it now and 
poetic metaphor. So  you can have in one poem, like in Psalm 46, we 
looked at, "you can have the high rock, the temple with the garden 
of Eden Stream, with the chaotic waters that are the nations."  
Jon Collins:  So with the high rock we were able to boil it down to a scheme 
which said, "The human ideal is just like dry ground or the 
mountain garden."  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's right.  
Jon Collins:  So are you saying that once I get this list, I've read through Genesis 
12 times and I get this list, should I be able to then create  those 
sentences?  
Tim Mackie:  I think so. Genesis created the core schemes for you.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. Well, give me the tent one. So like, being at someone's tent 
door or if someone's tent is...  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, it's being near the ideal. A narrative wh ere someone's at the 
door of a tent then is a narrative about, Ooh, they have a chance to 
get back to Eden or to blow it and be expelled.  
Jon Collins:  It's the crossroads.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  It's the crossroads moment at the door of the tent. And so there's 
all these narratives where Lot, for example, when the divine visitors 
come to his house in Sodom and he blows his chance at the door of 
his house - which is set right next to a narrative about Abraham 
who redeems his chance when the divine visitors come to the  door 
of his tent.  
 And you're like, "It seems so weird." There's two narratives next to 
each other in Genesis about...  
Jon Collins:  Doors and tents.  
Tim Mackie:  ...two guys encountering angels at the doors of their tents? Until 
you realize, "Oh, that's t he expulsion narrative." God assigns angelic 
guardians...  
Jon Collins:  Oh, to guard the tent.  
Tim Mackie:  at the door or Eden. So human's being expelled from the door of 
Eden and then later narratives of people encountering angels at the 
door of their tent or their house become repetitions. And then you 
go to the book of Psalms. And then the book of Psalms has  been 
tracking with all this and they will poetically explore poems about, 
"Oh, if only I could be..." "Better is one day in your house, O Lord. I 
wish I could go up to the doors of the temple and this kind of 
thing."  
Jon Collins:  Got It.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah.  
Jon Collins:  Sweet.  
Tim Mackie:  The Biblical visual imagination is super unified and cohesive.  
Jon Collins:  All right, Jackson. You've got some homework.  
Tim Mackie:  You just got to read Genesis 50 times again and then...  
Jon Collins:  It's 12 now.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, 12. Okay.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Jon Collins:  I mean, you can do extra.  
Tim Mackie:  All right.  
Jon Collins:  Thank you. Tyler from Vancouver, Washington. Just right across the 
river. Hey, Tyler.  
 
Tyler:  Hey Jon and Tim. My name is Tyler. I live in Vancouver, Washington, 
and my question is this. You talked about how the biblical authors 
are using metaphoric imagery to describe the abstract ideas of the 
new heavens and the new earth, and it seemed like you were 
talking about that with like Eden and creation. So my question is, 
does that mean or should we think about Eden and the new 
heavens and new earth as symbolic places or are the actual real 
places? And if they are, how do we understand them if the imagery 
is metaphoric as opposed to descriptive? If that make s sense.  
[30:00]  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. That's a great question, Tyler. My first response might be to 
clarify and to say, a real place and a symbolic place, those aren't 
mutually exclusive. Actually, in fact, most of my experience of 
symbolic places are real p laces  
Jon Collins:  Wait. Say that again. "My experience of symbolic."  
Tim Mackie:  In other words, most of the symbolic places that I can think of and 
that I've experienced, are in fact real places.  
Jon Collins:  Give me an example.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, the ne ighborhood I grew up in.  
Jon Collins:  That's a symbolic place?  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, yeah. When I go to that real place, it's full of symbolic 
meaning of my early childhood, of my first experiences doing 
graffiti and vandalism, my first kiss. You know?  
Jon Collins:  Yeah.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  When I mean symbol...we had this conversation at the beginning of 
the metaphor episodes. When we say something is metaphor...  
Jon Collins:  It doesn't mean it's not real.  
Tim Mackie:  ...it doesn't mean it's not real. What we're just saying is the 
language I'm using to describe it shouldn't be mistaken...  
Jon Collins:  As the thing itself.  
Tim Mackie:  ...one for one as an image of the reality. It's an image pointing to a 
reality that normal language isn't adequate to describe. So this is 
true. Whenever later biblical authors refer back to the Garden of 
Eden, they are primarily concerned about Eden's sym bolic meaning 
as the image of the ideal of God and humans together.  
Jon Collins:  Right.  
Tim Mackie:  They don't seem to be that interested about it as a historical place 
on a map. That's just not how biblical authors talk about Eden.  
Jon Collins:  Because they never actually placed it on a map for you or how do 
you know they weren't interested in that? There's no exploration?  
[crosstalk 00:32:04]  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, totally. And when they do use Eden imagery, they're often 
doing it in a way that frustrates a ny attempt to locate it on a map. 
So for example, when the narrator in Genesis 2 says, "Out of Eden 
flowed the Nile, the Tigris, and Euphrates, and the Gihon, - which 
actually in our episode about it, I was mistaken - I've since done a 
lot more homework on  those rivers. The Gihon, which is one of the 
rivers that flows out of Eden, that title, Gihon is used to describe 
only one other water source in the whole Bible. And it's the water 
source of Jerusalem in the Book of Kings. It's used three times the 
Book o f Kings, and I think one other time.  
 So out of Eden flows the source of the Nile...  
Jon Collins:  Yea, down in Egypt.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  ...the source of Jerusalem's water source, and the Tigris and 
Euphrates —  
Jon Collins:  And they're completely different.  
Tim Mackie:  Totally different places geographically. And the point isn't 
geography. It's symbolic meaning. Because what that narrative is 
doing is it's setting you up to view Eden, Jerusalem, and Assyria and 
Babylon as all Eden -like places that you're going to come across 
later in the biblical story. And once you get there, that's exactly 
what happens, right? The Israelites go down to Egypt, Jacob and his 
descendants, and Pharaoh says, "Here's the goodness of the land. I 
said it before you," but it's a false Eden. It's a false Eden because 
they go there to hide safely from the famine in the real Israelite 
Eden, and they end up in slavery in the false Eden. And had to 
replace with Babylon.  
 So the whole point is even in Genesis 2, where it's giving you a 
descr iption of what you think is the map, in fact, the authors can 
really interested in the symbolic meaning. I mean, there's a whole 
other debate here about what we mean when we say a real event or 
a real place. My point is simply when the biblical authors use  Eden 
Imagery, they use it for its symbolic meaning.  
Jon Collins:  But they do believe there is a real human ideal...  
Tim Mackie:  Yes, that's right.  
Jon Collins:  ...time and place in human history and God created it to begin that 
way, it was corrupted, Go d will recreate it.  
Tim Mackie:  That's right. That really will happen.  
Jon Collins:  That really will happen.  
Tim Mackie:  Really will be a new creation, I think the apostles and prophets 
really. Just like I believe my wife is a real. When I refer to her a s a 
fireball.  
Jon Collins:  Does she know you uses her example?  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  I know. I don't think she listens to the podcast. In fact, I know she 
doesn't listen to the podcast.  
Jon Collins:  Someone is going to tell her.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, someone's going t o tell her. So to say something has 
symbolic meaning doesn't mean it's not real. That's the basic 
response, Tyler. And what it does mean to say something is 
symbolic is to say, the most important thing about this person or 
this place isn't what you could s ee or notice even if you could 
actually go there. It's in me representing them with this metaphor 
or image that is going to help you understand the meaning of this 
place. So I think that's the basic point.  
 
[35:00]  
 
Jon Collins:  Great. Thanks, Tyler. Kerr ie from Australia, from down under.  
Kerrie:  Hey guys. My name is Kerrie and I'm from Australia. Christians 
consider the Bible a book that influences the way that we live. In the 
realms of creativity, how should biblical poetry influence Christians 
today i n their writing and in their creative writing? Thanks, guys. 
Love your work.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's a great question, Kerrie. You know, one way to think 
about it is...It's interesting you're asking it as a question. You live in 
Australia. I don't know where, but I know at least from my friends 
that live in a couple different large cities in Australia, it's very much 
a post -Christian environment like most western cities are. So it's 
interesting that we ask that as a question. Should the Bible 
influence o ur writing and creative writing or art?  
Jon Collins:  Right.  
Tim Mackie:  The entire history of Western civilization...  
Jon Collins:  In n general, and then specifically writing and art.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, in literature and art is entirely...  
Jon Collins:  Highly influenced.  
Tim Mackie:  ...inspired by biblical themes and imagery. Sistine Chapel, 
Beethoven or Bach [SP], these are all followers of Jesus who were 
writing and exploring biblical themes.  
Jon Collins:  And even people who aren't following Jesus we' re so saturated in 
these themes and at the Bible. You can't help without maybe even 
realizing it that you're riffing on them. But some of our great 
writers, they know what they're doing.  
Tim Mackie:  Totally.  
Jon Collins:  So we were just talking about Ste inbeck recently. Mike Steinbeck. I 
don't know if he followed Jesus, but he knew what he was doing. He 
was riffing off the Bible.  
Tim Mackie:  Totally. I'm trying to...Somebody...I can't think of the title right now. 
I have a friend who it was like a cultur al history of the influence of 
the Bible on Western civilization, but it was a popular level book 
just giving like an aerial view of how the Bible has shaped the 
history of Western film music, literature, painting and I can't think of 
what it is right now.  I thought it was the book that changed the 
world, but that's not it.  
Jon Collins:  I think if you spend a lot of time in biblical poetry is going to 
influence the way you think?  
Tim Mackie:  It just does, yeah.  
Jon Collins:  And then it will influence you r creative work. But your creative work 
will be your own and it'll have influences from other places as well. 
So it's not going to just be mimicking...  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, totally.  
Jon Collins:  ...ancient Hebrew poetry.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's right. I'v e actually thought about this, you can watch 
this process happen within the Bible itself when you have the way Metaphor and Poetry  
the book of Psalms reflects back on what we were just talking about 
- the narrative images of Genesis and Exodus and the temple - but 
it recombin es them in all these new creative ways.  
 Remember in our discussion about Isaiah's takes the river of Eden, 
but he reverses it?  
Jon Collins:  Yeah.  
Tim Mackie:  The river becomes...  
[crosstalk 00:38:11]  
Tim Mackie:  It's rivering back as one river back in to Eden. That's so creative. And 
he never says, "Hey, dear reader. What I'm doing is being influenced 
by the Garden of Eden story right now." It just comes out of it 
naturally. And I think that's when you just immersed yourself in 
biblical poetry, it's ine vitable. It will begin to shape how you think 
about the world and that can't come out.  
Jon Collins:  But we have our own metaphoric schemes that are unique from the 
Bible and they're not necessarily bad.  
Tim Mackie:  Totally. That's right.  
Jon Collins:  And so there'll be a blending.  
Tim Mackie:  It has to be.  
Jon Collins:  It has to be  
Tim Mackie:  For you to image God, Kerrie in your own creative work and writing 
means taking what you're learning from the scriptures and what 
you're learning from your own life experience...  
Jon Collins:  Adapting, translating [unintelligible 00:38:59].  
Tim Mackie:  ...and making it all one.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  I mean, what are the Bible project videos except your and I's life 
experience learning communicated through that medium. And we 
all have our own kind of versions of that. So yeah, it's good.  
Jon Col lins: Go create.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, go forth and make good things.  
Jon Collins:   Bring order out of chaos.  
Tim Mackie:  That's right.  
Jon Collins:   Clayton from Alabama. Another down under of sorts.  
Tim Mackie:  Well, I guess we're up in the northwest.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah.  
 Clayton: Hi. My name is Clayton Cullaton and I'm an Area Director 
for InterVarsity in Alabama. Your conversation about metaphor 
seemed to include a painstaking process of proving and affirming 
the driving metaphors in schemes that you f ocused on. Are there 
any guardrails that you would suggest for communities of lay 
people, like college students who might uncover schemes beyond 
the two that you mentioned, or is there a list or resource that could 
serve as a reference to help us catch the  essential schemes as we 
engage Scripture? The work of the Bible project is helping unlock 
the Bible for the Bible belt, and my students, and I thank you.  
 
[40:00]  
 
Jon Collins:  The part of this is a similar question that we answered of the 
homework for J ackson.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh yeah, yeah. Read Genesis 12 times.  
Jon Collins:  Maybe if we have enough people do it, we can compile some sort 
of list.  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, yeah. I wish I could have a conversation with Clayton, and 
then you could clarify what the qu estion is. My hunch is that behind 
it is a concern that you're just going to start mixing and matching 
images and metaphors and you just make up your own.  
[crosstalk 00:40:39]  
Tim Mackie:  Or allegorical Bible or something.  
Jon Collins:  Allegorizing. What  the word?  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, allegorizing.  
Jon Collins:  Allegorizing the Bible too much or in the wrong way so that it 
becomes something that it wasn't supposed to be.  
Tim Mackie:  That's right, yeah.  
Jon Collins:  How do you make sure you're not slipping into that?  
Tim Mackie:  Well, it's similar to our conversation about design patterns. I'm still 
trying to learn and articulate to myself even, but when the author or 
composer of Genesis has arranged story after stor y after story with 
keywords keep reappearing - "The waters" or "good and evil" or 
"life and death," then to me, those are the indications of authorial 
intent or purpose. Somebody has designed these stories with these 
key repeated words and images.  
 So for  me, that's the guardrail is, "Can I observe and show..." I mean 
you call it a painstaking process of proving and affirming the 
metaphors, but for me what I'm doing is just trying to anchor it in 
somebody else's communication purpose. That this is a biblic al 
author trying to make this point. I'm not just making this up. Jon  
Collins:  Right?  
Tim Mackie:  And so for me, the key criteria are, can I show that these key, rare, 
repeated words occur just in these points and they have these 
meanings? And you can see  that I'm not just making this up. 
Because you're right, the history, especially a Christian 
interpretation is that when we untether ourselves from what these Metaphor and Poetry  
authors are trying to communicate through the narratives or poetry, 
and we just start combining i mages because they combined in my 
mind, you know, then I think we're in danger of just remaking the 
Bible in our own image.  
 So that's why this is in 'How to Read the Bible" series is because I 
want to learn how to discern what the biblical authors are tr ying to 
say to me, not what I'm trying to say to me.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah. Cool. Maggie from Wisconsin.  
Maggie:  Hi, Tim and John. This is Maggie from Wisconsin. I really liked at the 
end of the last podcast how you shared those stories about Jesus 
and how h e brought that chaotic waters metaphor forward. Can 
you share any other stories about Jesus or other stories in the new 
testament that bring those metaphors forward? Thanks.  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, man, we could go all day.  
Jon Collins:  Yeah.  
Tim Mackie:  Well, here's two that come to the top of my head. So I've done a lot 
of work in the Gospel of Matthew, and the way that Matthew 
redeploys the high mountain rock, cosmic Eden Mountain theme, 
he's full -on integrated that into his work. So if you trace just 
through  the events of all the events in the Gospel of Matthew that 
happened on a high mountain, he says, it's remarkable. Every one of 
them is playing off of key imagery from the Book of Genesis really.  
Jon Collins:  The Sermon on the Mount.  
Tim Mackie:  The first  one is the mountain where Jesus is tested. He's in the 
wilderness, but then He goes to a high mountain where He's tested 
about having authority over all creation. That's Genesis 1 and 2. On 
the Eden mountain, humanity is given authority over all creation.   
Jon Collins:  So here's Jesus a human on a mountain.  
Tim Mackie:  He's taken to a mountain and the question is, how will He gained 
authority? Is He going to give His allegiance to the evil powers then 
gain authority through?  Metaphor and Poetry  
Jon Collins:  It's him replayi ng the new Adam. It's him being the new Adam.  
Tim Mackie:  It's Jesus' replay of Genesis 3 happening on a high Eden mountain 
in Matthew Chapter 4. He overcomes that test and then He's in the 
wilderness, and then the next mountain is in the next chapter. He  
goes up to a high mountain and delivers his new Messianic Torah, 
the Sermon on the Mount. Just like Moses on the cosmic mountain 
of Sinai delivering the Torah to Israel.  
 Then in Matthew chapter, I think is 16 or 17, I think it's 17, He goes 
up on the hi gh mountain and He's transformed before the other 
three disciples and He looks like the high priest. He's shining white 
garments. He looks like the glowing son of man from Daniel 
Chapter 7. And all of these are things that take place on the in the 
cosmic E den mountain.  
 In Daniel Chapter 7, the son of man is a human figure that's raised 
high up into God's presence high on the cosmic mountain. And 
then the gospel ends with Jesus on a high mountain commissioning 
the disciples to go out and to be fruitful and  multiply. It's back to 
Genesis one again, but they are going to be fruitful and multiply by 
making disciples. So that's a good example of Matthew's totally 
tracked with all of the cosmic mountain.  
 
[45:00]  
 
Jon Collins:  So, let me ask you. Was Jesus then , you know, he was tracking 
obviously with...  
Tim Mackie:  Oh, totally.  
Jon Collins:  ...the Bible and what it was doing. So when He was deciding where 
he was going to go and hang out, was He like, "No, I want when 
this is recorded to make sure that it works  with these design. So I'm 
going to go hang out on this mountain and be tempted. I'm going 
to go preach on this mountain"?  Metaphor and Poetry  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, totally. I think for the same reason that John the Baptist 
shows the Jordan River for all of the Joshua —  
Jon Collins:  It's an important symbolic place.  
Tim Mackie:  Again, it's all the way back to symbolic places, that doesn't mean 
they're not real. It's actually it's because real events happened at 
places that gives them their symbolic meaning.  
Jon Collins:  They become censored with their meaning.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, that's right. So yeah, Jesus would go to a tall hill to get — 
Jon Collins:  He knows what He's doing.  
Tim Mackie:  He knows exactly what he's doing.  
Jon Collins:  He's not just trying to get a better van tage point.  
Tim Mackie:  That's right. And then Matthew, by placing all those narratives at 
strategic points in the overall composition of Matthew, he's 
weaving it into larger design patterns. So another short example, I 
won't go on, but I'm in Philippians , Paul's letter to the Philippians, at 
the heartbeat, the theological heartbeat of that whole letter is a 
poem in Chapter 2.  
 And that poem is a retelling of Jesus as the Adam figure who 
doesn't give in to the test. He doesn't seize equality with God. Eve n 
though it's something He already has, He doesn't seize it for his 
own advantage. Rather He gives it up and then He becomes like the 
suffering servant.  
 So that's a good example where Paul has overlaid key images from 
the garden story, from the Israel st ory, from the David story, and 
from the suffering servant figure in Isaiah. He's overlaid all those 
images onto each other in this poem.  
Jon Collins:  It's remarkable.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, it's a remarkable poem. New Testament authors are 
constantly —  Metaphor and Poetry  
Jon Co llins: It's all over.  
Tim Mackie:  It's all over. Bible's awesome.  
Jon Collins:  All right. Thank you for sending your questions in. Thank you, Tim.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah. Oh, totally.  
Jon Collins:  That was really great.  
Tim Mackie:  Yeah, good stuff.  
Jon Co llins: I have more questions.  
Tim Mackie:  Of course. Of course, you do.  
Jon Collins:  There's more questions on this page, but for another time.  
Tim Mackie:  Deal.
