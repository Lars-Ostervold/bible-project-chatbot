what was God doing before creation existed deep pre-loaded assumptions about what the word god means we'll come out in that question I'm done calling this Bible project and today we welcome you to the final episode in a long series of conversations about the identity of God to Trinity that's right by the Trinity is a subject we've been dancing around for a while now God being one but also talked about in the New Testament as having three distinct identities father side in spirit for the backstory of this Christian belief about God and now we can get to the heart of it and one way to do that is it think about God's existence before creation the claims of the Apostles
 they're inviting you to see an answer that question it's summarized in the statement Jesus makes and John 17 where he talks about father you loved me before the creation of the world John 17 verse 24 and full of times the Gospel of John Jesus talks about the glory which I had before the foundations of the world or before creation but here we get this window into the GSS experience of his father for eternity past and it's the word love our relationship love and see if that's fundamental is the Eternal state of God for a Christian is the father loving the sun in in through the spirit that has the power to completely revolutionize your concept of God and that's what the Trinity has done the Trinity is the belief that God is a community of love
 Somehow God love Jesus before the world was even created sores that mean for us if you got it the Trinity never stops at the Trinity because the whole point is that this God is inviting all creation into the love the father loves the son and so sends out son so that others can be invited into the family of love
 so today on the podcast we dive into the Christian concept of the Trinity thanks for joining us here we go
 so I'm looking at what we're going to talk about and it says the word Trinity yeah. It finally got here we've been talking about God for hours and hours and hours we've stayed away from using the word Trinity but we can talk about the complexity of God's identity and we've been talking about Jesus and his identity as God God and distinct from God so yeah what the New Testament the gospel narratives the letters of the Apostles the trying to get us to see that God is the father and son in relationship with one another if that is the Christian meaning of the word god which just to try and say it in any language and a normal way it sounds like you're breaking all of our normal cat
 where is for thinking about what a being is or what a person is but that's the very point is these texts are redefining the concept of God around this narrative prediction for the Trinity we had a narrative that is depicting a god whose both wholly other Transcendent football yes but who keeps revealing itself himself humans in ways that make sense to us and specifically to these ancient Israelites in biblical authors that makes sense ways that we can nibble comprehend like weather Cloud fire and the name okay yeah I was at the creature side is a human
 that is so in touch with the Divine will and purpose that they're like an exhausting kind of human so he Revival set the table for all those categories and then Jesus and the spirit in relationship to the father and to each other not becomes the New Testaments way of consolidating all those categories into these three that yeah run throughout the whole narrative is the father and the son relating in and through the spirit so could talk about that for a second consolidating all of these things you have 23 what I feel like a more traditional statement would be is that God is three yeah yeah not that we had to like consolidate all these ideas into three in one or is there a difference
 all of these categories of God's word God's name God's wisdom. The glory they all are attributed to Jesus as God become human yeah so what I'm saying is the apostles use this great diversity of names and titles and categories from the Hebrew scriptures and use them all to describe Jesus at 4 except for spirit Spirit an angel of the Lord and is never used for Jesus is it oh no that's right that's right the angel of the Lord appear in in the New Testament and it's not Jesus it's a and it's a messenger of the Lord let me chest fact check that just reading the person are doesn't Matthew o an angel of the Lord gives me and Matthew remember it struck me an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph to tell
 and the Mary's pregnant by means of the spirit but it's an angel of the Lord for the name of the angel for yeah it's like the Septuagint figure that appears in the burning bush to Moses is in the ancient Greek translation just called a messenger of the Lord Angel of the Lord and it's the same phrase used to describe the messages it comes to Matthew to announce the birth of Jesus I need to think about that factor that in I don't know if it's makes or breaks anything but we're talking about is is all of this complexity of God's identity in the Hebrew scriptures and how is he reconfigured or thought about a new testament writings right and most of these things the Divine attributes of God and the son of man character
 all converge into explaining a Jesus says yes Jesus himself used these phrases or categories and then the apostles followed suit and continue to reflect on who Jesus was in light of the scriptures so it leaves the angel of the Lord and then also leaves the spirit of God and to kind of outlier whatever manifestations of God is a human figure whose appearance of the god of Israel himself but as in Phelan to people and is portrayed as both Yahweh can speak as Yahweh yeah but also can like leave like in the story get in right and then you always say you are so distinct from Yahweh Yahweh and distinct from Yahweh that's the plain sense reading of the smartest so yeah would you get his portrait and then what you see the pattern in the New Testament is
 all the depictions of Yahweh made visible or becoming eminent or present within the creation those get attributed to Jesus in the New Testament set the language of the spirit which makes sense because by definition spirit will always be non-physical just invited that such because that's what a spirit is the nature of what that word and concept is non the spirits become a flash makes no sense so we're talking about Transcendent being so we're never going to really understand and create the right categories these depictions of God as Isaiah sees the lower half of God rise from the waist down that's Seated on the symbolic thrown right in the holy of holies but it's the portal of Heaven in Earth
 so there's a whole aspect of God's character in Saint this just not revealed for Noble to us so what we do know Deuteronomy 29:29 the secret things belong the our way but what he has revealed that children have to be faithful to the Covenant. Kind of idea yeah what's the right word for describing their relationship with the complexity of God in the Old Testament and the complexity of God in the New Testament do we use the term Trinity in a package of all up in the way that we see the the apostles and Jesus talking about it but there is no like packaging up in the Hebrew scriptures necessarily there is an understanding that there is a lot of complexity in God's so there's space for that there wasn't any term coined to describe that complexity right correct yeah I think for the most part the Hebrew scriptures themselves kind of
 the boundary lines of the playing field so to speak where Israelite readers and thinkers did Theology and when you get to the New Testament than those lines get ya reconfigured and wide of who Jesus was what he said what he did and then the coming of the spirit at Pentecost and those two events re-shape those boundary lines is the Hebrew scriptures and the Jesus story and Pentecost that now create the Christian sort of like outline of the playing field now we live in thing you talk about God and might have that and the word that came to be prominent in the centuries after the apostles constant going back to 3.3 this as describing the essence of these this complex unity and it's just a pattern in the New Testament of the father and the son Jesus yep than the spear
 so when we're in the new Earth and we eat we get to talk with Jesus and if you ask them so Jesus we figured this all out its father-son Spirit three-in-one would he go yeah great job you figured it out like God really nailed it is much too could in your human category as well. Just kind of wing and go it's way more interesting than that what is the bladder is way too but I guess I'm just as a father and son so those are two words that you know almost all languages all I will just have categories this pretty Universal Human Experience ramli parent-child and then mail parent-child so these are human
 Concepts that are the vehicle of making a claim about God's Essence right entity so we just need to recognize it's a vehicle and it's an important one cuz it's the vehicle that God reveal himself to us through human language of them to the co-authors but it's different than saying therefore I with the word understand the essence of God himself but there is something of the essence of God's character revealed through these vehicles of these words it's just not the whole thing we talked about this already in this conversation at some point about you in any relationship what you know is what is revealed with the other person reveals or what year was revealed by your relational experience of them yeah that's why I want to call this but I know any other being especially Transcendence
 accepted by IU Experian experiencing what is revealed to us about what does it mean to have an identity and I think we began to talk about that I think we talked about this even just a human and humans identity there's more complexity than I think we realized that I think that's right I was I just listening to it interesting podcast Google yes a former Harvard biblical studies Hebrew Bible married James kugel all I did was listen to interview he believes that he's been able to trace the progression of concepts of God throughout the Jewish tradition and he likes it. To also progressions in different cultures conceptions of self-identity psychology
 and he was talking about his concept of the semi permeable self but it's a psychological categories namely that our view of myself there's a European kind of classical video of like I think therefore I am the autonomous right individual and this is very much saying that even our sense of identity exists in relationship to the other selves that we know other people and if my own self identity can be deeply imprinted by spending a lot of time with another person yeah you complete me then in one sense even the idea of a self is a really just not the right category to talk about a person because of a person is their brand is the shape that it is based on the other human person but right there around yeah so this complexity and the power identity is shaped in relation to other people identity is not a solitary
 it's not solitary if it's actually it's something that we experience as a form of kind of Independence in but it's actually being shaped you all kinds of other persons around what does that complexity but I'm also thinking about the complexity of identity in terms of how I experienced someone else's identity so let's take my relationship with you like I have formed an idea of what I think you are who you are the tennis and it might be like years from now we're hanging out and we're doing something we've never done together and you might do something really surprises me and I'll go oh my good at Tim and they're seeing a side of you right now all sudden I didn't really fully know you I just now I'm knowing more of you more of you is being revealed he was being revealed and I'm never going to know parts of you that Jessica gets to know sure so right there this complexity and show your idea how I experience
 that's a good analogy it might be that there's dozens of different manifestations of our friend and he told me that I have my personality because of the the regular John and then I have a he calls it my radio John and now he calls it also just speaking right now I guess it's the John right now I don't know which is like this really interesting and that doesn't sound like Josh isn't how I normally talk I know it's not usually that extroverted or that whatever yeah yeah and it's true like it actually is true and like when we go and when did that thing at a conference and I was there's a different part of my identity comes out yet
 different mode has true that is true for all humans different environments and different people reveal different parts of a ride or identity identity continues to grow I can't believe I never understood that part of me now I know why I reacted this way in these types of situations I never put that together I am just like my father was like you learn all these things and it's your own identity Fields complex even to yourself and then that's just kind of a strange thing about identity in that like you could rub off on me I think this we talked about this like I never doing something in Kent said that's exactly what Tim would have done like so I added him mannerism so like that's only with Tim would have said it so right daddy is become detached from you and now is this thing that other people can let yeah he lives on through others may I tell you that all the time when I'm working on scripts yeah 4 videos
 turn on my Energizer channel manager so a person's identity can live on in other person throughout and memories and also and yeah and how people have picked up on the traits of that person so obviously lacking Flexi-Rod identity yes so already with identity so we don't start with this really clean slate we're not talking about like chemicals or something was really simple you're just like yet every hydrogen atom looks like this it seems like it's not something you can dissect as well any type of Personality yeah yeah that's right where I think I want to come and talk about God and talk about God like he's a molecule I understand right correct we got this piece of God at the times to these other pieces do we have these categories categories we put them all together at lines up and it turns into this and now you can think of these categories in Trivial Cheese's in these categories in terms of whatever and I think I'm talking
 stuff into is trying to lose that like mental map and try to think in a different mental map different framework of identity and O and A relational a relational grasp of someone's identity what does it mean to know this being whose revealed in these texts Brighton through this history and through the person of Jesus who who experiences identity in a completely different way than we would experience identity going is that this being it is a diverse Unity but this being the Christians use the word g o d to refer to at least people carrying a tradition of the Apostles to Jesus is that the word g o d refers to a being who is a unified community of distinct persons
 who are the one God yeah at least those are the human categories by which a linguistic Vehicles right word verbal Vehicles word for us to get as close as we can to understanding the identity of a chance ended of a being who is one and a community at the same time which is why the word love is the number one word that Jesus and the apostles used to describe this beings core character trait and what types of human being mirror an image this God most faithful a human's overcome their other nests and right Bond seek unity and seek the well-being across the boundary line that
 physical space between my body and brain you know there's a relational Unity that love is a a product like an analogy so God is love says John therefore we ought to love one another so you're right but it's we can't claim the therefore we have no God in this entire Essence we know God is he's been revealed so love is the way that got stuck out the most in the teaching of Jesus you know it's God is the generous love enemy and bracing love describe the heartbeat of the father Jesus says to love your enemies and when you do so you show yourself to be children of God to be complete or whole the way your heavenly father is complete how he sends rain on the wicked and on the
 it's in The Sermon on the Mount and then when you get into Paul and Peter and John's letters the word agape love is the word that used to describe the essence of God's being that's revealed to us as the father sending the sun in the power and love and spirit you know we covered some of this territory and John but I think it's worth Landing the plane and not this is core I feel like if it makes sense to use the word Trinity is like the final Landing point to say once we've made the whole journey through all this Concepts here's a word we arrive at the word Trinity but we're defining it in light of these biblical categories of god's complex Unity but then when you step back yeah the New Testament you can see Paul the gospel authors and John using the word love to get to the essence of the thing. Like why does this matter why does it matter that you've you got as a community of love
 love versus a solitary powerful being and to be honest this was a number of years ago I just came across a book I wish I could remember who recommended that it was by British steel Ogen he's connected to the Langham partnership which is kind of a press and a Christian theological Resource Center in the UK the chance. It's kind of well-known figure who started it and it's a community of theologians and authors who write his name is Michael Reeves County Road a book called delighting in the Trinity and I cannot recommend this book in us to every person I meet you know I think if you're a Christian and if you care about how the New Testament is describing God's character I've read many groups through it he just has a way of unpacking this the New Testament dimension of this complex
 and a way of writing about the Trinity that's beautiful prose it's moving its funny and you learn ton and dismantle everything you thought you knew he begins his introduction to the book by asking a question that seems kind of odd but it's a good question into it and he starts the book by saying what was God doing before anything existed before creation of God Creations other than God it's contingent so God has a whole other story he was pre-gaming whatever what was his yeah I like to be part of this point in asking the question is your deep preloaded assumptions about what the word god means we'll come out in that question that question will expose so may
 examine the sun dancers could there be I mean who knows things is that with the story of Jesus bringing the story of the Hebrew scriptures to the combination we have a way of answering that question do you accept the claims of the Apostles they're inviting you to see an answer to that question for this one it's summarized in the statement Jesus makes in John 17 where he talks about father you loved me before the creation of the world John 17 verse 24 there's a handful of times in the Gospel of John Jesus talks about the glory which I had before the foundations of the world right before creation but here we get this window into GSS experience of his father for eternity past and it's the word love
 relationship love and if that's fundamental is the Eternal state of God for a Christian is the father loving the sun in in through the spirit that has the power to completely revolutionize your concept of God and that's what the Trinity has done all through church history but at the core of it is not something you can say you understand right at the core of it is just a claim that this is the nature of this being that was revealed to us in the story of Jesus at an eternal community of love and if so then that says things about who the father is about who the son is and who the spirit is and so Reeves has to come chapters on each person exploring those both going backwards in the biblical story in leading up to it trying to see how each one is involved in this
 one way is to go to the question let's say you have just a single solitary alone solitary being that their concept which is kind of our concept of person but we just talked about even human person to more complex than no man's an island but so if you have a solitary being which is torturous yeah yeah I do want to be a solitary being is actually pretty gnarly took the worst torture in the world what would be the purpose of creating and other for such a being well you know yeah you're bored for the solitary being for the solitary boorboor you need and other and so some way your relationally now dependent on what's the difference between that kind of being created
 versus a community of Love eternal love creating and Reid's Pointe is this just a completely different story completely different type of universe you and have it or you think you're inhabiting if that's your concept of God it's all of a sudden God is an eternal community of love it's just a party going on which is that being wants to share the love then creation or life-giving is like this overflow this sharing of abundant it's kind of like the difference between working for some young person who their identity is wrapped up in their work and they've got something to prove and they're just my way or the highway kind of boss or working for someone who like is already retired already is you know that everything's fine
 they decided you know what I'm passionate about this I'm a come out of retirement I don't need to do this really matters to me yeah it's a Perfect Analogy but he's trying to get at is a single solitary being it is creating and other that being Sovereign Lee has power over and guiding the pretty short list of reasons that we could conceive of from our Human Experience for power complex or boredom or creativity is that creation is an overflow of God's generosity
 and creative love and then if humans are in some way mirrors unique mirrors of that being the we exist in the world in a way that's analogous to that being the relationship to the creation then I was just a different against just a different sense of what Universe you're you're living in
so the fact that Jesus uses the word father as his fundamental description of the Divine other related to so yeah so father is a lot of ways that could have negative right layers of meaning but there's some fundamental portraits to it like a father as a parent like a father and the mother are both necessary for the generation of new life so a life-giver this is what Reeves has the better than I can he says Jesus called God father because he is a father it's a name rich with meaning of father is someone who specially in the biblical tradition and language father is someone who begets children to kiss life if before all things God was eternally a father what was God doing before creation Jesus says you look where you're loving me
 app for the creation of the world is God was eternally 11 father that means god is an inherently outgoing others centered life Giver that's what the New Testament depiction of father is describing just to say it again cuz it's going to be beautiful and inherently outgoing others centered life Giver the Christian God did not give life for the first time when he decided to create the universe where asked to consider that from eternity God is in his Essence life-giving what and what does it mean there by the life-giving well done a community of love to describe one of the members of this community of Love is father means that it's a being a person who is in their Essence the sharer of Life The Giver of Life the outgoing one outgoing one
 and then for a person to be the sun it's the one who is receiving The Gift of Life receiving the love and to say that those two persons together Our God sing a way you're right I don't even know what language I'm speaking at that point Christian Orthodox language so that God is The Giver of Life and receiver receiver of life in the father and son and buy life we mean the same way a father returned our existence Brighton cuz the sun Eternal existence yeah sure eat correct yes so and we're not talking about FiOS that at some point some part of God the Sun for example came into existence right that's a very easy way to take this language and there are have been groups that have taken the language that way but the moment you do that I think you're leaving the plane
 the apostles are trying to stake out my life giving in life receiving we're not talking about a moment in time moment in time or talking about eternal essential nature of this being but what do we mean by life to give life cuz in my mind life is stops of death which is all biological essentially like a creature is alive or its dad a leaf is alive or decomposing the grass is alive I cut it and now it's not alive us are dependent upon some other higher-level entity that sustains that life right like the chain chain of biological life contingent all the way down right so so where does it all lead on the metaphor of the sun is the way our solar system works right right
 so but then what out of what forces are entity did the Sun come into existence gravity and there's all gravity and whole bunch of other things but there's always a chain that sustains life yeah so the image of that the father and the son loving each other eternally is trying to translate this in the good word it is a good word but I think we're talking about in a very almost metaphoric away which is weird cuz it's already a pretty yeah like yeah fuzzy word the relationship with someone else with my wife is very Life Giving I don't mean that she's actually like the standing there eating my cellular biology or be a part of your physical existence that benefits from yeah and that is healthy in a better State because of when you're around someone
 who loves you it probably doesn't make you physically more healthy and many ways but by life-giving we mean more quality of life so that we're talking about here when you say giving and receiving life like a quality of existence well we're both just framing it and he's got us why I love our conversations cuz this was a perfectly clear paragraph. So the concept is of a father a parent to be a father is a life-giver to have a child have a son is to relate to one whom you brought like a / 2
 and so that relationship of The Giver the life-giver is inviting us into some fundamental aspect of God's being as some fundamental aspect of God's being that that's revealed analogous in Denham way to the father's Life Giving correct yeah cuz it's usually the father using its language of be getting the Sun the one and only son for the only-begotten where the sending of the Sun so yeah Josh I feel that the limits of language I don't yeah we're probably are at the limits of language but when when you ask like what was God doing before the creation of the world and there was God giving life and receiving life what is that what is that correct what's the point at which we have come to the bike the boundary line if that's the boundary lines playing field and to say what is that mean like go through the veil of the language
 cigarettes in the mail I think the apostles would just say that hasn't been revealed to us we hit the bottom of the case may be upset at that point once you try and go through the veil knowing this God stops being a subjective interpersonal experience and God can become an object of my knowledge as opposed to that person that I know I know I could read and think I'm probably be even more articulate about all this yeah so I guess I mean maybe take another way to say it and he here he goes to First John chapter 4 the phrase God is love so John again the oldest he lived the longest of all the apostles he had a full full lifetime reflect on this and pray and preached and teached and and so he can just boil it down to that sentence the god revealed in the father and the son
 the spirit is love so that's the god whose Reeves he continues on The God Who is love is the father who sends son to be father means to love to give out life to the Sun and then through this unto others by love we don't mean just an attraction or like a feeling I know you mean it like Jesus style you have to make choices to act in ways that increase the well-being of another so in some way that I'm not going to ever be able to understand at least on this side of the Aged, is that God for all eternity is a life-giving love creating self giver and then also a a being that that accepts and receives that love
 call eternity and who knows what that actually looks like when there's no creation around right but that's besides the point in that at least that's the category of the type of being with supposed to be imagining what I'm trying to say is just trying to say and I think both of us are trying our best to just reflect what the apostles and that's what we can say you can accept this portrait of God you cannot accept that I can sympathize with people who find once they hit this part of Christian beliefs they find it difficult I find it difficult as a concept that there's another sense in which I find it intuitive because I also in the person who gives out love not always very well and receive it and I know that experience you know
 and it's not even one that I can explain with language very well but I know the experienced and that's the kind of experience that the language of the father loving the sun the sun honoring and receiving love from the father is about you can take the idea of the fathers The Giver of love and then the sun to say God is also the sun is to say you know God can't be love if there isn't and other to love the father is bias and someone who loves and other who is that other son was God doing for Christian loving the sun Anonymous author to the Hebrews have the great metaphor metaphor altogether that he opens the letter to the Hebrews we talks about how the Sun is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of God's being so he uses light God being
 l.a. hair God being the father but God will know yeah he's using the word God for the the father so is he here I think so yes because we saying is there's God and then there's the son and he wants to say they're so closely United he uses the metaphor of light and Radiance this is a Church Father Gregory of Nyssa on that line from Hebrews he develops the metaphor as a way of talking about the Trinity so he says as the light from the lamp is of the same nature as the flame which said the brightness and is united with it I mean where does the light begin is the light in the flame is the light separable you know if you're looking at a candle where does the light begin where does the flame and in the light begin he's also writing like to fifteen hundred years ago thinking about photons
 so the sun is of the father and the father is never without the Sun for it is impossible that the glory should be without Radiance as as it is impossible that the lamp should be without bright switch using the concept of you have a light source of flame and you have the radiance of the light that shines out that's the metaphor used at the beginning of the letter the Hebrews to talk about God's relationship to the Sun so that's a different way you have a source and then thing you mitad but you wouldn't have the thing admitted without being completely unified with the source where does the radiance begin in the same realm as when we talked about Divine attributes brightness is an attribute of light or our store of sure of a photon you mean whatever so
 yeah and actually the idea of Radiance and light is directly connected to Glory. Glory yeah so at least there's somebody who's using developing a metaphor the used by the apostles does not father son but it's getting it the same idea because the metaphors different kind of us has a different kind of insight it offers you
 Reeves has a great chapter on spirit and he invited me to read the baptism narrative with yet another set of glasses and I will just read this is a comment of his on the baptism of Jesus Kenway he says the way the father son and spirit relate at Jesus baptism wasn't a one-time-only event so you read The Narrative and it's this is something that happened in the experience that the whole scene is full of Echoes from Genesis chapter 1 their creation the spirit the rule is hovering doves like bird like over the waters and just as Spirit after Jesus baptism would send him out into the lifeless Wilderness so in Genesis 1 the spirit appears as the power by which
 God's word goes out into the whitelist Boyd in both the work of creation Genesis 1 and in the work of bringing about New Creation The Story Of Jesus God's word goes out by his spirit this narrative is revealing what God is truly like the spirit is the one through Whom The Father loves blesses and empowers the Son and the son is the one who goes out from the father by the spirit so his point is the Genesis 1 Echoes I'm just there as like a clever literary opportunity yeah just flourish not just artistic Flores she sang it's making a claim that the god revealed at the baptism story is the same God revealed on page one of the Bible is God in the essence of how God is revealed through Jesus name Lee as the father son and spirit
 who sang the linking it to Genesis one is to make a fundamental Clan about the identity of this God that this three-in-one Life Giving and receiving through the person of the spirit is just the fundamental depiction of God and you go from that narrative when we read that narrative but I think I've come now to see it just the narrative that just invites You Into the Heart of this whole thing and then you go out into the New Testament and you see these three appearing all over the place so you can call him trinitarian text and images Testament Paul's full of them which is interesting because he wasn't there at the baptism you know he just he would have heard the story of the baptism the same way you and I heard it through the apostolic store sure he didn't hear the way I heard it both flannelgraph in his letter to the Corinthians 2nd Corinthians May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
 best and the love of God and the participation the Koinonia of the spirit be with you all so the grace of the Lord Jesus the love of God and the participation of the spirit so God has become a stand-in for father yes that's right so that's another layer that is another layer of confusion because sometimes God's a stand-in for Yahweh is Lord Elohim referring to but in the New Testament is God always referring to the father or is it sometimes referring to Yahweh well most of the next example 4:4 and this is important cuz he's talking about how we are invited to participate in the Eternal community of love he says so you all are Sons you've all been adopted
 sons of God's covenant family because you are Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son into our hearts and when the personal presence of the spirit of the sun is moving you to realize who you are as a human what will you cry out your cry out all the father you realize that the Eternal community of Love is inviting you in to receive the same love as one of God's beautiful image band creatures so it's interesting there he uses Spirit son father and the sentence begins with the word of God God sent the spirit of the Sun so that you can cry out by means of the spirit of the sun father is that first God referring to Father God the father or is it just referring to
 yes the community of Love is inviting you in how by sending out the spirit of the sun into your own heart and mind so that you can understand to it's my contacts whether or not God referring to hunt text father or like to eat the tri Unity that's correct example cuz God and Father appeared on the same passage and are they the same but also distinct in that the father is one of the three and this verse Galatians 4 is making a pretty pretty big claim here for the big idea which is that what it comes down to all this it's not just this theoretical thing it's an invitation to participate in this relationship and the way we participate is by kind of identifying as such a son as well that's right and this is where we get into these passages and then you test
 call Jesus brother my brother might be the preeminent among our family cuz he was human right and I'm human. Half-brother then I think that's actually going outside the Apple stock. He's a peaceful human so in that sense he's my human brother my full human brother has my full human brother and yes that's right so you can't actually didn't to view that as a trinity never stops at the Trinity cuz the whole point is that this God is inviting all creation into the love party loves the son and so sends out the Sun so the others can be invited into the family of love so you can't even divorce the sun other humans getting brought in to become Sons and Daughters that's an
 parent parts of this portrait of God part of God's I did invite others in to create so that others can share in the love Reeves goes on this God Reeves says simply doesn't fit the mold of any other religious category the Trinity isn't some in the essential add on to God or some optional software that can be plugged into him at bottom in essence this God is not first of all Creator or ruler or even deity in some abstract sense According To Jesus the apostles God is Father loving his son in the participation of the spirit a guide who is in himself a community of Love who before all things could never be anything but love and if you trust and come to know such a being
