if you made it this far in the Bible you read three chapters of strange stories dance genealogies ancient lock code but nothing could prepare you for what you're about to read a book so dense and foreign we jokingly call it Priestley tech manual but have no fear because as we waved through the scroll of Leviticus will find the Priestly tech manual is actually a story Leviticus picks up where we left off in Exodus Moses went up to meet with God on Mount Sinai and he's there for 40 days and 40 nights receiving Israel's law including the blueprints for a sacred tent in which God will come and live among them at the end of The Scroll of Exodus God's presence comes down off the mountain into the tent the Moses can't enter because there's something horribly wrong with Israel the people which is promised to follow God's law had grown tired
 and afraid of Moses being up on the mountain so long and they made a God out of gold shaped in the form of a calf the most of his inability to enter in because of the people's failure at the golden calf is an analogy to Adam and Eve's failure at the tree and then their inability to get back into eaten and Leviticus comes into the story as a bridge a way to enter the tent and to be with God in spite of their adulteress Hearts The Book of Leviticus is interested in this dilemma how does the author of all life to stay in relationship with those who love that it. As the sun The Book of Leviticus is the atmosphere that protects us from its Brilliance what I'm doing is saying I want to be exposed to the Sun and it's good and that good thing is at the same time dangerous it will kill me and that doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's the Sun from John Collins
 going to Bible project podcast Today We Begin The Scroll of Leviticus reading it Movement by movement Leviticus has three movements the first movement chapters 1 through 7 is all about sacrifices and offerings in the ritual Habits by which Israel will dedicate itself over to God Super Pair your imaginations to put yourself in the ancient world in the wilderness learning what it means to live in proximity with God thanks for joining us here we go
Hilton age on high here we are here we are again talking about the Bible say we are again talking about the Bible new part of the Bible for us but yes which is really exciting Leviticus The Scroll of Leviticus you have you called this the Priestly tech manual yeah for a lot of years I like that phrase yeah yep it's Charming it makes it makes a really intimidating book feel a little Charming yeah you know I think I either heard a friend refer to it that way like a long time ago when I was in grad school University of Wisconsin and then
 Hebrew in smithwick's department so or I heard some version of it in the Priestly Tech man was my my stamp and I suppose we'll be great about these next few conversations is even though I still kind of like to tongue and cheek refer to it that way I actually don't think that is accurate description at all anymore okay that's right and so if you've been following the long you've seen that we we did four movements in Genesis we train for different themes in three movements and Exodus 3 new themes now where in Leviticus yes and they're going to be 3 movement there are three Yep they're three movements the book has a
 discernible structure into three movements in this conversation right now and then we're going to die then and Trace again one theme for movement tracing today yeah we are going to a game show host is 137 and it's all about the five different sacrifice is not Frank's that the Israelites I'm used to honor their God Yahweh and approached his presents with so it's the theme of sacrifice and atonement is what we're focusing on and whether we finish that same conversation you know right now in this I think we can end this conversation right here but first I'd like to do an overview of the whole book real quick of the three movements and then we'll dive into chapters 1 through 7
 read the most like that Priestly tech manual the most techie of Leviticus and then of Leviticus within the 20 got ready at 11 so the Torah has five main parts to it Survive by Scrolls what's interesting about the first and the last Genesis and do drugs Genesis and Deuteronomy is that they are the outer frame of the tour I have your five-part literary work and also they have a lot of similarities specifically the way that they end so the Genesis scroll ends with
 Jacob the grandson of Abraham on his deathbed and he gathers his twelve Sons around him and he says gather together my son's and I will tell you what will happen at the end of days we all three how your name in Hebrew and he sings or a chance this poem where he forecast the future that we anticipate our sons and beautiful poem and then he dies afterwards on the other end of the Torah Deuteronomy the whole book is a collection of speeches by Israel leader of that time Moses almost a whole book is like a speech at the narrative begins as a narrative but the narrative is mostly about a Moses Getting from people and speaking to them before he dies and so the last chapters of Deuteronomy he is about to die he gathers the sons of Israel Israel as the name the other name
 Jacob Jacob who was about to die at the end of Genesis now here's Moses addressing the sons of Jacob in Deuteronomy and he says everybody gather together let me tell you what is going to happen at the end of days do you have to retie your name and he sings not one final time but to chance to Palms one of them is a show Jacob up yeah is a blessing on all the 12 tribes we go through all the 12 tribes and actually those blessings on the Twelve Tribes have a lot of verbatim copy and paste from Jacob's other also the additional pain is what we called Deuteronomy 32 and here he forecasts the whole history of Israel that you're about to read through in what we call Joshua just Samuel and kings in the forecast the history of Israel as the future of betrayal of Yahweh who rescued them from Egypt and violating the Covenant they made with him and
 their own self-destruction the Yahweh will hand them over to you trust that God will restore a Remnant out of that destruction and birthed a new group of people out of that but he calls the Servants of the Lord so that's how me and so it ends much like genesis so those are the outer frames inside of those frames are what we call three bucks Exodus Leviticus and numbers but those three Scrolls actually form the center a Triad at the center of the tour of the Torah and the whole things that elaborate Symmetry and numbers Exodus begins with the people enslaved in Egypt they leave Egypt and then to go through the Wilderness and then about the second half of Exodus is there parking at Mount Sinai in the wilderness numbers begins with them parked at
 Mount Sinai but about to leave and so Exodus ended with setting up the Tabernacle numbers begins with preparing the Tabernacle to become mobile and so the end of exodus in the beginning of numbers match both about parking at Mount Sinai and getting the Tabernacle ready on the outside of that Exodus before they got to Sinai they went through the Wilderness on the other side of that in numbers after they leave Sinai they go through the Wilderness and both those Wilderness sections have stories of Israel grumbling for water for bread God sending the Manna Moses being unable to lead the people alone so God raises up help for him so a lot of the same themes that we already saw in the wilderness journeyman Exodus and actually the stories of the Wilderness wandering in Exodus are picked up and developed in numbers and sometimes verbatim
 black sometimes the events happening at the same places like a place called Mary bar where Moses brings water out of a rock band Exodus 17 and then a mehraban numbers 20 Springs water out again but first time is Success second time it's a failure for Moses so those are clearly matching so you see Deuteronomy and Genesis match out of frame inside of that Exodus and numbers match inner frame which place is Leviticus at the epicenter of the center of the chapters 17 is all about the sacrifices and offerings in the ritual Habits by which Israel will dedicate itself over to God cut through the offerings with 127 that's the first movement of Leviticus the third movement of Leviticus from chapter 17 to 27 and also begins talking about sacrifices and offerings and 17 and then the rest of the book
 how Israel will surrender itself over to God not true sacrifice is not ferrings but through a dedication to Holiness and to Justice within their communities and so it's a lot of laws about personal integrity and then social integrity and Justice so one through seven and then 17227 become like the tertiary for the 3rd the 1st and the 3rd and what that leaves is Leviticus chapter 8 through 16 as the center of Leviticus it's also the center of Exodus two numbers which is the center of the Torah center of the center of the center and so it's a design structure that is repeated on all scales of biblical literature throughout so this isn't unique to the Torah that they have an obstruction of The Sermon on the Mount for example is designed exactly the same way with an intro in a concluding
 a large center with three parts and then each of those three parts has three parts many books of the Bible are designed it this way so what's cool about this Leviticus frame is what it means is that the center of the center of the center of the Torah is Leviticus 8 through 16 then it culminates what's the center of a to 16th yeah well it's more of the outer frames of 16 or all about the dedication of the Tabernacle like it finally gets up and running. His dwelling with his people the priests are running it's awesome this is chapters 8 through 10 and then two sons of Erin they blow up big time they decide to just make up their own liturgy for how they're going to operate in the temple and it doesn't go well they get eaten by God's fire sadness and then what happens is all of a sudden you have dead bodies stuck in the Holy place in the most sacred play
 Edward Israel so then you have long chapters about the ritual purity of Israel and then that tragedy that happens in the 10 is resolved by 16 which is the day of atonement just all about the purification of the Holy space from all the sin and Des is real he kept on it so at the center of the center of the center of the Torah is about the defiling in the vandalizing of God's holy space and then about its purification Restoration in the day of atonement so if it's a special sacrifice cuz it already seem like he's trying other sacrifice totally have this one's like this like David is the sacrifice of all Tax Services of the central sacrificial liturgy at the heart of what the Tabernacle means it is at the heart of the whole Torah yeah that's right so that's the design we're going to spend you know next week conversations kind of
 more of that view
 so let me show you one more out something then this will actually set us up to really understand the first movement of Leviticus which is about the five sacrifices and offerings that happened on the daily basis for the Israelites
okay so the basic thing to recall is at Exodus Leviticus and numbers are the center of the Torah and they are one unified big section crap that happened in three schools but they're all there's a unified narrative leaving this together and so it's called technology one of the easiest ways that bill Quast did this was to make sure they can coordinate the endings and beginnings of Scrolls you can really over Italy see the connections connections that when you finish and you roll it up then you go put it on the shelf and you get a new one and when you begin the first sentence is that the next call you know maybe it's the next day or maybe it's you know the next minute but either way the biblical authors made sure to coordinate the beginnings of ending of school so we called it at the end of Exodus the people of Israel had become the hosts of the Divine Glory cloud
 fiery presence became the hosts of the Divine Glory Cloud yeah and we were talking about is we were camped out at Mount Sinai I guess we still are there in the narrative where is real comes they see God's like thunderous fiery presents on top of the mountain Moses gets to go up and he's transformed in some way and he has all these cool interactions with the Yahweh and then yeah we give him the blueprints of the Tabernacle which is the place within God comes in all that crazy fiery Glory power comes and settles there and it's a place where Israel can access God
 not this like free-for-all there's like a lot of structure into exactly but that's what you're saying is there another hosts of the Divine like they get till I carry this around the kind of got chauffeur it away yeah yeah and I mean he invited them to be that when he brought them to Mount Sinai and said if you listen to my voice and adhere to the Covenant that we're about to agree to then you will become a kingdom of priests and a holy nation so that is a whole nation of Priestly represent the will show and Mirror to the nation's what the Creator God is like what that also means as they will become a holy nation so holiness it's the Hebrew word kadosh was the adjectives holy and then Holiness or holy place is called kodesh or Mick Dodge but things are holy
 in the story The Bible because they are people places or things that have been brought into proximity to the creator of all that is who is not a thing in creation write the Creator God in the logic of the biblical story is someone who is above all in 3 wall and in the hall and that's what the word holy man's holy means proximity to the IM to call something to call a person place or thing holding me and somebody who has been invited to live and work in exist in proximity to the Most Holy One by proximity it's about proximity that's right in our holiest video that we made at the beginning of the project will use the metaphor of the Sun
 as God being like a split son just a minute for just a minute so the sun is Bo's Life Giving Source of Life all of our solar system and it is also dangerous cuz it's just pure raw power and energy and so to go near to the sun you need to modify your way of existing you need to change so put on a sunsuit you're talking about like not like going out and sunbathing that's one thing make sure I mean that's well I think that's right super super thin but a long sleeve hooded shirt yeah it's just been a long day like out backpacking or camping and the wind blows right through it Breezy but something you don't
 don't understand no angel have to be all greasy close to the Sun I need to protect myself and it's good and that good thing is at the same time danger it will kill me and that doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's the sun it's the nature of sun and then now imagine I modify my selfie to be fit to be in the presence of the Sun in that and that's that's being wholly and that is taking on some aspect right change my normal way of existing to live in proximity to the Sun and that's putting out of sun shirt makes me wholly in relationship to the Sun so I'm sure Matthew holy moly yep he is the dictionary definition of the Most Holy One
 do you ever see that movie is it called sunshine it's about like this space Voyage to the sun 2007 movie
 yeah find sci-fi psychological Thriller to reignite a dying Sun wow what are you do fire up like a warhead it is a psychological thriller so if you're into those but it does like it makes you realize how intense the sun is this is like and I remember the Holiness video we actually like show like this rock it like a flying towards the Sun and then just obliterating and how do you prepare yourself to like exit the atmosphere and go to the sun set in a way entering the holy of holies is like it's it's another layer it's like any more than a century to need and that's why there's a huge emphasis on the clothing the special clothing that the high priest wears as he enters into that space these are fundamental categories for understanding the Biblical story so holding us
 God is the source of pure power goodness yep Beauty life often depicted with the imagery of light or fire so to approach the source of all life and power and energy and beauty is both good and dangerous so what God invites but Israelites to be is to become the hosts of his fiery holy presence and that's going to require big modifications to their Isabel as it stands and so you get this fundamental distinction between Holiness and what is common the opposite of holy is coming or X's English word King James where does profane profane sounds like it's bad yeah I know man just sounds like it's yeah just normal saying used to mean common but now it means other things to us but that's why I just use the word comment.
 key binary is Holy vs. common okay so what the Tabernacle represents we spent the last few conversations talk about the Tabernacle it represents the holy space forgot the presents but the center of the camp of Israel outside of holies because God is there and get out of this time but there's another sense of holy which is modifying yourself environment and anybody or anything or any time that comes into closer intense proximity to God's presence and purpose has to undergo some kind of change or modification and so that's why you have these curtains and Tents like the Tabernacle is one kind of like container both really it's for protection to protect Israel but it's just the curtain you know this all feels like playacting a little bit it is ritual symbolism
 the ritual symbolism that tells a story it is play rituals and symbols are there narratives in visual habitual form right now we're going to get into that what is a Sacrament but then it's more than that God will allow a curtain yeah but that's what symbolically that's what it means and then there's that there's a big tent fence around that creates a courtyard around the tent and everything outside of the courtyard is common well not quite actually it goes in concentric circles so you have this the holy of holies at the center that's like the most holy thing then you have the Courtyard area surrounded by the fence and so that it's a holy spaced a little less holy then you have the whole Camp of Israel which is even then a little less
 holy but still holy cuz it's a holy nation because it's the nation that plays host to the present and then outside of the camp is, the nation's yep the nation's or just the Wilderness awareness and so that's that's common so you have increasing concentric circles of Holiness focusing in on the spot and it is both good and dangerous and that's a hard saying the balance I know for modern readers cuz we think will if you're good you're not dangerous but in this way we have to adjust our imaginations and you don't CS Lewis famously try to accomplish this to The Chronicles of Narnia depicting the god figures as one who was a lion who was both kind and good but also both cuddly and vicious vicious yes and he was trying to capture that Biblical Portrait of gods and their famously Lucy asks are you safe
 is he safe is he safe for the team something he's not telling him but he's good at it for the biblical authors that just that's why I think the sun is a good metaphor cuz we don't think the sun is bad because it burns our skin or if we just think it's the sun it's some deficiency in me that makes sunburn man so I need to adapt okay so that's fundamental so at the end of Exodus God takes up residence except there's a problem so God's taking up residence among a people who as we learned in Exodus is fundamentally they don't get their son shirts on yeah and they don't want to the story of the golden calf is a storytelling you God is taking up residence among the people who win their hearts
 do not want to be bothered I'm they're going to create a different God this is the god that brought us out of Egypt that's fine just abandon the true God so that is the kind of people that the Divine Glory Holiness Glory has taken up residence among and sold the last paragraph of Exodus this we're going to read right now this Exodus 40:34 and following and it's both High Point and then immediately a low point it's like this it says so the cloud came and covered over the tent of meeting so this was the Divine fire cloud of you always presents Europe that was on top of the mountain and it moves down over the Finish Tabernacle
 in the glory of you always stilled the Tabernacle and you're like a ray in the moment where the scientist like figures out you Clear Vision all comes down to the power and the power the power is here but remember the power was always and the reason for it at the beginning all the way back when God for said okay make a tent the reason for the tent was so that I may dwell among you and from there I will speak to you from the middle of the tent like it's a place for communion I will meet with you they're supposed to be the tent of meeting which is what it is which is what it called the tent of meeting of the tent for God and his people to meet together as one okay so the cloud Comes The Glory fills the tent here like you yes and then the next sentence but Moses was not able to enter into the 10th
 a meeting it's called the tent of meeting but does not Aid our mission but he's not able to meet I mean it that is highlighting his hair. What a mental problem was for him the meeting of God and his people and Moses has shown himself to be the only faithful one cuz Moses was hanging out with gun on top of mountain yes he was meeting with God and a type of in the middle of the fiery cloud of light then they construct the Tabernacle of God says to and got comes down and then Moses can't meet with got any more there that's how the scroll that's right and the only thing that has changed since God said build me a tent and I'll meet with you there and now here's Moses with the finished and trying to get in and can't meet got it but there's like keeping up on the only thing that happened in between those two moments that could explain this is the story of the golden calf
 this relationship is from its beginning a ruptured one fragile fragile relationship and so Moses's inability to enter into the tent is in the last paragraph of The Exodus Crowell it's a crisis it's a way of introducing an unresolved conflict that is going to drive you into the next 12th which is Leviticus so we focused on this real briefly in our our videos on Exodus Leviticus a number is the same as with most us not being able to go into the tent and then that the significance of that is reflected in the opening line of Leviticus then Yahweh called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting side. Talking to him from it it's right here we are at the ending of The Exodus call and the beginning of the Leviticus scroll I've been in it together yeah the same moment Moses is not able to go in
 turn the next goal is to buy picks up yeah we spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting when you turn to the beginning of the next scroll which is numbers 1 verse 1 it begins and Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting you got it in you got in so it's it's kind of cool the ending of Exodus the first sentence of Leviticus the first sentence of numbers are all coordinated in a in a in a like a plot sequence so the crisis that began at the end of Exodus Moses can't go in Venice highlighted emphasized that the beginning of Leviticus has somehow been resolved by the time that we get two numbers and it's the easy way to think about what is happening it's actually a way to succeed at the Priestley tech manual is actually
 story yeah okay trapped in the story the story the story is I want to be in your presence I want to meet with you but there's a problem is you can't come into proximity with me Leviticus then why because
 that was a kid with the golden calf and that's Lucy's in the Bible building but it's just God said I'm going to come too well with you meet with you in the tent and speak to you in the tent golden calf let's build the tent now we can't meet with God so what God wanted is now a thing that can't happen why and it's not just cuz you know. They're humans it's because Moses is the representative of a group of betraying failed Covenant Partners so the relationship is bro has been broken because of idolatry and and that now the golden cap highlights that but that's the case already I mean that's the story of the Bible totally that's right that's so remember narratively yeah that's the logic in the story of Israel is
 laying out yeah the Story of All of humanity which is why we're not if we could then we will along the way to some but showing how this all maps onto the story of Adam and Eve in the garden and their Exile from the garden and their inability to get back in to the holy place to the holy place so Moses is inability to enter in because of the people's failure at the golden calf is an analogy and verbally hyperlinked in lots of ways to Adam and Eve's failure at the tree and then their inability to get back into Eaton OK disses been a rabbit Trail but I'll talk to Adam and Eve Adam and Eve for 2nd and that they're in the hotspot presents and they don't have the sun shirt on they don't write like there's no they don't need it there just naked yeah hanging out with God so there's something about that stage of humanity
 worth at the moment that they were able to be in God's presence they were blameless they were blameless they didn't know good and that they were they were moral infants just like a baby is morally blameless hasn't said I hate you stomped away and throwing Legos at their sibling yet you know what I mean like hasn't so there are sons of Adam and Sons of Adam and Eve but what God wants to do is recreate eating Outpost among these people and right now I'm Moses and and these people are not blameless and they're not blameless and neither is Moses but Moses is willing to surrender his life for people who are not blameless that Moses has a glitch in the whole story so far. We talked about this
 like no one's supposed to be able to get that close to God like he's he's connected to God in a way that just doesn't make sense right and the time and place where he was able to go into the fire of God's glory was when it was up in the skies here but now that is taken up residence among and idolatrous to train people now Moses can't go in because he is the leader of those people that's right so and God is now among people not up in the sky now among the people and so there's an unreconciled tension between God and his people that is going to have to be resolved yet for this to become the tent of meeting and then when we get to the Book of Numbers Moses is an and so the question becomes
 how did Moses get in yep that's right there between those two narrative points is the Priestly tech manual that that's going to explain what are the requirements to be holy enough to be within the proximity in different varying levels of closeness to God's presence kept exactly so let me summarize what we've done so far and this is the way to see Leviticus is just carrying on a narrative patterning that's already happening at work so with Exodus Yahweh appeared to the people at Mount Sinai I want to come live in your midst okay so that's a that's like a new creation beat I want to recreate you as my Garden of Eden people you'll be my priest of the nation's crisis idolatry the sin of Aaron the golden calf how is that crisis resolved
 Moses goes into the the Heavenly Fire and offers his own life and what he says is I will offer my life and make atonement for your sins all offer my life as a blameless substitute on behalf of y'all so that y'all way can forgive you all sex is 34 and so y'all way except that interception and he comes to dwell among the people ye dwell among the people crisis now Moses can't enter into the tent that's where we're at right now so how did the Chrysler get resolved last time and then tone meant Moses offering his life as a sacrifice of atonement that means again we'll talk about it talk about it but it's a way to cover
 cover for wrongs that have been done that have damaged our relationship so we'll talk about so but I've already been trained once when this relationship got broken last time there was a crisis it was resolved through someone offering their life as a substitute blameless substitute for this sense of the people so once Moses is not able to enter the tent what happens next what we call Leviticus chapters 1 through 7 which is all about God instructing Moses on how to instruct the people of how to approach him with sacrifices and offerings and culminating in two different types of sacrifices the three sacrifices sorry that our sacrifices of atonement
 and so that's what we call it against one through seven so what happens is after that whole section 3 Skillet we get Leviticus 89 and the priests are ordained find the way and I got the glory and fire appears over the tent and Moses and Aaron go in to the minutes of meeting so the price is actually resolved in what we call Leviticus chapters 8 and 9 which is a video of a second movement yep that's right but then immediately after like literally the next sentence after God's final Group C X and Moses and Aaron are able to go in is what we call Leviticus 10 new crisis and Aaron's two oldest sons have their own version replaying of what their father did put in this case you're talkin about the golden calf their father Aaron has Aaron responsible for the golden calf yet so their father Aaron was responsible for the first
 idolatrous failure now his sons replay his failure but in a different way where they remake the Liturgy in their own image and they try and usurp the place of their father by taking incense that he is supposed to have Dad supposed to have been trying to waltz into the holy place we could be wholly on our own terms that's right we know God said that right now our dad is the lead representative priest but they just take it upon themselves to become the lead priest doing their own energy and God doesn't take kindly to that to that and so God requires their lives for that offense and so now we have a new crisis we have rebellion and dead bodies in the tent this will lead to another resolution how is the crisis has been resolved now two times in a row. Tony sacrifice so that leads to them what we call Leviticus 11 through
 which is about how the tent and the people need to have their sins atone for and be purified and then that culminates in another Act of New Creation which is what we call Leviticus 16 which is the day of atonement when God comes up to show up in the cloud in the tent because of the day of atonement this is the pattern pattern is God blessing and present show up human's blood and then God like this is a problem leading to a crisis that is resolved through the atoning sacrifice sacrifices of atonement and then that resolves the relationship steps that God can show up again in a new form of
 I've eaten presents a Powerglide all the sudden we're replaying on a micro-level here in Leviticus the whole biblical story which is about creation failure bleeding to crisis at least to a decreation butt out of that God appoints the remnant to come out the other side and then starts a new creation over with them and then you just use some fancy language creation and you can even see that and just Adam and Eve story where the blessing Gods with them the crisis choosing good about on my own terms the the prophetic resolution a seed of the woman will come evil while being bitten by evil and it doesn't say atonement there but that's kind of a seat bad of that idea in a way whoever is going to smash this the head of the snake is also gay
 get up at least I'll bite by the snake the wounded Victor here this is no like this is no safe snake this is a venomous this is evil in the same way that Moses you know wrist giving up his life because of what the people were doing tonight alatriste animal statue down below the point of this conversation this really what I want to focus on was we'd think of Leviticus typically in terms of that
 hundreds of laws about the Priestly tech manual in reality if you've been trained to see the cycling of patterns the way but later the local stories are modeled on and replaying the vocabulary and seems earlier ones first of all the narrative just goes right from Exodus in to Leviticus bike without a stop yeah and recycling through the pattern of God wanting to come and bless and live among his people of terrible failures and betrayals leading to a crisis we need someone to do something for for Israel and for human someone when we get in the Medicus it's yeah it's an animal it's a blameless substitute a blameless representative a question of play-acting and I'd like to sit here for
 s been few minutes I think it's because all of this feels really weird to a modern right like curtains that hold back up presents and killing an animal as atonement you know like if we were going to contain something with a really powerful we wouldn't our like our liturgy are are metaphors wouldn't be a curtain you know like we would think of our imaginations the same role is played mostly by things that are radioactive nuclear fusion Sun things that are life-giving that can generate energy source life but also that are dangerous at the same time and when I Wrong someone I don't think he wants get up the animals yeah there's other ways to make it right
 so here I think the first this is the way I've been processing Seuss lately this collection of five Scrolls is called torra it's the Hebrew word for instruction teaching teaching this narrative is not just telling me about interesting things that happened to these people a long time ago it is instruction for all generations of people in all places at all times and all these other Generations don't have them at Tabernacle right what you mean you said this is instruction for all generations in the time of David So this narrative is offering instruction that about the present and the future based on the past that's one that's one thing so what is training us to do is to see the world in a particular way in, if we were to write a Torah story now
 really the the best example I can think of my imagination is like where we discover this amazing thing called nuclear fusion and it's right to be the source of all life and energy and we're going to power the whole globe off of what's happening in one little reactor and but then because of greed and power games on the team of scientists ride they started right using this amazing gift to work out their own like power games and putting the whole world at risk cuz it could explode it consume us all but one person with Integrity is going to walk into that reactor and clean up the mess that they made and reset the dials but it will mean being exposed
 to all that the death-dealing radiation but if they do it they could reset and we could start over and have a fresh take a test and so one person goes then takes the death-dealing
 radiation which is also the life-giving registration surrender their life so that others can enjoy the benefits of it and not let Stanley aspects in my imagination and it's not I wouldn't see that story be like oh let's play acting like it's an interesting symbol for how you should be self-sacrificial in my mind like that's real and what ways are real like radiation will actually kill you like it's not like if I went and walked into a nuclear reactor that you would actually kill my son the same way there wasn't some like people ain't answering the school what kind of like
 suspending their sense of reality in order to enter the story like there was this real sense of God can live among us and curtains can hold it back that's right and we're here we're talking about the people in the narratives people in The Narrative that's right and then later biblical authors who live long after the Tabernacle was gone or even after the destruction of the temple and we actually know that the Hebrew Bible was actually shaped and it's significant Way by people who lived after the temple was destroyed but they saw these narratives is telling the truth about reality that the source of the whole universe is a source of Holiness and power and goodness that is sustains everything that is then at the same time that Holy One is is dangerous to us given our star our moral State and the end this is where the crisis of the Buick
 story becomes not just about the past it's trying to explain to every reader of the story it's still instruction to us it is instruction for us now the difference between the modern nuclear fission story and this story is that there is a sense that the belief that this happened in human history with Israel so this is where I'm getting the idea of play-acting which is like God really did come to all the tent amongst them and
 the sacrificial systems were put in place and it's the same way that like we I think and it meant something but also it's absurd and right retrospect it's absurd that curtain we keep out God's power or that killing an animal is going to actually atone for yeah I understand the ancient that was absurd it was a very real but in a way it feels a certain we have sacraments that are $0.01 absurd like you we break the bread and we drink the wine and we say this is communion with God
 and in one sentence like no you're just eating and drinking but in another sense you really are like that the the belief on a Sacrament is that it's actually happening and so that's the playacting thing which is like in one sense there's we're just doing the thing and pretending it's real and then another sense like it's really happening because it there's something here in that I'm just trying to wrestle through because as we talked about this stuff I'm going to keep him thinking over and over that's absurd. So maybe you know where I think we're at is actually we're circling around and I'd love to see about you we're circling around to esteem that has come up
 every other month call history of our conversation which is about that God to be Christian and believe that God speaks to us in these texts that lead to the person of Jesus I don't believe Jesus is a figment of my imagination or is he just like a literary figure you was an actual person but Jesus of Nazareth appeal to these texts and this story as the story that gave the framework for who he was and what he was doing
 and what does that story do well we've just talked about it so it's training you to see the world a certain way however the God of this story is so committed to working and being present in the world in and through humans in and through humans and their language in their culture
 that what God wants to communicate
 will only happen through that Language and Cultural forms and so the story is written in ancient Hebrew
 so that I don't think that's a struggle for you necessarily that he is communicating through ancient near Eastern ritual symbolism of sacred tents and sacred mountains and animal sacrifices and priest like this is all thoroughly incarnate of ancient near Eastern cultures that Israel was a part of and so you struggling with that symbolism like is it just a symbol or is it real that that's what year is that what you're struggling with is the narrative just giving me symbols or is it real but it's the same question in a different way of saying how is it that God could speak to every person of every time through text that are written in ancient Hebrew that is an ancient that's like ancient Semitic language
 and I think we're just here at the at the brink of a mystery that's at the heart of a Jewish Christian theistic view of the world which is for God to reveal anything about God's self to us through human thought forms it will inevitably
 use categories of human culture and language and live within the limits of those very theoretical I feel like it's a major theme in our conversations over the years which is and I struggle with it too so did God did a like a fusion reaction that wasn't contained actually come take up residence in a tent in the middle of the Sinai desert isn't it kind of what you're asking like was attractive real I guess I'm assuming that these stories are rooted in Israel's actual history and I think the narrative is inviting us to trust that claim yes yeah so with that assumption then I ask myself
 in what
 in what sense you know would an animal sacrifice actually atone for sin and what sense would the priests putting on this like a bedazzled like thing actually protect them from God's holiness only in the sense that they're make their they're doing it for 10 things and God saying that the 10 thing is going to work so it's God accommodating yes himself to human language yet cultural practices and stop pattern it's Incarnation it say God inhabits a human
 Walter Jeff to reveal and communicate torta teaching instruction I think that's where your logically have to go to to buy any of ya and I think that's helpful to set the stage cuz we're going to get into a lot of stuff that I think I'm going to constantly be going dick Euless in like how does that work why would that even work and it's helping me to be able to just say I'm going to turn that off because what matters is the is the Torah the instruction what is this teaching me about about God and God's nature and about being relationship with God and the solutions that God has for
 the crisis that we've created
 so here's one way to think about it when I was in high school I took a lot of theater classes and I remember my Drama teacher on the first day was talking about house theater walking into a theater stage play and then you know the curtain Rises and Story begins and he introduced me to the famous phrase by the philosophers Samuel Taylor Coleridge but he introduced this phrase the suspect the Willing suspension of disbelief when you enter into stage play what you're not world movie where a movie but you're not supposed to think is one of us really happened so it can't say anything there is no I'm not going to get anything out of this right you willingly suspend your disbelief and you and have it the story on its own terms and then you walk away from that
 just buy it and so I do think there is crucially important question that we all have to ask about the way that the biblical narratives refer to real history and the truthfulness of that representation but there's also an element especially as modern readers I think to hear the biblical story on its own terms we have to take a cue from Colorado chair and willingly suspend our disbelief so that we can at least sympathetically hear what's being communicated hear what I have found am I teaching experiences when you invite people into a willing suspension of disbelief when they read the biblical story and all the stuff in Leviticus is going to be a great example you have an opportunity to do that I found is when you invite people to read inhabit the story that way over time
 most people in my experience don't end up thinking this is all ancient primitive hogwash they actually find a deeply compelling and Illuminating of their own life experiences but it does it through an ancient Hebrew narrative in ancient Semitic ritual symbolism in practice so nothing to worry we're going to suspend disbelief but to be clear the Ancients Aaron's sons and Moses and Israel I thought they weren't suspending disbelief this was happening and they weren't while we would call it play acting in retrospect they weren't playacting they were interfacing with very much real the holy that's right yeah and I think to me to be committed two of you that these preferred historical events that were real and their truth representation mean to say that God accommodated
 God's Own presence in power and person into the language cultural forms an ancient ritual symbolism of the Hebrew people wish to be clear was people living I mean when do we think generally is a thousand BC generally 800 BC before 5000 BC yeah people debate whether it's in the fifteen hundreds to 1300 Spence somewhere in their PC so 30 / 452 3,300 years ago is where these narratives are the alphabet have just been like is it is about to be invented even like when kids are bored that old. That was Run a thousand BC 1800 earliest that's right sorry I mistook 2000 with 1000
 age right yeah we're at the transition from the bronze into the Iron Age yeah yeah yeah but two to hold in your mind to Holden suspension this conviction that God revealed himself to Israel through the language in ritual patterns is a middle eastern Bronze Age that's like nomadic tribal people of the same belief it's at work at the core of Christian Orthodoxy which is that God revealed himself in the human person of a guy named issue a minute Eric who was in Aramaic speaking for Century to wish Man From Galilee and that God would accommodate and limit the fullness of God's Own being right into the localized presents and person of
 you should have been upset it or The God would accommodate and limb and God's Own presence and power to its ancient Bronze Age tent challenge that we have and a half cases also that God would commune and limit himself to be present with a 21st century community of Jesus followers do you have to trust and believe that my local church that I'm a part of plays host to the spirit of God and is somehow an incarnation of the body of Christ in the ministry of Jesus it here right here in East Portland where I live that requires the same amount of trust in the same category in my mind that's believing in the Incarnation of Jesus or believing in the reality that is a real experience in this tent thank you thank you it's about what story you're living in we don't come to reality like neutral and then choose to adopt a store
 like we are inhabiting the narrative about reality for the moment of our earliest Consciousness in the question is will we entertain new stories that can in Rich can challenge or a pre-existing assumptions that can teach us new Torah new instruction and that's exactly what the biblical story claims to be and that is the story being told in all of these ritual sacrifice is not Franks and the blood of the animal a different story but also at the same time the Bible Comes This conviction of this is reality and this is the the real story that's right and there's nothing for it you got to suspend your disbelief and died in and even in the Book of Leviticus there's a story being told that can change the way that you see everything if you let it so that's what this conversation has been about the story in which Leviticus is the part next
 we're going to dive into these fundamental concepts of animal sacrifice and atonement that'll set us up to understand the five different types of offerings that work in the first literary movement of America thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue to trace the theme of sacrifice in the first movement of Leviticus and going to focus on Leviticus 1 through 7 looking at the sacrificial system so Leviticus 1 through 7 is presented as the thing that will provide the resolution for Israel to be able to enter into and be in God's presence in a way that is safe and that gives them life instead of destroying them today show is produced by Cooper pelts and edited by Dan Gumball and Tyler Bailey are show notes are by Lyndsay Ponder and Ashland haisten had a woo provided the annotations for our and attended podcast app Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified
 story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you thank you so much for being a part of this with us
 Celine and I'm from Pennsylvania I first heard about our project on YouTube Hard video is so while I was searching for so immense and video clips on understanding Bible better and clearer for their significant other favorite thing about Bible project is the actually make it very simple and easy for the users to understand what the Bible is telling the audience for the unified story that leads to do this like me.
