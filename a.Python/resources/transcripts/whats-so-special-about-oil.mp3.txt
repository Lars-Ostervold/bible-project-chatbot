we're exploring a new theme on the podcast called the anointed anointing is taking oil smearing it on someone it has a very specific purpose boil Mark the person or place that's a bridge between Heaven and Earth cool but why oil why not flying what's going on we're going to trace down in this conversation is a special anointing oil you find it in that the recipe for anointing oil is given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai and it's not just boil it boil infused pungent aromatic spices that makes this incredible perfume how Creations packed with the plant that if you just ate the leaf you would not enjoy it but you crush it polarize it were soaked it and then it can Infuse this with a taste that just is like otherworldly what I think the biblical out there's wanted to see in this anointing oil is the light
 Eden condensed into a little deaths liquid the wife of Eden begins with the Water of Life feeling the dry ground at forming the human and then got Spirit-filled the human water and spirit marking Humanity of the place we're having an Earth are one that's what I remember that place or even to designate a place to be like that we anoint it with theirs moment when through liquid and spirit a person a place is marked as a special portal Between Heaven and Earth to bring about that reunions of Heaven on Earth is somewhat and I think that's where all the sudden and all these teams come crashing together of the liquid life and the spirit are joined images and that's what a nice thing meet in the Bible today Tim Mackie and I continue exploring the theme of the anointed looking at the symbol of oil in the Bible listening to Bible project podcast
 it's in his Sean Lowe hi hey we're just kind of right at the beginning of a new conversation on the theme of anointing someone with a whale yes yeah so terribly sad stage last episode you talked about how this was something that the early church was doing James actually said to and the letter that he wrote to the early Christians to do it when you praying for healing for someone to me Royal on them and it's got a big ass question like where this come from and actually wear that brought us to was a ritual would find in the Old Testament to Revival of anointing people with oil and very specifically saw that it was not just anyone and when people need prayer actually I suppose he could pray for these people but it was specifically to select one human and say you now represent all of Israel
 in the case of Old Testament in a very special way you're representing God to the people in the people to God you are a bridge now or a gate Between Heaven and Earth to while you are amongst the people you need to now be connected to God and a special way so how did Earth to be united through you and so this was done with the priests Aaron was the first one invited this was done to Kings and one time it was done to the prophet well it was said to be done I think I remember that Tabernacle objects the story of Jacob when he was asleep out in the middle of nowhere and he was on the run from his brother who he had deceived and he's out in the wilderness and he fell asleep and a gateway to Heaven up here is a ramp to Heaven God's on the ramp angel on the ramp
 he's like this is the house of God the Gate of the Skies he found the gate the gate the gate found him you said and so the big are high is to anoint someone or something is to signify it as a connection point between Heaven and Earth with her person or place and all of this is the background that is condensed and summarized in a title the anointed one that is the main title applied to Jesus about the New Testament Jesus Christ Jesus Christ that's Jesus Christos Jesus the anointed one Christos means the person smeared with loyal person smeared with oil which now we at least know on one level the basic level of meaning for a Jewish man in audience to
 say that about someone is that this is a person who is marked out to be a link a bridge between Heaven and Earth that's what it means to call somebody the Christos yeah now the big question for me and we started the conversation saying that the early church is doing this for anyone who's sick and you told the story of you know when you were a kid this was done to you and you're really sick and that's a different applying oil to someone in praying for healing is different than appointing will and someone to establish them as the representative bridge between the Divine yeah and the land and you said well there's something going on with the people of Jesus being called the anointed ones Christian's Christian's is it just one person but like through Jesus now this anointing is going out so I think we'll get there but you said even before that we need to appreciate deeper
 what it is that the oil represent represent yeah so far we're just take it for granted okay we're using oil oil marks a person or place that's a bridge between having there's cool but why oil why not boil water why not wine why not wine wood stain
 shoe repair in the nice linen ephod that day as well
 you know who runs too much something's going on with the whale what's going on so yeah we're going to trace down in this conversation is there's a recipe for your special anointing oil business opportunity here I'm sure it's because of the moments and we're going to see is that recipe and why and how and when it gets used all points back to the Garden of Eden solo and we're going to spend most of this conversation meditating on the Garden of Eden story to which you know all the main themes begin in the first chapters is viable it's inevitable fall back there it's like a gravity well
 I suppose I'm the one who allows it I let myself get pulled in yeah yeah that's great I force you to go with me okay so first two for making anointing oil
7 Exodus chapter 30 right near the end of when Moses has been up on Mount Sinai for 40 days and 40 nights up in the storm cloud and he's been seeing God's Heavenly Temple and being shown all of these things and then he is being given a blueprint for how he is to create a copy or an image of those things that's called the pattern and that will be the Tabernacle so you get this image that the Tabernacle and all all the curtains in the segmented boundary areas and what they all mean and the imagery that it's all a pattern or an image of some Heavenly reality
 then what he's told is that after you make the Tabernacle and all the furniture all the pieces of the stuff here's what you are to do you shall make a holy anointing oil so holy meaning set apart for a space that's dedicated to the presence of God so the oil that marks a heaven on Earth spot and that is sacred and set apart from any other space yeah it's to be a perfume mixture the work of a perfumer it shall be holy anointing oil in a moment but here's what gets anointed what gets anointed is the tent of meeting was weird meeting
 Define human meeting place of Heaven on Earth X the Tabernacles often called the tent of meeting always called It's called The Dwelling Place referring to the place that hosts God's glory but when it's called the tent of meeting it's referring to the Union in Union of divine and human and meeting in the tent to actually big tent and then the golden box called the Ark of the testimony then the table but is the table for the bread the sacred bread is in the Holy place in the Holy place and all the utensils get wiped down what what are the utensils used for holes that are put in three little rings on that table and then there's poles put into them maybe plates and stuff like that the menorah the seven lamps
 and in all of its utensils which is little Snuffer's in lamplighters it's on annoyed the altar of incense anoint the altar of burnt offering and then all of it to pencils like the knives in the forks in this without the courtyard out in the courtyard also the Basin for water and it's Dan mark them as holy they'll become Most Holy whoever touches them will become wholly then anoint Aaron and his sons mark them as holy so they can serve me so the whole comprehensive space mark does a heaven on Earth space so in an Israelite goes through the door the Gateway into the courtyard you are in heaven on Earth that's that's the idea was this done just in its inauguration was this done every time I set it up it's at its inaugural
 okay that's the whole idea so what is this boil Exodus 30 verse 22 yeah what's going to perfumer involved yeah take for yourself as well. This is Moses take for yourself the finest of spices blowing murmur five-hundred shekels fragrant cinnamon half as much coal is the unit of weight for 2 this morning to the flow ya Mur this was dictionary work I had to do is a southern Arabia with a strong aromatic smell it flows out of trees unique to South Arabia so it's a gummy yeah you know maybe well steering Pacific Northwest and we got Pines and this is what makes this a very distinct to pine tree sap smell yes
 I've ever tried to taste it may be as a kid yet is it I didn't maybe I was with my kids and they wanted to cuz it smells amazing in your hiking in the summer like in the Cascade Mountains you know where we live and a warm afternoon up in the evergreen forest and it's just it just the warm smell of time and you walked by a tree and it just smells amazing and it has stopped it smells extra amazing and so out of this was some years ago cuz the logic for my boys was if it smells amazing like in our kitchen then it probably is going to taste the pain it's horrible it's the most bitter so bitter that it smells so sweet honey doesn't I mean honey has a smell like the opposite but it doesn't smell nearly as strong as it tastes you since apps like the faucet also interesting that
 fault smell that we want for our cars Sprite air freshener like the main scent is Pine yeah yeah what's in the shape of a tree Yang from your when did that started it all right it's like you know what I need in this car I need the smell of the four hell of it
 okay so this holy anointing oil had a southern Arabian tree smell to it that summer I want to smell that now like right now what you have a sample of all these we should so you have a base amount of myrrh cut I'm just going to find just actually Coast when you get half as much of cinnamon. Cinnamon smell so amazing and a Wikipedia search taught me that the cinnamon tree is indigenous to Modern Sri Lanka didn't know that
 and spread all throughout the ancient world is it from the bark of the tree where do you get the cinnamon that's my favorite just cinnamon and sugar and butter pecan bread didn't really get much better than that. It really true that the inner bark of the tree bark strips cinnamon stick when you see a cinnamon stick and it's curled to barcs trip is taking that inner layer of the bark but then it kind of folds up because his movies are around used to be known as ya is Ceylon cinnamon cuz the island Sri Lanka was formerly known as the Salem I think in the British colonial. Okay all right let us Marvel more cuz this is the part of the meaning of the oil and why are they so amazing about how bland food would be helpful and food is
 yeah without spices and all his fighting is like you find some sort of plant and you wouldn't eat this plant normally like I wouldn't make a meal but you take the flavor of that and then you spread that into a dish and comedies with other flavors and all the sudden you have what was a meal is now a Cuisine you know and how rare and special it was I mean there was whole trades global trade economy is set up on like we need some of that spice route from Southeast Asia to India all the way over to North Africa this was a money route huge huge amount of forming our food experience and this is all long before
 I mean the wheel invented but long for Planes Trains and Automobiles yeah yeah really really big deal
 in exploring paprika it's it's sensitive you can overdo it and if it's not done right it can go wrong but the right amount of paprika and a certain Savory kind of dish can really do you cook well I'm more of the sous chef at our house but they're certain things on Friday nights we do like a Shabbat celebration is taco night and I usually make the guacamole plugged in exploring ways to make guacamole guacamole guy at home to I mean really it's it's garlic and onions and lime onions garlic and it's hard to do too much garlic but it's possible it's not like this is an enjoyable it's kind of more like we smell horrible now
 then Apple paprika or sometimes oregano oil of oregano it's just like crushed leaves treat the oregano tree I've no idea of any other plans so what where is about how Christians packed with these plants that if you just ate the leaf you would not enjoy it but you crush it will pulverize it or soak it and then it can Infuse this with at a place that just is like otherworldly just transforms yeah okay so that experience of taking what is Monday in and stealing it was some transformative power through dust smell from Plants cultivated plants from Plants
 so we're not done yet there's also some only got 22 so yeah we got some little bit and fragrant cane so oh yeah so Hebrew lexicographers will you call people who study the meaning of ancient words are not sure what exact plans being referred to hear it's only the word is only used here and in Jeremiah chapter 6 but some sort of Kane a reed plant that has a really strong smell I've ever had sweet cane before your tournament sugar sugarcane yeah it's like full of the sugar water inside you you just take a bite out of it oh you just eat the whole thing I'm going to do you take a bite you peel off the bus and it's bitter out here and just you take a bite and just soaked goodness but it's pulp and then you spit out the pulpit
 I haven't done it though it's a pretty remarkable experience but my hunch is this is are some kind of smelly cuz whole thing is about the smell right and disloyal okay then after that it has a hard time making this if we don't even know what it is the last one is 500 shekels of that oh that's a lot cassia Hebrew word Kida some sort of aromatic bark from the East Asian evergreen tree you mix these four things together you would have either boiled or dried them and crush them into a powder and then the last thing is you mix it with a bunch of olive oil or cinnamon fragrant can cassia one part and half a part cinnamon and half part Kane one part cassia
 mix it with some olive oil and you got in the wild but odds are you noticed you going to get them to the spice trade that they're being cultivated but you know by this point so you have these cultivated plants that smell and taste amazing and then you mix it with the oil know what the oil the oil like olive oil is so funny I was just looking at pictures to Jessica and I took when we went to go Harvest olives on the Mount of Olives when we met some friends who lived on the west side of the mouth of olives and they live next to an all the field and got to know the people around and see when they harvested they said invite some of your friends to come we was remarkable experience we spent all afternoon
 on Just for trees are thousands of Olives so you get this Olive and then you put them in burlap bags and then you take him in the next thing is they go get crushed cuz you can eat Olive and they're actually really bad too terribly bitter if you the mostest right off the tree yeah yeah they got to be pretty like tough yeah yeah that's right they have to be soaked and Brian and all that and that's tallest we typically have been soaked in various ways but if you take them in their fresh State and crush them with stones without is a soil and their different ways to make it right virgin extra virgin I've actually I don't know what this means technically I think I should do with the age of all this but olive oil is this compressed form of the life juice of this fruit of this tree what are you technically getting your getting cuz there's a
 water in there and then you're just like the water is soaked with fat like you Wikipedia it's a liquid fat obtained from olives
 respect pressing whole olives and extracting the oil they go liquid liquid fat the composition of olive oil varies lots of different things mainly consist of oleic acid or maybe why it's so bitter and other fatty acids linoleic acid in palmitic acid oleic acid a fatty acid that occurs naturally in various animals and plants vegetable fats and oils colorless odorless reading of acid I think of like something that's some I am not a chemist obviously you know what to ask it really is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid right now. Can you boil like any plant will if you like Crush anyway are you going to get some sort of oil some kind of liquid look at some point of liquid right so then it's just I guess about the
 composition of it whether it's this year be smooth or more of the what's a substance of the oil how useful it is because yeah I mean where the oil Renaissance of sorts we got avocado oil sunflower seed oil or power seed oil that's awesome but probably the Richer fatty or the the plant is than that that's sticking terms may be our categories to try and imagine an ancient imagination you got these plants do you cultivate in Orchard's hear that smell and taste like heaven oh your time with the fragrances and then olive oil is compressed dense liquid live a life of the yats comes from the very fruit to the Olive and when you add it to dishes I mean olive oil was one of the main stage
 cooking and life in the Mediterranean bread and oil and yeah you can dip it you can use it as a skin lotion multi-purpose multi-purpose and then use for all kinds of cooking use it for your oil lamps okay so olive oil was just like a staple of daily life in these Mediterranean where this rights were so and all of it comes from the life of the fruit of this tree yeah so there's something about the connection of gardens cultivated Gardens producing the smells and tastes and substances that bring life and richness and lusciousness and taste and smell so these are all of the feelings associated with Garden Gardens & Orchards and so is it interesting that this is the substance that's used to get smeared all over the Tabernacle
 what is the Tabernacle Tabernacle is a Sacred Space that set apart as a portal Between Heaven and Earth to find a human and it's decorated right the tent in the Fabrics were all decorated with palm trees and pomegranates and Terror beam If Heaven and Earth creatures so the Heavenly Garden that is the Tabernacle is smeared with this compressed liquid symbol of life is like this it's a liquid life plant life plant life yeah but condensed into this thick Rich smelly liquid that I think becomes an image of the life of Eden another words what I think the biblical authors want us to see in this anointing oil is the life of Eden condensed into a little dense liquid which will
 lead a person to ask well what's going on in the Garden of Eden what does the Garden of Eden mean that this liquid would become a symbol of that does it kind of the steps least of my journey of trying to understand this is taking me so that leads me what if we were to go meditate on the Garden of Eden for a moment and ask ourselves do the themes of liquid and life appear together anywhere in the Garden of Eden story and lo and behold the opening sentences give us a profound meditation on just everything
okay turning our attention to the second narrative unit in the story of Genesis see of the 7-Day creation story that goes from Genesis 1:1 to 2:3 maybe just a quick honorary mention is that the opening sentences of the 7-Day creation story combined it begins with the land being dark and wild and waste and darkness over the face of the deep Waters but they're hovering over the face of the waters is the spirit of God and then what happens is the spirit of God connected with the word of God they got speaks 10 times over the course of the seven days God calls into existence of sprouting flourishing Garden on the dry land with fruit plants and vegetation
 pop out of the waters so the 7-Day creation narrative has God calling a garden into existence out of the waters by means of the word and spirit explicitly a garden but but you're saying that God creates the dry land comes out of the water as but then the dry land sprouts with potentially a garden yeah trees and plants and totally what's going on day three is pretty great stuff vegetation plants with see he'd fruit trees with fruit after their kind full of seeds down so I guess if we think Garden in terms of cultivated by a person but this is sort of like imagining all of the flourishing life and fruit trees that reproduce through fruit and Seed as being God's Garden as it were
 what this feels like yeah like an uncultivated Garden where when we get into Genesis chapter 2 verse 4 in on it does look at the images of out of the water out of the waters the Dryland bursting with plant life by means of God spirit all connected Genesis 2 verse for a new narrative unit begins that complements the 7-Day creation narrative but it begins in a different way
 NASA tours for these are the genealogies these are the things of the skies in the land when they were created
 in the day of Yahweh Elohim making the land in the skies and they're going to get a hold of scription of the pre-created land of the where
 and no shrub of the field was yet in the land no plant of the field had yet sprouted for Yahweh Elohim and not sent rain upon the land since the opposite of how the 7-Day narrative begins which is of too much water dark here we have a trial and no plants no plants in the water
 and there was no human to work the ground
 but Extreme would go up out from the land and it would water the face of the ground so in the begin with, like a problem sequences there's no plants there's no water there's no humans and then what God is going to do is just take coffee to those boxes beginning with the no water problem stream pops up out of the land and Waters the face of the ground so now we saw the water problem there we got a bunch of mud yeah yeah so God provides water in the wilderness which is the primary first step and God created additional life that's going to happen without this water right water the Water of Life and the water is instrumental in both the creation of humans and in the sprouting of plants that will see the first humans right yeah.
 Dirt that is mud and so y'all way can form the human of dust from the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and human became a living being the notice you have a similar elements here of water you're not dark chaos Waters but rather water and it's been channeled
 pop up out of the ground and wife are Life water but the Water by itself can't bring about the kind of life that God purposes for the world you need another ingredient and that is yahweh's Spirit here with the word breath and we breathing the breath of life so you get this combination of water and spirit then you get living being such a little meditation there you have liquid life in the form of water then you have Spirit flights in the form of breath of breath and then you get the human becomes a living being
 human is the land with water given God's breath yeah that's right so humans are a combination of having an Earth where there are the dust of the ground or from the dust of the ground but breathing into them is God's breath God's breath Heavenly bro yeah so but there's also the ingredient of water yeah cuz form the ground needed watery the dust to become mud so that can be formed that word form is the word used to describe of working with clay
 the mold that you can't mold dust but you can mold mud or clay so for human so we know he's address the human problem planted a garden in Eden toward the East and he placed there to human he had formed and Yahweh Elohim cause to sprout from the ground and then a list of things here every tree that's desirable to see and good for eating and the tree of life also in the middle of the garden and the tree of knowing go to bed so now we saw the plant problem and tree doesn't just refer to trees right is it 8:00 yeah that's right it can refer to a whole variety of vines and shrubs and anyting wooden so the problem was no plants
 no human the water and God solve the problem in the order of provide water
 saw the human and saw the plant problem I noticed how the order goes He forms the human he plants a garden then he puts the human in the garden and then we're told what is sprouting in the garden namely every tree that's desirable so there's this combination of the water is like the precondition is what makes possible both the making of human and the sprouting of the garden the base so the Water of Life is foundationally necessary for this sprouting of life here on the land and that if you have water you can get plants but if you have just the water you don't get image of God human you need some other element element breath water and spirit yes yeah well and
 yeah it's interesting so like not like a chemist but like I think his language around you've got to put a base liquid but there's been when you add some sort of active ingredient in something new happens but in this situation what you need at the base is water and land together and then and active ingredient to make a living be the thing to note here in the way this is designed is that what water does for the land to bring about plants is set on analogy for what the spirit does with the water ground to bring about the human and even the three lines verses 7 through 9 here at this about the Hebrew literary design of these versus but there's three little
 let's hear each of them beginning with three things that Yahweh Elohim does and the opening word of each of these three statements all sound the same in Hebrew Yahweh Elohim formed the human first word as if I get to the Forum Yahweh Elohim planted a garden by Utah is planted Yahweh Elohim cause to sprout from the ground by its Mark and then there's other things in here that repeated words are kind of magic together so the human life that emerges from the ground to set on an elegy to the plants that come up out of the ground and the humans are the result of water and spirit plants are the result of water so
 the way that Water Works and brings life set on an elegy to the way the water and spirit bring life does that make any sense yeah we talked about before how in the biblical imagination imagination animals and humans humans here but animals and humans are fundamentally different than plants in terms of types of life that's right the word living creature living being is not applied to plant plants plants have they are alive and they have seed which makes them like part of this like generative multiplying life yoga creates and they need water but then this is category of living creatures yeah animent yeah animals creatures yeah but it's also the case that all animals have the Breath of God right yes that's the guy we are all
 animated humans and any creature through the life-giving ruach energy that's right of God and a great place to go let's go meditate on Psalm 104 and take a long walk and think about the role of God's spirit in that poem and the spirit does blowing around in creation blowing the trees is the spirit that animates humans is the spirit that animates animals
so is also a theme of talk about people of trees yes that's right about that enter this mindset is to go like I have has a whatever I am this thing that I am I'm like a tree I I come from the land and I'm watered and I could be like a healthy tree planted by stream or I could be kind of a withered tree and then some way I kind of like a tree but I'm not merely a tree trees have the Water of Life from the land something even more does another ingredient that is caused me to be a living being a creature which is God's spirit and so when I think about life what it means to be alive I think about the Water of Life that makes me feel like the trees but then I think I've also been the spirit of God which makes me into a living
 nefesh b'nefesh living creature in creature and maybe they say where are you taking us in this is to say if I'm going to be marveling in that I'm also marveling in like man I got the substance called the oil and it's pretty amazing stuff and makes food amazing it brings wife and me when I eat it my scary stories my skin from flaky to shiny and smooth and there's so much life in it and what is oil and it's like water comes from fruit it comes from a group of trees yeah the seed of trees and it's like it's liquid like water but it's infused with so much more life than merely water and so then my imagination is thinking like okay what is the life than fused in the soil and it just makes me just meditating think of like what's the life infused in me that makes me alive and those two
 he has are now like good connected I'm so compelled by what you're saying right now
 yeah that's totally right so what water does to the ground bringing about life is like what Spirit does to the lifeless ground to make it human and the water and spirit liquid and spirit become joined here in terms of they both play analogous roles in bringing about life two different types of creatures so going from here to pass you can track down that I think help us understand anointing oil one is that throughout the rest of the story in the Bible when God wants to talk about a new era or a new time he will bring about the restoration of creation and bring new life to the land what you often get her images of Yahweh providing water in the wilderness
 and what you start to see especially in the prophets is they talk about a new era of God's spirit coming and they always describe the spirit of a liquid so for example Isaiah 44:10 to
 this is what the Lord says the one who made you and formed you this is God speaking to exiled Israel through the prophet so this is what God says who made you informed you the same word as Genesis two forms you from the womb who will help you don't be afraid Jacob my servant for I will pour out water on the Thirsty land and streams on the dry ground and that's how this all started that's how humans were formed so I pour out water on the Thirsty land streams on the dry ground I will pour out my spirit on your seed your Offspring and pour out my blessing on your descendant they will spring up among the grass like poplars by streams of water
 okay it's cool like this idea of blessing now being thrown in the mix is something we haven't really talked specifically about which is the life of the Garden of Eden is life abundance and we're like to multiply and so oil as a symbol make sense to represent abundance abundance it's compressed life yes exactly right and hear none of the oil isn't mentioned here just liquid so I'll pour out water on the desert ground all pour out my spirit on your Descendants the second is you all and your descendants are like a dry lifeless ground he says to the people in Exile in Babylon but there's an error coming just like when God looked upon that Barren desert Wasteland in the beginning of the Eden story when he will bring about a new creation and a new Humanity
 and it will begin with the pouring of water in the pouring out in spirit and those who joined images of basic what you're saying isn't it cool to see how receiving got spirit is turn into a liquid metaphor there's a connection between what's going on with the living water but God's spirit coming down and with the Living Water creating living the fast and this idea of now we can think of God's spirit like a liquid that's right yeah there's kind of fundamentally different types of getting God's spirit it feels like we're talking about because God breathing in the nostrils and every creature being full of the Breath of God I feel like it's kind of universal like we all are animated by the yard and him we moving the Garden of Eden sense but it's also the sense now right side of the garden with say I still am animated by gazi
 yes we takes it my life is gone I go down to that that is how God's spirit is talked about all over the Hebrew Bible and Jobe please have T's in the Psalms God's Wrath is in my nostrils Joe says there's another way
 the spirits talk about like when it descends on David when he was anointed exactly right when he's annointed cuz he they was alive he has a spirit of God in his nostrils but then the spirit of God comes down again we're talking about Spirit descending on you in two different ways and it's like their life 1.0 which is just pretty great yeah but having God's breath in you there is a another level Life 2.0 that is described by Isaiah he's talking to a group of people who have the Breath of God in their nostrils and Isaiah 44 if they're alive but they're also that as it were cuz they're cut off from the land of promise and blessing there they believe they're cut off from God's presents
 they violated the Covenant there living in the land of Dustin death so they're alive but that in other words you can be alive in one sense but if you're outside of eating here on the day you eat of this fruit you will do you will die and then the day they eat at the forbidden fruit today or still alive they are exiled but the exiled they're alive but in the land of Dustin death and so if God is going to restore Humanity to the Abundant Life Of Eden into eternal life that becomes what this language of a new pouring of water and a new pouring a spirit to be connected to the life of heaven and so
 hear Isaiah is hoping that Israel will once again be recreated as it were into a new Humanity through water and spirit and that's what he's hoping for here
 so that's for a whole group of people but then you start to see that all of these anointed figures like an errand or like that spot Jacob anointed or like King David King David is the first person who is said when he got the oil poured on his head the spirit of the Lord came on him water and spirit no he's already alive I got the Breath of God in his nostrils here so all of a sudden there's moments when through liquid and spirit a person a place is marked as a special portal Between Heaven and Earth to bring about that reunions of Heaven on Earth in some way and I think that's where
 all the sudden all these themes from crashing together of the liquid life and the spirit are joined images and that's what anointing mean in the Bible
 play my mind is just a bundle of associated images now right when you were explaining it earlier we made more sense to me than this made in my head straight so what significant I guess you can go from here is a question that you've asked well first of all are the pieces this is tied together into a coherent idea liquid and Spirit In the Garden of Eden story are how God brings about life
 but what is a way to represent that liquid and spirit together with more life than just merely being water impressed life compressed life so it's represents the idea of God's spirit infused in water and so when we annoy someone with oil in the symbol saying we want God's Divine breath and a new way and it's needed particularly for people who are going to stand in the Gap Bridge payment are they need that and so but then
 we are looking at Isaiah 44 and there's this image of God spirit being poured on in a new way all of the people yeah not just the anointed one of the seed yeah exactly and in fact when Joel The Prophet Joel picks up this promise famously and Joel chapter 2 he talks about the future day when 2:28 God says I will pour out my spirit on all humanity and all your sons and daughters will prophesy you'll become bridges for God's Heavenly word to be spoken here on Earth and your old men will dream dreams but Jacob in the visions and dreams and Visions are about being on earth into the Divine your imagination becomes open to the life and love in the message of heaven and even on male and female slaves I'll pour out my spirit so
 the whole Human family is on the docket for getting Life 2.0 that's described as liquid life are you just mean life restored right because reunified with Heaven because what happened is is we had life outside the garden is death but you still have the Breath of God in or not. Also we still have some life that's right how do we get back to full life it's almost like we went from 1.0 to like a beta version and we need to get back cuz we're using yeah yeah so this is why the images of the anointing oil as the liquid that's connected with the coming of God Spirit on people and places that are portals Between Heaven and Earth this is all one United set of ideas so with all those things
 tied together hopefully in our minds we can go forward and explore a couple other moments in the biblical story where anointing comes up one will be to talk about the role of Kings cuz the anointed Kings becomes especially significant with the story of David and then in the Isaiah scroll we just looked at 1 but the idea of an anointed one and an anointed people plays a huge role in the future pointing hope of the storyline of the Bible and then all that gets drawn upon by Jesus in Apostles from there but for now we should just meditate on liquid life and go make some guacamole
