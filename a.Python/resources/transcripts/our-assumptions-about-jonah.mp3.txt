hey this is John and Tim and this is the Bible project podcast and we just got off a little break if you're listening in real time we did five rerun episodes and we're back to take a break we've never done that in the podcast before but it was awesome we're excited about what's to come we're going to do for the next few weeks is we're going to release a short series which is actually going to be listening to you doing the class on the Book of Jonah so if you've been listening to the podcast for a while you've heard us talk about the Bible project classroom Initiative for a couple years now they've been talking about it slowly taking shape the last four years yeah we've been filming Seminary level classes here at the Bible project Studio we get a small group of students in a room and start reading books of the Bible together and then we film
 and then it gets edited and chopped up and put made of not online like learning experience with interactive exercises and discussion forums and it's still in beta mode but we've got a number of classes up on a website now and the Book of Jonah is one of them it is and we wanted to put on the podcast some of the very first lessons from the Book of Jonah because it's really great material a bit of what your appetite to do the class I'm just excited to be able to listen through it there's six students in the class will hear them pipe up but ten little bit about this first set of lectures and we'll jump into yeah well first of all Jonah is what the most incredible short story ever amazing little book about John is that you know it's a very well-known tail you know in terms of popular culture and literature even if somebody's not religious they probably know there's something in the Bible about a guy getting getting
 I'm sorry it's not called and then if you look at popular retellings of the story like a children's religious media for their looks or shows what you all notice is that usually they are heavily Rewritten versions of the story that has changed it rejected usually to focus weigh more on the 5th then the story does an awesome leaving out the whole last chapter of the store here for reasons the another one that will talk about in this episode what's great about Jonah it's a heavily ironic story what are the main points is about how God's Own people can become Gods biggest obstacle to his purposes in the world and so in the story of Jonah he's like an antihero he's an anti Prophet whose called to be God's spokesperson but ends up becoming Gods antagonist in the story is full of humor twists and reversals whole thing about God's mercy and relationship to God's judgment
 questions that we haven't come to the Bible and it's all packed into 4 short chapters so let's listen in on this class on the Book of Jonah thanks for joining us here we go
welcome everybody to class on your favorite book of the Bible perhaps it takes up a page-and-a-half fish in most Bibles and trust me there is more than enough for us to explore and discourse however it is just a page-and-a-half so it's actually the perfect kind of book to take a class because this class will both be about the Book of Jonah but it will also be about the whole wide world cuz that's apparently how Jesus conceived of the story of Jonah but also the way of the Book of Jonah Works how it communicates what it's doing in the Bible in relationship to everything else studying Jonah actually becomes like a crash course in how to read the Bible in general how to read it on there it is how to read biblical poetry it has it all the only thing it doesn't have is one of the letters of Paul in it and so but luckily you know there's a whole section in the Bible that you can learn to do that
 but with anjana is you know a microcosm of all of the beauty all the potential but also all of the challenges that the Bible represents to its readers so before we do anything but we need to reckon with his we Dive Into the Book of Jonah religious media specifically Christian Media has already reached the world over with the story of Jonah in creative and sometimes unfortunate ways so some of them was just too at least in the western context in the 1990s there was a whole cartoon series about talking vegetables that you may or may not be familiar with and this was VeggieTales immensely popular TV series and DVD series and so on and so on spinning off of biblical stories
 Thor biblical character traits are in back of a kind of thing but their first like Motion Picture Splash was the story of Jonah this was in the early 90s so you may or may not remember this but this is the kind of thing I'm talking about where the Book of Jonah exist in the popular imagination before the actual story that comes from the Bible has ever connected with people that's why it's a good example because this is true of a lot of the Bible the Bible gets mediated to people through specifically religious media and so it starts to shape these categories that the Bible is a kind of children's literature or at least biblical stories are for kids cuz stories are Universal right they can connect with everybody and so it creates this mentality at least in some Jewish and Christian Traditions that the store is well they're for kids and the real stuff is in Jewish tradition it would be
 in the Torah in the laws of the Torah or maybe the prophets and Christian Traditions it would be in the gospels or maybe just in the letters of Paul so one of my jobs in this class is to thoroughly disabuse all of us of this notion the Book of Jonah is one of the most sophisticated one and a half pages that in your entire Bible and it's not at all a children's story it's much much more like a really complex Beethoven symphony that anyone can sit down and enjoy and experience it but for anyone who wants to learn a thing or two about how like Symphonies are actually composed just infinite layers of depth and complexity and beauty and sophistication right on down and so as you think about your own Ministry contacts do you know or maybe you don't have a Ministry context maybe you taking the class online and you just want to learn about the Book of Jonah cuz all you know about it is the stish
 the secret is in the popular imagination is very clearly a well so this is one example of ways that the story of Jonah has an example of biblical stories in general they come to us pre-programmed and part of learning how to read the Bible is the bothan unlearning so that we can truly learn what these texts are actually trying to save movies actually entertaining just as I know it's not a bash in the movie however what I will be happy to Vashon is one of one of the first classes that I took a Christian College that I went to the end of the status was a how to study your Bible class and it was an introduction to how to read biblical narrative poetry it was whole semester on the Book of Jonah so it was one of the first books of the Bible that I learned when I was learning how to read the Bible so I took that class change how we see everything I've got a number of the books up here that I was introduced to as I took that class and a couple years I ended up being a
 assistant in that course for like other students and so someone gave me when my students gave me a children's book version of the story of Jonah that I would like to share with you I kept it all these years so we can see it it's a little cardboard book that's about this big so I'll just show you the version version here but it's one of those lift the flap books so it's not just it's like a double that double thing right so this copy is Thoroughly loved because I let my 12 year old son you know abused the book and chew on it once he could actually understand the story I took it away cuz I would have to shape his vehicle Jonah what is looking for Jonah he wants Jonah to preach so we left the flat there is Jonah he's afraid of God Jonah hides from God behind a tent
 do you see my son's like slobber teeth marks they're on the job is by the Sea there's no see in the picture but I trust it is by the Sea it looks like it's in the meadow by the Sea that's where Jonah tries to flee a crowd of people wait to board a ship is Jonah there yes he is on the ship Jonah tries to escape but God sees him but the ship is tossed in stormy water my son a bit off this flap it says it's stormy water while Jonah sleep when he sees God's anger throw me to the Sea underwater a whale swallows or Jonah three days later
 very happy whale spits Jonah notice none of it is incorrectly spelled on the beach well then at last Jonah returns to preach the word of God is doing
 what more do you need to know so first we'll just let that register and the point isn't trash on a children's book this is a symptom this all this is is a symptom of a much greater set of issues for how our culture and how specifically Christian culture has related to the Bible over the years I want to hear your observations and let's think about the larger issues that they represent a paints God as angry and Jonah is afraid of God yes angry God chasing somebody and yes they're afraid for chapter 4 let's talk about that let's talk about that so someone made a judgment call that the actual story isn't relevant for children or that it's too complicated to explain what follow this through what this version of the story of Jonah is about
 think about how Jonah works it's a story-within-a-story so it begins with God calling a prophet Jonah and it ends with a long unfinished dialogue between God and that prophet Jonah and embedded within that is a story about God and Nineveh then what this version has done is it's mostly made it about God and Nineveh and Jonah is just an instrument isn't he cuz the goal the end of the story is don't appreciate the word of God and then it so that becomes the resolution of the story and it's the story ended it chapter 3 this class would be a lot more simple to teach wouldn't it be more simple so there's something about a fraught complicated relationship that God has with his own coven of people that's the subject of this book and apparently kid can't handle it and this is especially like it's only a page-and-a-half it's a quarter of the story is miss it you know okay thank you goodbye
 one-dimensional like it it doesn't talk about repentance in all of those other things that come up in the come up in the real book yeah that's right that's needs to be for exposing that the fact that the hero is also of anti-hero at the same time yeah that's right it's a cardboard book so it's for four year olds but I don't know I do is it too soon to start teaching your children that were all quite complicated in a mix of Good and Evil I don't think so I think that's actually pretty important to grasp right from the beginning it also seems that it left out chapter 2 chapter 4 but it seems like the whole story they encapsulated just one and three do observation their first of all just Gods angry so he ends up in the ocean and there just happens to be a whale there so are you in the store is very different God has
 Marshall half the forces of nature to get his profit to do anything in the store is where is here it's just a happy coincidence and then and then it's about a missing an opportunity to talk about actions have consequences and then the fact that you can repair with God even after for actions that lead to terrible, but all the same observations other thoughts they paint Jonah as a victim of all the way through like all these things happen to him and he had nothing to do with it I am I thought was that I have two little ones who are eight and four and I read straight from the Bible the Book of Jonah to them just the other night they seem to completely get it I mean I understand there's a there's a depth to it that they're not going to understand there's a life experience components and enemies and forgiveness and things that you're not going to understand as a child but they they
 understood what it was saying I don't I don't think they have to have it water down to this level to be able to say oh that's all that a four-year-old can understand I don't agree with example may be the most Grievous I've ever come across but I think it's important because it represents a larger set of issues doesn't it that the Bible is Big it's complicated after many years in pastoral Ministry I understand the need to simplify and meet people where they're at and I think that's a fairly intuitive thing if you're in any Ministry context meeting people where they're at it's in human language so God is meeting us where we are at by that fact alone at the same time however are we actually helping ourselves or anybody else by revising and rewrite the story in ways that make more sense to us and how we represent it to other people this is the board of the biggest challenges I think and trying to invite people into the Bible isn't it you want to find ways
 to connect with people but at the same time there's a danger that in any tradition that we can we enter into the Bible it really just becomes an echo chamber and we only hear what we already expecting to hear what we've always heard before because we don't either know how to no one's taught us how to reckon with what's actually there and understand how these authors communicate and what they care about and so on and so John isn't such a great example of this but you could translate this basic principles into how any biblical story gets caught in any religious community right so for example of this happens with the most controversial Bible stories very important conversation happening release of modern Western culture has about the kind of universe were living in and whether or not there is a beautiful mind so that's behind all of this that's a really important
 but unfortunately what somebody was trying to communicate through Genesis one has been hijacked by a much larger debate about the material origins of the universe and how those processes and timelines mechanisms happen that's a really important conversation but what it has to do with what the biblical authors were trying to communicate and so what we end up doing is bringing our agendas into the store is rewriting them sometimes just because of a bad editor and oftentimes unintentional and then sometimes because we just don't know what to do with half of the weird stuff in here Brothers the talking snake or all of the sex scandals or all of the violence or the weird stuff that God says and does you know and so it becomes just a little easy let's just go to the Jesus part and asked and he says a lot of crazy stuff too so let's just kind of focus on the things that maybe don't freak us out so there you go. This is the largest set of issues what my goal is for this class really isn't just about the Book of John
 it's going to be about Reckoning with Biblical narrative and poetry and how these texts communicate and why they are what they are
 so let me put a proposal you have a handout that apart or it's available on online that's called how to read a text like the Hebrew Bible once you get that in front of you and then what I'm going to invite you to do is actually also open a Bible at the same time and go with me to Luke chapter 24 what's a fresh question and ask it for yourself and for anyone that you would ever try to introduce to the Bible why on Earth should you invest time and energy into reading an ancient text from the other side of the world that's written in Hebrew or ancient Greek do you have any other friends who sit around reading Egyptian hieroglyphics translation of ancient like Babylonian literature or whatever you know. No no you don't people who do that congregate and things we call universities and their nerds
 and God bless them but that's not like a normal thing so why should you or anyone else dedicate the time and energy into reading these ancient Hebrew in Hebrew word in English or whatever translation you happen to be reading in why and for a follower of Jesus directly says it's pretty clear answer to that question and it's a revolves not around the book as set a revolves around a person a person that we say we follow so Jesus was Jewish he grew up in bed it in the story of the Israelite people they were called the dance of the Jews by his time by their neighbors and when the moment he hits the ground as an adult launching his mission he is connecting everything that he is doing to set of texts that his people cherish so actually I told you go to Luke 24 stay there I'll just show you from earlier and Luke and Luke chapter 4 after Jesus is
 by John the Baptist he goes into the Wilderness and he's tested but we're told the first thing he does in public in the Gospel of Luke is to go to his home town of Nazareth this is Luke 4:16 and you goes on the Sabbath day and he stands up the read from the scroll of the prophet Isaiah and you read this long quote from Isaiah chapter 61 that it's it's chapter 61 chapter book and what it means and how it all fits in and so he rolls up the scroll when he's done gives it back to the attendant and says today it starts today it starts the thing that I read and that you will know all of what that means is today he doesn't even bother to explain what it is like he doesn't even use his own words to launch his missing be with me so if I am a follower of Jesus and I remember this like I didn't grow up reading
 Bible and so I start following Jesus when I was about to turn 20 years old and started to just read the Bible I've never done it before and I didn't start on page one I started with the Jesus stuff cuz I I was really interested in him that's why I'm reading these accounts and it was I didn't know anyting and it was clear to me oh this first three-quarters of my Bible the Christians call the Old Testament it's not just that it's important to Jesus it defines reality for Jesus he sees it as the story is that makes sense of who he is and what he's doing and so then it was just kind of okay sitting out her to me too that's why I should read the first three quarters of this big book is really complicated but apparently the more time and invest here the more Jesus will become three-dimensional with color and become even more awesome than he already.
 stop you get to Luke chapter 24 begins with the empty tomb and pull out of class many things to explore their empty Tim Jesus appears to women that are there and then they don't say I'm sorry and Lucas just empty tomb people don't see him and she is gone what's happening first 13 smj2 of them we're going to Village call the man is about 7 miles from Jerusalem talking about everything that happened everything's well let's try tell self but their eyes were kept from recognizing him he said what are you guys talking about they stood still looking sad then one of them named cleophus and so are you the only Stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't happen in these days
 he asked them this is great Jesus playing dumb right so what things please tell me they replied everything about Jesus of Nazareth a prophet Mighty and deed and word before God and all the people are chief priests and L handed him over to be condemned to death They Crucified him we hoped he was going to redeem this real so notice that so they believed he was going to redeem Israel but Redemption doesn't involve getting executed by the Romans and besides all this it's now the third day since this happened and some women from our group astounded us cuz they were at the time this morning and the body's not there so they came back and told us that they had seen a vision of angelic beings who said he's not dead but he's alive and then some of us went to the tomb and it was just like the woman said nobody saw Jesus when Jesus said to them idiots
 you're so slow of heart to believe everything that I've been telling you it much less forget what I've been telling you everything that the scriptures have to say about the Bible and the New Testament exist yet it does not exist for them what they're talking about the Hebrew scriptures to read the scriptures does shouldn't you read the Hebrew scriptures and walk away with a very clear idea the Messiah will suffer and then enter into Glory by this like Old Testament 101 then beginning with Moses and all the prophets Moses obviously not the person what does the reference to the first five books of the Hebrew scriptures and then the profits which will talk about in a moment he's referring to the scriptures and he interpreted to them all the things about himself he goes on he pretends like she has to keep walking then they have a meal amazing sorry we don't have time to finish he appears to a larger group of people and says the same thing looked on the first 40 for you.
 do a larger group of disciples and he says you guys these are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you everything written about me in the tour of Moses in the profits and not now we get a new edition hear the tour of the prophets and the song mom's had to be fulfilled then he open their mind understand the scriptures I do to be a fly on the wall at that Bible study but here is basic summary of the Hebrew scriptures for a prophet songs and hears it like a bullet list of things you ought to get the Messiah is to suffer is to rise from the dead on the third day repentance and forgiveness of sins announced in his name's all of the nation's beginning in Jerusalem right 101 right according to the Old Testament what is the summary right there and here we are and it's happening your Witnesses I'm sending upon you what my father promised so you guys stay here until your clothes with power from on high this is great This Is the End
 in the Book of Luke this is a hyperlink forward to the next volume in Luke's to work series rights as a reference for the Acts chapter 2 with Pentecost in the coming in the spirit so why should I bother this is an answer relevant to followers of Jesus with somebody's not a follower of Jesus the conversations different hope you see the implication here but when somebody is compelled by Jesus or interested in him and they want to understand him more and in greater depth so that they can follow him apparently for Jesus that means learning how to reckon with the first three quarters of this book and specifically about his identity as Israel's Messiah deliver about a suffering and a rising a death and a re-creation of Life connected with the third day and that Israel's Messiah is to go through that experience precisely on the half of and for all of humanity as a whole to see that is real
 the opens out to an all nations story that repentance and forgiveness be experienced by all the nations so just stop by here just think Jonah and Israelite representative suffers brought to New Life on the third day so that repentance and forgiveness of sins can go out to all of the nations are you with me there's something happening here now is Jesus only talking about one part of the Bible is talking about the whole thing in this is what the whole thing is about so whatever any individual part of the Hebrew scriptures are about for Jesus they all are brought together in this common storyline every part of it connects as a United whole into one story that leads to him and then goes out from him and you can just see their outline of the Book of John. Here I can't you Israelite who suffers recreated on the third day so that the nation's can repent and be forgiven so here you go to talk about the Book of John
 pull up the Hebrew Bible and its to talk about why the Hebrew Bible matters to followers of Jesus no matter where and when you live today so for me this is kind of like an anchor Point The Ground Zero for why anybody should care about the Old Testament if somebody is not a follower of Jesus talk about the Old Testament talk about Jesus and like let's let's get to that point and then once somebody is compelled and curious about Jesus then it's like well do you want the full backstory
Fox 4 questions would you suggest the same approach to the Hebrew a practicing Jew that knows that he was scriptures but is not a follower of Jesus when it comes to talking about who Jesus is so yeah the Hebrew scriptures are the heritage of now multiple religious Traditions the abrahamic Traditions particularly Judaism first chronologically than Christianity is not shoot it and then Islam so they just three really influential world religion that all have some reference point to the Hebrew scriptures are but you need to those Traditions the meaning and significance of the Hebrew scriptures is very different the different story leading to a different fulfillment so but the pattern of what you see in the first generation of the Jesus movement is Messianic Jews going to their family and
 friends and saying like you guys this is what it is actually about so it's a contestant plan but it's a claim that I think is amply demonstrated when you see things from that from that point of view this will come up more than once biblical literature especially the Hebrew Bible is intentionally written in the very dense way that leads you on a journey of deeper understanding and so on any journey of understanding you realize you're developing your point of view and your understanding changes over time that's what the kind of literature that doesn't Bonk you over the head with its meaning it asks you to give a lifetime of reflection on to what it might mean so that's a challenge children's books just they don't let anybody have that challenge they just filter it out and just make it Crystal Clear we'll come back to that deeper question again and again we talked about story
 you said it multiple times when you look at Jonah you're looking at this whole story of the scriptures but beyond just did being embedded into the Old Testament scripture you can make that case for any book in the Old Testament Are there specific things within the context of of Jonah that you're making that that claim and we will look at them at length will look at them at length but they need to just say it initially in this is still this is something I am in a new discovery mode over the last few years is that the Hebrew scriptures are really diverse collection of literature but they have been coordinated so that they really are all about One basic thing and one basic storyline and Jesus time is on that right there humans are really screwed up we need an appointed one who will be human on our behalf of the family that God Called to raise up
 that pointed one ends up being just as human as the rest of humanity and so that family has a very fraught and complicated relationship with the Creator such that it leads them actually into death and out of death out the other side so that they can fulfill the mission that God has called them to all along that's what the Hebrew Bible is about and when Jesus grew up on this at some point which is a moment we don't ever quite hear about it Don's on him that it's ultimately going to be carried forward through him I mean is imagine that you wake up with that thought I just imagine yourself into that space But yeah so that is a claim I'm making and we'll see how the Book of Jonah works yeah thank you good scripture I brought my mind's to Revolution 14 chapter 14 John says that he saw an Angel flying in the midst of Heaven having the Everlasting gospel to preached unto them that dwell on the Earth
 and to every nation and Kindred and tongue and people this Everlasting gospel I believe is what essentially you referring to and I would be surprised if we came back to that chapter in Revelation but he's absolutely right we can make that case for every book essentially including the one that gives us the conclusion of all the others correct so good I like that image in Eternal gospel based on that Bible study that Jesus had that room the reason why followers of Jesus house res centuries kept the first three quarters of the Bible and it's a complicated relationship with the first three quarters of the Bible there's a lot of sex and violence and really difficult stuff that followers of Jesus and had a hard time know how does that fit into the bigger picture but Orthodox both Jewish and Christian Traditions I've always said we have to wrestle and honor the portrait of God
 find God's purpose is there here and then in the Christian tradition because they're about the one thing that here is called the Eternal goodness it's about one thing and it's precisely when we don't have a framework for what that one story is that we don't know what to do with the book like Jonah once you don't see how it plugs in then it's just like what is this weird story about a guy in a fish and then he weird like really beautiful pain from a fish's belly and it's strange that's weird why should I care about that you know like it's just and so well I don't know how to make sense of it so let's drop out the prayer and drop off that stuff at the end about him being suicidal cuz I don't disturb children so let's just creative you know what I mean as a nice moralistic tell because that's what religion is four after all is to make people good so it's it's an honest struggle but it's all a symptom of not knowing how to read these texts the way the Jesus read and understood them and that he was trying to teach his followers
 in a way it's his way of saying we need to recover why it is that these texts even matter to Jesus why they matter to the movement of his followers and why they have relevant enduring relevance still fruit as today not just to give us a narrative illustrations about how to be a good person but they actually explain to us who Jesus is and who we are and who God is and what on Earth were you doing here thank you and eternal guess a good image I'm going to keep that one thank you for that yes so when Jesus has the opportunity to to summarize the Hebrew Bible in a sentence he says it's messiah messiah suffer and rise from the dead on the third day and I've been following Jesus for almost 23 years since I've talked to a lot of Christians from a lot of different backgrounds and when I hear them talk about the Hebrew Bible in the Old Testament and summarize it that's not at all dance right I ever hear from anyone it's about and their minds it's about laws and Covenants and a lot of things
 I've been toward me Topsail eat and don't really matter and it maybe it's still valuable as a proof text and prophecies that sort of validate the the claims of Jesus but that's not the story is it and that's why I think what you said that Gianna is at to the microcosm of the the larger problem with the Hebrew scriptures is that we have could have filtered out with Jesus think is most important actually I got the story that's right it's one of the strangest iron is of the history of the Jesus movement is we've lost touch with us being may be too dramatic but maybe not many Christian Traditions simply don't know what to do with the first three quarters of the Bible and it's yeah I think it's because we don't we don't understand or take seriously what Jesus was saying that this is actually what it's about there was a portrait being painted in the Hebrew scriptures that creates it just a gigantic silhouette with a detail job description waiting for somebody to come do that thing and what Jesus doing what
 anything. He's not saying like Okay surprised whole new story whole new deal no one's ever heard this before but just trust me it happened around here and here we go now yeah thank you for that
okay fliss was linked list to another may be well-known biblical passage same point but from a different perspective Paul's second letter to Timothy 2nd Timothy chapter 3 Paul's riding to disciple and protege Timothy he's appointed Timothy train them over many years has traveled with him and now he's appointed him as a leader in the pasture whether it's just one House Church in Ephesus or over a network of house churches people debate these things it doesn't matter for this for this moment is very personal letter and Paul in verse 14 2nd Timothy 3 verse 14 he encourages Timothy says you however continue in the things that you've learned and it become convinced of knowing from whom you have learned to them so notice learning is in the context of personal enduring relationship and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings or some translations of the Sacred Scriptures for cysts register this again what writings would he be talking about is it talking about the new test
 he's writing so no and the Jesus movement the way that the scriptures are accessible is two of them both a Jewish and non-jewish audiences which means in Greek so now we're talkin about scriptures in Hebrew and in Greek going out their sacred writings here is Paul summarizing what the Hebrew scriptures do is let the Old Testament does it say able to give you wisdom wisdom literature so the scriptures are wisdom literature that lead you to encounter the fact that you need to be rescued you need to be rescued and the only way you're going to be rescued is not by doing something on your own but it's by trusting in something that's done for you so that it's an education and wisdom about how you need to be rescued by something you can't do for yourself through whom Messiah Christ and who is Messiah Jesus of Nazareth look at the progression right there this is not how I was introduced to the Old Testament
 but that's how Paul what his looks on a great one line is a Messianic wisdom literature that leads people to understand they need to be rescued through what trusting and what someone else has done for them and that someone else is the Messiah namely Jesus of Nazareth time to pondering these texts in your devotion is part of your Devotion to Jesus oh man the spirit gets involved he says all all these texts are literally God spirited god-breathed or inspiration is a common translation but their gift of God Spirit which is a human and divine partnership whenever the spirits involved in the storyline of the Bible it's a human infused with the life and love and power of God so that what that human does is what God wants to have done in the world and so they're the result of the ultimate divine-human partnership and here's what they do they teach you they tell you things
 I heard the boy there for reproof for some time translated rebuke so they they tell you things that you've never heard before and then they get in your face about the things they have heard before but don't lose consistently West Point out to you ways that are wrong so that you can be trained to go in the way that is right in the righteousness real specific it's about right relationships with gods and with other people so that the man of God may be adequate and equipped for all of the good works that God wants you to do and the praise God works it runs right through the teachings of Jesus and of the Apostles it's about engaged in my community seeking the well-being of my neighbor in the name of Jesus so is this awesome paragraphs right here Messianic wisdom literature that creates new kinds of humans that can be the image of God the way that page one called all of us all of us to be
 so it's the same idea but different language From a Different Cloth are but it's the same point so for me this is become foundation on any time I invite someone into the Old Testament scriptures this is what it has to be about it has to be about this otherwise we're just going to reinforce the same unhelpful paradigms about the Bible is a moralistic handbook gets the narrative examples about how to be a good person around not to be a good person and it's like I said it may it will have those effects I think it will produce new and different kinds of people that's what Paul saying here but the way that it the kind of story that it tells in the message that it has that produces new kinds of people is not like the cardboard book I never let my son actually read this very different answer the question for us is all right I need to build a skill set for learning how to read these texts that I'm in tune with was actually being communicated and then I need to retune how I talk about
 text to other people and find new ways to invite them into what's happening for the rest of the class we're going to do is let the Book of Jonah teach us how to read the Bible so some of that Workshop be we're going to have a number of sessions where we're actually just going to learn how the Poetics and the literary art of how language Works in biblical narrative how repeated ideas get introduced how repeated words are like the bread and butter of how these authors communicate through repetition because of through repetition and saying no idea over and over again that you make something really important and clear to your readers by saying it over and over again and by repeating yourself because that's how you emphasize something is by repeating it and saying it over and over again you register this is a very it's actually the most basic tool and the moment someone gave it to me you start meeting another mind in these Pages cuz you can watch the handiwork of the author and what their invite
 and so we're going to do some work on how to read the whole narrative we're going to do some work on how to read biblical poetry we're going to do some sessions on how hyperlinking works or it's a phrase that I'm borrowing from whatever the 21st century you know web Worlds the world of the interweb in the internet but how different whole different pages on the internet for stories are linked together by Lil key phrases and if you know what to look for you'll see a glowing and you'll be like I see maybe if you is exactly like that and so learning how to spot when an author is linking me to another story how many how many rescues through the sea can you think of in the storyline of the Bible there quite a few and they're all coordinated and hyperlink together intentionally by the author's if you know how to spot it people singing songs after they've been rescued from the sea is that
 nothing prophets who are resistant to the calling God has placed upon them is this this is a thing okay so that's another thing we'll do is learning how to spot these hyperlinks so this class is about Jonah but it's about the whole of the Hebrew scriptures which means it's about the whole story that leads up to Jesus but that's what we're after in this course now you can see why we can spend 12 to 14 hours on that page and a half cuz it's going to be about the whole thing
show me the Spas again father comments at this point of the cardboard like when you mentioned that the book was cardboard cuz I think sometimes we we are we're just so angry to have a tight be understanding but forget that God has given us so much more credit and understanding how he reveals himself like even how Jonah answer the question like like boot guards like let's talk about this like I don't want you to have a tidy understanding you and I we can be much more deeper and much more complicated than that of say the Book of Jonah is really rich and deep and complex and it it's not easy to simplify the moment you simplify it you've distorted it and parallel to that is the way that the Book of Jonah communicates the medium of that communication is itself a really beautiful and sophisticated form of literary art that the
 local authors developed and so it's we're back to the symphony I'm actually not huge classical music fan but when I hear a symphony I feel like I ought to appreciate this more my introduction to complex music happened through getting addicted to the 1960s era of blue blue note jazz artist John Coltrane Hank Mobley salonius Monk and it was the first time I begin to appreciate music that I couldn't make sense of immediately and then to go on and learn baggage fees if these were brilliant musical theorists and for them it was about math and science in the shape of r e r and the way the harmonies and lack of Harmony is there a million things is it composed the song that most people never even imagined when they hear it on the radio and Symphonies are the same way in fact there are much older more developed tradition of doing that and that's exactly the great metaphor for how this literature works you can read it with your kids
 and the main point is clear but someone invites us to consider something named way that somebody whose life is going to be shaped as the wife of the righteous but someone who lives in tune with God and with neighbor this is someone that's the result of somebody who is Joy is meditating day and night pondering the scriptures over the course of a lifetime so if something is going to require a lifetime of the daily pondering and reading my Hunt is this there's some depth like extreme that that I never even thought to imagine before and this has been my experience and it's probably yours as well and when you get in tune with what it's really about humans turn into the tree of life that's what sound what is thing humans turn into you get in tune with eternal life when you meet the the person
 you're trying to connect us to do so yes immense amounts of death myself to a proven your point what we're about to dive into how you're putting forward for us to study the texts I think God tells us how he would like us to study his word so we don't get off track Isaiah 28 its if it's okay if I read it it says huncho he teach knowledge and whom shall you make to understand Doctrine then that a weed from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept on precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little forward and lips and with another tongue will he speak to his people and it goes on butt and then he gives is quite amazing he has an analogy he says well would you start to so before you plow or heat it makes no sense for us to bring our own minds to try
 study the mind got that which is why we begin with prayer right being fight the mind of God to interpret his word for himself another mind but we're hearing the voice of and other which means I have to fight really hard to make sure I'm not just hearing my own voice echoing back to me which is it's really easy for that to happen and then to see if that happened for a whole group of people to hear their Collective opinion reflected back to them and so it takes hard work to actually listen to another voice doesn't it yeah so that's the basic that's the basic point that I wanted us to ponder how we can I think get them back get back on track in our own reading habits and goals of pondering and studying the scriptures but also thinking about the context that you're in and your ministry or church for neighborhood her family and what does it mean for you
 to embody this kind of relationship to Jesus in these texts and then it's to reflect it and model it in a way that invites invite other people in
 I'm going back to the book and also the verses that you read that that wrote that Paul wrote to Timothy just makes me think that the book left out the part that teaches is about loving people that are different than ours for the have sinned against us or that don't even care about God so not linking that with 1st Timothy if we're not careful of what I'm understanding from you is if we're not careful we are always going to create new and different kinds of people but we can create the wrong new and different kind of people or we can become the wrong new and different kind of people someone can be hateful and spiteful or everything goes I wonder if you could speak a little bit into then the Bible will exert influence on people no matter how you read and understand it it's that kind of text in Western culture many Eastern cultures still
 I only know my culture so I'll just speak to Michael Cho contacts which is the Mountain West the Bible still exerts an immense amount of influence the question is what kind of influence and yeah that's right that's right the Bible shapes people and communities and co-cultures still the question is are they shaped in the way this faithful with what these authors are actually trying to communicate and what Jesus said this is about the stakes are not low but I also get like sweaty and nervous when I think about how high the stakes are in so I try not to and I just tried like with you just trust that God will lead us to do the right thing in our own stories and around context and what else can we do
