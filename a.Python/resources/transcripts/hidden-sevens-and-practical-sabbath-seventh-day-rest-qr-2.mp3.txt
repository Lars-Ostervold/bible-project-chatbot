is John and pop artists and the system also at the time for project response episode of series yet we've been calling yes Seventh-Day rat and stare at although videos point I can be called that this whole time we were staying with us not call it the Sabbath cuz it's about so much more than more than the Sabbath but some of our team members are getting us to think in the bigger perspective that maybe actually calling and stabbing might be strategic strategic because no one's Googling Seventh-Day wrestling to me this concept of Seventh-Day ratna me the concept of the Semitic symbolism of the number 7 because lots of people saying what's the deal what's up with that's right and so will get more Google juice if we call the video Sabbath and it is a big part of
 what these conversations in this video have been about and it's actually what a lot of these questions from you guys but I'm going about because when it gets practical yes we're not practicing the Sabbath year really so much or the other festivals you believe it's really more about can I do this this weekly Rhythm and what does that look like so in our last installment of the series real time is yet to come out with dedicated a whole bunch of time to talk about that issue theologically terms of how Christians in the first generation in the spirit of the Apostles and throughout history have or have not practice the Sabbath and so on but you all have sent in a bunch of great questions that are even just very practical which is regardless of whether you do something from Friday night to Saturday night or do it a different day of the week what's the wisdom about the Sabbath does that would be like really restorative
 yeah so we're going to have some questions to talk about that and then some other good questions to sew it into it. I'm number one David from Arizona you expressed a question that was sent in many times over throughout the whole time we've been taking questions on the series let's hear your question on my name is David from Phoenix Arizona my question is does the frequent occurrence of the number seven and the seventh day in Genesis Exodus and the rest of the Bible have more to do with the author's creating design patterns within the narrative to make theological claims or is it actually how God himself worked in history maybe these are synonymous but I would love to hear your response thank you for all that y'all do especially the podcast episodes they've strengthened my faith in Jesus and helped me embrace my inner Bible nerd I think this is a great question and it's question I think about often when we look at design
 patterns in the Bible of any sort because you're like power that was really well crafted correct and the most logical explanation is there playing fast and loose with real history you know like if this thing really happened in 7 days or did that really would ever like is it really depends on your cultural conception of how to do history but which is the best yeah so let's just first let's name it you know we went through a handful of design patterns in Genesis 17 days of speech and 7 days I was just talking with you this morning I just realized this morning that the entire flood narrative is broken up into ten acts of divine speech got 10 times in the course of the flood in their attempt to coerce which is decreation Recreation story so it's not just the number 7 it's almost all number symbolism and you ever buy a blow-dryer through 72 n4040 12 for the Twelve Tribes we didn't end up including in the pod
 cast other little tidbits that are kind of on The Cutting Room floor mimicking Genesis 1 the way the Israelites March around Jericho and then rest on the end of each day and then on the 7th Day is when they blow their horns and they March around seven times a day and it's clearly a recall of Genesis 1 and on and on Joshua's Peak 7 times in his Covenant speech at the end of the Book of Joshua so it's just sitting this seven symbol AS completeness or wholeness pervades the design of biblical literature so the question is
 at what point are we stating from what what some Modern westerners would call history into this just cheer literary creativity history I think what we mean by that is what actually happened that's one meaning of the word history really history can also refer to a written account that has been selectively arranged and designed in order to highlight certain connections be like a native retelling of history about any any retelling history is a creative act cuz there's no way to actually re create an event cuz that event was only experienced by people who have their limited points of view so somebody write the history of World War II it's one person or a group right Consulting whatever eyewitnesses and sources and song
 tarantula account that's not quite the issue here modern Westerner the goal I guess most of time is when I'm going to write history I want to try to write an accurate account whether or not I'm actually doing it that's your hypocrisy the goal the threat so I would say that the value is on Maxima Maxima realism in the representation of the event and realism not in the sense of just realistic but actually matching details this is what my wife wants when she asked me how my day was your day was at work or how my conversation with whoever it's like just replay the whole thing as it happened please don't tell her I know I know that Dynamic so here's the rub however are we imposing our cultural conception of what it means to create a written account of
 an event when we make people from other times and cultures when we expect that they would represent an event in the same way and so I think we're all the way all the way back to honoring the fact that God has chosen to speak to his people through the ancient Hebrew through texts that were written in the literary Styles the ancient Israelites read and wrote in and in the literature of the ancient near East it's not acceptable it's the way that you write a narrative recounting an event the highest value isn't just realistic representation it's also communicating the meaning the cosmic meaning in light of their assumption that all events that happened have about the human cause a level and a Divine castle level it seems to me we need to allow the biblical authors to speak on their terms and through the literary styles
 that they were familiar with it was so when you start to see like somebody speech by Joshua speed and Joshua 24 is divided up into seven speech act you know his Covenant speech at the end of the book so the question is did he actually stopped and like restart 7 times or is an author helping me understand the meaning of that within a series of design patterns in what kind of back to our conversation we've had many times a year is just like about the gospels differences in details in the accounts of the gospels but does this one feel different to you know I mean I completely easier because it's easy to imagine that's what they actually did I think I saw David that's your question is is this just a story of creativity or is this how things actually worked out in history at some point it becomes hard to imagine it becomes incredulous that there's so many patterns and he missed
 last like David said God was orchestrating history could be written like really and have all its symbolic meaning but where is it where the Israelites really water in 40 years maybe it was 42 years and there's a man down because that's more significant geologically and different people are going to have different going to land on all ends of the spectrum here on one of the spectrum would be the biblical out there sometimes frame and narrative is happening within a 7-Day sequence for 7 time sequence to make a theological point if even though the source with oral tradition that they received or are passing on didn't have that but they had that element to it and it's not just literally creativity there making a theological Point LPC the meeting so I will be one another another end of the spectrum would be that all of these events happened precisely according to
 maximal representation of details including all of these patterns of 7 which means Joshua stopped and started 7 time to ask us to open-mindedness Colette the literary evidence of the Bible to speak speak for itself our goal is regardless if I see a logical assumption is that we just want to hear the Bible on its own terms and I've had these conversations before is somebody who's maybe on the Maxima realistic representation side will say with Joshua just happen to like Stop & start seven times that's just what happened it's like okay well but it's seven times in a whole set of other mountain of evidence of the meaningfulness of the number 7 so I think it's a meaningful thing that we're supposed to see a theological claim at work there I'm getting more and more comfortable with that yeah but I know that the the rub for people is where do you draw the line
 has one place will you need to report in to draw the line is it Jesus rise from the dead did he die in Russian the dead or is that just a way to make a theological claim sure so you think you can take this argument of well we're just taking what happened and talk about the significance and you could take it to a degree where now I'll be throwing out the baby with the bathwater Shore show and where do you draw the line even there the timing of the Resurrection for example was on the third day was it three days and three nights was it from Sabbath the beginning of a Sabbath to the man in which case there's really only one 24-hour Glock with a few hours on each so that the signs you are so even with empty Tim the way that numbers mean things shorts how you refer to the empty tomb so they're certain details like a that we could be a little bit more Flex on other details like the women showing up that must have happened now that's right
 what's B to say oh look at the time that Jesus spent in the Tomb is represented by different numbers in different text recognizing that nowhere put you near staying there for the resurrection did not happen what we're saying is the claim is the resurrection did happen and indifferent text the numbers are giving different theological nuances a meaning to the resurrection but it's unwanted say therefore it's all fiction and I think the same is true for a story like Jericho the marching six times and then 7-minute gang the six days of gathering mana and then not gathering on 7th mimicking the six days and seventh day of creation there for the Israelites never had a battle with the city of Jericho that's an unwarranted conclusion am I making any sense we need more sophisticated category is between fiction and like video security camera footage and in between to stay in event can be represented using literary critique
 design patterns and still be a faithful representation of of History this is not the last time we can have this conversation but I know this video raised it for a lot of a lot of people I don't know nothing about on that one no thank you David for that wonderful question live in the discomfort but yeah discomfort for us I don't think it was a discomfort discomfort for us and certainly not for the biblical authors cuz they like yeah they love the stuff we'll know when you're talking and made me think like if you didn't do that it's like people be disappointed in you kind of get this in the same ballpark okay Ashley from Arizona has a really perceptive question this is Ashley from Arizona I have a question for you regarding Jesus's words during his Miracle at the wedding at Cana when his mother points out that there is no wine he says my hour has not yet, and then he takes 6 water pot
 it's for purification and then put water in them and then turns those into wine there seems to be a connection maybe with the six and then the idea of you know bringing the good the best wine out Outlast but I'm wondering what the connection is between cups wine in the seventh day is that is that a thing thanks so much for your thoughts and all the work you do actually very perceptive observation and then also a great question that the questions have been getting progressively more and more sophisticated people are reading the Bible yeah it's awesome and yes I totally so this is the first story of 747 acts of Jesus will do in the Gospel of John they're called signs so seven times Jesus perform some kind of Wonder or healing and it's called
 by the narrator a sign the first one and John also tells us that this is the first sign of Jesus and that it revealed Jesus's glory to his disciples Hannah and he's helping throw a party invites the reader to see something really significant here is an important in the narrative that might feel like I was kind of a kind of thing to happen to Jesus if it is such a random Miracle right it's like help someone blind see awesome demon yep. Yeah I'll do none of those but yeah but the other party longer so a lot of things we could do in the story let's just highlight the things Ashley highlights John makes this observation the Jesus use
 six huge Stone jars that are usually the jars the types of jars that people would do before ritual purification either of their hands before they eat or down in Jerusalem they were big Bath called Mick Mick Vote or a Jewish form of baptism we're before you go into the temple courts you immerse your whole body or wash your hands in the car so this is why does he tell us how many there are so they're six and then what Jesus does is take the 6th and then do one more act that turns the six into this thing that provides for the wedding party 6 ordinary things and just seventh train ride
 into a new thing which new 7th is helping a party continued till like a completing the wedding party it's a party it's the last thing that happens and the whole thing focusing in on what the head waiter right for the party host party sponsor we had some wine before this but like the ultimate you've kept the good wine for this moment so this wine that is created out of the six is presented in the narrative as a completion or culminating moment there's no way this is a coincidence why John is told us the 6:00 and stone one drives yeah I've never noticed that this do you remember back when I showed you how the prote the opening chapter of the Gospel of John has been designed to imitate the letter a design of Genesis 1 it's a thing it's a thing
 others The Scholar Mary hello will make sure her books in the show notes I'm she's done a lot of really amazing work on allusions to the Old Testament and the Gospel of John she has a lesser great study is on the L A design of the prologue to the Gospel of John and he's broken it in 26 panels opening line to Triads of three and then finishing seventh piece and the opening lines of the in the beginning so the prologue of John just telling you read this gospel like you would read yeah the Hebrew Bible cev Bible and so he's buried seven sins seven signs he says I am seven times yeah there's all kinds of patterns of seven wolf in the Gospel of John which question right the previous question that's easier though to think I will he just chose 79 it wasn't like
 I could have chosen any stories right that's right so yeah this is the fact that John would recognize six Stone jars but that's but that one yeah it was a really 6 correct why else would John mentioned it right let's tear it up on either side was trying to be objective yeah yeah maybe like he just was like I should throw some details in there to maximize our realism remember how many there were listen to say so I happen to remember there was six, put some details in that side I mean there's two ways you can approach it right but it has nothing to do with a pattern of a nation license happen to be safe and I just happen to mention it there was other details that I forgot but that one I remember a detail to manufacture you're not upset if he was making it up just to lead the reader to seeing Jesus has acted like a seventh act it's an odd one it seems more likely that
 preserving the memory and the reason is included it is because like I could we could sit with him my hunches he feel like did you guys won't believe there was at 6 but he thought you know this you know it's going to really make the story Sparkle because that helps make the point correct in a much deeper memorable way and I was Jesus doing is ushering in New Creation friend and his first both are plausible we don't know the answer on either reading the symbolism of it is the same and I think it's learning to live without knowing you know when you said that the last time I talked about that
 transitioning from Bible number nerdiness into some more practical questions about the practice of the Sabbath we've got Jesse from Disneyland hi John and Tim this is Jesse from Palmerston North New Zealand thank you for this conversation around the Sabbath I was wondering about the Practical implications of the theological discussion that you've been having Jews have been practicing Sabbath rest and south of the servants for Millennia and yet Christians kind of gave up on that a few centuries ago should wait as Christians go back to Sabbath observance is there something more that I've missed one of the implications of this sabbath rest for us in the Christian World thanks thanks Jesse yeah thank you that's your question represent a question we've gotten many times sentence many times throughout the series in the next episode of the series we're going to focus in specifically on the practice of Sabbath in
 the Jesus movement in the early centuries and specially in the. Of the New Testament so maybe just a bit the preview or seed that one thing to notice because in our modern-day Judaism and Christianity are distinct religious Traditions their perceived as defeating different religions entirely different Faith traditions and they also have you know going on Nineteen Hundred Years like really a violent hostility mostly on the part of Christians towards the Jewish community so that complicates the matter that complicates any discussion on this subject for here because in those first generations of the Jesus movement the very first generation was all of Jewish and they didn't consider themselves now we're Christians that they were juice Hoops other hope you have fulfilled in them in the Messiah they continued all the Jewish
 and there has been throughout history whether it's small or large there has been Messianic Jewish followers of Jesus all along it has never not been a Messianic Jewish Community practicing Sabbath doing the feast days and so on they wouldn't use a little Abel Christians so back to the roots of the movement so that it complicates the matter because it's inaccurate to say well Christians gave up the Sabbath or they switch the Sabbath what Christians are you the real issue is now if you're not Jewish yeah and you want to follow this Jewish Messiah yes then what Jewish practices yes should you could you would you pick up correct focus on little more in the next episode that's going to come out and we'll plug conversations yet soon here
 there have been Jewish and non-jewish followers of Jesus from the very beginning Jesus went around doing his thing and mostly with his Jewish contemporaries and so it is the case that Resurrection Sunday from the very beginning started a unique practice on Sundays it's referred to in the book of Jude Jesse's brother in the first two that meal he calls it the love Feast they got they faced an English word love fees yeah I called you. They someone invites you to a love fees but it's It's A Feast for the celebrated Gods left Sean and Jesus observant Messianic Jews doing Sabbath and doing the Sunday Resurrection Sunday thing they seem to be mutual
 exclusive some people and that's where this division got set up but anyway so whether or not you practice Sabbath on Friday night to Saturday night there is think of our conversations about the laws of the Hebrew Bible even though I'm not a nation Israelite living in the covenant made at Sinai there is divine wisdom yes for me in the laws of the Hebrew Bible there is wisdom in stopping and resting that's right and there's wisdom in celebrating and anticipating New Creation yet for them it is a cool Rhythm so we have two questions that it raised this issue and interesting regard one is geeska and then another question from John Chen Jessica lives in Rwanda Johnson was in Malaysia to answer your questions I think Little T up a good conversation
 so my question for the same as the rest is how do we apply the principle rest in a time of Christians what do we do with dinner with the information on rest on the seventh day how do we live without on a daily basis today what can we apply for me thank you
 hi Tim and John this is John Chen from Malaysia I work in the construction industry here and it's common for people to work six days a week this is truly made me appreciate the one day of rest that I get every week however a lot of my friends who work in normal five days a week. Working 6 days in today's world can be way too tiring to share thoughts on the practicality of still working 6 days and rest in one day in the mortal world and the flip side of that what are the biblical implications if I do not take a break by continually working seven days a week thanks for all you do guys I love your podcast keep it up yeah great questions want one of them just what's the wisdom principal and Sabbath idea and then one question this really practical what actually happens when we work too much I thought this is interesting about the 5 vs 6 day work week in different cultures right now
 6 days of work at 7 right interesting you know disconnect there between people who live in cultures that do the five-day work week with the two days rest I guess yeah but have a cating the Sabbath and then the question is which one of the best days do you pick a few of the traditional one yeah it is Saturday Saturday Sunday that's a big difference between whether or not you're working your own land in your own business yeah we're not being an employee of someone else that's what you just like what do I need to do how often do I need to be here because if you if you got your own thing yeah you can work yourself to the Bone sure yeah that's right if it's farming yeah I don't know I need to be in the cops don't care what day it is and there's always something to do and it's your place and I want to keep it up and you could Steward and a strength or if it's your startup yeah in ancient Israel was much more like that
 write Mountain tribal farming communities in Hill Country so and in the ancient world and it was kind of ridiculous to take a day off right yeah there was not another culture that did it as consistently attached to the 7th Day there were other cultures that did Seventh-Day religious feast day is and stuff like that on occasion but nothing is consistent every week and then in some months like multiplying like in the 1st and 7th month extra days to so I think it depending on your cultural upbringing that will shape your perception of how much is too many days of work for me having been raised in America a Six-Day workweek sounds exhausting but for somebody raised in a culture like that it would just be that's what's normal so your question is what are the implications if we
 work hard cells without any rest which it speaks to Jessica's question about what's the wisdom principal here so we haven't really talked about this in the course of the series like if you were to actually do it let's say it's Friday night to Saturday night or if you are going to observe the principal and spirit on some other day of the week what's the value of wisdom there why does it matter to you so you can't just keeps on I can't just keep going it's going to the blades going to get doll and eventually Stop & Shop in your saw and I think the human body if it were I saw of sorts it need you need rest resting makes a lot of sense
 is that the two biblical rationales for the Sabbath don't quite match that more modern principal is when God takes up his rest he settled him he wasn't getting Dolphins played wasn't going to sharpen the saw the seventh day is the day when he completes creation by entering and filling it with his presents so that's the completion theme and then once you get into The Exodus the deliberation seem the seventh day is the day when you celebrate your journey out of the darkness into you know the complete life remember and Deuteronomy The Seventh-Day rest is for you and your slave and your animals because it's the day when you you don't really care of everything but it's the day when you remember the year they're not yours that you all belong to God that's so you get the same dress
 all together so that's more of a you know a few quality Liberation thing so you don't find in the Old Testament the reason this wisdom reason of life because it's good for you psychologically and I will tendance I'm not saying that's not legitimate I'm just saying it's not one of the main biblical Ramses about the Sabbath tickets to remember whose you are yes and that you don't own all this stuff and it's not up to you and that history is moving towards an ultimate fulfillment of the Union of having a nurse in the ultimate Seventh-Day rest yeah that's what the Big Lots of care about you and developing the steam it's just interesting cuz you can develop a lot of other wisdom about the wisdom principle of it why it's good for us there creatures Road and psychologically or physically socially and so on but it's also it's worth naming to say those are ways that that we are
 calculating from the biblical story line which is part of the ruling the world is ruling with wisdom and learning new things that align with things that we already hold to be true or have his convictions so I got him this would be one of them so here's the thing I think about when it comes to this if I wanted to apply the wisdom principle of celebrating and thinking about the culmination of history and remembering who I am and that God owns everything and I want to know how to do that right now I could do it and what's kind of reassuring when you're part of a ancient tradition is like this how we do it you know so if I was Jewish as like here's how we do it yeah yeah you just raised I'm just be sure it's almost like there's too much freedom I feel like it's too much freedom to where it's like where do I start how do I do it and how do I do it right and it feels
 the same way of like if I wanted to like work out and have a body transformation of some sort to go to the gym and just start to getting whatever I feel in the moment or watch just random people doing random things going to try to lift those weights yes I would want to have a real strategy that makes sense that I would want someone who understands the human anatomy and to like coach me through it and so I feel like we're all kind of out on our own just trying to figure out where all you mean people aren't store observant right by the observance of the Christian tradition of Resurrection Sunday being a day a weekly day not just the wolf once a year then bring but the weekly day were you get together with other followers of Jesus you celebrated God's love shown in Jesus you sing about it you give your resources to your common mission in your neighborhood or city or as a community and
 you sure are time and meals and food with each other that's the way the Christians for Millennia have I think lived by this wisdom it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that they're observing the Sabbath cuz Sunday is not a Christian Sabbath technically or historically saying you can apply Sabbath wisdom to the Sunday virtual correct yeah I figured that it's a day to this isn't my day it's a day when I dedicate my time focusing energy people might want to act like to do are you a Sabbath which one top of a Sunday yeah I know lots of people who do that so it's wisdom but by Nature wisdom isn't law its wisdom which means that there are times when you need to fax it and mold in the Baptist based on Coulter and setting and season of life and and so on so
 what tired maybe and I'm in the modern Western settings when so much of our experience of religion has become a therapeutic that the human like physical and psychological need for rest I can take it that's interesting turn where it becomes I don't know I don't even know what I'm trying to get out of here but it's just a feeling in the air when I hear people get out at 12 I mean it's such a unique time in history where are so connected to devices so you're just always one glance away from your email inbox is it so much to be doing in your brain keeps spinning and you can just so I think everyone's kind of realizing like this is getting out of hand yes sure my body is in the state of like if just go and we've got to forget to text yeah it's so yeah unhealthy over the long run so yeah that's true
 isn't it interesting how the need to unplug from the modern media Fest alliance with this ancient practice that was for the Sabbath that some Messianic Jews continue to do on the Sabbath that many non-jewish Christians began to practice this wisdom on Resurrection Sunday every week of recognizing that I need a day to remember that I'm not God usually suggest books cuz I have a couple friends yes I'm home in Portland we both we know like a number of people here in town I've written good books ya on the wisdom of Sabbath yasso Jefferson Bethke wrote a book called to hell with the great title so good and then our friend John Mark Comer yes but a book called The ruthless elimination of hurry also another
 play reflection on rest Trent yeah and then I have to go and then I have a former neighbor and he was a pastor here in Portland until he moved away recently AJ swoboda I wrote a kind of short practical Theology of the Sabbath called the subversive Sabbath they're all three really great resources that will get you thinking theologically and creatively about the wisdom of the Sabbath lots of creative thinking cuz it's in the air is also a book I just a friend of mine showed me we've been trying to do like a Friday night thing every once in awhile and we just don't know we're doing you have any brothers book is called at home with God completely turn to cook guide for the Christian home and it had like we're in heaven season and it had like here's how you do Sabbath in the spirit of Advent through a Messianic lens and it had a Liturgy of sorts
 nearing the clothes on this my initial interest in this whole theme was just seeing the 7-Day patterns all over the Bible and how prominent it was in the Jubilee announcement of Jesus and it was funny is when I really began to work this out and realize this is like a theme video I didn't have on my mind any of the things the things that most people want to talk about the Sabbath what is the weekly what's the weekly thing and how do you do it and why but it's in the air but I'm really glad that I've been forced to think in those areas too and think about my own life that's a good reminder and that's how we end the video is that Jesus says I will give you rest that's the main piece of wisdom which is rest comes through a person yeah the Sabbath has happened to history has happened in history in in the person of Jesus and he called it the arrival of God's Kingdom for him that was the meaning of the Sabbath
 his inauguration of God's kingdom here on Earth as in heaven yeah how you apply the wisdom of the Sabbath that needs to be said needs to be yeah that's right.
