word blessing, there's a lot of different images of someone sneezes we say bless you bless our food we might call good things a blessing for a while there was a popular hashtag hashtag bless does blessing just mean Good Vibes blessing is among those categories of religious sounding words that nobody's coming with the blank or neutral light so to speak we already have pre-loaded assumptions about what the word might mean just based on her own life experience fortunately for us the Bible begins with a working definition of what a blessing it is in the first story of the Bible God creates he brings order out of chaos and on the fifth day he creates the birds of the air in the pitch of the seat and He blesses them and says be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth evility to be fruitful and multiply and still is the sign of God's blessing next God creates the humans
 he gives Humanity the same blessing be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth but yeah it's an extra blessing to partner with him to extend that blessing to all the Earth it's not just that they experienced the blessing of reproduction in and abundance but now their blessing involves becoming stewards of other creatures flat so the story of the Bible is about God and leasing abundance in creation and then electing us inviting us to come alongside him in a partnership which is going to require trust you can trust that God will give you the blessings that you need in the time in the way you need it or you can go about grabbing seating and taking the blessing that's good in your eyes this is the story of the garden and he didn't hit a tree got says not to eat up for the day you eat it you will die we eat it but instead of dying. Nelson has a curse the circumstances that will now take place because of the choices
 the realm of the curse the lack of security like a safety scarcity what God wanted to do and offered first and then what humans bring upon themselves is the opposite of blessing what God never does you never curses Adam and Eve you never curses the man the woman he curses the snake and then God curses the ground I'm drunk Bible project podcast and today I talked with Tim Mackie about the biblical theme blessing and curse thanks for joining us here we go
hello Tim hello John it is you and me today we are in the third movement of the Genesis scroll and for those of you playing along a home that is inside only go for the third large section tell us about movements Tim yes and if you want those of you listening to podcasts you can dial back I don't know how many episodes till you see one called movements and links and you'll get a thorough discussion that's what I'll try Sunrise right now which is the Hebrew Bible is a collection of ancient Hebrew literature it's been divided up and its traditional shape into a three-part collection the Torah Prophets The writings each of those parts is made up of a number of what was in the original form skulls number of individual Scrolls and has lots of editorial compositional clues that the authors have given about when the scroll begins when it ends but then when you're inside 1 scroll the one thing that they
 biblical Scrolls did not have is the chapter numbers or the verse numbers that we have in our modern Bibles but the authors actually gave all the material in these Scrolls I design the structure and they did it just without the numbers they did it to other tools in devices specifically repetition and patterning of language and themes so the Genesis girl has four movements will be calling them and we're taking one theme from movement and just kind of like taking people on a tour through the museum each movement is like a section of the big Museum in were trying to point out all of the you know I'm saying so long the line of that theme along the way house that we're trying to figure out how to explain it in a more succinctly every time yeah It's tricky because yeah are categories chapters of verses and the largest organizational structure of any book of the Bible which were originally Scrolls is a movement is a term we're using
 but it's a whole collection of stories that is designed as a whole or poems like if it's the book of Psalms or Proverbs or joke or something like that depending on the type of literature you're in so the Genesis cause for the first one is the story of Adam to Noah s Adam to Abraham all the way to Abraham yeah that's right you know and then that first movement goes through three major character movements as it were but that's a whole other thing we already talked about that and we looked at the theme of God and that rent in Genesis 1:1 through 11:26 first and then 11:27 is when we were introduced to the family lineage of Abraham's friend and second of all the stories of Abraham and that has its own cohesive flow many things in both these movements but in the Abraham Stories We trace the theme of trees
 yep that's right that's awesome was really good conversations and such a cool creative use of that image and seen by the public lofts in that story and now we're venturing into the third literary movement of the Genesis scroll which transitions into the Next Generation after Abraham it actually it includes two main characters Isaac son of Abraham and then Jacob the grandson of Abraham was the father-son like parallel stories it was interesting is mainly the stories are about Jacob the grandson of Abraham but we have some Isaac stuff thrown in there and then important ways that will start to explore today in the theme that we're going to yes and I guess this is only the third time so we haven't said much of a president but so far we've chosen a theme we've already done a whole series of conversations and a video on right yes that's right but you got to this
 the Mets and the theme that made the most sense the trace was a thing we actually hadn't yet yeah that's right and it's one of those like how did we not do this already and it's not like we've been bored but we just haven't gotten to the theme of blessing and curse yet you really can't talk about the third movement of the Genesis Krall I can't talk about the Jacob story without talking about the meaning blessing and curse it comes up in an important way in the first movement of Genesis and the second but it really comes into prominence in repetition of these words in the Jacob story and so we're going to do something unique which is in the app depending on the production process of the video we might put less than completely finished version of it in the app to go along with the reader early version yeah yeah yeah so when we make a video the process is you write the script you start storyboard
 that's like sketching out the thumbnails of the key moments in the video then you do what's called an animatic and an animatic is you take all the thumbnail sketches and you put them into a video like a slideshow over the script being read and then essentially you have this very simple slideshow kind of video that gives you a sense of pace and let you see all the key frames and at that point for us when that is approved it's really all downhill it's all about designing each frame and animating it but the story is locked the stories yet I sweat it all the key visual ideas are there it makes you use your imagination a little bit cuz things are moving and do you have to kind of anticipate what's happening to be a really great animatic a blessing and curse done and that will be there right and so if you're using the app you're going to get some inside baseball of our process and then eventually in the future the Finish want to get swapped
 what we're talking about right now will be off so late but yeah I don't know why it took us so long to make it but there you go we've just we've been doing a lot and blessing and curse hadn't made that are really list because not only is a key to this move yet but life is Genesis to the Torah the whole Bible three really important times in Genesis 1 and 1 of the last lines of the Bible in the final chapter of the Revelation is and there will no longer be any curse so blessing and curse spans from cover-to-cover I don't know man I just there's a lot to talk about in the in the Bible and imma give you a pass on this one thanks have mercy upon me so blessing and curse so here's the thing though we're going to talk about in the Jacob story but we're going to do is take this episode right here and we're going to get up to speed because the language and theme of the blessing and the curse
 I've been introduced in Genesis 1 and then rolling it developing in movements 1 and 2 Genesis we're just going to take this episode to do a flyover of the meaning of blessing in early Genesis story is the meaning of curse and then how the stories of Adam and Eve Noah Abraham set us up to really see the gravity of the blessing and the curse in the story of Jacob should we choose to accept it and I think we already accepted that by showing up to work today. Talk about blessing in the Bible That's Just first acknowledged blessing is among those categories of religious sounding words that nobody's coming with the blank or neutral flight so to speak we already have pre-loaded assumptions about what the word might mean just based on her own life experience
 oh okay I asked about that blessing I'm blessed. I'm blessed I just had to experience over the weekend I don't know we did we were talking with somebody who's had as a page they've had some problems with her their knees and so I maybe you were standing there I forget but I asked this person like how are you doing and what is that there was not like my knees are doing fine but he says I'm blessed and what he meant was my knees are healthy and feeling good in the season of my life I'm blessed but he never said my knees are good you just said but I thought that was awesome health health and that you know that computes with say bless you when you sneeze, thing our friend saying I'm blessed means I'm experiencing a moment of physical well-being physical physical well-being my knees are helping me help me drive totally so people know I also use it to describe a season maybe of
 relational stability or Rich relationships in their lives they haven't enough to live off of they have enough to eat they have good friends around them their bodies healthy and blessed blessed but then the moment you say bless you I think it's the meaning word we're doing a little twist there so it was something different maybe those things may Good Fortune may like health and we brought up a relationship yeah I once heard that the the origins of that to look this up is that there was as kind of an imagination when you sneeze your kind of like blowing out your ghost like your spirit is like leaving you owe ya got it and you got a bull ask the spirit back in the body that's probably not true folk tales that you grew up with in Federal Way with Washington
 I learned that college is sacrilege yet yeah okay alright I guess my Association was a sneeze can sometimes mean you've got a cold coming on and so to say bless you means like it if you don't have a cold coming that's what I that's what I always thought yours is more interesting the meeting you got people used to believe a sneeze cause someone to spell their soul out of their body what's the source here or did you just Google that for some people that that's what it needs and so God bless you was used as protection against the devil snatching your soul that's one or the second origin is that during the Middle Ages Bubonic plague was widespread and because it was usually a fatal disease people are often very religious and they said God bless you to offer a benediction
 to someone who may not be living soon LOL it's a way to say goodbye that's intense that it is the phrase God bless you bless you it's kind of a comes from somewhere yeah that's fascinating when somebody says I'm blessed that the first person reference to like Health well-being stability goodness in my life when you say bless you without God what you're activating is an ancient cultural phrase that means may God bless you who you're wishing blessing on another person but it's about the wish may God bring upon you health and abundance and so on but maybe for others that might have like almost like a magical meaning like you wishing blessing on others just because your words can make it so but I think it's more biblical Roots what it means is May God who is the author and give her a blessing and he bring that up on you that's what the phrase bless you means
 can say the blessing as a reference to saying a prayer that Emil usually all right yes will you give the blessing Pastor Tim will you bless the Seattle that's it yes and then you have a conversation like a blessing the meal as if it's not already blessed or are you blessing God for giving the meal to us but yeah sing the blessing and actually brings another meaning that you in the Bible that I don't think we use in English anymore which is often when you're reading in the Psalms and assault will often open sing praise God praise the Lord, sometimes it's the phrase Hallelujah from Halo increase the honor or speak well of someone's honor but a number of those are actually also bless God bless give a blessing to God we just a fascinating thing to ponder because they're going to see in Genesis when God author of all life and blessing and so
 any blessing that humans can give to each other is secondary cuz we're just giving away the thing that I got in the first place and so how do you know which case would it mean to give it to God yeah it's worth a cup of tea and a long walk I think you give back to God the things that God gave to you in the first place and somehow that is twice as God's heart bless your heart at the phrase bless your heart. Bless your heart. I mean when your heart have well been for me this is associated with the way my mom use that phrase bless your heart it was a way that she would say thank you or like that is so thoughtful of you that you said or did that bless your heart that phrase has become a bit sarcastic or really hasn't heard anyone say it except for like like you know like I know you were sincere but that was a little stupid oh you meant well heart you might want us your heart that's what it is
 you meant well well I think that's kind of what my mom meant except she didn't mean it sarcastically like it was genuine okay let me just cause we could probably go on but I think we're getting a English word bless has actually a variety of different ways that we can use it and when we have words like this in English and then we read them in the Bible to set us up for the misunderstanding cuz we are all prone to just read in our own personal associations from experience into what these words mean in English I think of magic like a magic spell or bad word a curse words describing that way I think my grandparents might have though curse words and speaking of curse words opaline is this we're going to do our thing which is less that the biblical authors show us what they mean by their use of words by actually just paying close attention to how they use their words and blessing is it
 great example because the word appears three times in the first story of the Bible blessing dust and each time it is very clearly building out the meaning and significance of this word and so that's where we're going to start then Ross going to ponder the significance of the opposite word these are called antonyms and linguistic studies or you can have contrast words like up and down good and bad near and far blessing and curse their often pairs but there are other like a contrast pair and so they often implied the other you do whenever you see one of them so there you go blessing and curse in the early chapters Genesis prepping us to read and understand the Second Story better
can you believe we're going to talk about Genesis 1 again yes the Hebrew word for blessing the verb is but a kiss you in transliterating Bearcreek or a soft kkh and then the noun is better, and then better blessing and either form of that word appears just over four hundred times in the Hebrew Bible well that's a big one I know there's like a lot of pages I do modern alt estimates but that's a lot so that's interesting it's also interesting to note the distribution of We're Blessed it appears more in the Genesis crawl and any other scroll in the Hebrew Bible a total of 88 times the only scroll that comes even close is the songs scroll coming in hot with 83 appearances of the way
 Acer page though Genesis has got to be correct yeah that's right and the other interesting thing is just in the Torah in the first kind of main part of the Hebrew Bible the other Scroll of the tour that contains the word blessing the most is Deuteronomy the last books actually and that's significant the first role of the Torah the last roll of the Torah Genesis in Deuteronomy have the highest density of blessing language in them and they form a book end so to speak around the Torah that way and then the flip side the opposite of these words is the word curse and here there's actually a variety of Hebrew words that all have overlapping meaning of course and we haven't Define blessing at so we won't trying to find curse yet but the main words that are either on the words of God or the verb or he calls which means to treat somebody like they're nothing and R R means
 to appoint somebody for the opposite of blessing that is the curse curse curse does not appear in Genesis one only blessing does but then blessing does not appear in the Garden of Eden Story Only the words for Kirsten so it's kind of flipped did you just flip and we're going to we're going to look at both for a few minutes here so the narrative begins with describing the pre Creations Darkness disorder chaotic watery nothingness and God begins to architect Realms of order three Realms in Des 123 light and dark then the day to splits the waters above from the waters below and then day three calls the dry land to emerge up out of the waters and now you got the snow globe by snow globe you mean you've got the way the Ancients thought of the cosmos the rocky that Foundation above water he dumb above Beyond which you can
 heard that watery dumb as the skies for the heavens but you can also refer to what's beyond and above them as the heavens also and then you got the land here that's on top of the abysmal water below the land and the realm of blessing comes from the Heights and comes down from above cuz it comes up from God who is above all but also in all through all and the land pacifically the place where you see the evidence of blessing and so that's where we find the first use of the word blessing on day 5 when God appoints inhabitants for the waters below and then for the waters above it's the birds and the fish Sky flyers and the water's warmer so you are living creatures are said to be the living beings of the first ones in the snow globe and after God makes them in Genesis 1 verse 21 to get the first blessing and God bless them
 what is the birds and fish and said because this needs to be be fruitful make fruit and make more of yourselves multiply and fill the water is and let the birds fly over the land so fruit multiplication and spilling spreading that's God's blessing the blessing is be fruitful and multiply and fill the ARs oh here let's go back to the sneeze in the bless you when you say may God bless you what your meaning is Hey listen I noticed that your maybe if you have a blessing deficit in your life you know you just needs you might be sick wouldn't want that so listen I know somebody who can help with that the creator of all the provider of all life and health and Security in abundance and may that God bring a blessing to you so we call this is perform
 this speech talking in linguistic Theory theory is all category of language that we use where you're both saying something but you're also trying to do something as you say it kind of accomplished something so when you say may God bless you if you're wishing a reality app on someone but then when God blesses someone you could say it's effective speech or it's a it performs the thing that it says like when a wedding officiant says you know to two people Now Pronounce You is performative and it's effective or actually I think the signing of the document after the ceremony this is the actual ritual are symbolically it's the same thing that I Now pronounce you husband and wife and so it brings about the things that it's referring to its own the same way God speech is what brings reality and the Beat in Genesis 1 and so
 What God Says defines what the blessing is and it brings it into being and God bless them saying make fruit that is more of your cells multiply and fill the land and it happens in effect of blessing I see cuz he liked it at that moment got multiplying that species performing that speed up making it effective but at the same time is it as idea of I'm giving you now the capability to continue to do so yeah let's talk about that so so far in the story anyway order or life like on day three God summons all the plants that make fruit fruit bearing trees with seed in them to make more of themselves so God is already summoning for this potential that is packed into creation is his powerful realist we're being invited to a deep mystery here life on our planet
 doesn't just happen all the time and everywhere there certain moments some moments you just look at it like a red bear Rock and you got a lot going on there even though maybe it might just delete the rest but biologically you know there's not but then when you look at a seed right that gets into La crab is not rock and then all the sudden that seed just turns into the thing the starts growing green stems that are blossoms and then drop seeds and then those drop in the cracks in the rocks and it's that phenomenon that the biblical authors are observing and they see God's spirit animating generating life where there was not life and then something happens when God pronounced as a blessing it says if God is giving a gift of reproduction if God is the producer the blessing is reproducing its taking the Original Seed of potential and then using the freedom and opportunity
 did Kobe make more of and that's the definition of blessing right here in this first occurrence of the word the ability to generate more like the ability to be fruitful and multiply and fill is the sign of God's blessing but specifically still with life means to spread out and take up more space enjoy more of the space another one of the first use of blessing in Genesis one doesn't give you a dictionary definition The Narrative provides the definition of the word you have to ponder it so I would after God says this The Narrative says and it was so God's blessing brought the thing and reality. The first evident first instance of blessing so if we're building Arlo base definition hear it involves abundance multiplication reproduction abundance by inference because how could you multiply and fill I understand out lots of resources yeah that's right cuz it takes food
 and lots of fruit trees to feed all those in space and space for the fish
 okay second instance a blessing in Genesis 1 happens on day 6 on the next day and hear God blesses the humans you get the little image of God, and God said let us make human in our image according to our likeness so that they may rule over the land and the creatures and then Genesis 1 verse 28 and God bless them and said be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and blessing with a little bonus piece that's a fourth item and rule over the creatures so here are humans share the gift of reproduction multiplication implied abundance those are all science of God's blessing but then there's this additional element I'm which is about having yeah responsibilities being deputized to Edward Dy responsibility
 the God has blessed me so it's not just that they experienced the blessing of reproduction and then abundance but now their blessing involves becoming Steward of other creatures blessing Taps us into the theme of being immature God which is pretty remarkable to think about like we you know the birds are flourishing they don't need some other mammal to tell him what to do if they're doing great and then God takes this, Ned and says you guys are blessed 200 and take care of the blessing of all the in a few by the way you're responsible all these creatures and plants now that's that's for Market is remarkable yep it's a remarkable portrait of human nature and we talked about it and many other settings and podcast conversations but what
 I want to drive a tension to hear is that ruling means to oversee these creatures but what was I just told about these creatures they got the same blessing as the humans which means overseeing the blessing making sure that these creatures experience the blessing is now a shared responsibility it's something shared between the humans and what is a part of the human blessing to oversee the blessing that goes out to others and what we're out here where the seeds of an idea that is going to Blossom in the story of Israel when God calls the family of Abraham to be the vehicle of God's blessing for all the nations then then when the nation fails of the story drives you towards a coming future individual who will become that Steward of God's blessing for Israel end for the Nations but it's always rooted right here God wants to partner with humans so that divine blessing is stewarded
 right out into the world and its really human nature is blessed independent of humanity but humans have a crucial role to play in how we called nature experiences that blessing that's power. Big Ideas here one is at the root of blessing is flourishing and multiplication of life it's so packed into that is the idea of abundance and I suppose things like peace although it's not explicit but like I don't know like this idea of yeah it's hard to be fruitful and multiply if you're fighting when you're running for your life all the time or when there's not enough food when there's no stability earpiece so it's as if a whole bunch of other things have to be in place for a species or a group of humans to truly be fruitful and multiply
 and what are those things that piece stability economic abundance for a community to really Thrive cuz of course humans will multiply it in almost any situation but whether will multiply a lot or live very long as we multiply well that's going to depend on whole bunch of other that's depends on how humans do a ruling and organizing our communities so that's the second big idea is that humans have been asked to participate in taking care of the blessings of other creatures come into my mind sort of like this baby is going to be born like this Pact
 this world and the womb with such beautiful potential that the baby will be born but humans have an important role to play in the birthing and the health and well-being and improving the passage of that baby from Loom into the world and is FICA Med Midwifery know that's the mound with free delivery I was actually sitting across the aisle in a plane from someone studying to be a midwife and over her hearing her discuss it with person next to her and she basically said like you know if anything really bad happens the doctors there and they know what to do and once the baby comes out I'm not really expert on what to do with the baby like my job is just to take care of the mother before and during and after pregnancy and was just a few Melody that she was expressing of this kind of like
 exactly where my late is and like we need other people like I'm just here to support support them anyways I don't know how that fits and what we're talking about it's a beautiful image of like there's a whole process set in motion that we don't control yeah called whatever Vios life but we very much can influence help or hinder the coming into being a blessing and that's the role that humans would have called him a second occurrence of the word blessing 3rd occurrence is in the last day the Sabbath day when God set apart the seventh day and rest from all his work and God blessed the seventh day this is different cuz the first to taught you it's about multiplication and filling
 and it was creatures here it's a Time sequence of time a sequence of day and night one out of seven that is blessed and for sure it's a it's a riddle your men to ponder it like how we know how was this thing like the others but we paid attention to this before the 7th day is that a part in a number of ways in terms of literary design but one of the most prominent ones is the fact that the phrase there was evening and morning that marks the end of days one through six there's no evening and morning on the seventh day it's the day the night without end of the day that day The Day That Never Ends so in that sense it is very much fruitful and multiplying is the unending day the day of God's ultimate rest but they overflows yeah so an implication being that the seventh day is like the culminating act it's the ultimate Act of ultimate flourish of Perpetual a bun
 arrest in the goal of creation the seventh day so that's that's the portrait anybody wants to take a deeper dive there's a real focused beam study bio test muscular Jeff Anderson called the blessing and the curse trajectory is in the Theology of Old Testament and he summarized it this way he says a blessing in Hebrew Bible is a potent way to invoke distribute or celebrate the well-being that comes from God's favor in the Old Testament blessings primarily involve fertility Authority Dominion holness peace and rest and why all these blessings my proceed from God to humans or from humans to other humans and even from humans back to God a blessing is at its core God's enhancement of a life of fullness like that
 the blessing who doesn't want that I think that's the idea I think I ever going to watch this is the good life because life so you could X in Genesis 1 I mean you've got you got blessing triple blessing I'm triple-platinum got a party going on a blast but we also have the seeds of a potential conflict which is God has put the management and oversight of the blessing in our very well well you skip the reference check part of the application process yeah the the stewardship of the blessing has been put into the hands of a creature other than God that is an image of God and that that's going to the whole biblical plot conflict in the story is going to unfold out of that a fact
 and that brings us to the Eden story I so try to be quick we'll see what happens
so in the Eden Story the word blessing does not appear now the Eden story is second chapter will forego my chapters story in the story chapter 2 verse 4 hours for the classic story of God creating Man Out of the Dust in the Breath of Life planting him and this beautiful garden that God placed in the middle of just yeah Wilderness yeah and close up because life and then all that water case the mud clay the consuming shows Adam all the animals that humans like me and only two animals have have a partner have a good have a great partner and guys like you're going to do well have 12 cuts the human and half male and female the one we come to the two can become one and then they are told
 eat of the Tree of Life eat from all of the fruit trees of the garden eat from all the trees students from all of them except this one that will kill you the tree of good and bad it will surely kill you you will die on the day you eat it you will die so the word blessing is not used but the image is that Genesis one taught you about as the narrative Define blessing all being activated a land of abundance Garden life just enjoy it you don't even have to is it all going to be all kinds of food here that you that'll just be there no course as you garden and cultivated you'll participate in the in the blessing managing it cultivate the garden and that's what the humans call to do but just enjoy its blessing to the word is conspicuous by its absence you know that the garden is assigned a blessing and all the animals in it and the humans in it but the other word is not
 but you find out the blessing is conditional and it's not like I do good things and I'll bring the blessing it's hey here's a blessed land already and there's one thing you could do to really screw the stop just don't do that one thing that's the setup here so the the maintenance and enjoyment of the blessing is continued is a conditional on like their ability to trust and just do what God Said even though I might find it difficult to understand right now it's conditional blessing is that that's that's pretty significant what a blessing comes to them and what's conditional is not getting the blessing what's conditional is continuing to enjoy it and its fullness that's what's on the line here and to enjoy fullness you just have to trust the humans have to trust that's the the set up to the store here the trick is that that tree there not supposed to eat from is one of the trees that also looks good to eat
 in the snake capitalizes on that when the deceptive creature comes up to the humans. That's significant to I think and in other words the tree that will kill them looks like a blessing it looks like it's good to eat and eating a bunch of abundance it's all part of it is all part of the blessing so that looks like a blessing like it looks good. It looks like a buried Tony's whole I only thing that would let me know that that tree is not a blessing is just texting someone who's smarter than me told me so someone told me that he will kill me yeah and I got to trust them to know I look at that Barry and then I looked over at that other tree and it's got a similar-looking berry and that one I can eat so what's up with this one this is important than the way the narrative is setting up the choice is going to unfold in in patterns later to follow where it's going to present human characters in the story of the Old Testament that are making choices
 I'm going to make choices that seem like in their eyes the way to enjoy the blessing or to get the blessing or get more of it and what they end up doing is doing doing the opposite totally we talked about this at length but it's it is landing for me to neways like in the same way I'm out on a hike and someone go so that Barry right there that one will kill you and the trust them and I don't know the difference it looks tasty that's you take that to just making decisions about flourishing like this decision the thing I want to take this decision it looks great I can't tell the difference yet I don't know what's going to going to destroy me is so true to The Human Experience it seems like that it's good that I see little boys you know so it's good that my boys have enough to eat but what what if I end up in the food scarcity situation and I want to provide a blessing
 for my family but let's say I'm living in a time or place where food is hard to come by and so right. People get put in the real moral dilemmas when they are trying to bring a blessing to others but out there they've got to get Scrappy you know and do whatever it takes to get the blessing even if that means taking from somebody else you know and maybe they need it right I mean we end up in these Dwayne us where we want to get the good life with a blessing and in the biblical story the way that you get the blessing is to receive it but trusting that you will receive the blessing from God often means sitting in situations that don't feel like a blessing right so it's kind of like these two pads you can trust that God will give you the blessing that you need time and way you need it or you can go about grabbing seeing and taking the blessing that's good in your eyes and that moment at the tree basically summer
 every generation of characters that's going to come for the rest of the heat pump and so the tree of blessing then is contrasted with the tree of curse word about that will bring that's right yeah I'm in the human spine has command they take from the Tree of faults blessing it doesn't bring them a blessing it actually a heads up bringing a rupture in their relationship with each other their connection to God's our connection to the ground and so God comes and the others to curses as like a consequence for Adam and Eve's Choice what God never does he never curses out of 1/8 you never curses the man the woman he curses the snake and then God curse the ground so the snake goes to the lowly place you're going to eat dirt all the days of your life and you're going to be locked in conflict with the humans and then one day you're going to get your head smashed by the seed of
 it's the opposite of rule the snake was trying to usurp the rulers right he was recalled to rule the creatures but here's a creature trying to rule the humans ends up doing it ends up getting one up on them and so God's the curse is to go from a place of you were trying to get power and you're going to become powerless and destroyed so that's definitely the opposite of laughing and then the other curse is on the ground so the ground is now going to become a place it's the way it's going to become like Humanity's adversary you're going to have to raise productivity out of that so well and sometimes you do you put stuff in there and it's just going to grow but you're going to have to give you literally give up your life to the ground to get it to really provide what you need out of it and so that these become the icons of blessing and curse blessing is I have enough I have what I need
 and what's crazy is it just feels like a gift because I have more than what I feel like I worked for you and the curse is where you feel like the whole environment your whole life fighting against you and you put in all this effort and what you get is not enough not enough blessing and curse the ground I'll get right in the middle she is a promise is a promise it's not a curse a curse if the curse of the snake the snake sorry I will make your pains in childbearing oappl labor you're going to give birth to Children yes it's feels like a curse yeah the thing that the blessing cause which is the multiplication of life it's now going to be okay alright long Rabbit Trail here
 flying rabbit out here depending on what translation you read will greatly influence when you get out of this the main problem with many of our English translations that read I will multiply your pain in childbirth the main problem with that translation is that the word Hebrew word translator for childbirth does not mean childbirth
 okay I'm laughing as deeply and comfortable there's a perfectly good words for childbirth Halal route and this ain't it where it had our young appears many other times in the Hebrew Bible is very clear meaning is conception conception refers to the process of conceiving children not the moment of birthing children that's and I we got that wrong and in the word pain isn't the word for physical pain it's the word for the emotional physical toll that difficult circumstances have on the human mind the body so it's the same word used to describe what the man is going to undergo in relationship to the ground which is difficult painful toil so when it comes to conceiving children the circumstances in which babies are conceived will be fraught with painful complicated relationships that hurt
 emotional physical pain through every generation of characters in the book of Genesis and you will see what is referring to infertility jealousy jealousy men who want to make families and so they sexually abused women men who are jealous of their wives men men who accumulate multiple wives so they can produce as many kids as they want and then the wives are all hurting each other so this is a preview in Genesis 3:16 15 of ya of the painful relational environment in which children are brought into the world the things I ought to have been a blessing is now going to become traumatic in the lives of all these characters the soil in which we multiply or South yes that's right is also cursed that ground this is an introduction to the stories you're about to read in the rest of the Genesis scroll
 and it culminates actually in the story of Jacob who marries them the most women out of any character as far in the story and none of the wise can stand each other and all the 12 tribes of Israel are born in this sad complicated power of used set of circumstances that's what this versus anticipating and preview of betrayal in pastoral Ministry I've sat with many people and women in particular who read that verse in Genesis 3 as God cursing them with the Pains of Labor and essentially not what that mine is talking about that's interested in there but not to the woman is your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you all together male and female
 in Genesis 1 yeah the image of God was male and female that's right but know this image this thing that happened at the tree has brought a lack of safety to the unity of the man and the woman because now their bodies their nakedness of their bodies shows vulnerability that they're not safe around each other so they hide their bodies and now they're they're told that they're going to be locked in conflict with suspicion of each other and so you are going to desire your husband but your husband's going to treat you like an animal what you together are supposed to be doing over the animals is now what the man will do to you and think through every generation in the Book of Genesis and there will be mail abuse power abusive of the women in their lives and the raw honest portrait of The Human Condition Genesis 3 you could say is Godzilla meant it's God naming what is now going to end up
 call Owen Stevens chosen to go after the blessing in their own eyes instead of proceeding received the blessing of gave to them very powerful quite powerful sobering
is a consequence of the mistrust and the desire for a false abundans that leads into you know all these problems and so I and I've heard you say before that the curse isn't God like making it to be it's more announcing that it is is that what you would say well here in Genesis 3. Curses the snaky curses the ground and then what he does as inform the humans of the circumstances that will now take place because of the choice choices that they've made but the circumstances are circumstances that could be described as the realm of the curse the lack of security like a safety scarcity and so there's there's one element where of course they're being handed over to it by God and so there is a sense in which there's God's agency involved in giving someone over
 the power of the curse and so you could say the goddess active and bring that about in some way but the core portrait is that God will God wanted to do and offered first blessing and then what humans bring upon themselves is the opposite of blessing and so there are times when God especially once he starts generation after generation singling out another chosen one and then giving them even more blessing and so then we come to the nation of Israel you know we won't get to the Jacob story but is this they're even more accountable then Adam and Eve were because God has given them all the laws of the Torah you know in the storyline of the Bible and so mad when they go after a false glassing god is holding them way more accountable and so he's depicted as more actively bringing the curse upon Israel in a way that's more intense than he is right here in Genesis 3 without a minifigure feels a little passive when he's like cursed are you
 serpent yeah it feels passive cursed is the ground in the center here when he says I will make the toil of your conception severe pretty like actively yeah that's interesting that parallel is I will make or I will multiply it's the same verb as be fruitful and multiply from Genesis 1 I will multiply your grief and conception so I think it's the knowledge that all multiplication of life is a gift from God's blessing so you're going to keep multiplying it so I'm going to keep like I am behind all multiplication in abundance I will make X but then the flip side isn't the environment now you've created by your choices means that multiplying will take place in a Grievous Angel environment and that will be the circumstance at least I think that's what's going on there alternate Lee he's going to allow it and so in that sense you could say that God.
 but then none of this would be happening if it weren't for the agency and choice of humans in the story and it's this kind of dual agency and I guess that's what the image of God taught us in Genesis one anyway is that the management and oversight of blessing word the lack of blessing is going to be in the hands of these creatures God has appointed and actually here let me just we'll just really quick over the next cycle of stories which is the newest story humans end up multiplying grief and hardship and violence so badly that they soaked the ground with the blood of the innocent this is the Cain and Abel story and then leading up to change the send it to my Mac and then the big bad Warriors the Nephilim of Genesis chapter 6 so God says yeah man these humans have two are spreading death and I have what life so purifies the ground of the blood and
 when does the created order and the separation of the waters from Genesis Juanita create does Genesis 1 and then is he recreates he singles out one family from among the many because of their righteousness and that's Noah and then once Noah gets off the boat at the ark he offers to sacrifice and God says God responds to that surrender of Noah and he says I'm no longer going to curse the ground in the way that I just did by striking all living things God says so their curse was pretty active like the curse is not ending life the ultimate ultimate curse is to undo Genesis 1 yeah yeah so what the flood story teaches us is man if God has one righteous Remnant who he can single out and if that righteous Remnant doesn't Noah like what Noah does after the art righteous room pretty Bible terminology there that's why God
 scares them from the decreation one who does right by God and he said to walk with God the other thing about Noah and Remnants is a is a word meaning when they were literally in the story his family is the one that remains so the righteous one that Renee and over becomes the seed of a new humanity and what number does after getting off the boat is offer up the sacrifice which is biblical imagery for surrendering giving back to God the life and food and animals that God has given to me and that act of surrender when God looks at it he says here that Humanity I can work with and so when I see a righteous Remnant surrendering everything to me no more curse I won't do the curse I'll bring and then in the narrative it says and God bless Noah and said be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and water
 the races again and we start the cycle over again and so that's basically the story line of the whole Bible blessing a curse the points a human to rule over the blessing versus Adam and Eve the human ones and human life human in life him to relax the human the human brings the curse instead of the Blessed Saint because what they want is what looks good to them but which God says hey that's not a blessing trust me trust me it looks like a blessing smells like a blessing and so they go after what is the blessing in their own eyes and they end up yeah creating unleashing the curse now and then the curse is Unleashed there's decreation and God finds a righteous one
 another at points as his representative and says through you I will then Unleashed a blessing again and try it when the righteous one passes through the waters of death and surrender is all to God God will look upon that righteous Remnant and there are self-surrender and sacrifice and say yeah that's the birth of a new creation right there I can work with that I'll bring my blessing and that's what God blesses any unleashes a new creation out of the out of the old and just that cycle right there told me Genesis 1 29 is itself a little condensed preview of a cycle that's going to just be on repeat repeat repeat recipe Revival but also summarizes the whole Arc of the biblical story from beginning to end a story of Jesus being told as the ultimate righteous blessed one who goes through experiences the curse on behalf of all so that you can unleash
 the power new creation and blessing I'll tell the side so that's what the video surprise us with the whole blessing Chris videos about but if you get this idea blessing and curse the way a blessing and curse language works in the rest of the Genesis scroll will really make a lot more sense so I think yeah and the next conversation will just real quick summarize how about cycle plays itself out in the story of Abraham and then that will set us up to really dive into the blessing and the curse in the Jacob story which for those of you doing that reading Journey on that you'll be able to actually follow through and click on and interact with the words blessing and curse all the way through the Jacob story so yeah but for the moment bless you John may God bless you John
