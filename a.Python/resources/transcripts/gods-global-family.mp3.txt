there's a lot of diversity in the human race have different hair color and skin color sure but we also have different languages different ways of verbalizing meaning depending on where you grew up you were taught different values told different stories face different challenges some of us are rich some of us are poured some more powerful some not so much in the large Human family spread out across this flying space Rock there is a lot of diversity and yet somehow the ability of the story of Jesus which is a biblical story is able to speak to every different kind of human and address their deepest questions or problems our longings about themselves about other people about God about the world the back step back and look at the impact the story of Jesus have had on this planet and you'll see the Jesus movement is the most culturally and ethnically diverse people movement is ever happened to the human race
 and this is no accident the biblical story is designed this way it's designed to show us that we are one big Human family all of us and all of our wonderful diversity we are the family of God the seedbed of this is the little image of god poem dentist one in that poem God says that humanity is both male and female in together and our difference is when we express who. Is this seed of an idea planted in the biblical story continues the completion of my human identity consists and can only be found in understanding being connected to an appreciating the humanity about those who are different than me and so in the last story of the Bible the story of humanity comes together in a climax when Every Nation every people every tongue and every tribe come together not to erase their diversity but to bring their own unique guess the only way for
 for Humanity and the thing that God is doing in the story of humanity is unify diverse nation in 21 news Manatee stuff is the toll of the biblical story but not in a way that erases or marginalizes anyone cultures difference but actually in a way that honors and resurrects and glorifies what is unique and beautiful about every different kind of human culture this is the Bible project podcast on John Collins and today we begin a brand new series called the family of God and a quick note for those we've been following along from our last series on the character of God you're going to notice that doctor Krista Quinn is not in these upcoming conversations and that's because we recorded these conversations about a year ago before Chris has started joining us we are excited to have her on many more future episodes and sadly you're not going to hear her voice today or in this series but we'll get her back in here so thanks for joining us here we go
hello Joan Collins hello Tim we are starting a new conversation about a new scheme video that we are working on I love new theme videos yeah me too he's a really fun conversations we're going to span the whole Bible and the end working out theme we're going to call the family of God family family of God in the sentence about how and why and what kind of story is driving one main fact about the Jesus movement that is now two thousand years old namely that it is the most ethnically diverse religious movement in human history cuz I know I thought about that the most ethnically diverse religious movement and human history terms of demographic diversity and numerical proportion
 it's the most diverse yet somehow in some way unified movement but instead of talking to you about it let me tell you a story all share have how my awareness to this rose on it on a personal level with Jessica and I were living in Jerusalem for a year in 2006-7 was going to school at the Hebrew University in East Jerusalem one thing that was a huge privilege about not just going there for like a you know a tour trip but live in but living there was just there was time and we did not kids lots and lots of time it didn't feel like it at the time now looking back yeah with kids that can see just how much time we had so we would often spend weekends or Thursday afternoons cuz I didn't have class.
 Thursday and we would just had a huge list of sites to go see you in Israel Jerusalem area you know there's a list of big and I remember so two in particular that I share and I think when you and I went to Israel years later for about a week and a half we didn't go to either of these places the one is a church Roman Catholic church and kind of attractions site on the Mount of Olives switch is east of we went to the Mount of Olives yes and we are actually probably just a hundred yards from this place but we never went in. It's called The Church of the paternoster which is the Latin phrase for our father it's the shorthand for the Lord's prayer Our Father who is in heaven Hallowed be in a pot roast dinner so there's been a church building standing on this location since like the mid 3
 hundred something like that like 1700 to be there but what what makes the attraction of the ones close to the Viewpoint for the Mount of Olives but it's a lot of tourist traffic goes through but they have this gigantic Courtyard with these really cool art people are always you can walk down and in Marble Mosaic is The Lord's Prayer in 100 different languages and so you can walk down the hallway is there a big circle around the whole Courtyard and just spend hours pondering The Lord's Prayer and all of these different languages for the first time we went there there were a couple like buses parked in front of the crowd was filled with tourists but was awesome was one tourist bus was full of Koreans and then another
 where is bus was full of people from I don't know what country in Africa I'm guessing Kenya cuz it's like so many Christians in Kenya what was the Mets and then there are other visitors there too but I still remember the experience of so there may be a you know hundred people in this Courtyard I didn't hear any English and I was kind of walking around the hallways with Jessica and I'm hearing people read The Lord's Prayer and say it and all these different languages not a hundred you know the right all the only whatever 10 happening up that moment or something and or maybe a couple of other people with skin as light as mine in the courtyard but you can just picture the scene for some reason that memory really hit me there is still it's me it was like this awareness that I knew in theory. Singh in Jerusalem where are followers of Jesus from all over the planet were coming and sharing this very
 it's a prayer together and I just realize like I have something deep lie in common with all of these people that I've never met from all of the planet yeah it was a pretty remarkable experience at school yeah you have this prayer in common which is very significant and of itself yeah but that's just a piece of something much larger that you have in common yeah that's right yeah we're at somehow we're all on the other side of the planet from where we live for these really far away but all the same yeah there's something drawing us into the city to the story Into the person who the person was one person I have in common with all of these and he's a person who is deeply important to me or answered most of my life trying to figure out what I'm used to follow the person you are and it's true for most of them but these people are really different from me and we're in this court
 anyway I was one of those was one of the stipend moments here so I had that experience many times over at most of the polling sites for the rest of the year that we went to is just an international crowd of Christians coming to Jerusalem and israel-palestine but what school is that the Church of the paternoster the courtyard itself in bodies that diversity and unity through the same prayer being written in a hundred different Expressions language so that's one over there we didn't go through Nazareth the city now to Big City and actually yeah it's one of the larger cities where you have a Jewish Israeli and Arab Israeli population mix think it's a b the proportions are different than they are ants in many other Israeli town do we live in different parts of the city
 where is it pretty in a mixed in Jerusalem for example that's really divided between East and West, Jewish and an Arab downtown it just seems like everybody's in the max right here again in the middle of the city of Nazareth which wasn't the town of like a few hundred and she has to stay now it's like I'll tens of thousands of people and is it the same same city ever the kind of like read who constructed excavations of like the oldest section of the same spot corrector City modern city has grown up around and rings around the older site but in the heart of the city is another Roman Catholic church and holy site called The Church of the Annunciation and it's all about memorializing the story of Mary learning that she's pregnant with Jesus and so you go inside and in the court
 start and end in the church are a couple hundred paintings of Mary and Jesus the Madonna and child it's like she's a Mary holding Jesus but what are they commissioned all these works of art is they had almost every country in the world has represented and they had artists from every different nation and culture depict Mary and Jesus in the unique traditional art style of their culture and so you're just walking through it you know I just included some pictures here but for people listening to us Google Church of the Annunciation paintings and it's so awesome so awesome and so you walking through looking at a Bolivian Mary Romanian Mary and Jesus Vietnamese Singapore or Greece yeah all different sorts of art styles
 did they give him a color palette though because there's a lot of similarities in these like oranges and now that's interesting that's a good question I don't know I'm Scottish so I have a particular Affinity to the Scottish man in Thailand Croatia so awesome the most epic one is one with all those Rays coming out that's Croatia in Croatian Mary and Jesus are so many times over the year was the same experience but even more tangible because there was always the international crowd every time we were there male say that's in Western culture for people who are aware of the value multiculturalism growing awareness of the the white European captivity of pictures of Jesus in Mike Western Art and Christian Media
 tivity will the Jesus is portrayed as a wipe your peeing male and most of the history of Western Art I distill perpetuated today totally go to the Church of the Annunciation and when you see a hundred different ethnic representations of Jesus then you realize I'm okay everyone's and the question is are we imposing our is Nick identity under Jesus or maybe it's the reverse it's the the nature of who Jesus is his identity and story is that he is my brother and he's the brother of all of us and what he came to do and what he did and who he is right now and what his story represents it speaks to the deepest part of the human longing that is universal to the whole brother and Sisterhood of humanity and so you walk into this church and you see Jesus face in all the ethnicities of are all the school is very
 it would be cool to weave depicted Jesus in many different ways throughout our our videos videos and I wanted to put them all up together just so can you can see all the different yes we try not to do a white jesus yeah but in our doodle style and kind of almost feels like it's a white jesus because he doesn't have color than the white background my background kind of thing that makes me feel like they're but yeah there's all sorts of a variety of ways that we can pick the GZA on one level it's unhealthy that one coulter's black portrayal of Jesus has become a default at least in Europe and America awesome but at the same time the intuition underneath that I think is right name because that expression came from White Caucasian and it's not wrong for them to imagine a Jesus who is like them
 I think what the error or the Distortion comes when we imagine Jesus as primarily what Jesus did live in human history and correct and have color skin yeah actually his ethnic identity was crucial to his mission and purpose but it wasn't why Europeans so I heard you do a whole year of these types of experiences it really marked me and so in the Years afterward I was on a hunt to just learn more about global Christianity just to like get more educated and I discovered the work of a scholar named Philip Jenkins prolific he was a professor of history and religion at Penn State now he's a baylor-texas he is done the best job of popularizing the importance of the growth of global Christianity that is a coup
 who sang white European American Christianity in the modern-day you turn my modern day or you just kind of in the late or early 2000s into the teens China probably correct yeah and in Kenya and Uganda so here's just some quotes hear this from a book called the new faces of Christianity Jenkins says in the world today I think it was writing this in 2012 there are approximately 2 billion Christians what are the world population been doing in the last decade and about seven and a half billion right now 7 in 2019 and 2012 it would have been 7.1 when he says 2 billion Christians you know who defines what that means I get to people who would identify with the Christian tradition in some way to billion people on the Earth in 1927 wow you know it's also really interesting to think about
 sorry this is a tangent I've been studying a lot about ancient near East as we've been at the other podcast and one thing that's been striking me is how few people there actually were yes yeah sure. I'm just looking at this chart 2000 BC 27 million people on the planet planet yeah man that okay so Jenkins I think riding and not 2012 I think maybe two thousand seven I forget in the world today there are approximately 2 billion Christians of those the largest contingent about five hundred and thirty million live in Europe Europe still the numerical highest number close behind however is Latin America with five hundred ten million Africa 309 million and Asia bi-weekly means China and then hold South Pacific about 300 million
 if we project that number forward into the future the numbers change quite rapidly by 2025 the title for most Christian continent that is the continent with the largest number of Christians will be in competition between Africa and Latin America we move further into the future however there is no doubt by 2050 Africa will win in terms of population distribution Christianity will chiefly be a religion of Africa and the African diaspora which will buy then in a sense be the heartland of Christianity 2050 that's his that's his predictions so for not the whole of Christianity and modern modern West Urban environments I think Christianity is associated with the Western World the west and with your up so that's a in North America yeah that's a medieval phenomenon and that's not taking into account the Eastern Orthodox Church
 yeah the Eastern Christian today so this was another book that he wrote called The Lost Christianity and by lost emails lost to Western memory but the conversion of the kingdom of Armenia in the early centuries they were whole like Kingdom some people groups that adopted Allegiance I don't know many of those stories they're all in there all in the East what is today is called the Middle East right now or turkey or Optic yep that's right Syrian Orthodox Syrian Orthodox and a Syrian Orthodox so moving forward it's going to be the eclipse of Western European and American Christianity just numerically and so yeah yeah I said the famous quote from his other book called the new Chris and them we says as Christianity moves to the globe
 south southern southern hemisphere Christianity is also entering a world that is very poor if you want to think of an average Christian in the world today the average follower of Jesus comes up like who should you think of terms of who makes up the largest category of a demographic and he says you should think of a woman living in a village either in Nigeria or in a father Le a shanty town in Brazil probably somebody who buy typical American Standards is inconceivably for to a virgin Siva bleed for two in America you can't even imagine the party yeah what's interesting is if you walked around Portland and you ask someone to name an average Christian yes it's just in the news is all about it's more about this kind of very nationally focused very political Christian who
 kind of like rich and wants you to do what they want you to do I'm with you I mean having grown up in Portland this is why I go and live in Jerusalem was such a shock to my system it was an Awakening to the fact that I was only familiar with one little sliver of the cultural expressions that are Christianity and the demographic reality of Christianity already makes that point but the history of the Jesus movement itself also makes that point and so it became strange to me how you know even when I move back to Portland years later it was like coming back but it felt totally different because all the same things that I grew up with you know if Christianity being associated with only one type of culture it just all seems so backwards or almost sheltered but deny Eve's mom
 and a view of what Christianity is but that was my experience growing up here
are you tell me if there's a burin experience of this kind of thing as you become more aware of the global chair Global church and exits through this project I don't get out a lot.
 I'm pretty I'm an I'm pretty sheltered I theoretically we're at least yeah I saw this it was a tweet I spent too much time with just the confession time and I saw this this tweet I really cut through the noise in a beautiful way someone said something to the effect of you have more in common with other I don't remember the example they gave us was just give us a sample of a poor I think conceivably poor woman living in Nigeria with a Christian then you do with someone in your political party but doesn't follow Jesus and that really shook things up because it's so easy to begin to identify with other things and not realize I missed a powerful thing to say I don't even fully appreciate that I have more in common with a poor Nigerian Christian woman words up or
 boy growing up in a shanty town in Brazil then I do with someone in my city who isn't following Jesus there's there's something so some massive about following Jesus and the Lord's Prayer being just a symbol of that changes your identity that there is there's that Bond I think just saying that out loud it's startling because I don't think about that yeah yeah ok Google yeah that's exactly right to say it again this is part of Philip Jenkins whole project in writing as many books as he can the popular audiences the Jesus movement is the most culturally ethnically diverse people movement that's ever happened to the human race somehow the ability of the story of Jesus which is the biblical story is able to speak to every different kind of human and address
 their deepest questions or problems our longings about themselves about other people about God about the world however it's such a universal story that it can go on and be adapted Andre Express in innumerable cultural facts of their many diverse religious movements I'm not saying there aren't other diverse religious movement but nothing equals the adaptability of the story of Jesus in terms of the sheer number of cultures that have adopted it and made it their own cuz it's not bound in any language it's not bound to any one culture it's not bound to a piece of land I mean is really it's it's Universal and so the question is what's going on here is this just like a happy incidental feature and so what I'm hoping for this video is so just address that the essence of the story of Jesus which is the essence of the biblical
 that's actually baked into what it's about that it is and it's very essence as a story saying that the only way forward for Humanity and the thing that God is doing in the story of humanity is unifying diverse Nations into one new Humanity that's the goal of the biblical story but not in a way that your races or marginalizes anyone cultures difference but actually in a way that honors and resurrects and glorifies what is unique and beautiful about every different kind of human culture again and I'm having grown up here in Portland I was raised with a cultural value of diversity you know in the abstract even though Portland history new house the exact opposite story so does the state of Oregon but it's sort of like it's in the air that you value that right and so this is one of those things where the story of Jesus and the biblical story actually
 takes ethnic diversity more seriously than the more popular value of multiculturalism in Western culture and has a version of the human story is that is so so radical that sounds radical and scandalous even people who say they value multi-culture really I think so once you get into the biblical story I can see it feeling very scandalous to someone who is scared and I don't want any way to mean this kind of person because there is a lot of fear around with people globalism sure and actually I think it's a good intuition which is if the world is crooked and did the powers are at work you know creating evil and Injustice and stuff a global version of that is the worst thing you can imagine
 and so there's this kind of you think about human history in the way that like people have been creating tribes and then creating Empires and Nations and like now are these nation states were hundreds of millions of people all have an identity as a nation-state and so some people are theorizing that you just go forward in the future and eventually it's inevitable is going to be some sort of global yeah unified something yeah I'm in an already at the so many things are global economy is global the internet is global and all the stuff so there's a fear of that yes that's right and so to say that that the Bible has a global vision I can see why people can start squirm yeah that's going to go away the beast that's the dragon that had Avalon yeah because it is it is the icon for the unification of a false
 Humanity false new Humanity so we'll talk about this is Central to the story of the nation's the unification of the nation's so yeah that it's not whether humans want to unify or think they should be unified and the question is what is the story driving that Unity we're going to be unified there is a unifying power that's happening we are. Yeah it's I think it's built in the question is what is the story about human identity and value the drives that unification and in a way that's difficult, it's a tale of tension between two visions of what a unified Humanity ought to look like in the one leads to a city called Babylon and the other leads to a host of Damages the Garden City New Jerusalem is the cities
 kind of going to be yeah I'm going to separate it out separated. Yeah we're going to talk about the the the the interrelationship of the families and tribes of the land don't copy in the story of the Bible is overlap with families and tribes Tri-Cities but when we get to the city it'll be about the development of the city's going to be about the family's is about a genealogical ties kinship ties in the story The Bible but against a the main point the heartbeat of the Jesus movement from the beginning was to go out to all nations Make Disciples of all Nations back to juice from Jerusalem to Judea Samaria to the ends of the Earth
 the idea that only in Jesus can Humanity be unified in a way that will generate life and love and human flourishing as we ReDiscover the image of God in each other and with each other so that's a scandalous claim that's made by the story of Jesus and there are many other rival claims to how the human family ought to be unified but that that is the claim and by definition it's born true in history even though I'm not saying church history therefore vindicates everything that any church has ever done now but to say there is I think there is one thing to celebrate that it's become the most multi-ethnic religious movement in history and there is immense potential here for the future of the human story if we understand what the story actually is
sounds kind of anecdotal and then some demographic data thank you Philip Jenkins but passages in the New Testament that kind of show this theme in full flower when we do see videos we start at the beginning where I have a seed picking up on the metaphor for it's like fully bloomed biblical Theology of the multi-ethnic family of God at a culminating point in Paul's letter to the Romans Roman Christians which is a church that's dividing itself along ethnic lines and socioeconomic lines to Jewish and non-jewish and people who are taking Torah observant as the marker of identity for the family to us and then people who have a different view of the laws of the Torah identify the followers of Jesus to Paul's whole goal is to show how
 call June Anjou unified not by the Torah but by our Allegiance and faith in Jesus and so has 15 verses 8 and following this really cool is that for I say that the Messiah has become a servant to the circumcision which is the Jewish Torah observant Israel the family family of Israel that they identified by its adherence to the Torah with circumcision is in outside of that correct pin is the Messiah has become a servant servant just pause upload everything that servant means in Hebrew Papa theme of the servant can the Revival but he's become a servant to Israel
 on behalf of God's faithfulness for two purposes he makes two purposes clear first in order to confirm the promises that he gave to the father's these are but I'm going to bless you turn you into a great nation wreck so one whole roll of Jesus as the Messiah is to fulfill God's promises to the family of Abraham is real to confirm got the promises to the ancestors of this realm of you so that you can now have the things that you were promised that's right and they give them to you so here's the second reason I became a servant is a 9 so that the nation's would glorify God for his mercy so the logic what he saying here is Jesus's mission was first to the family of Israel
 let the nation's would honor God for his Mercy the way he thinks about who Jesus is and the story that he fits into a zoo with a mission of God to first of all to fill his promises to Israel one specific Nation One Nation to so that all of that the other nations would look on or somehow participate and therefore glorify God for his birthday so this is we're getting core to the logic of the family of God in the story The Bible it's there's a Israel Focus but that is real focus is the means through which all of the nations are brought in on the party so speak Genesis 12 and 15 which one is the one where he's kind of explicitly says God's promises
 we'll come back around come back to that statement now so he's supposed summary of the story of the Old Testament and the purpose of Jesus's wife's death and resurrection and then he goes on to support it was for quotations from the scriptures of Israel to say this is what the whole therefore I will praise you among the nation's though in some translation to get translated as the word Gentiles but we talked about this up front and tile Gentile I'd never heard of it because yeah I don't really know where that word comes from yeah but it just means everyone is not not you I thought you were saying I actually didn't do black Oxford English Dictionary search on Gentile the Greek words translated here is sna from which we get our word as an officer ethnic ethnic this means the nation's it's the Greek word for Nations
 referring not to the modern nation-state but to what we would say more as ethnic identity people are tribal relation a bloodline particular family connected to a bloodline there's lots of those a lots of lots of as we have ours there's lots of other ones and there are still many nations that are identified with one particular ethnic ethnicity but for the most part the modern nation-state in the 1800s he knows his being can see him was to create a land boundary line best national identity that could be made up of lots of different types of people groups oh so you know Gene the same routes from Gentile which is yeah yeah I did I had no idea it comes from gentes or get to us when we the race or Clan which is I guess it's proto-indo-european
 worse comes to worse so effing a dentist or where you come from I had never heard the word Gentile until you're reading the Bible word what do we say Foreigner or no would you say would you have a word for not American oh I was the international internet or ethnicity or multi-ethnic when I want to talk about all of the different people groups are you see outside of my own Nation or whatever I would say the Nations International multi-ethnic those are good phrases ever use in your mind you replace that with multi-ethnic among the multi-ethnic nations of the world yeah that's right so now only some English translation still use the word Gentile to translate the Greek word athame so for example I think this is the new American
 and it says Gentiles the English Standard Version says Gentiles The New International Version has Gentiles well there you go that's popular Gentiles people of other genes it's from the perspective of somebody of a speaker or a writer Who belongs to the Jewish ethnic anybody who's not Jewish right is called the nation's sure that's what the term mean in the Bible when you come across a non-jewish because the Bible was written by written by the name is a servant to confirm the promises given to Israel and so that the nation's could get in on the party and he's going to support this idea from four different texts from the scriptures of Israel
 first quote therefore I will give you praise among the Nations and I will sing your name to quote from a song of David all that time explaining Gentiles and then you didn't use the word know why does my people will see it in their Bibles yeah and I just I don't like using the word in English which nations are translations supposed to be translations have to translate the translation from David but poem The David sings at the end of the story at the conclusion of 2nd Samuel that's why there's a second quote again it says quote Rejoice O nations with his people quoting from the song of Moses at the end of Deuteronomy verse 11 and again quote praise the Lord all ye nations let all the peoples praise him quotes from Psalm 117 the short
 in whole collection and 12 and again Isaiah says quote there shall come the root of Jesse the one who arises to rule over the nation in him the Nations will help now concluding verse 13 Paul says may the god of Hope fill y'all with joy and peace as you have trust face so that y'all will overflow in Hope by the power of the Holy Spirit the great computer so notice what he's just done he's quoted from all of the four sections of the Tanakh of the structure of the Hebrew Bible the Jewish tradition. Pulled from all over ya in the Torah and then from the prophets which have two cats subcategories is the former prophets
 Lotto profits and then from the Psalms which had off the food section the writings this would be like quoting from quoting a line from four different bodies of work to be like quoting from each of the three original trilogy Star Wars I'm sorry all of the Star Wars movies and speak to us through about how the all of the nations are going to come give their allegiance to the god of Israel and the realize their identity
here's my point here is the Apostle to the Gentiles Paul and at the culmination of a letter where he's trying to help followers of Jesus who are of different ethnic groups in there at odds with each other and then when he wants to summarize the whole thing like what's this all about he paints a picture of the international family of God that is Unified not by its ethnic identity not buy a piece of land not even by a cultural heritage the laws of the Torah what unifies them is that through the Messiah they can now all be a part of the human family that is Unified with its creator and praise and worship and is it clear to you through these specific versus or from elsewhere that these nations will retain their identity as Nations or will they
 actually become identified more with the Messiah that they lose their identity as Nations great question let's just register it because it'll be underlined is that theme of the one in the money for the many to become wand to say stop being the many right or is it is it the case that the biblical story is actually trying to reconfigure our whole sense of what it means to be a one
 what it means to be an individual human what is it was it mean to be a human is it actually possible for me to be a human and not retain my own unique identity is it possible for me to be human and be closed off to all the other expressions of human this around me right you can say the Western culture has hyper exalted the individual identity many traditional cultures Eastern cultures Elevate the identity of the group The Family tribal unit at the expense of any one individual what's the weather so you got that individual family tribal unit which at the smallest level is the immediate family at the largest level you can imagine right now is like an athame which could be millions of people yeah now we're talking about a third category which is I don't know we don't call it the family.
 a term for example and so I'm actually specifically thinking about the Aetna versus the family of God what the relationship there and you're just saying that relationship between what it means to have your own ethnic identity and to be part of the family of God that's a great question yes let's go yeah the story is exploring that black one thing it's always stood out to me in the very end of Revelation the New Jerusalem is there and there's Nations outside of the New Jerusalem and is like gates are open or not. Stephen for flour in the last book of the Bible there's a phrase used throughout the last book of the Bible it's a formula in the revelations the Revelation it's a phrase that appears throughout it
 10 times every nation tribe people in tongue or every tongue tribe Nation languages before it's either three or four part formula used throughout the Houston times anyway you want to divide things up I put all of them ever tried every people language the first time it appears is in Revelation chapter 5 in what's called The Throne Room saying John the Visionary gets he sees eaten what you see is this place we're having dinner there one which is the Defiance syndrome and it's all of the beings of the head of my surround Rim the living creatures and 24 Elders in and they're singing a new song sang 5:9 singing to the lamb slain lamb you are worthy to take the scroll open it seals because you were slaying and with your blood you purchased for God person
 from every tribe and language and people and Nation you made them to be a kingdom and Priests to serve our God and they will rain on the way yeah you made them a kingdom yes that makes him feel very unified it's one group and they are a kingdom yes and in this being free that's that's pretty intense because that was not just for for Israelites the very specific subset of his real identity of the representative one in their midst there was one small family of priests but here the whole people is being called you priests to rain on Earth as our theme of the image of God yeah so this is the first time that phrase appears and it's just saying every time I've heard that Jesus came to create
 International a multi-ethnic kingdom of priests rule has got the partners in the new creation chapter 5 verses 9 and 10 and then the phrase goes on to a nine more times in the end 10 is that on purpose I think so that's one of the Sinai speeches here the last time the word Nations appears is because the one I'm Revelation chapter 21 and 22 the first one is in 21:24 the first of the last time the word Nations a three times in the last two chapters and it's the last time that the word appears in the book so you're right in this portrait was talking about the new Eden / New Jerusalem / Heavenly Temple that has come down to earth so that have another one too and you think I'm probably verses 23 and 24 that right
 the city does not need the Sun or the moon to shine on it for Glory of the glory of God gives a light that's on the way to school today to bring the boys to school I'll try to explain to him how the Sun works
 and then that I got so how will the Sun explode one day and that was a bad move as a dad literally have been a really know what millions of years really is that she lost her explode my dad says that explode and then I thought you know anything about what would it be like to live without the Sun bright he was like oh let's go find another one yeah yeah yeah song out into space was the first toy Chica the Nations will walk by its light which is God's light
 is the city doesn't need the sun or moon for car glory of God illuminates it out of the city for the nation's walk by its light the city Slide the City slide but the city's light is the Lambs like in the lamb is it slam is the lamp of the city yeah we should be okay so where's this obviously we're speaking on. But the point is that the city is almost now indistinguishable from the lamb the lamb is like the city
 write the city doesn't need to sign a moon why the glory of God likes it up the city yeah I'll get your eyes so that it's that more of that the glory of God is the Lamb that is the light of the sea that lies the city that the city is the light because the lamb the glory got to slide the Nations will block by yes it's light and the kings of the earth is the King's the kings of the earth which makes you think all of his King's portal when there's Nations plural will bring their Splendor into it I know they will its Gates ever be shots for there will be no night there and they will bring the glory and honor of the nation's into it as picture of a city that's kind of like the epicenter donations come and give gifts but in my mind then I don't get this picture of than everyone that lives in the city their kings
 other places that's right cuz I remember the first time the formula appeared why is the lamb slain so the out of every nation time try and people a kingdom of priests is created who Reign Over the Earth who Reign Over the nutrition yes so don't you think that's all these Kings and nations are there the Nations tribes sewing what is the city if this new city is the New Kingdom you can live outside of the Kingdom animation and then come back to it it's saying the city is the radiating Life Center the center from which all of life and Order radiates out into the new creation there's the New Creations all of it yes but you can talk about its Central Hub and this is like the tree of life this is the the temple this have both the microcosm of the whole Cosmos
 yes which is the glory of God which is the Lamb which is the resurrected Jesus the resurrected Jesus is almost swapped out here for the city but he's out here that can be identified by the Light of the city or the city itself has become synonymous correct. It is so is saying that the new Humanity retains its unique identity as the Human family has expanded and grown did Humanity doesn't ignore or erase those identity what it does is reconcile those many precisely through the difference so that the one becomes an enriched one the one becomes the one being the one new Humanity dies which is the lamp
 now you're just trying to make my brain hurt or categories for Humanity is the Lamb the lamb a man is the son of Adam he's the dude he is the new human he is our brother who is the when we get to Seasons this is how tall will talk. Sorry. Go ahead of the human body all these damn that's right so this is what yeah it's an important picture of the last pages of the last book of the Bible are all about this theme the family of God that is one and many at the same time one family with many nations many different cultural expressions different Kings different splendors
 type yeah what what is the unique Glory that the people of Uganda O'Brien the people of Brazil and the people of you know Thailand and the people of Scotland they all have a unique way of reflecting the creative Beauty in imagination of God and only together does the portrait make the complete portrait of God that we are meant to damage I think that's the that's the thing which means that I can't actually fully realize my Humanity without understanding and appreciating and being connected feeling connected to the refugees are called yeah they express the identity of another of someone who's better than me my Humanity consists of other people's Humanity this vision of the human person it's only together to be fully human now you have to be able to be
 connected to every expression of humanity and what can only be found in understanding being connected to an appreciating the humanity of others who are different than me and that doesn't mean you lose your own identity correct by definition it means I retain it cuz they need my expression expression yeah and I need theirs again this is the seedbed of this is the little image of god poem Genesis 1:12 next and then that deep sleep that the human has in Genesis to where the one becomes too so that they can become one again the potent image that Jesus and Paul were into cuz they thought the whole biblical story told in miniature right there but that's where we going for the point is
 currently demographically historically through history and in the logic of the biblical story where they look at Paul to look at Revelation the family of God as a multi-ethnic unified yet diverse body is core-core to the biblical story and it's also a message of the biblical story on the scene that I think a thin mint potential to speak to followers of Jesus around the world today myself included episode of The Bible project podcast theme video on the family of God is out as of January 2021 we spent a lot of time on this video it's brand new style tried a lot of new things and we're really excited to share with you next week we'll continue this conversation in this brand-new theme on the family of God and we're going to see how God begins to introduce
 diversity into the Human family and one of the very first stories of the Bible about at a store you might be familiar with but are likely going to be surprised by and he took one from his side's for this isn't a bro so almost all English translations going back to the first one with Wickliffe have entered of the word rib here it is certainly not what the word man today show is produced by Dan Campbell our theme music from the band tents and shown Us by Lyndsay Ponder Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofits and we exist to show the Bible as one unified story that leads to Jesus do we have all sorts of resources to do that this podcast the videos we make yes I have Seminary level classes we've got other resources all for free because this is a crowdfunded project and people have already paid for it which is incredible thank you so much for your generosity thanks for being a part of this with us who is Harrison Barnes
