we are tracing a theme in the Bible that were calling the firstborn the theme about who God chooses to rule the world on his behalf at the theme about power, power should be used today we arrived in the New Testament and we talked about how Jesus is the ultimate power in the universe the firstborn of all creation this title get specifically applied to Jesus by Paul l in the New Testament with the gospel authors make the same point in a different way by calling Jesus the son of God and the first time that title is used a fuse as publicly as in the story of us that the story is about the commissioning of the Sun as the Son of God to begin ruling over creation is God's image and son and that's what's being announced here not a new identity that a human is somehow like adopted into but didn't have before baptism is an anointing ceremony of the true king this king is born
 the woman but also has a cosmic identity and makes him the true ruler Cosmos please two ways that Jesus is the son of God one is to his human lineage it goes through Joseph look back to Adam and that's crucial for him coming at the humans to do for humans with no human seems to be able to do but the baptism this revealing the other aspects of his identity that in appearing among us as a son of Adam. One is at the same time the Eternal son of the father if Jesus is the ultimate power how will he use it after his baptism he goes into the Wilderness with Satan tempt him to do what other firstborns have done before him see the power by their own means but Jesus will succeed where others have failed by the very Act of surrendering his life but the Hebrew Bible is just like oh cycle cycle but it keeps pointing forward to the promised that eventually comes to be focused on a hoped-for king
 the lineage of David Israel second thing and that one is going to be the lowest of the lowest of the low that God will Elevate to the highest of the highest of the high by giving their life in the place of others and for their sins today to Mackey and I talked about the identity of Jesus as the firstborn son of God of John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us
hello Tim John hi hey we have turned a corner and our conversations on this theme we're calling the theme of the first born
 and if you've been following along you know what that means and by turn a quarter I mean we have talked through the storyline and how this theme weaves through the story of the whole Hebrew Bible and now we're going to open up a gospel and start reading about Jesus and see how this is named has a climax in the identity of Jesus and so maybe Tim give us the like 3 minutes explained her on the theme of the first point well on page one of the story The Bible God appoints human image bearing representative to embody the Divine Rule and presents and power and creativity in the world to take responsibility for it in partnership with God that does the image of God but that image is subverted and deceived and lured in
 to disobey the word and wisdom of God and is exiled in the land of Dustin test and so what begins as a pattern of God choosing someone from the Next Generation and elevating them to have a chance at a baseball metaphors coming to my mind right now cuz I don't really watch baseball but the chance at the plate as it were a chance to go up to that and what's interesting is the one that God consistently chooses to you know go up to bat or I guess soccer to kick the ball in bounds or something I guess you don't kick as you throw it in advance when the balls out of bounds in soccer is not right in soccer yeah you throw it in there I've got a big Sports guy but
 you're a sucker fish and yeah well you know okay so in indoor soccer you kick it in football is what I meant to say either way God God consistently chooses people to be the one to get into the game back in the game and got cuz it's only Tuesday the latecomer the second-born the person of lower social status and buy the game is important to remember that we are talking about in general like food we put in charge of our institutions and and food we give the authority to like Rule and in among us but underneath that is this promise that takes place yes early and Genesis that there's going to be this one special human the seed of the woman who is going to rule and
 the way that he actually crushes evil the head of evil the head of the venomous snake and it said that seed that rule that ruler like who whose family is he going to come from what line going to come from and I do a lot of this choosing who's in the game who's at bat is about where's this yes a Crusher going to because through that one the blessings in life of Eden will be restored took out the world that's what's implicit there in the in the promise and so God consistently chooses
 the carrier of this promised lineage to be from among those who are the latecomers those of a lower status and it sets in motion all these cycles of the biblical story that we're calling just under the title of the first born so the first born can get angry the one of high status can get angry and persecute or get hostile to the one that God has chosen sometimes the younger one who's not chosen but thinks they ought to be will engage in hostile rivalry towards their elders and then sometimes the one of low status or rank or the latecomer that God does choose it eventually goes to their head and then they abuse that privilege and end up replaying the cycle of The Human Condition all over again essentially what the Hebrew Bible is it's just a cycle cycle Cycles
 but it keeps pointing forward to this promise that eventually comes to be focused on a hoped-for king from the lineage of David Israel second king and that one is going to be the lowest of the lowest of the low
 that God will Elevate to the highest of the highest of the high by giving their life in the place of others and for their sins that's where we ended in our last conversation in the suffering servant poems of Isaiah so with all of that said from Isaiah and the whole Hebrew Bible I didn't do a very good job of explaining that quickly you have to come and rescue me from my sports metaphors Alex great little place Sports metaphors anyway with all that said we really do transition into the story of Jesus and what we're going to do is touch down out a few points in the gospel narrative and what kind of sample actually passages from Mark Luke and Matthew that explore this theme of Jesus as the I know what he saying the ultimate first born for the ultimate Cosmic first born of God so shall we dive into the Gospels
 so let's start with Mark who has the briefest and most kind of concise introduction to the story of Jesus there's no birth narratives in the stories about Mary or Joseph or anything it just begins with a long while actually would have begins with the words the beginning the beginning of the good news about Jesus Messiah and then depending on your translation it's the phrase the Son of God so it's real quick compare
 actually almost all of our modern translations have the Son of God and it's cuz it's good manuscript support for it however there are a few manuscripts that are significant Witnesses texture witnesses to the early text of the Gospel that don't have the phrase Son of God it just reads the beginning of the good news about Jesus Messiah Christ meeting Messiah Jesus Jesus Christ that's right in the earliest version of Mark it doesn't make a huge difference to the point we're trying to raise here but the point is it that Jesus is identity as the ultimate first born of God and we actually won't Explorer well you will begin to explore what that means that the gospels are exploring what it means to say a thing like that and then we'll explore it a lot more in the neck
 what's up when we get to Paul and he bruised but Mark begins out of the gate without line so in other words it tells you about the identity of Jesus it makes a claim the first statement of Mark is a claim about the identity of Jesus but he's the messiah messiah in the Son of God so the rest of the story is essentially going to be about unfolding that claim in narrative through a sequence of narratives and it's mostly going to be about how people slowly come to the realization of Jesus is high-density Richard Hayes New Testament scholar remember his treatment of Mark that I came across a long time ago if he said Mark is like the opposite of like a mystery story
 where the identity like I didn't like a whodunit Amanda reading this great life children's mystery story to my boys about stolen treasure all these people are in a castle and a blizzard and then this like the castle treasure was stolen and whole story is about this will teddy bear that because all the characters are talking like stuffed animals is trying to figure out who's the one that took the treasure and no fun man a good who done it you know it's so fun again so Mark is the opposite of that because you're being told who the main character is and who they really are in the first sentence and it creates this dramatic irony because the story is really going to be about how everybody else does or does not come to a realization of who you know this character today so it begins with a quotation from Isaiah and Malachi that introduces John the Baptist and then
 John the Baptist is doing his thing in the wilderness the renewal movement taking his real back to the Jordan River dunking them in the river as a way of identifying is preparing his real or God show up like Isaiah and Malachi promised and we're going to consider is the baptism of Jesus Chi-Chi story which we read many times over the years but just want to look at it from this angle with the steam in mind
sew-in Mark 1 verse 9 we read in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and he was baptized by John in the Jordan River immediately coming up out of the water he saw the heavens interesting standard has opening but it's the word like ripped or torn open send me the Greek word skids or skid Zane from where we get our English word Schism so it's like a violin opening garment open if we talked about this Mark identifies the one who sees this happening not as everybody but it's Jesus Jesus saw the heavens torn open and the spirit descending like a dove upon him and then a voice came out of those ripped Open Heavens saying you are my beloved Son in you
 well pleased first story the short and sweet now I always get a bit turned around with these phrases Son of God and son of man ever similar phrases we're introduced up top with Mark as the Son of God and then here in the baptism
 just a few verses later he's called God's beloved Son yeah what was the title Son of God may be started there just re-uploaded that in my mouth well I mean how many levels of context for it so the phrase son of Elohim in Hebrew Bible means a member of the class the Spiritual Beings so this is what the Spiritual Beings in Genesis 6 are called that's the first time the phrase is used son of a Levine is not
 of the Messiah the Spiritual Beings and that's a common phrase actually to refer to beings who share in the class of having a spiritual nature like the one true God is used in Psalm Psalm 29 Psalm 82 Psalm 89 to refer to Spiritual Beings but in the story of the Hebrew Bible God appoints certain human representatives to be his son and specifically David and the line of Kings from David in 2nd Samuel chapter 7 and then install them to which supplies the language for God's quote right here God appoints a messiah a king from The Wire David who is one day going to rule
 over the Nations and bring God's Heavenly rule to Earth
 and so that human one who is God's vehicle to be his rule on Earth is called my son didn't sound too and also Israel was called thank you Yes actually in Exodus chapter 4 God called Israel my firstborn son which we talked about earlier in the series because Israel is not the firstborn among the Nations and in that moment Egypt was claiming to be the one chosen by God to rule the Nations which is why they enslave other nations and God saying actually it's your slaves one of those people groups is my first born son to be a Son of God call the son of God is to say that you are a people or a person who's being can I uniquely chosen to represent God in a unique way in the background of the term
 so this term and that's just in the Hebrew Bible so this term is capable of multiple nuances of meaning and I think what's sometimes challenging for us here we are two thousand years later as the we have inherited a really developed view of what that term means and I think I have you actually comes from the gospel narratives and what they want to tell us about Jesus about the you know the second member of the Trinity God the Father God the son got the spirit and I think those ideas are really rooted in what the gospel authors want to say but the term Son of God was capable of many nuances the meaning when the gospel authors were writing and so what they're going to do is defined what they mean it would Jesus means by being the Son of God by actually reading the narrative you have to have to read The Narrative to know what they mean by it with all those other meetings in the background
 theological dictionary word that they were like plucking from that made a very precise thing but by following the story you will learn what mark means by Jesus Son of God or the baptism Heavens rip Open Sky rips open got Spirit comes down God's voice says you are my beloved Son yeah and he said that's a quotation from Psalm 23 Hebrew Bible quotations being brought together here so the phrase you are my son comes from Psalm to know where God looks out at the Nations that are raging and violent ruled by violent Kings or stealing and plundering from each other and raging against God's Authority cuz they see no Authority greater than themselves and so what God says he laughed
 and he says I already have my king and it's none of you it's the one that I have installed on Zion my Holy Mountain and then that King speaks up to us and saw him too and tells us about this decree that got made about him and he says I'll tell you the decree of the Lord God said to me you are my son today I have and it's the word burst burst you so the risk is being used here as a metaphor cuz it's the you know God is God speaking here in the song This is the Son of God the king relaying to the reader a decree that God made about himself and you saying God has declared about me you are my son and today as of this day
 I have begotten you which doesn't mean that God's given birth to the K rather it means that God is a pointing this thing as the first born son
 so what's interesting here is that this promise that God has appointed a king and designated them as the first born son when you come to this in Psalms you already have all of these pohib Revival in your mind for calling this up what's interesting about the story of Jesus is when Mark calls on these words the question is is Jesus being marked as something that he wasn't already or is he becoming something that he wasn't already or was he always already this and that makes sense if that's a question in the reader's mind and actually that was a huge source of debate in the early centuries
 all the Jesus movement so song to is One Source the Second Source is in you I am well pleased that comes from one of the servant poems in Scroll of Isaiah Isaiah 42 so that hyperlink to all the stuff we talked about in the last episode I was serving stuffy stuff and also connected with David the king from the line of David a new David a new David the last bet is you are my beloved Son not weird Be Loved You are my beloved Son uniquely in Greek Maps precisely on to the Greek translation
 of the story about Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22 where God says take now your son your unique or one and only son the one whom you love and offer him up as a Ascension offering so this very subtle to us but this is totally how do which authors work in the Hebrew Bible and in this. Which is to hyperlink whole big ideas and themes in the Hebrew Bible by just blending together a few chosen words
 so this is a vision that Jesus had when he was baptized and noticed you have the Heavenly voice stating the identity of the sun and the connection or the vehicle that carries that loving pronouncement from the Heavenly voice to the sun is that the spirit you see you have this three God has three and one working together here to send a beloved Son into the world to carry out the vocation of the royal servant
 all that's being like communicated here in the very near future so one of my favorite commentators on the gospels is Rick commentaries on Mark and Matthew this RT France no longer with us but he had a great way of summarizing issues here he says the Divine declaration and the whole experience of which it forms a part is talk about the voice from Heaven is not phrased in such a way as to suggest the Jesus at this point becomes something that he was not before
 The Voice declares who Jesus is not who he has now become and he's talking about the echo of some to hear it may be significant that the part of the verse from Psalm to that speaks of the status as new today I have begotten you mark doesn't include that in his illusion clearly for Mark Jesus will not have to wait until the resurrection or now to become God's son he is so already and there's no hint even at his baptism that this is some new Factor what is new here is the launching into the public exercise of a role for which he as a Son of God is not prepared and that's an important clarification because in other words Jesus is arriving on the scene and what happens the next word after the Divine voice is immediately the spirit compelled him out into the wilderness
 and he begins his mission he overcomes the evil one and then he goes out and starts announcing the kingdom of God so the point is that the story is about the commissioning of the Sun
 as the Son of God to begin ruling over creation is God's image and son and that's what's being announced here not a new identity that a human is somehow like adopted into right I didn't have before and you've talked about this being Jesus is anointing we haven't been talking about that idea but David when he was chosen as King Samuel had his like oil of anointing that we talked about to go take your oil or your horn filled with oil and then he pours it on David When God says that's a guy and David and then he anoints David at the oil and that's the moment then saying David rain is big on yes yeah and so you've said this baptism scene of Jesus he's not being Anointed with oil and this is a rabbit hole I suppose but this is like his anointing
 from heaven with a spirit yeah yeah right I mean it is with David the spirit comes down and anoint him as well like the spirit does to Jesus and so this is the idea of not so just to say like this story is more about the commissioning and they knowledge mint of Jesus as the anointed one versus like making him giving him that's exactly the rest of the Gospel of Mark is going to be designed to keep revealing that so there's two more scenes where there is some Heavenly phenomenon that appears in people look up and then there's some declaration made it about Jesus's identity and all of them reveal not something that Jesus is becoming but it's like the unveiling of who he really is and who has always been and what's new is that he's on the scene to like be the image of God in the Christmas thing
 and like that what's being announced here
so that's the first appearance of this image of Jesus as the Son of God as God's firstborn elevated and pointed commissioned to do his task that's the baptism narrative now in this chapter we were also told that you just came from Nazareth and that's just like lighting up my mind because we just talked about Jesse father David being from Nazareth exactly in the servant of Isaiah 11 we're told that it's going to be a new son of Jesse the new David so is that why the address is being highlighted here so for sure and marks audience just saying you came from Nazareth Echoes all of the other oral Traditions that would have been passed down from the apostles about Jesus as background but Mark doesn't give us that story
 yeah doesn't tell us stories about Mary or Joseph you have to turn to the other gospels to do that and actually it's perfect this is the moment to switch over to Luke so it looks account Jesus is baptism comes in Luke chapter 3 what we called it chapter 3 and immediately after the baptism like the next thing after the Heavenly voice and Luke's account is Luke chapter 3 verse 23 and it is the genealogy of Jesus and just watch how this works of God in Luke God just said you are my beloved Son and you might well please just 23 when Jesus begin his ministry
 Jesus himself was about 30 years of age. This is where that comes from this line I always thought about 30 bout 30 he was as it was supposed the son of Joseph
 the son of Eli the son of my son of Levi's milky and it's about to go on for a long time but first let's just know that he was just in the narrative called my son and then the next line is he was about thirty years old and people thought he was the son of and then we Joseph being his marriage was exactly right yeah yeah and Luke actually has already told you the story of Joseph and Mary you know and Luke chapters one and two so as being his son his status as a son has multiple layers to it because he was born as a human to marry
 but not to Joseph not the whole thing about the Virgin birth and so here there's two ways that Jesus can be called a son he's the son of Mary biologically he's the son of Joseph in terms of as an adopted son and then he's the son of God but watch how this works so he's the son of Joseph and then Lucas just going to carry on Justice lineage all the way back
 linking it up to David and then to Jesse
 and then looking all the way back to Judah
 and then Jacob Isaac Abraham and then working backwards through Genesis 1 through 11 to Tara who is Abraham's father Noah back to Noah back to Enoch back to Seth back to Adam and then the last phrase in the genealogy is so the son of Seth the son of Adam the son of God
 I hope my house is Adam the Son of God so fascinating because Luke equates being the image of God and being the Son of God as being overlapping ideas in some way so the question is is Jesus just a human Son of God or if you knew Adam strictly speaking just another human has given a status that Adam was given which is the image of God exactly and so I think the point of what the gospel authors are saying is they're trying to load the phrase Son of God
 with more meaning because of their convictions about who Jesus is in light of the whole story about him that they want to tell but this is a good example about Adam is the Son of God is using one of the nuances of the phrase in the Hebrew Bible which means a human that God has appointed it doesn't mean that Adam was the second member of the Trinity it means that he was a human appointed by God and made in the image of God and what the gospel hymns are going to go on to try and claim about Jesus it's Jesus isn't just the Son of God like the way out of his of God Jesus is actually the image of God
 in whose image Adam and Eve were made in the bat make sense so full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan River and with lead around by the spirit in the wilderness so the spirit that came on in at the river
 it's like with him now empowering him
 for 40 days to be tested by the slanderer so it's the word devil in our translations but lysistrata devil he is not a name it's a title that means somebody who Slanders or tries to bring someone's reputation into disrepute and he was tested by the Jesus like Moses ate nothing for those forty days forty nights and he was hungry when they were over then the slanderous said to him you know if you really are the Son of God so we're back to that yeah yeah what are we supposed to be imagining he's meeting here yeah exactly well one way to think of it is if you are an image of God like Adam was meant to be that all of Humanity's meant to me
 then I have an idea let's come up with a food test and you're like oh my gosh I'm in the opposite of a garden I'm in the wilderness but it's like I'm in the garden with the snake and the humans with a test of food and that food will determine or somehow tell the truth about this son of God's allegiance to the Father which is what the test of the food of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad it is to exactly right yeah this is Luke's the way of casting Jesus's start back my bad Sports metaphors but now it's Jesus stepping up to the plate as it were as a Son of God and we're going to see like he overcome the test and the tester three times over
 so what Jesus says is listen food doesn't actually determine the life of our world it's the word of God that is our true life who says humans don't live on bread alone yeah which is a quotation from referring to another moment in the wilderness where God was providing got food and so that's all hyper linked to the same idea Israel his firstborn son into the idea is just like Adam and Eve at the tree of wisdom of the fruit that will make them wine it's like are they going to take the fruit or they going to rely on God's word which was don't take the fruit but I guess underneath that do something that God will give me wisdom give me life
 from the Tree of Life right sustenance I don't need that sustenance I've got that there's food that you think will give you life that actually in the long run want but God's word if you hear it and do it that will give you true life and that's what's at stake in the Garden of Eden and that's what's at stake right here with this son of God Jesus cuts to the core of it yeah and that's just the first test 2nd test the slanderer led the Son of God and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a flash of time the moment of time sky like a dream state totally it is another I mean dude he's like Starving in the wilderness so I could really get to Jesus's experience is he is participating in the long tradition in Judaism of focus times of prayer
 where you at even higher would rather deeper level of Consciousness and like an altered state of consciousness in this case through fasting you are cuz your minds going to be doing weird stuff having not been at 4:40 or you ever really flipped out over the idea is that somehow through depriving ourselves of constantly meeting our own needs we achieve a clearer State of Mind as to the true reality and that it's when our stomachs are full that's when we're in a weird state of mind or like not aware of the Marvels around us and of the connections of things and we're just kind of numb to it all and we're happy and we're fasting is about getting Clarity. Reality oh yeah
 so he can see clearly and he's shown that the slanderous says listen I'll give you all of this territory and its honor its Glory
 we were talking about Rule and Authority which is what the name of the firstborn is all about yeah I'll make you can I'll make you yes yes and then the slander says because it has been handed over to me and I can hand it to whomever I desire
 it's such an interesting kind of half-truths they're right because in a way it has been handed over to him like isn't that part of the story is that like God like hands over us to our own desires and so there is a handing over but it doesn't put evil and charged right in the way that the slander saying here so it's like I have to the deep deep inside here and you have to get what was happening in the Hebrew Bible to understand with things cuz when God's desire is for humans to rule his Partners but the snake keeps like hijacking each generation and Adam and Eve and then when the snake appears is the animal called sin in the story of Cain and Abel and then let's figure just goes Underground
 but keep being at work in every generation and every generation that God has an opportunity to rule they handed over to the evil impulse snake through their poor decisions and so in that way the demesne and the glory of ruling the world keeps getting handed over to the snake and the snakes have in Hay Day
 so all those things are really developed throughout the whole Hebrew Bible and then in second temple Judaism and so in a story like this those concepts are just being alluded to like you already know how it all works right so the slanderous says listen if you give your allegiance to me where should me you'll get all the power in the world and so here we are back to the question members he said if you are the Son of God and what you know from the Heavenly voice is the Son of God is the song to ruling King over the nation's but does that rule will be achieved through an act of utter self-surrender like the blood son of Isaac and also through the self-giving sacrifice of the suffering servant the one in whom I am well pleased
 and so there's going to be two pads to power and authority the surrendering of one's life and trusting the word of God is true life or you can take it for yourself which is what is on offer right here the story so amazing this is like everything in the Hebrew Bible and its analysis of the human condition is coming together in the scene right here and we have the ultimate Son of God who is going to make the right choice here
 so there's one more test. This would take too long is the test where you put them on top of the Tabernacle and says jumping upsets right yeah yeah it's your father's hand to save you essential as you show your glory now exactly a spectacle that will make it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt to everybody that you are the Son of God and Jesus says I'm listen I'm not in the business of putting my father to the test he will vindicate me in the eyes of the nation's in his own time I'm not going to make him do it on my time
 so when the devil finished is testing
 he left him until the right time
 and that right time is going to be in the garden the next time he's tested in the garden which is it's the villain in the cartoon I'll be back
 that's exactly when I'll be back it's right now is this is a random side note Y3 is three important as we don't talk a lot about 3 with the tests three times this is the third day three days in the belly of the whale to BJ's in the Tomb of the Wilderness and they don't have water and then they test God God tests them oh yeah three days cycles of three are often associated with this Motif in the kind of the Steam and Melody of the Hebrew Bible which is another person up to have the chance to rule and it's usually the same pattern of 3 at work and they're testing story Gideon's three tests
 in Josh's PS3 tests any longer than I thought it would and that's great but notice that says verse 14 Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the spirit news about him spread through the district he began teaching in their synagogues and hopefully he got meal first then he went back to Nazareth where he was brought up and he goes into the synagogue on the Sabbath and lo and behold the scroll of Isaiah was being read as the portion that day and so he opens the scroll and opens it to Isaiah 61 and he reads the words of Isaiah 61 which is one of these servant poems and Isaiah saying the spirit of the Lord is on me
 because he has anointed me
 to preach good news to the poor to Proclaim release to the captives recovery of sight to the blind to set free those who are oppressed to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord so it's so rad it's like he actually is the ultimate first born
 it's passed the test and now what does he do with his power right what does he do with this opportunity for a hold on though he's the ultimate firstborn is call godson beloved Son is the Son of God and in the Hebrew Bible when God chooses someone to empower them the narrative generally almost always and with failure to failure so here's Jesus he is the Son of God and not just the way that a human is the image of God but he is the image of God which humans image and Luke putting the genealogy and saying he was the son of Joseph so it was supposed friends that's the lineage that he takes all the way down to Adam the Son of God but the baptism
 that's about God saying look you are my beloved Son yeah and in other words his human sonship from Joseph is important crucially important but that's not what the baptism is about the baptism who's human yeah it's humid like Joseph lineage connects him to the servant as being from Jessie and then denied from Adam and then being from Athens to Adam and that's important like he's a huge however he's more than just that and the baptism is about how he actually is the revelation of God's Own Self and God is presented as being father son and spirit working in concert to do what no sons of Adam and Eve have ever been able to do so here we have the chosen son and in all the narratives before we've gone through the chosen son
 was unexpected choice and here that's also in the subtext he's this unexpected you know small-town guy I mean born to an unwed mother teenager and she's definitely in lower social status then the other people in the story around her like a priest who knows that cry but that's the one God has chosen us like his identity is told to us right off the bat which is like no this is this isn't like God choosing the Lesser son yes exactly hurting power this is the guy I like your hat is the Son of God like so he is the true for support and we'll get into that more because I know Paul use that language but these two ways that Jesus is the son of God want us to his human lineage it goes through Joseph Mary and links back to Adam
 and that's crucial for him coming as a human to do for humans with no human seems to be able to do but the baptism is revealing the other aspect of his identity that in appearing among us as a son of Adam that one is at the same time the Eternal son of the Father which Mark doesn't come out and stay with that kind of language but not a colonel in exactly and that's where you just have to read the story to see the claim being very the story you got to read the apostles teachings yet you've got some but also at work in the book of Isaiah and we didn't have time to cover this cuz it's not a series on the book of Isaiah what Isaiah keeps holding out this Future Hope of a coming King from the line of David alongside the future hope that Yahweh himself would show up in person to do with no Israelite or human has ever been able to do and this is Isaiah 40
 Yahweh is coming like a king gather the Sheep into his arms to bring Justice all the nations will see his glory he's coming in person and then gospel narratives take the promise of the king and the promise of Yahweh coming and are putting Jesus in both of those slots as the Divine One and the human one together and that's what they mean when they talk about Jesus as the Son of God revealed like in the baptism story in here
 Pastor the task cruises in Tabernacle time going on there Rita synagogue or whatever it is the reason of Isaiah takes the scroll he reads from this passage about the servant about serving of Isaiah says this is me but the specific passage she wants you to know like what and I love what you said what's he going to do with his status was he going to do with his power and it's to release captives to Kiel to rescue the oppressed in other words in all the cycles of the firstborn seem God Elevate somebody who's not actually the first born
 but here's Jesus on the scene and he really is like the ultimate Son of God and he passes the test and then what he does with his authority and power is to what do you say d Elevate himself or no actually it's rather to raise up others alongside him and who does he raise up those at the bottom of their Social Circles
 so what God has been doing in the story of raising up those of low status in the younger and the second born in the latecomer now Jesus is going to do with his authority and power is the first he's going to do what you always been doing throughout the whole Hebrew people that's really cool yeah because I think I was trying to make the observation may be in our last conversation about how there's two extremes that came out of his theme and one is that the mode that God likes to use to empower people and it's it's upside down unexpected Underdog kind of thing and it's elevating the week elevating the oppressed
 and we're seeing that on cycle and that's part of the first one thing the other thing the firstborn thing though is that no matter who is given power humans are just crapped and we can figure it out and so we need a new human a new Adam the new David and so now these two things have come to a climax and here's the new Adam the new David who is the son he is an image of the Eternal God and made human so he's filling that kind of hope but then we put it back over to the other thing which is like what's God mode how does he like to empower PA yeah it's it's this upside down or how does he exercised his Divine Authority and he doesn't by elevating those who are loved to be high and so this is the launching pad the story of Jesus at the synagogue reading this is the launching pad and what follows are just loads of healing stories after this feeling sick in the poor
 healing people from their slavery to mental and spiritual slavery to the powers to Partners of the slanderer it's truly like the this is what happens when God comes to bring his firstborn authority to bear in the world is he elevates the stick in the poor in the hurting and this apparently is going to be how Jesus exercises and comes to a place as final glory in authority over the Nations which is what the Flandreau was offering him but just without having to go to the bottom so we've just looked at 2 really just the opening chapters of Mark and of Luke and the word firstborn has never appeared but the phrase Son of God has
 and then all of the surrounding scenes that echoed around the firstborn Motif in the Hebrew Bible are getting drawn up on here if you have ears to hear them knew so the next step in the music the good place to go next is one additional moment of this revelation of Jesus identity as the Eternal Son of God and it's at the story of Jesus at Transfiguration and it's another one of these moments like the baptism where who Jesus is and has always been is revealed to the people around him but in a very surprising way that is surprising implications and I think that's the story we should look at next also
