hey John to get to listen to some questions yes about the Exodus roll yeah yeah we took 99 conversations I think maybe 10 to work through that to the scroll I forget PS yeah then we culminated then with the interview with Carmen I'm a friend of scholar who is actively doing research in Exodus so that was a great conversation and now we can interact with questions that all of you listening I sent in this is the largest batch of questions we've ever received forgiving our episodes yeah that was the repeated questions like just the percentage of Swede had that bigger sample
 so like there was definitely a number one most repeat the question we have a bigger batch and if that was it. Then we're going to be at first no it's the moment where God wants to kill Moses but okay but first before we dive into the listener questions we wanted to follow up with one of the episodes we did was about the test that was before Israel as they stood at the foot of Mount Sinai when God showed up and fire and cloud and the whole thing about where the all the people supposed to go up to the top of the mountain was that God's plan or desire and this confusing cuz God says they should come up on the mountain depending on what translation says they should come up on the mountain but then God seems to say they can't Theory says they should be happy that they didn't there you go that's right and so you and I had I took you on a journey
 where when I think make sense of all of that and what was great was Carmen had a different take you and your take Journey you brought me through in the hole and the audience is yes they were meant to go up onto the mountain the invitation to come up onto the mountain by God was a real limitations real invitation and the test was will you come up even though it's dangerous and you're afraid and so in your presentation Israel failed the test you fail the test and the literary design of that whole section
 funky modern Western readers cuz it's out of narrative sequence but the moment that God said they should and could have send his invitation The Narrative really drives it out is on the third day while the trumpet is blasting and the nurse says in the trunk I kept going and going and the people don't go out and then in chapter 20 of Exodus you get a flashback the zeroes in on that moment it's because the people were afraid for their lives and they said they aren't going to go out so that's one interpretation I thought the failure of the test because the ideal is for God's covenant Partners to Return to Eden to return to his eating present so that they can be transformed to become his priests to the Nations become a kingdom of priests and holy nation and bummer that they didn't but good thing that they had someone
 you're not Moses right that's right and so then our conversation with carbon doctor coming times she presented a different explanation which was that it was good that is real didn't go up the mountain that the invitation was there come up under the mountain and she agreed with that but Israel was wise to realize and fearing the Lord that they were not in a place to go up the Holy Mountain and sending up a mediator instead Moses was actually got plan God's plan and was a success success actually passed the test in the test was not should I trust God even though it doesn't make sense I think it'll kill me the test was will I second-guess God because I know his character and I know my character and she
 and she talked about Abraham negotiating with God about Sodom and Gomorrah and an opportunity for us to to enter into this relationship with God where we actually because we know his character will second-guess steps in their first Carmen is going to do her own full-scale research of the question would you get there and her research and so at this point she's relying on a dissertation and work done by scholar Michael kibbe who wrote hold dissertation about this issue and so I've been just want to just figured she was representing kibby's work but she was compelled by a sew-in Michael Cabeza it was a great cuz I didn't know about his work so I went and read his book and I learned that was awesome and this is why I love difficult studies cuz you
 keep learning so I keep this point especially his conclusion is that the invitation of Israel to come up the mountain was a test to show whether or not they have an accurate assessment of themselves yeah and what a cutie argues is that the gods real desire from the moment of The Burning Bush was the Israel have one mediator on their behalf Moses and so he sees Israel's declining the invitation to go up the mountain as passing the test because they steer got enough to have an accurate view of themselves that they will be consumed by the fire not transformed by it and that right now Moses is the only one who should go up on our behalf and he argues that that is what God wanted but this is Trick what it means is that God's invitation to come up the mountain
 was real but not it was a it was a it was a trick question yes and that's the twist that I think in that interpretation that would you got to sit together sit with and then this is where it leads to there's a kitty argues that this narrative in Nexus 19 is patterned after the story of Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah and you agree with that I agree with that and so he sees their Abraham passing the test by doing what God Said even though what God Said seem to contradict something out said earlier so God said I'm going to bless all the nations through your son and then he says give me back the life of your son on offering up Mariah and he sees Abraham's passing the test is being willing to do what God Said even though he knew it contradicted what God had promised earlier
 and God takes that willingness and Trust as passing the test and so he sees the Israel of Mount Sinai has an inversion story their unwillingness to do what God says it's been passing the test this is where I start to see it for me cracks in for me what is becomes not compelling so what was interesting is that for Carmen she was also integrating the work of a Hebrew Bible scholar J Richard Middleton and his book Abraham's silence The Binding of Isaac the suffering of jug and I'll talk back to God and His take is essentially it's a book essentially about the story of Abraham and Isaac and he argues that Abraham has failed the test
 that he's what he should have done this is not silently obey God's command to sacrifice his son but he should have done what he did for lot in Sodom Gomorrah which is TalkBack to and mediate an advocate for the innocent until he sees Abraham's failure to do that as a failure so I also read that book in the last few weeks cuz I really enjoyed it and I really enjoyed it and with fear and trepidation I'm not persuaded by his reading of the Abraham and Isaac story and I miss with fear and trepidation because I have learned more from J Richard Nelson about the image of God than any others, so I've been deeply informed by his work and it was the first time I've ever read any of us worked on my phone yes to some of that but I don't I'm not persuaded on that other part so this is tricky it's like
 a lot of it has to do for me this all comes down to narrative patterning you when Later stores in the Hebrew Bible or patterned after an earlier story and the author is counting on you seeing the parallels to inform how you're supposed to read the story at hand so when we're at Mount Sinai with Israel we're like multiple patterns deep cuz that store in Exodus is patterned after Abraham and Isaac is patterned after the decision of Adam and Eve at the tree in the way this fear the lord in the fiery appearances Yahweh fits into that store you say narrative pattern you mean yeah so a story in the Hebrew Bible that later in the collection will use the actual words and phrases and images of an earlier story with such a density
 that it's recalling that story is so that you called them both up in your mind to begin to compare and contrast them and usually it's to help the reader this meditation literature so you actually need that a mini story and eaten to understand the nuances of what's going on with Abraham and Isaac like the author assumes that you will bring the Eden story The Bear to solve some of the interpretive puzzles not story and then the Exodus story is design such a way as to recall both of them so that you use what you learned in those earlier stories to solve puzzles and this one and this is why I raised in the conversation with Carmen why I loved it cuz it's quite a method what did the biblical Arthur's expect readers to do when they noticed parallels what does it mean to read a later story and why do earlier parallels to me that's an interesting question I can tell you where I'm at now after processing talking to Carmen reading those two books you or you don't want
 that's it to say back when you're saying that there's two works is kibbeh who says he makes a case for how is real was meant to have a good assessment of themselves themselves and no they're not they're not ready to be in God's presence of the Lord and not going up the mountain according to KB is good and it passing the test and it makes a lot of sense but what you're saying is the real gravity of this argument needs to be around there to patterning and you brought that up with Carmen and then what she did was introduced another scholar who actually says that will allow you to say yes the narrative pattern is very clear with Abraham and Isaac Abraham was supposed to assess
 what God was asking and not do it like Israel at Mount Sinai to iron out that wrinkled but then you're saying that narrative it's connected me to Adam and Eve yes we're supposed to listen to the word of God and trust it and fear him and that was clearly not second-guess God that was very clearly like yeah do what I'm saying it's right don't need that tree correct yeah that's right so I think how the three stories fit together is that the Eden story God gives a command it's counterintuitive to Adam and Eve both trees look good and one of them leads to knowing good and bad which seems like a good why would God not want me to have that right now I need that I need that and so they make it they make the wrong decision they fail that test to fail it and it results in there being exiled from the garden by passing
 fiery Angelic creatures that guard the eating Mountain at the door and that Exile is both an act of God to Justice as a consequence but I thought I was also a mercy because where they got says access eternal life in this morally compromised state that would be for the bath so when we get to the Abraham and Isaac story up here at all just recall the conversations about the test we had from the test podcast series Abraham has wrong he and his wife have wronged and sexually abused and oppressed in Egyptian immigrant and her son
 in the process of trying to produce a sign of their own between the two of them and so after Abraham and Sarah have these two sons now what God does is because they didn't trust God to provide them life and Sons by his own creative Eaton blessing but they got he got in through the round schemes God takes away both of the sun's that he gave big pictures to understand good and bad on their own terms redefined good and bad I tried to produce a future for themselves in a seat future descendants for themselves by their own wisdom and ended up sexually abusing and oppressing and exiling an Egyptian in granting her son so what God does is he allows their sin to separate the Egyptian immigrant and her son so he takes away Abraham's actual first born son never sees him again and then he asked for the life of Isaac back and so in dialogue
 with Carmen and J Richard Middleton Middleton starting point is that God would never do that and that is not a thing that God would ever do ask for the life of the firstborn son and so he goes through through a long history of interpretation and I can't I also learned a lot about the history of interpretation of their eyes our story from Middleton that's a starting point and I'm not compelled by that you know the main reason being is this is that there are many times throughout the biblical story where God demands back the life of the firstborn son and does it really yeah he takes the lives of Judas Tucson's first born sons in Genesis 38 they are killed by Yahweh son kills errands first to Born son's he takes the life of all of the first born in Egypt including Israelites but he provides a substitute
 to pass over and so in other words that I think a lot of the problems that the Abraham and Isaac story poses for readers is it seems arbitrary like all the sudden got demanding life of the Sun but most readings that see that as a huge ethical problem I think are ignoring the narrative momentum up to that point that Abraham has the sun's by means of his own scheming and Sarah scheming and they have hurt and abused people on the way to get Sons know the difference though with Abraham is God doesn't ask
 dude at Achilles sons are Aaron Achilles Sons now that he told her yeah that's right or the pharaoh to kill his son wrecked yes he just he just an axe to Justice that's right yeah it's so there's something else that's very cringy about saying God and asked me to kill someone yeah he asked him to offer his innocent son as a going up offering which is one of the offerings in Leviticus one that that owns four sent it isn't Middleton saying is like that's what the pagan gods do that's not what Yahweh does that's right and the Abraham Story begins with and Yahweh tested Abraham so there is a question why why would God need to test Abraham in this specific way
 well what do I know about Abraham and his relationship to the Future survival is his family will man you ever hug he went rogue and they are willing to abused sexually abused and and send off to death to death and Egyptian immigrant and her son and I think what we're seeing in Genesis 22 is God bringing judgement on Abraham and Sarah's Den but then ultimately but what you see is that God God is going and does provide a substitute in other words the story of Abraham and Isaac is exploring the Paradox of God's judgment and his Covenant mercy and commitment to keep partnering with these humans keep failing you and so he both takes away and gives the life of Isaac in the same story cuz you know there just happens to be around there you know and that's not
 surprised God put it there cuz I was a whole point for the point was bringing Abraham to a place of surrender where he has to enact this the sacrifice of his future in the form of the Sun for his sins only to find that the moment he surrenders the wife of his son he receives it back with God's forgiveness and mercy and the fact that the ram is there means that this was the plan all along but the first sentence to me that cuz it was a test to test wasn't to say hey God I know your character and you wouldn't actually asked me that so I'm not going to do it correctly you're saying the test was I don't get it it feels counter to to what I think is right and good and makes sense yeah but I am going to do what you say
 and the I think the moral logic of it is I was willing to anything Abraham should have been in place where he was like I get what I deserve this I don't know if I don't know if that's where we're at. I don't know if we're to imagine him being there is silence maybe seems to indicate that but I think for the reader it's saying what Abraham did to Hagar and Ishmael was wrong this is this is Justice this is judgment on what he and Sarah did to Hagar and Ishmael and then look at how God wants to deal with this he does it in a way that's very merciful god actually in demanding that sacrifice already has and has a motion a plan which is very similar to God saying I demand the firstborn of all of pharaoh and Israel but look here is the way through it that's right this is why Jesus
 see the Deep narrative pattern connection between the story of Isaac the beloved Son and Passover and the gall of a Gospel of Jesus that's why they show us Jesus being called the son whom I love it's Jesus baptism exactly the phrase use of Isaac and then that's on one end of the gospels and then on the other end is Jesus offering his life for the sins of Israel during Passover so Jesus is portrayed as and Isaac Passover Lamb who is both the sun dying for the sins of his family but both also the substitute will step into the place for others to pass over is another narrative patterning about the death of the sun's but God providing substitute when we come forward to the Exodus tour here we are outside I'm all of that I think the narrator of Exodus
 assumes that you will bring all that to bear and so here is a group of people who's already been grumbling in the wilderness and beginning to Rebelle even before they make the Covenant and then their mediator Moses who has already been on this mountain and face the fire angel on it and so they come to the mountain and the ideal is that all of the people become God's covenant Partners the kingdom of priests and a holy nation and so God says take three days makes a hope all the people holding your purify yourselves change of clothes and come to the mountain and when the trumpet blasts on the third day everybody goes up on the mountain and this is about a chance to begin with one family recovering a people going into the Eden Eden president
 but to go up to the Eden presence means passing by the fiery angel on top of the mountain so I agree with Kimmy that I think the invitation is genuine but where I think the parallel is brought to bear is that for the Israelites who have been grumbling through the Wilderness Allegiance and Covenant Union with this God will mean a surrender of their lives as we know it symbolized by passing through that fire so it's it's at the fiery door and if they go through the fire the question is would it just be killed or would it be transformed and what happened to Moses's he goes through the fire is ball and he transformed so I think what where is to see is the offer is genuine
 and it's a to go through that fiery door would have changed them in some fundamental way maybe through that maybe it doesn't say but we'll never know cuz they didn't do it but the idea of Abraham going up to the mountain surrendering himself over to death to son over to death only to receive it back as a gift I think it's what the narrator exit wants to have us in mind and that the most loyal Covenant partners that God can work through these are people who are willing to lay down their lives unto death trusting that they will receive it back to become God's partners then that's what the people fail to do
 I think that's a narrative down point but whole narratives it has been portraying Moses as the mediator who could do it on their behalf and he does and then lo and behold he ends up laying down his life for their stands when they make the golden calf yeah I know that we've just had a very detailed conversation about a handful of texts I'm send me just a couple one I am so grateful that we had that conversation with Carmen I'm so grateful that she pointed me to Michael QB's work and Rachel Middleton's work and leaving just the way I'm putting the pieces together now is more nuanced and I think more compelling to me now because I had those conversations and so we end up with different views and I think that's okay what is it okay I think so like I don't know how it could be otherwise you could try to convince kibbe and Middleton towards your
 I totally believe in the summer I just gave of it I don't I don't think would necessarily compel somebody but it's compelling to me and if I were ever to take the months and months to write it out in academic article which I don't want to do cuz I'm going to go do other projects but that's how it works so I feel like I had some weak points and little details that I didn't talk about of my view point it out to me through this whole thing and I'm really grateful for that but I ended up with a stronger conviction about where I was already at but but it was precisely because of these dialogue Partners who hold a different view that's just the process of reading biblical texts and always has been and so what we're not disagreeing about I think these are fairly nuanced details about the story or you got maybe yours see it is really really big
 no at the end of the day
 it was really good for me in the end and I think people listening along to hear how to engage and respectful and curious and humble towards differing interpretations of Passage is helpful for me on
 I just have a lot of discomfort and it probably comes from my background which is like find the right answer and protect that answer and as we talked about the Bible as meditation literature and wisdom literature there is an invitation to come in and wrestle with it and so there's going to be more opportunity for people to be meditating and
 think on two different paths the end up not being consistent with each other but are both ways to meditate on passage and so at what level of comfort should I have with that and it what point should I
 draw a line in the sand so I made a big scene for years as we've been really sitting immersing ourselves in scripture is meditation literature I think what it means is that the goal of interpretation isn't just about reaching a Right View but it's also about the process by which you thinking develops and grows and deepens about a topic in scripture and that that process itself is a big part of the goal so the number of times that I have thought I understood something in scripture but then I read or talk with somebody who's thought about it differently or more than I have for their life experience has shake them to see it from a different perspective than I would ever have given mine social location like after you go through many many rounds of that
 it's made me realize that at any given moment my reading of scripture needs to be held with an open hand like the nature of human knowledge is that we are finite and we can only bring our current thinking and life experience to bear on any making sense of anything and so holding my view on XYZ in the back in this case stuff for the test of Mount Sinai like still not a hundred percent certain that I'm right
 but that's why I will always be open to hearing other points of view because there are certainly things in the story and I don't know what they are until I encountered the view of somebody else from that angle and maybe this is temperament where it's just I've had that experience so many times where it's not like what I think anything give me anything for me I feel like we're all constantly honing in on a more comprehensive understanding but it has to be held with an open hand and the techs are designed to lead you on exactly that kind of Developmental understanding you're saying it's a feature note about teaching on a bug which doesn't mean that you can't hold deep convictions about what scripture teaches
 but I do think it means that we need to hold our convictions with a degree of openness so that we are always ready to learn learn from other part of this is just to keep being my experience even as I outlined my own view I'm passionate about my view about it because I think it makes sense but I am also recognize I'm seeing things from one angle and there are things that I could be in that Carmen and Richard and I want to hear and benefit as much as I can in the process of them that of doing that and going back to scripture and stand meditating your sing the process itself is a good and any of forms people to both focus and learn to develop their thinking and to make sense of scripture in the make sense of life
 at the same time with an openness and humility to know that I am always certainly missing something and need the whole community of God's people to move towards greater understanding and part of that process will mean encountering people who have different views about certain parts of scripture and that that's not a bad thing you would also doesn't mean it's a free-for-all like you think we could you think we'd be hanging out with you know and you having to do we're talking with Jesus and Jesus what like what was the right and her earlier thank you for meditating on it
 yeah yeah my husband's brother probably some type of well first of all I have no idea but I like to imagine that it's probably some of us but yeah I mean I think the price on the bus okay we got some questions to get to okay that was good conversation move into some audience question in response to all be easy I'm sure there's such good questions you guys first of all you all of you listening you're amazing and the questions you sent in or so insightful
 I love it I I really I wish I could transcend my finite capacity in might have a cup of coffee with everybody listens to be so fun. I would say I would never get to actually be a father to my son's if I did that and have a job so we can do that so first question we don't respond to this is from Terry Evans in Georgia is from Woodstock Georgia and I have a question about the possible connection between the Exodus narrative and the story of Jacob's burial in Genesis 50 in his book The Exodus you almost passed over Rabbi David Foreman highlights the similarities and language between these two stories and he makes the case that the combined Israelite Egyptian procession that is described in Jacob's burial gives us a portrait of what the Exodus could have looked like if Moses is Pharaoh would not have been so defiant and under
 willing to acknowledge you always Authority do you guys see a connection between these two stories and if so I'd love to hear your thoughts on how Jacobs burial should inform our reading of the Exodus narrative thanks guys you see what I'm talking about you have such a great question yes and yes first think of all about scroll technology that the whole thing about Genesis 50 is Joseph going to pharaoh and making a request to leave the land to go up from the land and to bury his father and the wording of that request is the wording precisely of the repeated requests to go into the Wilderness and and Moses is constantly going before pharaoh to ask to leave the land but what the
 actually what God says if I'm going to do is to bring them up out of the land okay that's one thing so the a request to Farrow to leave the land with the goal of going up out of the land that's one parallel second is it sterile and Sarah the other is that Jacob makes his son's swear Covenant House that they will take him up to the land of Canaan to bury Genesis 50 ends with Joseph making his brothers swear, know that they will take his bones up out of the land and at the end of The Exodus narrative in Exodus 13 there's a little note that says and when the Israelites went off out of the land they took the bones of Justice with them so it does to Exodus is from the land of parallel but they're contrast or so it's a contrast between when you have a king of the Nations who blesses God's blessed one
 you get blessing and in the good Faro at the end of Genesis has constantly been blessing the blessed one and what you got was eating abundant send a time of famine and so the Pharaoh of The Exodus story with Moses is definitely a contrast character to us counterpart pharoah at the end of Genesis and so here it's an example it's really it's Genesis 12:3 I'll bless those who Bless you that's the fair at the end the chances I will bring curse on those who treat you was cursed and that's the Pharaohs ex's story so there's all kinds of parallels I haven't read David Foreman's books I'm glad to know about it but I had noticed that contrast portrait to and it's a cool way cuz it links together the two Scrolls Genesis and exodus are actually have low mirror contrasts are on to two different Skullgirls but you're supposed to think of them as connected us how the land was
 a good one with blessing pharaoh and there's a little detail in Genesis that Egyptian procession with Jacob was with pharaoh and his officers Horseman it reads like the the Pharaoh and his chariots in officers that chase after his film meet their dim that's cool to think about what the second Pharaoh could have the later Pharaoh could have done yeah by by meditating back on that another words when you see the pharaoh who challenges Moses what you wanted to say is now
 this could have gone one of two ways and it didn't have to go this way but because the hardness of heart it went the way of cursing so great observation I'm glad to know about David Foreman's work on that much are that out to piggyback on that little bit different
 the wording of the request is usually something around we just want to go in the wilderness in like 3 days 3 days and then come back before use again almost feels kind of like actually do we have many questions about that actually we have many questions about that but they weren't repeated as often as some of these other ones so I'll just say I think it is a trick to the pattern of counter deceptions
 acting skills lie with craftiness chapter one and he starts an acting all these plans to destroy in to kill and there's this pattern that work from the Genesis Scroll of when people make a plan to the route will result in death often the way to deal with a schemer is to a game kind of like deal with the the Hebrew midwives Hebrew midwives is that exactly what Moses is doing with Farrah and saying like a will discuss three days out is set on parallelism to the Hebrew midwives here and it's that don't do Bears come in to our listeners okay next question is from Jana is Indiana high command John this is Jana Harden I'm from Marion Indiana my question is about Exodus or verses 24 through 26 Moses is headed back to Egypt and it says the law
 I met him and was going to kill him but then his wife circumcised his son and saved his life I think I'm just confused why God would say he's going to kill Moses when he's just told him to go back and save his people thanks for all you do guys it is such a it's it's like you're cruising down the highway and then all sudden heck was that story all about so good okay first of all this was the most repeated like a lot for very good reason it's a boring story and the great example of a short super-dense riddle like story woven into a much bigger like narrative section in the Hebrew Bible and this happens often they're almost like a little Parable riddles
 that are so confusing it forces you to look to the surrounding narrative for greater understanding so this little story is All About narrative pattern leading back to the death of the death of the firstborn son theme going on through Genesis where is it or the loss of the Beloved son this is also an origin story of circumcision a little bit I just related to it so within the narrative itself there's an important design strategy in Exodus chapters 1 through 6 where Moses will go through as an individual what the whole nation is going to go through in chapter 6 through 15 so Moses is delivered out of the waters in chapter 1 Moses is delivered out from among a death of all of the Suns
 Moses goes up to Mount Sinai and see if he's got it the fiery Bush and is afraid and hides his face Moses goes out into the Wilderness and discovers a there where God provides for him so Moses all of a sudden chapters 1 through 4 go to the Moses is leaving out himself what is going to happen to all of the people so this way right here in Nexus 4 is reflecting on Moses's complex identity is the Hebrew or is he an Egyptian and he's both well he is technically a Hebrew in Hebrew but he was he becomes a lot up as an Egyptian yeah he becomes a son of pharaoh a sign of Pharaoh's daughter and it's given an Egyptian name and so
 when we come to the store in Exodus for what it raises the question is about circumcision and what's not clear actually is whether God was going to kill Moses or God was going to kill Moses's first born son are some of the language it could be either so that's interesting what's interesting is that when Moses his wife, she doesn't circumcised Moses what she circumcises is his first born son and then takes for skin touches it to Moses okay so here's what's happening Moses is going through his own his family is going through a prepass overpass over so just like he went through the waters and in the baby shark in the baby are just like he went through himself what all of Israel is going to go through here remember it it's an interesting feature of Passover that God says I'm going to strike all first born
 among humans and beasts in Egypt including Israelite right like it's just an indiscriminate flood of a plague through the land and so even Israelites need to be rescued through the blood of a Passover Lamb and what is real answer to do is to take the blood and they are to touch it to the door and he always looks at the blood as a sign of surrender and trust and doesn't allow death to enter that house so within the Exodus narrative this is Moses experiencing himself a surrender to the will and command of God but noticed that it's his wife who saved his life because he didn't do it so Moses here it's once again Moses his life has been saved by the two important women in his life now for the second time it was the first time with his mom
 oh his mom but I'm in the basket rescued him from Death you and now here is wife is rescuing him. So that's one piece why would God kill him at this right after he said you're my guy to rescue the people so I think here were all narrative patterning back to the Abraham story and noticed Genesis 16 17 back to Abraham and Hagar again the story so important God said I'm going to give you a son Abraham and Sarah don't trust the sexually abused and impregnate their chips and slave and then oppressor abuse her and God's judgement on Abraham is chapter 17 circumcision and it's both judgment and mercy so he tells Abraham sign of the Covenant now that you have wronged the Egyptian will be to cut off part of your genitals that you just used to oppress your slave such judgment but it also that cutting off
 the foreskin is precisely on the part of the body from which Abraham will make his contribution to Sarah's womb for the future of their family work and then what God says as is anyone who wants to be a part of this family of Abraham whether he's born into your house or whether he is an immigrant or slave purchased into your house they have to be circumcised and if they are not they will be cut off from their people so God take seriously this command that this is a family whose very existence and identity is both a mark of God's justice and mercy and so I think what we're seeing here is the Moses either wasn't himself circumcised or I think more likely his firstborn son wasn't circumcised which means he stood under the threat of Death By God's command from Genesis 17 and so Moses neglects to obey the command of God to mark his son as a part of the Covenant
 Emily and submit his wife gets it so I think that's a circumcision fits in before I get there but she's not even Hebrew and she's not even that exactly that's exactly the point so you have a non-israelite who gets the Covenant more than the Covenant mediator does and this is zipporah the daughter of Jethro and then on the other side of all of this necklace 18 we have Jethro a non Israelite who's going to be rescuing Moses from workaholism are delivering God's people and that they can somehow see the Covenant more clearly than got so come to people can anyway so that's the Nexus 4 is meant to make you like slam on the brakes and meditate on the all the stores around to give you insight into the puzzles you mention this circumcision site once before and I'm really glad we had a chance to go back to it cuz it's such a
 powerful image of the part of our body that generates Life part of the male body part of a male body that generates life which is part of blessing of humanity X have life abundance but then also is something that become such a tool of Oppression and forgot to mark that and say like a very physical way like this you're going to be my people out of all the things he's going to choose like that's the thing that's the thing that's that's that's a part of the male body that can either be used to generate life and Covenant blessing it can also be a tool of Oppression and abuse that's what Genesis 16 and 17 or meditate and so to be a part of the Messianic family of God's people
 holds a high degree of focus on what men do with their genitals and accountability before got what does mail come to Partners do their channels and Jesus clearly shared that passionate focus in The Sermon on the Mount which is why he's singled out men for example particularly in the command about lust and filter and yeah and so when we get to that story that's in her mind that this is important part of being a part of the Covenant people but I love this other Insight that you brought which is this was Moses's Passover moment as well and again the hyperlinks is the actual language at work blood and touching of the blood is precisely the same vocabulary used about the blood being touched of the door for Passover
 the next question is from Melissa in Ottawa Ottawa Canada I have a question about Exodus episode 5 is real test Yahweh in the section about the bitter water made sweet and Yahweh says if they listen to him that he will keep off of them all the diseases and illnesses that he put on Egypt and Timmy mentioned how you wanted to do some more work on how this could be a connection with later testing stories I'm actually wondering if it might be a connection back to Noah and the time after he gets off the arc are you focused a lot on decreation in the stories of Exodus and that at the ten plagues and how those were similar to the flood I'm wondering then if I'm Moses hear interceding for Israel and then there's a promise that he won't put those
 I think has an illness is on them is similar to know why when he gets off the boat making a sacrifice and then y'all way promising that he will never again flood the Earth thanks so much for all you do I love the Bible project I love the podcast keep up the good work so good even waste the storm yeah yeah Melissa you are spot on your spot on another words is a cycle through the waters the chaos Waters of the flood are set on the analogy too many later destructive things in later cycles of the biblical story one of them is just human violence striking each other and murder and death killing another set of vocabulary and images connected to the chaotic unleashing of death is the language of ill
 sickness and plagues and I'll just became more clear for me in studying the ten strikes the 10 decrease next because plague is I wanted to send her once I think the fifth one and then it's also interesting the language of the Passover like the the death of the firstborn is also striking language that makes you feel like it's a plague spread of a night my Airborne virus so and then you get into numbers Flags spreading among the people is the same as the word strike so when God withhold sore says I'm not going to send a flood or I'm not going to strike those are parallel moments and so yeah what Noah did oh that's right all the way back in the flood story When God says to Noah I will never again flood the Earth the parallel line is and I will never flood the Earth and strike all life as I've done so the flow
 is it self-described as a strike a strike and in the narrative about the flood waters it's described as we have this is just becoming more significant to me and I've been working on Joshua are the name for the vial of Warriors to call back people names in Genesis 6 to give a ream and then give over him by the Warriors and then when the flood waters are rising and rising in Genesis 7 it's the verb of that noun give or take of are the waves gavarni out the waters are described as Violet Warriors Conquering the land and so the spread of violence is described when you see Violet lawyers killing people that's all recalling the Genesis story of to give Orion in the violent wires and then the flood waters at the chaos image but sickness is another kind of way had it which is the spread of a contagion of
 that reduces human life back to chaos and death and so anyway there yes they are parallel to each other so I guess what I'm saying Alyssa is I think you're right. And yeah it's a great example of how later this of narrative patterning later biblical stories will use puzzling images but the more you meditate on them the more you see that you're working seems that I've done cycled from earlier story yeah so floodwaters and violet Warriors spreading death and sickness and plagues the localizers want us to see those things as more alike than they are different and meditate on that interesting that deserves a a long walk so does the next question from Jeremiah in Indiana
 hey John
 Jeremiah
 Indiana eye
 7 years old and I like the patterns that you are doing in your system in your pad cast so I would like it if you can figure out if there is a pattern between templates and Ten Commandments buddy you seven years old and what are you doing reading the Bible at 7
 I love it okay Jeremiah way to go man you are right there's a thing you know why you asked us like you want us to figure it out but I think you could figure it out and so the ten plagues and there's Ten Commandments and both of those begin with God speaking 10 times so Jeremiah let me ask you can you think of a story that begins earlier in the Bible that also features God speaking ten times the ten plagues Our God speaking and the order and stability of Egypt dissolves back into chaos and death The Ten Commandments ten words from God that are meant for Israel to create order and life in their community and so you can use the number 10 as a way of talking about complete statement of God
 will to either bring creation back into disorder or to reorder creation can you sync Jeremiah of a story about God's ten words that goes tricky about finding this story is tennis kind of hidden more than another number in the story the other number of the story feels more significant a good point up front but had a hidden in that story track yeah is 10 words however you will start seeing through Genesis and exodus and the rest of the Hebrew Bible the numbers 10 and 7 keep being repeated with in a similar kind of why you're onto a buddy I'm pretty sure you could figure it out if not I can hear your mom whispering cuz I think you asked her this question and she's she maybe encourage you to ask him first so I bet you and your mom could figure out another story where God speaks 10 times and that would help you figure out the connection between the ten plagues and the Ten Commandments great job buddy
 meditating on scripture I'm going to tell my son's about you and I think it might Inspire them to read and meditate on scripture a little bit more okay let's check out a question from a mason in Florida my name is Mason poem and I am from Tallahassee Florida I have often heard it said that the laws of the Torah were given to set Israel apart from the nation's however it is also clear that some of these laws mimic those of other ancient near Eastern societies as we continue to read the laws how should we discern between unique Israelite laws and adapted near East laws and does it even necessary that we do so thank you that has come up for us through the years we talked about last question Mason IMAX curious as we've explored this I'm over the years where is your first thought as a response to that John
 what I think this brings up is something that we're going to talk about more as we go to the Torah which is how do you find wisdom in the law because the law is meant to give us wisdom and we can't follow these ancient law codes as written cuz we're not into his relax but God's wisdom is there
 do that how much do we need to understand ancient near Eastern cultural context and one of our pillars is this ancient literature and you do need to understand it but I like how you posed a question like how distracted should we be by that or how focus should be beyond that because we're still learning I mean in real time we're learning a lot about through archaeology about ancient near East and stuff that you know people have been meditating on this year's before us didn't have access too that's right. You still got with them for the question and I think it brings to a point of yeah how much should we care about the engineers in context maybe this is two perspectives you know it's to use maybe my over over Warren analogy of like us a jam with multiple facets
 main facet to read and understand the Torah is to just read it cuz it is by its design is meditation literature it's on commentary on itself as you read through the way that happens if my narrative patterning and the biblical laws many of them are worded in ways that recall earlier stories or hyperlinks that help you evaluate understand what what you're reading and so in that sense you don't have to like go down to your local library and read like the ancient Assyrian like law codes are the laws of lipid is star Doris Nuna to understand you can read it now you need to read it the way it's designed to be read which is request a lot of effort but we've been remodeling that I hope like when we read through the Ten Commandment is what we tried to do is
 The Ten Commandments are woven into the narrative context that give you an insight into what they mean that's one level however I just my personal experience has been that when I do become familiar with the cultural context in the shared literary Heritage of Israel's neighbors and the Torah was written in the conventions and literary modes of their ancient culture that has given so much deeper but a different kind of deeper insight into why these texts are the way that they are so and just one not to nitpick Mason but just cuz it's a it's a word that for me signals that along paradigm shift for me when you say that these laws mimic those of other near Eastern societies I want to refine that so when I freaking for when I right now describe the
 system to you as I understand it in my mind I'm going to paint a Virgo picture of just pictures that I've seen before so I'm not mimicking National Geographic is actually because of my cultural environment it just is actually how I talk and describe the solar system because of my cultural environment so in a similar way when God reveals himself to His People Israel it's in the cultural form of its ancient near Eastern International Covenant treaty that's the literary form the laws of the Torah
 so what that means is the laws don't mimic those of other societies they are the laws within Israel God revealed that is real and they are worded precisely in the language and thought forms of the way that people Envision covenants in-laws so it's it's not mimicking it's sharing its God incarnating is purpose to them in the literary and cultural forms of people it's also true just the Torah was written in Hebrew Hebrew is an ancient Semitic language that was shared that has all kinds of parallels and shared linguistic Heritage with the moabites in the Canaanites and the Assyrians and so Hebrew doesn't mimic other Semitic languages it it just is Semitic language and so on the same way the law and Covenant in the Torah is an ancient near Eastern Covenant code and so that's what you would expect it to feel like there is a much
 valuable comparison and contrast to be done between Israel's lock code and out of his neighbors and the scholar to Scholars who have helped me the most here as one John Walton his book The Lost World of the Torah and then to Joshua Berman is booked all created equal how the Bible broke with ancient political thought in Berman's Express purpose is to cross comparison and contrast the other ancient near East Marcos and his is so rad so and we've actually convince them of this in our conversations about how to read the law with years so that's off the top my head response Mason to thank you for that important question one last question this question is from Brianna and I'm from Lancaster Pennsylvania get Bible project my question has to do with how you describe what the Garden of Eden and the Tabernacle as a series of concentric circles with stratification of how close to get to God my question is to what extent will also be this strata
 location of access and then you haven't seen the new Earth or will we all have equal access to God thank you so much again the question about the Garden of Eden had this really clear to your geography the middle of the garden the Garden Eden which the garden is just one part of and then the bigger land and then we talked about how the Tabernacle describe next to this is literally yeah yeah and those Mount Sinai is a vertical image of that the base the middle of the mountains or the central part and then the top and so her question is is is something is there something as a corollary a new creation interesting about in the Revelation at the end there's there's a New Jerusalem city that was that out of the sky do something to the heavens are the city as it begins in chapter 28
 and then all the sudden the heavens image by the city come down and the tree of life is in the city right. The Tree of Life in the city I've got the city but then there's open Gates around the city and Nations can come in that's exactly right and so there is seemingly something going on through the gate with the door the door to eat in the door Gates over the gates no I'm sorry I'm just it's plural but it's the idea it's the it's the Gateway for the doorway new creation is depicted as the skies as a city that comes down and lands on high mountain and when it does so it's surrounded by walls that are all you know about the crystals in the names of the 12 12 gates in the names of the tribes in the apostles it's all brought together but then when the city touches down its back
 Garden Inn from the center of that Garden is a river with a singular tree but somehow I'm both sides and then the center from which the issues is the throne and it's the Throne of the one who sits on it and the lamb lying together all of these images of the way that increasing hotspot that's right because the Ark of the Covenant is throne of God cuz he is enthroned above the chair center of the Tabernacle what's interesting about that as you would imagine New Creation being a complete Union to where everything now is the tree of life for everything now is the holy of holies but they're still does seem to be some differentiation between like the center of this new Heaven City then what it says is I saw a nose temple in the cities is revelation 21 or 22 for the temple is the Lord God and the lamp so they are the center
 they are the center they are the center and so once again I think we're dealing with literary style of apocalyptic literature densely symbolic and the goal of symbolism in apocalyptic does not to harmonize the metaphorical imagery into a literally coherent picture it's the meaning of the symbols being smashed together so I think because Sacred Space has been all about an enclosure through which you goes have a boundary but now it touches down and merges with her with open gates open Gates and Bess YouTube or coming in as huge and there's traffic is traffic in and out so the whole point is that the life of the nation's, presence of Heaven is no longer confined confined in up in the skies it's rather it's one with her and it's open Commerce so it's using
 those concentric circles which were used to understand and I'll make another dew point which is we're open for all creation open for business is productive and but also but then it also contrast that with outside the city and so here were to thinking of the valley of hinnom which is an actual Valley surrounding the southern flank of Jerusalem still today but even more so in the second temple period and the first temple. You know and that's where nothing to clean will enter into it nor will anybody else only those were written a so it's this idea which could then make speculations and how can they inhabit the purified New Creation but I think the point is that statement is just to say that death in Imperial tea has been removed has been purified so that the
 new creation is just Heaven and Earth One in perfect union with Commerce in traffic open open for business Heavens open Heaven and Earth are open for business I love that so I think the point of the open Gates and of the Union of what is high and where love is that is undoing the boundaries I see the boundaries are still there but we've seen as they become undone I mean the boundaries are still there in the sense of that the shape of them are there but the gates are up yeah I think the reason why were using the language of Gates or city walls still is cuz if you didn't use those it would be very difficult to access the image from earlier in the Hebrew Bible cuz the city is a walled enclosure so to say that you have a city but it has no walls since like well that's not a sit at your the way you talk about a city but that's completely open with eternally open
 or you can talk about the Centre is the throne but there is no Temple and temples are all about access right tears of access I see there's a throne and its life is going out yeah so there's a couple Gates going in the gate of the temple which the access gate that's gone that's gone and then the walls and those gates gates are gone they're open and so it signals that restricted access through the gates here now think about it another way to think about it is in Hebrews for example where the Heavenly Temple plays such a key role in the story the author of the pastor riding to the Hebrews wherever they left says the first of all access to that Heavenly Temple even though it hasn't been apocalypse here on Earth Reveal Your on Earth it's accessible now when he says we can
 boldness enter into the throne room what do you mean that's that's repair worship we can enter in to the Heavenly presents individual and communal way at the end of the letter he says right now you and I are poor part of the Assembly of the firstborn can Ascend the Heavenly Mountain we have access to it now so not only are there no tears of access the new creation there are no tears of access now we can boldly answer in an experience I think through elevated Consciousness through prayer and worship in the symbols of liturgy enter into heaven on Earth even those were sitting right here which is where John is seeing all of this is he sitting on an island experiencing unrestricted access to the Heavenly realm as he sits on a tile at the gates are open right now the gates are open for those who want to go in bowling
 hey along with the number of great submissions for the quman are episode there were some questions about our earlier conversation about the test of Mana in the book of Exodus a number of questions about some confusion around the story around Mana Israel was given Sky bread and they were asked to collect it and and we made a mistake on whether or not they should collect mana on the seventh day said that the manager was out there on the seventh day and the test was not going to get it and I just forgot the detail that it says in the story that the man I was not there on the seventh day of the test was to trust that what you gathered on the sixth day would also be left over for the seventh day and some people do go out on the 7th day and they don't find anything anyway it's not like we're shattering but we felt like it was good to pay attention to how the story actually works okay thank you every
 one of the water was a good question span great questions will continue making our way through the scroll Leviticus and we'll stop again and listen some questions yeah thank you so much for for sending a man yeah we love hearing from you and so awesome to hear about your insights and questions keep on keeping on high did this tonight and has a doctor, this is Dustin Bledsoe and I am from Las Vegas Nevada I first heard about Bible project almost 2 years ago while driving to Phoenix on Military orders I wanted to listen to the Bible on Spotify and Bible project popped up and I was so excited to see someone talking about Nephilim and I've been listening ever since you stuff on Bible project where in 2025 for sale City and how many Bible different song I thought Yelp
