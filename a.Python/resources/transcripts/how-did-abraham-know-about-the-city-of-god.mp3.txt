hi John hello so we're doing we are right now happening is about to happen here we go and actually we were going to do two episodes of coon ours for the symbol for the city series yes this episode is a kinara listener questions we want to go see your and respond and we're going to do two rounds cuz one is a long series longer-than-average but also like so many good questions were already up to weigh over a hundred bike hundred and thirty so far and we're only halfway through releasing Series so and they're awesome like it's so fun to read your questions and we're excited to interact with some of them and then we'll do another round kind of near the end of the series to keep sending them in we love hearing your questions
 and even if we don't get to the question we get to look at it and we get to know what you're thinking about and that's really helpful for yeah yeah absolutely so if we don't get to it it's still rad to hear from you. Thank you for sending in your questions clearly y'all listening to the podcast are motivated cuz we're getting more and more than we ever have before even though you all know that we only ever talked about a handful cuz it also good with that so thank you it's a really fun to have my finger on the pulse of what our conversations are sparking in your minds and hearts it's really really wonderful as always my call yet I work through all the questions I tried to pick the ones that are most repeated and then also questions that I think just open up cool conversation topics that are just the good stuff so with all that said till we go for it let's get it let's do it
 question number one from Brandon in Georgia this is Brandon from Powder Springs Georgia longtime listener first-time questioner one of my favorite passages in this team is from Hebrews 11 where Abraham is described as looking for a city which has foundations who is designer and Builder is God I hope the same could be said about me someday but how did Abraham know that is city was the ideal it wasn't like he could pull out his Bible app and read the end of the story he was semi-automatic he had a front-row seat to all the evils of Sodom so what were the clues that he was seeing that told him as City would be his final destination love to hear your insides keep up the great work thank you great question I thought what we could do is just read the paragraph about Abraham from Hebrews chapter 11 starts Interstate goes through verse 12
 and actually goes on much longer it's a long section about Abraham do you want to read it and I'll just scroll new revised Standard Version by faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for place that he was to receive as an inheritance and he set out not knowing where he was going by faith he stayed for a long time in the land that had been promised as in a foreign land living in tents as if Isaac and Jacob who were errors with him of the same promise the 6th grader that you know the story of Abraham and his son oh yeah but he's out in the land of God promised to him but he was from right the Chaldeans which is another ancient tribal name for what became bad when I left the city and now he just nomadic in this land that God said one day you'll inherit this that's right I'll call the author of Hebrews
 text me the pastor riding to a son named Church community and you really highlights the journey living in the wilderness living in tents but the point is in temporary migrating patterns not in a permanent location now that's a theme that the pastor in Hebrews has already developed back in chapter three and four to stay the followers of Jesus are also like the Wilderness generation that came out of Egypt trusting God in the wilderness but don't be like the rebels in the wilderness be like those my face and Abraham's faith is also highlighted here and if he's hoping for something else than just being nomadic intense he's anticipating something yeah you know I'm going to bless you make you fruit fall into a nation by melding together multiple of God's promises in the Abraham stories kings are going to come from your line
 all nations are going to be blessed through your seed or your family but no mention of a city just of a land but of like permanent possession and settling in that land and giving birth to a royal family that will bless the nation's so city is all but said in God's words because there's Kings and Kings adamant that's right but The Narrative of Abraham just keeps that tension that he himself is not investing or connected to any permanent cities in the land is not building it in temporary shelters migrating round something permanent promised and that's what the pastor is picking up on here I'll let you yes a Rehan continues Abraham looked forward to the city that has foundations who's architect and Builder is God
 and that's the key verse yep that's what Brandon quote from by faith Abraham received power of procreation even though he was too old and Sarah herself was Barren because he considered God considered Abraham faithful considered him faithful who this is why I didn't take out the pronouns cuz I was confused because he Abraham considered God Faithful eye in it who had promised therefore from one person and this one is as good as dead that's Abraham Hicks to the old he's that old from that one person was as good as dead descendants were born
 as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore that's where the pastor goes from here is he has a little aside and he says listen to see the pattern cuz he also talked about Noah before this is that the pattern is people trusting God's Promise by face even though they only saw we're barely tasted the Fulfillment of that promise and he makes it a parallel here between the audience and Abraham by saying people who speak in this way make it clear that they're looking for a Homeland so once again
 contrasting the temporary shifting nature of Life out you know in the land of the Wilderness contrasted with what's permanent as it is they desire a better country that is a Heavenly one sky country Abraham's trust in a future cities Builders God becomes a parallel to the pastor's audience is reading the letter and their desire for a Heavenly land so the the City built by God and the Heavenly land become parallel images with each other and that's significant to the city becomes away just to think about a new type of civilization or new type of what the pastor is doing is he is reading the Abraham story as a coherent whole both in light of Adam and Eve story
 and about the expulsion from The Paradise Garden out into the Wilderness and then that's where Abraham mostly cruises around is in the wilderness but God keeps meeting them in these low Eden moment out there in the wilderness that's one thing but then the pastor is also reading Abraham story in light of all the stories and design patterns to follow especially the David story so the word face is a key theme in the Abraham story and if you just do a concordance search on the word face one of the other set of stories in Genesis three kings which is kind of the main big narrative if the Hebrew Bible the word faith just off-the-charts in the David story and so the stories about when David is anointed king privately but persecuted by saw does all the stories about him running around fleeing from Saw dwelling in the wilderness and going from temporary place to place and all
 the story of David in the wilderness are packed with hyperlinks back to the Abraham story in similar way so the biblical authors want to set David on analogy to Abraham the Wilderness wandering are matched with each other so that the promise of it Eternal Eden promised land that God gave to Abraham become set on analogy to the promise that is partially realized of David setting up Jerusalem as a heaven on Earth spot to so what the pastor is doing is he's reading the Abraham store in light of the David story and then he's imagined this is like Sanctified imagination he's imagining Abraham with the mindset of David like looking forward to the city who is architect and Builder is God in this is very common in the second temple. Where
 Bible nerds who produced all the wonderful literature you know the Christians called the Apocrypha and pseudepigrapha but also the Dead Sea Scrolls have a lot of biblical commentary and they regularly do this they take interpretations based on seeing the design patterns of the whole story and then they will
 I sort of like imagine like I love how you said this Brandon it's like did he pull out a Bible app and read to the end of the story but that's how second temple Jewish authors red and spot I talked about it so in a way yes historical Abraham didn't know how the story ended but the biblical Abraham once you read the Hebrew Bible through and then you go back and reread it again and you see like Abraham story has been designed with an eye toward statehood story then in a way that conclusion that the pastor drops and Hebrews perfectly straightforward because all of these characters once you've been exiled from Eden are looking for some more permanent dwelling who's Creator and Builders God so does that make any sense for like we're imagining Abraham as if he's read the whole story but that was a typical way the second temple Jewish authors did biblical interpretation it sounds like you're saying both things
 if you just try to isolate Abraham in the story what he would have known he could have anticipated a city because God said I'm going to make you a great nation well you just fast forward in your imagination and you got all these kids and you've got in this going to be a king one day and your be great nation have a few cities but what's even more important is to think about what do koala bears are doing in there tying Abraham story and being the Wilderness and hoping for City to David story being the Wilderness and then going to build a city and then the pastor seems to be taking all this and he's talking to first century Jesus followers describing them like they are Abraham in the wilderness living in temporary shelters in Flint looking for a Heavenly land so just like the pastor wants the Surly
 followers of Jesus to imagine themselves as Abraham the pastor also wants us to imagine Abraham as being like a dated having the mindset of David yeah so thanks Brandon thank you Brandon great question let's move on to you got a question here from Isaac yeah and Hawaii from Hawaii why I noticed the Hebrew word for City ear and the Hebrew word describing Adam and Eve's boastful nakedness I don't have the same Hebrew letters in the same order us an m and I don't give a clear Association and I was supposed to draw comparison between Adam and Eve simple nakedness was they covered with leaves and Kane's naked chain which he covered the walls Hebrew this is wonderful so I feel like in this series I've been learning a lot about how ancient authors around
 ancient Israel and the ancient Israelites scribes the way that word play puns and matching words with similar letters of meaningful thanks but this was a really key tool in the hands of the biblical authors and so in this series really are we did a whole episode on that you know I'm kind of in a deeper dive then I think we've done ever done in Denver so just real quick here what we talked about is that when in the Eden story When God says it's not good for the human to be alone so God causes a sleep the following him and he takes one of the sides and the Lord is Genesis 2 verse 22 Yahweh Elohim built into a woman the side which he had taken from the man and all of this is described as God providing what he calls in a Caesar
 so the building of the azer will both the word build is the same word used for what Cain builds when he build the city and then the word hazer or delivering a liar help the god provides matches what king built which is an ear which is three letters two of them are the same as the word a three-letter three-letter is Zion brush Erie must be two letters are three letter so I am Yoda rash and the middle letter is dying and yellow dye in both of those words have the identical shape at the top is just missing a vertical line okay that's a little look nearly identical and they look very similar animes are the words that I highlighted and then also the fact that the one that God provided as the Acer the delivering a lie and zup becoming the target of the snakes deception realizing that they're naked
 and then God covers them with skins and the word for skin or is another got the same two letters the beginning and end with what's a different letter in the middle so it's I involve Rush with the Bob looks almost identical to the Zion and the top of the valve is identical to the top of the Odin year City what is these three words either you're in or have the same first and last letters different middle letters but the middle letters all look almost the same and that's meaningful point is this that's not random it's meaningful so what you're pointing out Isaac is there is actually more there's another set of words that link into this word play and that's true I just didn't want to overload overload that are already hard to follow you so the word for naked is the word Autumn and it's spelled with 3 letters the same three letters as the word skin
 the mixed around so the word for skin is or I am a fresh this word for naked Autumn is Ian rash valve and then a man on the end so it's the same three letters with additional letter on the end he was with great the last sentence of the Eden story after the building of the woman is in the man and his wife were Autumn naked and they were not to shame explain now the serpent was more so different root word but it's spelled with the same exact letters for Hebrew letters as the word naked butt was just a different vowel instead of autumn naked room crap to your smooth so all of these connect the one who is Autumn shrewd targets the Autumn couple naked and specifically the weather
 the one that God provided us with delivering a line to see is her so that their eyes are open and they realize they're naked Autumn and the bank God provides skin or anything all those words are like they're like just jumbled together they would kind of all feel the same but are spelled with the same letters that are spelled the same but the same course out of letters like a Doctor Seuss kind of think it would feel like so much repetition and the words in like rhyming words and words that sound alike and yeah so what God built that is are delivering a lie to provide for the loneliness of the human is set on an allergy to what humans try to provide to cover over their nakedness and the words for nakedness in the words for the Acer that got bills to provide the words yep to moments
 where a character is in need and God provides it's a good thing but when the humans provide for themselves so the first time is one man's alone and God Cuts demanded by restroom and then the second time they are how did you put it they need help or they need well there's no problem here they're naked and they're not ashamed there's no problem that's a sign of the goodness of the safety and vulnerability of the relationship but then the crafty serpent comes to take advantage of that. Yeah that's right and then he targets the woman who was the one provided to be that delivering a line and he tricks her so that she ends up doing an action that results and then realizing that they are naked but now it's they perceive it as a problem and then they attempt to solve their own problems by covering themselves with leaves
 and then what God does is he actually provides for the problem by covering them with or which is spelled with 3 letters that are identical looking in our or identical to the word is there help okay so we're clear to me was the thing that you were bringing this up in one Force episodes of the series showing that look now when we go and see Kane building in the air like we've got a pattern of when there's a problem when humans are vulnerable God wants to be the solution and be the protection but there's a choice to go try to do it your own way or be deceived by like a snake or Munster and do it in the wrong way and so there's a big payoff there with all these rhymes of the year in the order and the next level of insight that Isaac's
 Tina said to is about covering over vulnerability the being naked is an image of being vulnerable before another and in Eden it's great cuz there's you're safe but once humans take it upon themselves to know what is good and bad by their own wisdom that creates the possibility for things to go sideways now my vulnerability before another human specialist are very different for me becomes a liability NADA acetone opportunity and so that's become the break the nakedness it was a sign of the bond now becomes a liability and a source of division so what pain is doing when he builds an ear because now he is vulnerable and he's afraid that someone other than him might Define is good to kill him the building of his ear reminds you of the whole network of weird place from the previous
 so in a way it's totally I would have had to do Isaac is long over complicated way of affirming your intuition what the humans covered that used to covers their Autumn nakedness because of what happened with the izor that God built now here can is vulnerable and he's alone he's naked in a way yeah yeah he's socially naked so he is vulnerable and goes to the land of wandering not the Land of Nod he knows his wife that is it becomes make it with her and like produces a son with her and then he builds an ear to cover his nakedness that's right so he is doing for himself with the theater what God did for Humanity by providing an Acer it also he did for himself by building a near what Adam & Eve try to do to their nakedness when they put on order
 what they put on the leaves the leaves a cover over there that God gave them and Only God gave them in order to the skin that's right so God provides Two Times by providing an Acer and providing the or skin and so does kind of make you meditate like what would have God built for Kane yeah but what he wanted to provide was a sign a sign a sign. It has another set of kind of different graphic similarities to the word skins when we build cities we build to protect ourselves from our vulnerability and our conversations of a snail shell yeah totally to protect ourselves so what the Quarry images of human vulnerability exposed which place has the human in a moment of decision
 whether they'll trust God or provide for themselves by their own wisdom and change the picture that's doing the ladder and it's the word Place back to the Eden story that set in building the city on analogy to Adam and Eve trying to cover for themselves but it adequately so so what God provides is a order which is skin but it's also looks identical to the word City so I'm not sure that maybe thing clear that was a lot of Hebrew words but it is a continuation and deepening of the conversation we had about two people replaced and in fact speaking of Hebrew word Place had a great question about the practice of Hebrew word plays in biblical Literature list from Oxford in the UK
 I'd always understood the Genesis grow as growing out to an existing oral tradition which was written down later
 what do the visual plays on Words which could only exist in Renton taxed mean for when we understand these stories to a first formed thanks yeah this is more of a not really a City question but how the Bible came into a second question yeah I have a similar but separate question from our last concert in the other question which is when you read or hear all these word-plays does it sound childish in Hebrew or you know like a lot of weird plays in English will start to feel like kids material or pun and then just kind of like how does how does it feel when he know it much more has the word of hearing poet spoken word artist hip hop artist rappers more like that yo super clever in other words the word plays are loaded with meaning and they linked together ideas and Powerful comparisons so that's why the
 fortunate that our one of our English words for this phenomenon is wordplay you really should be called word serious
 cuz you're doing seriously weird work philosophical intellectual theological Sinking by means of linking together these for her play as work well for any lizards question is does this translate when it's Orel write a couple thoughts certainly many many parts of the biblical literature have their origins in oral histories for sure and the patriarchal store is through the Genesis story is you know are some of the best candidates for that however you know the way biblical literature came into existence wasn't like the processes for how we think of how literature gets produced today so this is traditional family ritual literature that was preserved as identity forming type of text and these texts were treasured and preserved through scribes and
 over the course of many many dozens and dozens of generations through centuries so you can imagine oral histories get written but then the stories of the Patriarchs individually get woven together at some stage whether that happened at the oral stage were written stage we don't know just different scholarly serious about that but then those stories get woven together with even bigger chunks like the Joseph story and then combined with the Exodus story which would have had its own kind of prehistory so think of it like quilt pieces originally eat Sorel individually eat got committed to writing I put into fabric but then they begin to be joined together and that joining together process involved even more shaping of the individual quilt piece by shaping you mean that's when some of the workplace could have been certainly inserted correct in other words the moment that something was committed to writing it didn't just stay in pristine on altered form
 I think that is the Assumption the literature kept being shaped by each generation cuz he's generation of these you know inspired by God Spirit prophetic Bible nerds is there studying the family history up to that point and they are Discerning within it the will of God God's purpose for themselves and Discerning God's will through studying their history but then as their history kept developing new material would get brought into the collection and then design patterns I think would play it hyperlinks would get the literary craftsmanship dialed up a threat which is why Genesis 1 through 11 even though it comes at the beginning it's designed by people with an eye towards introducing all the keywords that you're going to meet in the rest of the Hebrew Bible yeah yeah because I think the Assumption for many people that I know from me and bring up the Bible that some
 one experience the story told it to the next person and then that exact story got passed along in those exact words I've ever met someone wrote it and then that writing down has been Faithfully transcribed over and over and over until what we have today and what you're saying is that's not what happened and I think that makes some people itchy because you're like well then people are just making this stuff up or changing or however they want like then how can we trust it and we talked about this before which is just the god spirit is working through this hole was about the meaning of these stories and how they communicate the wheel in the word of God
 what is the wheel in the word of God for future Generations through the Abraham story and so they Abraham stories were crafted with an eye towards what the stories before it and this fall the story that come after so what they're being faithful to is the word of God speaking to God's people through the store it and they shape the stories accordingly and continually as the literature continue to grow so they are being faithful but being faithful to God's word meant adapting and shaping the texts continually to communicate that message and again just to be clear I'm not just claiming all of this this process of adaptation is you can see it with in the Hebrew Bible itself so the book of Chronicles
 in Hebrew Bible is a retelling of Genesis through 2nd Kings and it's highly adaptive it's the story of Genesis to Kings told from the eyes of somebody who's been back in Jerusalem after Babylonian exile for a couple centuries and they reshaped hundreds of details in light of reading the whole heap of hiva it's a version of Genesis to Kings by Uber Uber Bible married so you can watch that author making me that up tations in his own new version of the story and that's the same process that was happening in the making of Genesis Kings 3 Kings themselves reference couple resources so one terms of making of the Bible I've reference call Wagner's work many times over the years the journey from text translation so he covers literally making of the Bible from oral history all the way up to how do we get our modern translations there's a new or work in English translation by to German
 Scholars who are at the Forefront of a lot of these conversations Hebrew Bible scholar Conrad smede and then a New Testaments call Jen Schroeder this is called the making of the Bible when it comes to word play because the word play both is something you here and something you see both are factors that going on I've learned a ton in the last few years from to Hebrew Bible scholars when is Scott in the wagon and a book called word play in ancient near Eastern text cool though is he Compares how the same literary techniques happened in Egyptian literature and Babylonian literature Assyrian literature and the Hebrew Bible so it's actually really important work cuz it's not just biblical authors to do this biblical Arthur's learn these techniques from the Traditions you know that Israel was apart of also there's the Israeli scholar Isaac collini
 I'm at the book called metathesis wordplay as literary and exegetical device and he shows what like what I'm showing here in the Eden story is what is the whole books about but he shows it all over the Hebrew Bible word blazing like this when you just listen to him also right maybe just not as much as when you see him it depends some of them seem like they depend on graphic similarity looking for the connection and so likely those are literally features that came into existence once the texts were being in a written form and being shape to stay with her type of any of the design patterns and word-plays and what do you call hyperlinks could have all been part of the oral tradition totally yes and remember that in a Biblical manuscripts and Scrolls were extremely expensive and rare so most Israelites Xperia
 the Bible by hearing it and then memorizing it you and so the oral performance of these texts would have been a crucial way that you would have learned what the meaning of the story is cuz the oil perform you know just like in spoken word or poetry or music you know you can emphasize you can use the tone of your voice to highlight certain things but we don't have any record of of those big ten record those be cool the cool so I have a whole but it's an important feature and I use awareness of word-plays puns and the technical word paronomasia is actually a really important to all and difficult application that I wasn't even in about College West Seminary it was graduate school in Department of Hebrew Bible at University of Wisconsin before I first came across this to hold it but it's pervasive throughout the Bible and a really important thing to know about okay
 let's keep moving We can question from Jenna in Virginia this is Jana from Chesapeake Virginia your discussion of the Tower of Babel in the people's attempt to build a tower that would reach into heaven reminded me of a later story in Genesis 28 the people in Genesis 10 we're trying to build a gateway to God out of bricks and mortar but Jacob slept with his head on a stone and saw a ladder with it stop reaching to heaven and angels ascending and descending on it he said this is the Gate of Heaven do you see a connection between these two stories and what might be the significance of Beth El in light of that thanks for all that you do this is a moment Jenna this is a gold star Chesapeake Virginia you know how you get one in the mail or something anyway so excellent excellent and I think the reason why this is key is because it's blinking the tower Babel story in some way
 to the story the origin story of the Israelites city names that sound so real quick just in Genesis 11 what the people say is Genesis 11 verse four let us build ourselves a city so same thing contained us build a city and a tower whose top hits the Hebrew word Roche is the word head its head is in the skies and let's make a name for ourselves and babble means gate the gates of the Gods of the car Bob Hill date of the Gods so they want to build gate of the Gods and that gate is guarded be high he totally yeah it's a tower and Sky exactly right whose head is in the skies and God's got hers that project so I missed an interesting that when Jacob is fleeing for his life and his brother who just Swindle the couple times and you know he comes to this you like hanging out in the wilderness was the first
 you totally yeah it's we have this dream where it kind of like can we got a damn it is really gracious and his wife I'm going to look out for you so God Appears to Jacob and he just the famous you know or a ladder more like a Stairway and in Genesis 28 + 12 that ramp or stairway was set on the land but its head is in the skies of the same identical phrase and it's the only two times makeup is seeing the reality of which Babel was like a caricature parody for human made a temp tomorrow so that's interesting and then you know God says it's listening like I'm with you I'm going to make you and your family having a nurse spot on a man to bring you back to this land and do everything I promised
 WR cool thank you God and Jacobs response to this is really curious he wakes up and rosaldo drink in this place and I didn't know it stop itself is important that heaven can touch her as the Divine eating presents can occupy a space on Earth and even recognize human would never know it if they don't have the eyes to see it that's interesting but then he goes on he says wow this place is awesome for today English means like cool
 or that's a metaphor to cool something being cold mean that it's all the words for be no better for the awesome means terrifying fearful or culture than made that awesome like Brad and radical radical I use that word a lot but that means like rooted connected to the source anyway who knows how fearful is this place this is none other than and then he says Bait House of L this is the Gate of the sky's so that he uses the word date here which in Acadian the Semitic language that the Babylonians with its the word Bob Bob o links I just seen the thing the reality to which Tower Babel West parody but I'm going to call Bethel
 yep the place where this division how do you like cool that's cool but they have more more response he wakes up he sets the stone that he put his head on as a pillar he anointed as the first oil in the in the Bible about that he calls it Bethel then he makes a vow to God and he says if God will be with me if God will be with you like that just said I'm going to be with you literally just said no and I am with you
 and then Jacobs responses you know if God will be with me if he will keep me on this journey that I take and give me food to eat and garments to wear and look what God said is I am with you and I will keep you wherever you go I won't leave you or forsake you but he's liking his food and clothing and what did he deceive his brother and father with a meal and fake clothes so all of a sudden we lack is this crafty and he said if I return to my father's house in safety will be my God that's not like a Super Rad like
 moment yeah and he says this this rock that I have set up as a pillar this will be the house of God and everything you give me I'll give you a chance. Ask you to build a house like what you know it seems like maybe he's doing this out of honorable intentions but this whole thing is just fishy and especially the all of the if if if if then can I ask you don't know Wilderness he's out in the field got a field but he's nearest city because there's a line there that was skipped that's right cuz obviously the name of the city and nearby cities than almond there's some little walled enclosure nearby here by but he doesn't go in just like Abraham and the name of that city is lose which means almond tree by tree God will provide me food and clothing.
 but what is interesting is this is the foundation story of Bethel which will become a later Israelites city the city is mentioned by 70 times a bunch is in the Jacob story cuz he goes back there on his way back into the land after leaving it as mentioned a bunch in the Book of Joshua but then after that and summon in the Book of Judges but then particularly it's in the story after Solomon for Solomon's son's Miss manages a whole bunch of internal politics in the tribes a bunch of the tribes the seed of Israel split into two kingdoms the North and the South the guy named jeroboam takes over the northern kingdom and he's really concerned the Israelites in his tragic and I want to keep going down to Jerusalem cuz the temples their Solomon to build the fence in the building
 cuz I know lady I'm going to build to Temples up here and his really great idea is to build two golden calves and to put one in each of the temples in each of these two cities and lo and behold one of the city's is that sound so now there's a golden calf and Beth El in well that's a whole Rabbit Hole similarly to why'd you know Aaron and the people thought it was a good idea to make a golden calf being dumb but yeah this is the whole thing is this is like the golden calf double and it's happening at Bethel so finally the house of God is being built in Bethel all right and it's idolatrous from yeah it's a problem and what we're told actually is this thing became a sin for the people who went to worship there and then in the next chapter this Temple
 city of Bethel is the focus of the story in 1st Kings 13 where God says hey this is serious I just sent a prophet to announce the destruction of the temple and ultimately have the city so the foundation story is kind of fishy in the Jacob story and it leaves you wondering why was that cool what do I supposed to think about that and then much later in the story that City but Jacob found it in this moment becomes an idolatrous Tryon City that ultimately gets wiped out when the Assyrians comes down yeah so once again it's it's how the biblical out there just don't come out and say what they think all the time they put a characters actions in front of you and then let you watch the long-term consequences and then you have to draw the conclusion so this story of Jacob is doing so much just run the theme of City cuz he's in the wilderness running from his brother like mine
 yeah but then he has a vision well in that moment sorry saw said he was going to murder his brother okay so so that I could be like the fleeing able who gets away with his life and he's got the blessing but Jacob's been to like sneaking a guy whose blood been overcome with from the womb he was snatching at the Helix brother like the same so that way it's kind of like it and he's like the instigators like a problem so yeah he's both and then God reaches out and said I'm going to provide for you going to provide for you and then he shows him a vision of like the Heavenly Temple yeah that remind you of what humans tried to create it with the Tower of Babel which is the centerpiece of a city which is like our city can connect to the Divine the Gate of the heaven so what he sees is what God wants to do
 what God wants to build says if God Appears in the Splendor of the Heavenly City up in the clouds he's like I'm going to do something I'm going to pour down to be with you trust me put on the blessings of the city down on you but I'm going to beat that he just as I am with you I am with you and Jacob is like well are you really you know maybe how about this how about I'll write up the terms and if you will be with me and give me everything I need then when you bring me back here I'll make the spot in special Temple and in a kickback we've given to me and so then you get this new kind of City motif of Bethel a city that Jacob promises which I'm one sent you like okay cool he's like honoring that this is the spot where he saw heaven and earth together he saw the Divine City like the cornerstones of Vice City like come down and or
 head of City yeah that's right come down and he was under that but then you brought up like I didn't really ask him to do that and it comes after this like fishy speech of like all these terms and then when we get to the city later in Kings at the mess and a Dollar Tree has a problem and so it's just like the theme Here seems to be that we like God wants to give us something and build something and we're constantly going actually we got a better idea we'll build the thing will do it right that's essentially it so when David's like I'll build you a city we should be like okay so exactly after David captured Jerusalem 2nd Samuel 5 and then he makes it a place of abundance and blessing for the people 2nd Samuel 6
 got a to them right in the dream excuse me what David says is like men Gods lives in a tent it's been wandering around he deserves a permanent dwelling and what God says to David is so I can know I'm good I'm good have I ever asked for that sorry I said he said I build a city. Build your house yeah and so was the David is he want to build me a house that is a temple in the city but I'm going to build you a house that is a dynasty so even in that story the building of Jerusalem as the temple city is not something God wants and I said it's important I think hyperlink back here to make up stories or Jacobs like I'm going to build you a thing filled the house of God are yea and God's time with you and I'm going to build you a think the stories like really checking our Ambitions of like we want to build the thing we want to build a house of God yeah we want to build the city of God we want to do the thing
 and it's like yeah man should you be finding where God's doing it which begs the question then of course which is well then we discerned that the spirit of God is up to something and something needs to get built around yet Stewart it had to be wise stewards at the thing that got speared it up to that do it buyers usually some building at least processes organizational structures if not physical structures and here we got and then that becomes arturia testing I think that's up at least I think that's how the cycles of the stories are meant to help us then go out and maybe checking emissions the wrong thing it's kind of more if the intuitions like okay I'm going to do it I've got the plan I'm going to build this for you God then it's like that's ya in the narratives that's usually a moment to go hold on that's right to another words it's the difference is.
 Between what it is the thing that we see the God is doing how can we partner with that in a way that doesn't trick us into thinking that we're doing it how do we really partner with the thing God building versus the whole thing it's right that God doesn't want some yeah and that's the cast of risky quest which requires a lot of wisdom among other things yeah
 so when we got through that for all right but the last one significant cuz it opens up into our actual lives which is about how to pick up Partners in what God is building in the world that and they said it will come back to some more questions at the end of the series thank you for these big Tim thank you everyone and we'll see you next time I hear well we want to see some metaphors all the way down yeah just keep going to have always thank you everybody for great questions really enjoy it look forward to read more and Keep On Keepin On
