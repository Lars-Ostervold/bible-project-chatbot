God created Humanity to be near to him is that that's how the story of the Bible begins Adam and Eve Walking with God in an abundant Garden but this doesn't last long Avenue choose death over life and God banishes them from his presence in the story wants to let you know that to go back into God's presence is dangerous. Stations to Spiritual Beings called cherubim at the entrance of the garden and there's a flaming sword of death guarding the way back in and this should be ringing in our ears when we get to the Book of Leviticus because of the Tabernacle isn't just a tent it is a place that mimics Eden it is a place where God and Humanity can dwell together again
 but is it safe the dangerously good Holiness of God is going to take an outpost in their mitts how do you make things right welcome to the Book of Leviticus answering that question how do we draw near to God so live it gets one through seven is presented as the thing that will provide the resolution for Israel to be able to enter into and being in God's presence of the ancient world animal sacrifices were a common way to try to appease a God but in the Bible sacrifices are God's gift to humanity so that we can know how we can come in here and while reading them and feel kind of strange and even Grizzly were invited to sympathetically enter into these rituals and see what these sacrifices are teaching us to all these offerings think of them as each one is little variations on a theme teaching me that to come into greatest for closest proximity to God
 Mina Potter surrender of life that is an estimate what these offerings are all about surrender now we no longer make animal sacrifices but these offerings are here in the Bible as a Torah instruction teaching us that the stakes are high and even though we've failed God wants to create a path Back to Life Death is the result of our choice the wages the outcome of sin is death but God will accept the death of a blameless representative on behalf of sinful people and that's not fair but that is God's gift in the form of these offerings I'm Joan Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast today to Mackey and I continued discussing the first movement of the scroll of Leviticus looking at the five Tabernacle offerings thanks for joining us here we go
 hey Tim John hello hello hello we are in the scroll of Leviticus it is the third scroll in the Bible and we were walking through the hall tomorrow which is Forsyth schools in the Bible Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy and that unit of Scrolls and it also has its own Cemetery in the last episode we talked about the whole composition of the Torah and how the Taurus five books has kind of this out A-frame Genesis and Deuteronomy us girls end in a really parallel way that sets up their matching Nature has the outer frame so that's the like outer bread of the sandwich and then sandwich or sandwich unleavened bread cracker bread is what we call three Scrolls which is one kind of literary
 it's why I'm sure it's the center of the Earth but it's made up of three Scrolls Exodus Leviticus and numbers have a really tight unified narrative sequence and design to them it's a one big Mega unit that has three Scrolls we won't go any further than that go back listen to that episode if if you want to if you're into that kind of talk about about that yet but what Leviticus is jamming on is how can a people be in proximity to a holy God and you helped me kind of imagined Holiness bit more dialed-in that it's not about people going to be in God's presence it's that God is so committed to becoming one with the Human family that died has come from the heavens down-to-earth when I go to him
 the crisis of Leviticus what is jamming on is what should people do for God is here when God shows up to dwell in our metsu cuz that is both a great gift cuz he's a source of all life and it's a crisis because it is good and dangerous so what are we going to do God has showed up that's that's what Leviticus is jamming on cool and the biblical vocabulary is Holiness to describe that that God is both good and dangerous that God is the source of all life he is the Transcendent other that is what it means to be holy and there is a sense that then we need to be wholly in order to be meeting with God and communion and this is all kind of back to Garden of Eden is fundamental, seeing Melody music common in areas here that tree of life in the place where God life and power can become commute
 get it to his people it's a very special sacred Place full of abundance in life and so once humans betray God or foolishly you know break the Divine command their Exile and so when God shows up again in the form of a tent and a tent in a tent what you said in the form of his head. It has hosted by the statement for the purpose of God inviting his people to come near him but we're going to solve some problems you have to work out the things that keep people exiled from proximity to go we're going have to overcome those obstacles in some way and that's yeah Leviticus is aimed at overcoming those obstacles and we've already been trained to to sense and see the obstacles what they are and the solution was that is yes that's exactly what we've been trained to see it because it's been repeating Moses was in God's presence and Moses goes up on maps
 it's in God's presence but then down below the people create a false god say that it's Yahweh said that b r deliver and it's just it's just blatant just horrible Moment by Dollar Tree and Dodd is like this is a problem this is a big problem and Moses says make me the atoning sacrifice I will give up my life as an atoning sacrifice for their sins know what that means is we're going to talk about in this conversation. Okay. Probably at atonement for this thing that you did but in the narrative it's what makes God changes plan from destroying the people cuz if they're Dollar Tree to choosing to forgive them and maintains having a partnership with them
this is an ancient Bronze Age Semitic people in the Middle East doing rituals that made perfect sense for that time and place but for us thirty-five hundred years later looking back or come on what's going on yeah but all these rituals are getting at this idea that was very real which is God is Holy and we're being invited to be in God's presence he's come to be with us were invited to his presents and we need to alter ourselves and we need to live in a different way and we need something or someone to like a tone for us in order for us to be in God's presence it all of these rituals happening in and around the Tabernacle they have meaning their Torah they are instruction
 and it turns out the things that they are teaching is exactly what the rest of the revivalist teaching through poetry and through narrative but here now it's teaching through ancient ritual symbolism and nothing for it we just got to we got to move towards it so what I want to focus on as I think of this as part of our conversation as an introduction to like the basic categories of meaning of the sacrifices the animal sacrifices so Leviticus 1 through 7 is presented as the thing that will provide the resolution for Israel to be able to enter into and be in God's presence in a way that is safe and that gives them life instead of destroying them that's the narrative contacts you of Leviticus 127 what do you need to do to be in God's presence and so what Leviticus chapters 1 through 7 tell us is you need to come to God with a posture of complete and
 utter humility and self-surrender that is in essence what these offerings are all about surrender surrendering receive these offerings in this movement in this movement has five offering yes yeah so let's let's get to it so and just a quick list right here
 in Leviticus chapters 1 2 3 you get three offerings that often happened in a sequence offering is also a religious word I never heard say that yeah we'll talk about it but if you're surrendering something over we'll talk about it there's three sacrifices our offerings that are listened to that one is called the Ascension offering this is Leviticus chapter 10 it is sometimes translated as the burnt offering the whole burnt offering will talk about it the second is called the gift offering let me know sometimes called the cereal or grain offering that's not an animal that's your offering food and then third is What's called the peace offering or sometimes translate is the fellowship offering its first three out of those three only the first is one that is said to provide some kind of atonement that can release God's forgiveness from his failure
 then after that come to more than one is called the purification offering usually translated as the sin offering and that is said to provide atonement that releases God's forgiveness and then the fifth and final one is called the guilt offering or could be translated as the reparation a restitution offering that one also provides atonement for since there's five offerings four of them involve animals
 and then three of them are said to have I'd atonement tournament that's right so instead of starting out by talking about the word atonement what here's what I have found is that it's best to get into the meaning of these from the inside okay and walking our way through the description of what it'd be like to bring one of these and what I'm going to invite us to do is to kind of walk through at imaginatively walk away through the five offerings the offering no not just of the Ascension offering the first watch and we're going to walk through and kind of offer commentary on on each step and hear Let me just highlight to works that have been so helpful for me
 one is by an Israeli Jewish scholar and Joshua Berman who wrote look back in the early nineties so good it's it's called the temple its symbolism and meaning then and now it's a book actually aimed at a modern Jewish reading audience but if you're a follower of Jesus you're part of the Messianic Jewish family and we are part of the larger audience of the extended family of Israel and it is a mentally Illuminating because he doesn't work in Christian vocabulary it works primarily in the vocabulary of the historic Jewish tradition so eliminating another scholar is scholar who is the father of Jesus Michael Morales who wrote an amazing Theology of Leviticus called who shall Ascend the mountain of the Lord if you want to take a deeper dive into everything we're going to do now and the next conversation those are two great places to start hookah
 so the first three offerings in Leviticus are the Ascension offering then the gift offering then the peace offering and then you get to purification offerings and then the guilt offering what's interesting about that list is that they don't reflect the order of the actual liturgies when when you read the narratives of how the liturgies work they don't work in that sequence like when you give these offerings and in the week or whatever or the day yeah what school is just this list reflects their logical priority that the Ascension offering is some is kind of the offering par exsalonce it's the one in which all the others are variations of that but it is real actual liturgy here's how the order ghost and you know this by just turning to Leviticus 9 which is the inauguration of the Tabernacle okay yeah we watch Aaron
 and Moses walk up there and they first offer purification offering then they offer an Ascension offering then they offer a gift offering that's only three it's only three yep that's right that's the three that are named in Leviticus Leviticus 9 I forgot a couple well and it's because the other ones the guilt offering and the peace offering our about other occasions so this is the fundamental Liturgy of the offerings so purification is about repairing a broken relationship atoning for his sins and purify in the relationship from the harm has been done that is followed up by the Ascension offering which is about total surrender to God
 and the Ascension offering is offered along with a gift offering which is about as you surrender to God you give back to God what God has given to you it's all these offerings think of them as each one is little variations on a theme but the goal there's a story being told about a desire to repair a broken relationship by surrendering totally in the posture of humility and buy gratefully giving back to you. What God has given to me in the first place that's the story being told and if so if you think about it you can just not right there what has happened is a rift in the relationship Israel has given their allegiance to nidal but God does the dangerously good Holiness of God is going to take an outpost in their Mets how do you make things right and so these offerings are fundamentally about some help making right the wrong that has been done. Keishin
 now entering the relationship in a posture of humility and surrender and giving back to God what is giving me in the first place and that's like that's what the these are about fundamentally
now animal sacrifices were common in the ancient world and is what I understand most commonly they are trying to appease God appease a god whose you don't know is he for you or not is what's his mood going to be today and maybe I can appease him enough to be kind to me today and there's even a sense of like I don't know how many sacrifices I might have to make Mabel even have to like scar myself or maybe you know it's it's kind of like to become pretty gruesome so that's like the setting that's what all that neighboring like nations are doing they're they're using that same system in a way but it seems like it's only purpose purpose yeah yeah similar to the way back car podcast conversations on biblical cosmology the biblical authors
 freely used in the top did creation imagery and themes and motifs from the creation narratives of their neighbors but they repurpose them framed it and retold the story of Creation with those images but in a way that changed or Focus their meaning and that's exactly what's Happening Here Yeah the meaning of animal sacrifice in Leviticus the reason why I soften repulsive and seeing the grocer primitive is usually somebody who hasn't yet had the opportunity for taking the time to really sit in The Narrative of the Bible and then the meaning of all these offerings are framed in Leviticus so let's do that this has been a full refund form of course the last few years start first with these two words sacrifice and offering so this section of Leviticus is often described as the list of sacrifice
 what's fascinating is the word sacrifice is that not used very much in the section the word sacrifice is the verbs Ava and then the noun sacrifices Eva and that word actually is only used to describe one of the five offerings the word that is described as or like the category title of all five of these is not the word sacrifice it's the Hebrew word Corbin Corbin which means offering actually it doesn't even really know what it means
 so the word Corbin is from the opening line of Leviticus right here which is and God called the Moses from the 10th and then because one of us to when anyone among you who brings near a Corbin to Yahweh bring near your Corbin in animal either from the herd of the flock so all of these five things that come from animals and also the little pile grain for the gift offering they're called Corbin Swiss what's interesting about the record bond is it's the noun form of the verb that is used here bring near I'll read the verse again when any one among you who brings near and it's the verb grief I'll let you in here the Q the are in the be in there talk rib
 da crib Corbin to the car with the tar the tar is the second person singular verb conjugation second person. Yeah you yeah when you bring near Tha hope to talk to you being just a brute the route that could also be announced yeah we're gone that's right so another words this word Corbin is the noun of the verb to bring something near so I'll korban is that which is brought near the thing that comes near her so all of these offerings what they are called in Hebrew is the thing brought near when you bring near the thing brought the all five of these are called the things brought in here and it's all about God just landed or that's the narrative Leviticus is jamming
 God just taking Outpost in our in our midst and it's dangerous for us we wrong y'all Wagoneer we can't go in there but you always inviting us to come here
 he's inviting us to come right in right up to him and what is inviting us to do is to come near with things brought near things that will bring me near so it's these are these are five ways that one can ra commune with the god of Israel the vehicles of communion there the cord to calling them offerings you know kind of gets we don't have another words don't actually I don't know what English word can work here but that's what they're called the Corbin in a way that's how to interpret this you were you are bringing something and you're offering it to God to bring it near you bringing it well you bring it here to offer it to God right yeah that's right but it also is a response to an invitation when I bring this near it's because God asked me to bring it in here because he wants me to come there but God wants me to come into the tent or come near to it and so he
 ask me as he invites me to come there he asked me to bring a bringing your thing by bringing their thing for Bon Secour Bond means you know we almost named our first son Corbin did you know that's what this is our favorite name Corban Collins oh yeah but then someone in the family said oh Corby as a nickname and that sounds like an inevitable nickname so that's funny or not funny. I just wasn't for me
 so just to remember the coming near imagery is key to how Leviticus fits into the biblical narrative in the pattern of the Eden story at the beginning so to come near this all about re-entry into Eden
 it's about entering God is inviting people to come back in and so when it is realized brought one of these offerings brought a core Bond
 you would walk through the the little tent fence entrance that takes you into the courtyard and you wouldn't have it like an animal and you would walk up and you would be approaching the Tabernacle tent and what you would really see is a huge blue curtain on the entrance with two cherubim in it but then if you're approaching it front on the altar was right in front of me would be in front of it and that altar on that altar would be a perpetually burning fire
 cancel you have a fire in if you're looking for spective wise you would be looking forward and what you see is a doorway into the tent was too cherubim and fire fire and you're like all that's what Adam and Eve walk past when they left Eton and then 3:24 God posted to cherubim and a sword of fire the door and so the altar in front of the door of the tent is a symbolic Recreation of the door of Eden Minnesota come near is about God's inviting us to re-enter it and I will bring this as a way to repair the relationship so that that's what the story is about to understand the kid and Abel story to their offering they're offering at that spot at the door at the door door he exactly right that's the first thing that's what these are called
 so let's say you do want to come near what are you do well Leviticus one tells you first you need to select an animal
 and it needs to be an animal from the herd of the flock and differing subtypes could be a cow could be a goat could be RAM does a herd refer to food would be cattle around like cattle and walk would be like goat sir lamps but something that is required of any animal offered as sacrifices that it is Tummy in Hebrew word Tommy
 it's usually translated when it's applied to animals as unblemished or without blemish but this is a word that is also used of people in the Bible and when it's used of people it's the word translated blameless and that's the Hebrew word tell me when the Scott translated into Greek in later Jewish history Greek translators who are Jewish use the word teleios oh yes and this is where Jesus use this in The Sermon on the Mount which is betel ass just as your heavenly father is telling us be there it's in our new testament perfect translate is perfect without blemish so this is the ski another words what we're Beginnings were choosing a animal that's going to be my substitute representative before God cuz I'm going to stop at that altar I can't go into the tent stupid too powerful for a normal Israelite this is this is far as I get home
 but not you but God will accept as my representative an animal that is Tommy for animals that means in ideal physical form and to be more explicit like what they don't have patches of hair gone or they don't have like and it's like fully functioning so no I damage no reproductive organ damage no malformations that kind of thing so it's a what do you like dog shows perfect animal is representing this idea of being blameless it's the same word use for someone's moral Integrity moral Integrity so Noah said to be righteous and tummy in a month
 generation and that's why God delivers them from the generation of what he was told he was righteous and tell him and he was delivered from that moment you walk with God so you choose an animal that is Tommy am now we know that Israelites were often tempted to make shortcuts here and Malachi the prophet lays into his generation of Israelites live in chapter one he describes Israel's priest as showing contempt for God's name and then when he describes it more he says listen you're offering animals that are blind lame and that are diseased and then he says try taking that offering to your Persian Governor like the Persian governor who rules around here would he accept that so you wouldn't offer it to the person Governor but you're going to bring it to the Creator God and like think that he won't notice what is a disease
 got it prophetic senior but also speaking of the Return to Eden this is within the Theology of the Psalms Tommy misuses describe someone who can return to eat some insulin 15 famous battle of the famous song the one on song if you know the songs but it begins Lord who can dwell in your sacred Temple you can live on your Holy Mountain one whose walk is coming who does what is righteous who speaks truth in their heart and it goes on they don't take bribes they don't land with interest to their neighbor they do righteousness and Justice tummy tummy tummy to live next to a sure and I think ya ideally the person you would want to become so tell me in people can come here
 tell me something, things can come to your house but he could go walk right into that tent wow by bar okay so that's you bring the time email first thing so it's a you walk up to the fire of the Altar and you have your tummy Manimal and then what you're told is that the worshipper would take their hands and stomach their hands on the head of the animal it means to our press it's usually translated to lay their hands on the animal it means to press for a way down okay school does the symbol is in this happens with all the animal Frank's the offer press has their hand down on the animal and the descriptions in Lubbock is don't tell you what it means it's just like what does it mean to me interpretations throughout history one is that this is a moment where you're offering it if you're offering to sacrifice matoma
 cuz you're apologizing it's essentially a way to say I'm sorry and so there's some people who think that this is about transferring your wrongdoing on to the animal and there's a good reason for thinking that could be what it means later in Leviticus on the day of atonement we're told is the high priest of Israel takes to Tom meme goats and takes one of them and puts both hands on the animal and confesses all the sins of Israel and places them on the goat's head 16:21 the priest puts two hands some ox them on the head confesses to double press double crust Apple press confession symbolic placing of sins of their explicit Lee he's he and then he announces the sins of Israel or what
 confession for the sins of Israel so they're many people is saying well that's what it means on the day of atonement or at least that's the laying on of hands is involved in that part so that's probably what it means here by that other problems too many problems without interpretation because the laying on of hands is used for sacrifices that are not a ton of sacrifices but what way are you transferring guilt that's right so this is a peace offering does not atone for send you press that one and you do the single hand press on that one the other thing is the same word is used to describe the rituals where you do it two people
 it is said the phrase laying on of hands that is used in the New Testament that says it's this simple it's the same ritual right here so when Moses appoints Joshua as his representative leave it will take over in his place he lays his hands on him when the Israelites commission the Levites to work in the tent and around the timer on their behalf they lay their hands on on them so that's one thing did you do this to an animal than people and you do it the animals that are not being offered intimate and that the other things kind of nerdy but this is significant is that it seems like the transfer of sin on to the goat in the day of atonement this happens to the goat
 that stays alive and to the goat that go is exiled out into the woods to coats two coats ones killed that's right ones Exile and the one that's killed is not the one that has the sins confessed over it this is super important the goat that is that is killed and whose blood is brought into the tent is not a symbol of sin it would actually be contradicting the whole point of the symbol of the Tabernacle do not go to sprinkle cinnamon into the 10th. The whole point is to keep sin outside and so it does the goat that there's a sense of Israel is becomes like a like a trash like a garbage truck gassed and you stand outside you not into the for the laying on of hands it doesn't make logical sense it's okay the day of atonement which is a different way we haven't gotten there yet but there's talk about that later there's two animals want is sex
 when is natal that's the famous escape goat and the one between those two animals won the Senate confessed over it and then the one that goes out and that's the one that stays alive and the one that is exile Camp get the scent out of the can of stain out of here but another one is sacrificed and it's a blood is still in some sense toning as purifying that's right and we'll get there but I just want your attention to that so it's more likely that the pressing of the hand on the animal's head means the same thing for the animals that it does when Moses does it to Joshua when the Israelites do it to the Levites it's you're appointing a representative you're saying this person is now me Moses appoints Joshua has a new Moses
 who takes the people through Joshua takes two people through the waters of the Jordan just like Moses took them through the waters of the sea with how the New Testament uses it was laying on their hands you're pointing at you pointing yeah yeah Representatives Papa appointed Timothy as a leader over the church and that happens to that was working through the laying on of hands commissioning so that you act now on behalf of those who have appointed you that's what it means with humans and that's what it likely means with all these animals you're appointing a substitute you're pointing a representative who will go in so now this animal
 becomes your blameless representative before God and it's going to get a little it's going to go even more near to God I'll watch what happens when it goes so here's the next thing you do after you appointed as your representative you kill it with the priest kills up the animal's throat is slit and what's interesting is the MoMA them animals death is described in all these rituals just was used as one word checkout just to Slit the throat but not huge emphasis on how the animal dies or it's just it's at its throat was slit and its life is given in the place of the one offering it to remember this animal is not bear the sins
 in other words the laying on of hands is this thing is now blameless on my behalf and it's going to come even nearer to God then I can so what's the first thing that happens as it comes nearer to God
 yes. But you're saying that death isn't because of the sin because it's blameless the death is for another Purpose soap in the same way if an Adam and Eve were to go back into eating they would give up their lives that fiery sword would take him out when their way on their way in so is this symbol being communicated something very important the story being given to us here that for humans because of what we have all done here outside of eating and creating babylon's and Egypt send the world we've created outside of Eden by doing what's good in our own eyes as so estranged us from the character and goodness of God that the only way for us to become fit for God's presence is the surrender of what we call life so that we can enter into the life that is truly life means a surrendering of life
 you surrender the life of a blameless one who will go nearer to God than I could in my current state
 Adam and Eve were not coming after they not left that's my garden and so because they were not tell me they're not blameless the fiery sword keeping them out your save the logic of that it is they go in there going to lose your life yes whatever a fiery sword is just keeping you out or something I think it's a simple the NFL. You'll die if you if you try to go buy it now in the logic of this offering the the going near thing is that though it is coming it is blameless and so
 a blameless think and enter a d10 yeah but you're saying even a blameless thing is going to have to die yeah yeah it's teaching me that death is somehow this this boundary yeah this boundary line that to come into greatest or closest proximity to God will meet other surrender of life whether I'm blameless are not blameless yeah it is blameless it represents well it represents me and it's blameless but yeah it it does so by representing me I'm not blameless correct but it is blanket is so is the idea that
 and sorry if this is too I think you're saying well if it's blameless than it should have to die right and it does exactly blameless and it dies
 because so this is this is Tora teaching me something know what was blameless and he was saved from Death yeah that's right however when Noah got off the boat God said you know what I know about humans they're just going to do this all over again. So what no offers is the sacrifice of atonement and God sees the death of that tummy Manimal and he accepts it as a representative substitute for a compromised Humanity the actual language cuz where I'm so busy teaching us busy it's a substitute for me it represents me in a blameless state
 it is blameless it is when it is my representative and it dies on my behalf
 a blameless thing that represents me dying on my behalf that's right it's not fair that that thing should do I see up there that's nothing shouldn't have to. I should be able to enter yeah yeah cuz it's blameless cuz now the blame of thing ever since me it is going to die die up there giving his life for sinful people who got accepted. Even the offer of a blameless life God didn't even take most of his life and accept it and you accepted that so the image that communicates its own meaning God will accept the death of a blameless representative on behalf of sinful people and that's not fair but that is God's gift in the form of these offerings to but you were also meditating on the access to God's life there is an entering through death
 yeah yeah and when you say that was ringing in my ears which is Jesus saying like you want to follow me yeah that's right the one who wants to save their life
 will lose it but it's the one who will give up their life who will find it that's the one who will find through life and if you want to follow me take up your threat like crucifixion like death trap device carry you are execution rack follow me death is the way to life
 what's the next part of the ritual will bring us deeper into this mystery and this is once the blood is drained from the animal
 the priest puts it in some kind of basin or ball collection somewhere and then picks it up and then goes and does something with the blood and depending on what type of thing has been done wrong or who did it it's going to start getting sprinkled on things
 so the priests will dip their fingers in the blood and then maybe sprinkle it on the altar the altar being the thing that you just said first animal going to be burned on the first it's just now a dead animal to strengthen Blood on the ball and you're standing there in the police precinct sprinkle it on the altar or let's say it was the whole Congregation of Israel or a king or ruler that I'm did something wrong is offering it then the priest takes blood and goes into the tent disappears behind the fire in the chair being and starts sprinkling it on sings inside the holy place so what's this about so later in Leviticus we're going to be told to X over in chapter 17 that the blood of the animal doesn't as such represent death it represents life Leviticus 17:11 the life of the creature is in the blood
 and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the Altar and then a couple versus later every sport team because the life of every creature is its blood this is why I said to this room lights don't eat but cuz the life of every creature is its butt so big clear the blood is life so this Blood representing the blameless life of the creature the life that the creature just lost lies the creature just lost and gave up for me is still present in this blood it's still alive even though it died the blood is it's white and you take the life into the tent and it comes nearer to God's presence than I ever could and it symbolically comes into contact with God's presents for me and what I get is forgiveness as the the blameless representative goes into the temp on my behalf
 they're all this crap is Michael Morales is very helpful here he says I'm page 130 of his book while the slaughter ritual signifies death to oneself so the killing of the animal is like the surrender of the animal's life it's critical to understand the blood ritual in relationship to life that is the worshipers on life the blood represent the life of a creature and so through the blood manipulation sprinkling the life of the worshipper which is now identified with the animal through the hand pressing the life of the worshippers brought into contact with the Divine the blood symbolically conveys the offering up of one's life to God saw us through this animal and the surrender of its life I threw it get to go into the 10th
 here then is where the word atonement it's brought into the mix that is a time this is called atonement so the Hebrew word used for atonement this whole ritual is called a tournament our English word is actually a compound that you can still see at 1 minute at 1 month the English word atonement in its atomology is referring to the repairing of a relationship between two who were at odds but now can become at 1 the making of two to be at one that's what's underneath the word atonement not funny you don't hear that when you look at it as a tongue that but when you say at 1
 another words at one minute English at the two becoming one okay and not the Hebrew word has a different metaphor OK Google, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I was thinking of the dog in the cartoon it does look like a Kipper on you translator right and I'm glad things and people debate these and much of the modern to Tomah today it's in modern theology is trying to say is that this word compare gets used in two ways that many people see is different and it's essentially I think this is right I might be wrong here
 but the two ways to pair gets used and often one of the meanings of compare gets more emphasized in the other D empathized and but you just follow a right on through and the word somehow means both two things that for us it's difficult to see how they could be the same time but they're deeply connected so the first thing first Nuance of meaning is a ransom from Death Ransom referring to an actual payment that you give to somebody that you wronged
 so that you are no longer in their debt so this compare is connected to the Hebrew noun Cofer which literally means like a payment that you owe somebody that you have wronged it's a cover call the Coker so you know some of the same as well as in the toy about the Goring aux you know if your oxgord somebody kills somebody yeah so is Exodus 21 through 8 and 7/11 Austria to run somebody over Spears them with its horns or something so if you have an AUX and doors somebody to death but let's say that it's never done that before nobody knew it was a dangerous aux
 your aunt escapes minute trample somebody so the dogs will be killed but the owner of the ox shouldn't have to die but it's the socks is threatened somebody before if it's almost killed somebody a couple times and the owner just let it roam freely
 and then it kill somebody then that person needs to be held accountable a life for a life the owner is liable to capital punishment.

 is demanded of him right as a family member of the someone who died says you know what you owe me I'm not going to make you die
 you owe me a cover for you know my whenever my son's life that Sox scored I'll take a cover then he should give the Redemption or the coast of his wife whatever is demanded so that's what this word means to Ransom from Death so this is one of the main meeting cuz of compare is that you give this offering this substitute life is a way for you to not die yeah it's a payment
 this is this is a fairly well-known meeting you know from like the Apostle Paul names this when he says the wages of sin is death you know in Romans chapter 3 but he's reflecting here on the fact that human fact that you're not blameless means that you should die well okay so here when you just stayed at like a scientific fact we have to live in the story that began with the Eden failure so Humanity was lifted Out of the Dust and put into proximity of eternal life through Folly and moral failure that forfeit that life exiting right the Human family and in the story Into the realm of death so in this story Death of those is a result of human failure to trust God to live by his wisdom in b word
 so in this narrative death is the result of our choices and it's about God giving us over and then enforcing the consequences of our choices The Wager is the outcome of sin is death so that's currently I am under a death sentence and so are you going to return the dust and that's how the Bill's authors see reality we're all dying to see existence is a death sentence to be human outside of Eaton is to be under a death sentence and it's not from that perspective it's the most intuitive thing you could imagine sure cuz I'm dying and so are you and why are we dying yeah God God is letting us die or violence and Folly look around however
 God has given the life of this creature made it available as a substitute and if it's life blameless life which is allowed cuz I blame the thing can go in surrenders its life on my behalf and God will accept that life as a cover
 now when they did this they weren't expecting to live forever isn't some like Fountain of Youth like exercise they're very well aware that it's like this I'm going to die still man but in a sense what they're realizing is I can still be in God's presence so I'm I'm like reentering Eden even though I shouldn't be here cuz we keep playing host to the god of Israel in the season are missed he'll rescue us from death
 me rescue us from our enemies will provide Manna for us God's presence is life and so we want to keep that source of life around us and so he has given us these creatures as a way to
 pay him back for the ways that we wronged him even though he's living in our midst the first man meaning but here's what's interesting is that this word atone a compare is also used not a people but if things so the day that the Tabernacle gets a Nuggie rated Leviticus chapter 8 Moses takes a ball he Slaughters it he takes its blood puts his finger and some of it and then he puts it on the horns of the altar is Franklin the blood out there and what we're told is it purifies the altar
 then he pours the rest of the blood at the base of the Altar and made sit holy and mix a tone meant for it it's over for the altar yeah that's the word to pair pair so the ransom doesn't really work here alter doesn't go with life and then he doesn't know it's life yeah yeah and what you're told and in terms of the literate design of the sentence he puts the blood on the horns of the Altar and purifies the author then he pours out the blood at the base of the altar he makes atonement for the all the words, is in parallel with your thigh to purify yeah and this happens to on the day of atonement when the blood of the blameless goat not the one that got sends put on it that one went out of the side of the camp but the goat that is blameless and then presumably dies and dies and then it's blood is taken not just inside
 he goes outside the camp presumably dies one day that represents us that one is killed if they do the double press send was on the goat is write the confession of sin the one that gets the single press representative commissioned as a representative that one is killed its blood is taken not just
 to The Altar and not just inside the tent but into the holy of holies and here's what we're told about that goat's blood
 the high priest when he takes the blood he will sprinkle it on the atonement lid is called a couple read the place of atonement and he will make atonement for the holy place because of the impurities of the sons of Israel because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins this is what he will do for the tent of meeting which lives in the middle of them and in the middle of their in Puritas
 so here we're in the different narrative well in overlapping narrative in the narrative is sin is like pollution and vandalism it both puts me in God's.
 I'm wrong and other people but sin and evil moral evil is like a wrong against creation itself it pollutes creation it fills it with pain and violence in the blood of the Innocents build on the ground and so here is it's like the furniture of the Tabernacle is slowly building up
 piles and marks of vandalism throughout the year and one day a year all of it gets washed away so all of this metaphorical imagery about the washing with the blood comes from this meeting here oh and like New Testament authors say Jesus blood washes away sin which is the word atonement it's the word atonement yeah but it's a different
 aspect of atonement the meaning of the word in two ways one is Ransom the other is to wash something that has been made dirty and in pure it makes dirty things pure and dirty not just in the sense of cleanliness but here we're in another key symbolic way of the biblical author see the world that will connect with stuff going on later in the Book of Leviticus but impurity is a state of being similar like we would call being sick it's it's being in a state of death or nearness to death and it's connected to things like skin disease or losing bodily fluids or touching blood or dead bodies are always you become and pure
 ritually but Israel's moral failings and Injustice and oppression actually slowly begins to pollute and vandalize the temple in their midst and if that builds up too much gods just going to say I'm done I'm out of here like I'm trash my living room is the same idea of like a flood washing creation so there's a Biblical logic of when humans are violent against other humans
 like I slaughter a fellow human fellow image fear of God their blood like there's actually at the Bible talks about the blood soaking into the ground and the ground itself you have now defiled yeah and that there's so much that was so much violence yes so much blood being shed so much just horrible yeah that got washed away with the flood he allows creation to of creation rebelled against human evil and God allows the order that I placed on creation to recede
 and the waters become a purifying agent that washes clean it when the boat when the waters are the purifying agent the wash is clean you're going with them but you died but when the blood is a purifying agent you stay alive because the blood is of an animal that's blameless that God will accept as a substitute for me that he was not like this so the blood can purify the land purify creation that I've filed to my violence violence and that's a hard mental space to be in the think about
 that my corruption our Collective corruption in creating an environment that needs to be reckoned with the biblical imagination was a flood washing it clean here's the thing though it's not that hard to imagine in one sense okay I mean I know that you know climate change usually Pleasant I sure miss you so let's just keep it local but if through human greed you know like the sewage plant is poorly run and has a negligent manager those moral failings will start to result in the malfunction of the sewage plant it will start to spill sewage into the local streams and so on and that's very similar to What's Happening Here human moral failings actually degrade the environment such the creation
 and will we will be Belle against us and destroy us and God will let it as a natural course of action and consequence to the same word compare
 is used to describe that you were fying of the land of the of the way that we're corrupting it in a way that text me because of the flood waters will purify it but will destroy me yeah this will purify it and also protect me that's exactly right and so you pair that with the same logic of this work a meeting a blameless one thing experiencing death on my behalf to protect me that's what they're protecting me from Dad correct but one through this idea of purifying and want to the idea of being a payment that's right and the payment and the purifying you could say they're different metaphorical we're all the way back to our conversations years ago on metaphorical schemes
 the word compare has two different stories underneath its meaning but the both overlap and one is about I've wronged you and I owe you now I offer this as a payment to make right what has been done wrong the other metaphorical story is I have wronged you and not has polluted the environment of our relationship such that this environment is being in your presence is like triggering me will clear the air yeah it's okay and and they're overlapping the whole point is that these are not separate you the biblical authors had one word to refer to both of these things and we find them difficult and I think I modern atonement debates are reflection
 of my inability to sympathetically enter into the imagination of the biblical authors and so the blood purifies and the blood repays in it and that is what the word compare when the New Testament authors talk about the blood purifying Wash Me In The Blood about me not the environment
 sometimes but in Hebrews in Hebrews the the act of atonement the Jesus accomplishes
 is not primarily when he dies
 it's when he ascends into the Heavenly Temple and presents is blameless life and I you blood into the Heavenly Temple before the father that's the moment of atonement in Hebrews yeah there's a work of a new testament scholar David Moffett Road important work called Resurrection in the logic of atonement in letter to the eeriest feeling feeling great but no see I learned so much but what's interesting is primarily we think of atonement in the New Testament happening when Jesus dies on one element that's true but even in this ritual here in Leviticus atonement happens not with the animal's death yeah what the hell was life being brought into it about when the life exactly Hebrews the Jesus's life is brought up into the holy Place becomes the atonement and that's purifying the environment creation
 wait it's not going to take my life that's right that's right so hit let me tie this up with another quote from Michael Morales here he summarizes this way he says the blood served as a purging agent
 purifying agent in about like a detergent, so the blood served as a purging agent purifying the sacred objects from the pollution of the Israelite where the person wiping away that's in from God's eyes cuz this is the stuff right near God's presence
 both Ransom from death and purification from pollution are tied to the underlying logic that the blood is life it's a life that is Ransom from Des and it's a life that wipes away the stain of death the basic point that in other Lee blameless life can obliterate death is the rationale underlying the sacrifices of atonement a blameless life offered on my behalf can obliterate death
 by repaying what I owe and by purifying the effects of sin and done and that's the rationale that underlies the sacrifices of atonement it's so this leads to just final note to me this is actually the most important one back to the one explanation of atonement given in Leviticus is where is 1711 God says the life of a creature is in the blood and I got says I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar
 that's interesting cuz you would think the person's bring it to got you would think what it says of the life of the creature is in the blood so you have to give it to me give me the blood and the opposite of what you're paying attention to exactly the how you began this conversation like the way the most people think about us is to advise and this is saying that I'm at in the Bible is the opposite it's a gift it's a gift from God to us
 I am giving you the way to become right with me yeah well and then John 3:16 God loved the world that he gave his son that's right so yeah I didn't for a lot of years I have such a huge stack of books on atonement in my library and I really tried to figure out the atonement today it's an Asus rating topic studies here and I decided at some point to just kind of left that
 debates it because the categories of the debate were capturing my imagination and then all I could do was read Leviticus in light of the debate and some for me what I'm not trying to read the debate in light of Leviticus trying to read the debate in light of understanding the Deep logic of atonement just within the biblical story and I know what the debates are about the I decide to put the debates aside and just didn't have it the story and do lots of deep word studies
 and it's completely shaped my my reshaped how I think about the whole thing it's it's beautiful it look like Israelites thought of this as beautiful even though it involves the death of a very valuable animal they viewed it as an act of God's grace like they approached the tent and experienced God's grace they didn't see it as whatever else you might you know appeasing a God is about to hammer me they saw it as a gift of God that he wants me to come in here and
 he's giving it to me yes and
 if that doesn't happen I will die that's right totally I will die that's right it is saving me from Death save me from death but the death that I will experience and how what death means means we're means in light of the story that began with the Garden of Eden and what we often do is abstract it out into some new story that we make up which is god is perfect
 you're not perfect so God has to kill you cuz you're not perfect but he'll kill something you can kill something in your place and then God will accept you and you can see you lack the elements of what the Bible saying are there but when you when you abstracted and shorten it to that little formulation you just really missing I think with the richness of what the story is saying it's like that that little summary that I just gave it's not it's not that it's entirely wrong it's just it's a remade narrative that I don't think is emphasizing what the biblical authors are trying to emphasize and this last Point God makes perfectly clear this is my gift to you about you trying to appease me with I've given you and I'm so sorry but you're letting me just this is a part of how the Hebrew Bible is Messianic literature does this is in the same collection of Scrolls that has the suffering servant of Isaiah
 the talks about God's servant who will give his life as a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of Israel and therefore for all Humanity you so this section of Leviticus is trying to give us the categories that will prepare us for the Messianic hope of the suffering servant who is God's gift to humans thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week work including the first movements of Leviticus looking closer at the offerings The more I've learned about his offering more I see that their meaning is working on themes that are developed all throughout the rest of the Bible self-surrender purification from sin making right loving God loving your neighbor thanking God for what he's given to me but the meaning of these are ideas deep in the heart of the biblical story that comes out everywhere today show is produced by Cooper pelts in
