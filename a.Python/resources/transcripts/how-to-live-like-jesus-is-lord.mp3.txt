it is a John at bible project in the last two episodes of this podcast we have begun a brand new series on how to read the New Testament letters these are small books in the back of your Bible these are letters written by the Apostles of Jesus to churches scattered throughout the Roman World during the first century and it's important to emphasize that these are letters really letters for reading someone's mail and I've been thinking about how strange that is that part of God's Divine word to us is half of a conversation I mean to me that feels strange maybe even a mistake or an oversight because of these ideas these letters have are so important for us to understand shouldn't we have the whole conversation so Tim and I are back in the studio and I had to process this through with him are the nature of the biblical letters a scandal or perhaps are learning to read half a conversation or actually learning skills
 that will allow us to take the way of Jesus the new modern context we get to watch the apostles take the biblical story and more fit into a cross-cultural story and language and apply it in cultural circumstances that Jesus did not have to deal with our encounter after all taking the way of Jesus to new places that's what the commission of Jesus was this is the paradigm shift that I want to invite people into it with these videos is that the letters actually come out of the missionary movement and expansion of the Jesus movement you could say that this part of the Bible is actually the product and the fuel of the expanding Jesus movement going out to All Nations okay so this episodes a lot of meat processing so it's 10 likes to say I'm sorry and you're welcome also Tim and I develop some vocabulary while we talk about the full moon
 if the Bible and where the letters fit into the whole Grand narrative and we do that by breaking the Bible down into movements gets a little bit confusing perhaps in a little geeky but don't worry we found it helpful in the moment and I think you'll find it helpful to that's all I had in today's episode thanks for joining us here we go
here we are back in our little Studio after having had that live conversation that was super fun. So many great people lots of great people who do I could have told you that but meeting so many proud Texans in one weekend yeah it was really awesome was awesome I just got on to San Antonio wants a conference saw the Alamo think of something you supposed to do but Dallas Next Level yes so we have a whole conversation to continue on from that what are we started there we're going to make two videos and how to read the Bible series about how to read the letters of the Apostles in the New Testament we covered some ground during the live podcast and let's check that loose I kind of feels like some cobwebs around it already
 yeah in real time for us okay I just wanted to sit on the table the reality that this section of the New Testament that it's fairly small number of pages compared to lack the rest of the Bible books of the prophets or even the Book of Luke acts is longer than all the letters can buy a really yes the Book of Luke over 30% of the New Testament okay, so however this small percentage of the New Testament of the Bible has like a disproportionate amount of influence yeah on everything else so we talked about the reality of reading other people's mail the New Testament and the fact that the letters from the apostles are not
 theology essays or essays about Theology and ethics in the abstract there actually mail actual mail between people and house churches that had a prehistory word morning backpack explore the implications of that in our first session let's say I had like a great great grandpa with some brilliant dude and I found some correspondence letters and so I only had his side of of the correspondence was corresponding with someone about sure about something he really understood well and maybe it was was just say it was like
 astronomy or which one which one which one's like the study of stars and so he just stood like black holes and he understood dark matter and he understood all the stuff but we only have his correspondence with a colleague and we got piece it together that's right dear grandpa in this great great grandfather great grandpa and his colleague were talking about some pretty bad stuff but all you have from it are Snippets or sections of developing ideas that he shared in the context of conversation so you do get you get real content new content but it's all framed within a conversation that has an actual purpose. So you get Snippets or you get if your great-great-grandpa developed
 idea about quasars but only to answer a question that was being asked by the call Leah cry so you don't get his full understanding the book will you get is a paragraph where he's condensing stuff that he would have written whole chapters on in a textbook and I guess it take the parable further let's imagine that he had written the textbook he had like put down everything he understood in one but that doesn't exist anymore or all we have is the correspondences by piece it together that's right okay that's fine because life happens and too bad we lost his thesis and somehow it's it's destroyed or buried or just missing a life goes on it's unfortunate but if we're talking about the God of the universe how he's going to communicate his will to his human partners that he created
 that seems like an oversight like you should have kept the pieces document so we didn't talk about this but I was thinking about this ever since we started this conversation in the first episode I think on this Parable this the core thesis statement is the Hebrew Bible and the four gospel accounts that is discussed a thesis statement mainly want to rule this world in partnership with his human image Ferris zero they have failed you pointed Israel they failed in Jesus who is divine image made human humanity and Israel stories are brought to their Climax and carried forward into the field and is supposed to be in this conversation all of the New Testament letters have Echoes of that core storyline that they believe has come true in Jesus which is why they talk about him raining in the Heavenly realm at God's right hand in almost every one of the letters
 so that's the thesis statement what we're watching in the letters is missionaries pastors Apostles corresponding with actual house churches helping them understand how to apply and live out the reality of that core thesis statement in the context of these different cities around the Roman Empire statement is also not a theological is a poetic narrative the way biblical narrative works but the thesis statement is that Jesus is Lord the gospel the gospel is yeah I believe so many unanswered questions and what I guess my supposition is that all these unanswered questions is what the New Testament speaks to the typo on right Jesus came and brought so much kind of climax in and finality to the story
 but then lead us to so many more new questions about what does it mean to be a follower of Jesus what does it mean to be his body and so I guess my assumption is the New Testament letters will tease that all out and put a bow on it and you do but only through correspondence has not like someone you know you think Paul would be like right some Tome of a of a book that just spelled it all out. It was too busy
 he was too busy starting actual churches and pestering actual people and writing letters to them what's unique about Paul is we have more letters from him than any of the other Apostles you know get to from Peter 3 connected to John the Elder you know it's not a lot else to work with Hebrews has an anonymous letters from somebody over the course of you know a decade-and-a-half you can really put together a picture of a kind of textbook that they would write and that's what we have those we have a bunch of people throughout church history trying to put together at the textbook that they would write the textbook that Paul would write what textbook would call right that's the question I would have even written one I guess that's an interesting question what do you have even written one because my assumption is of course we need one and maybe maybe that's why I'm getting tripped up sure but it just seems like a given
 closest we could get would be either Ephesians 4 even there that's him corresponding with anything about Ephesians is that it seems to have been a circular letter sent up and down the lycus Valley from Ephesus all the way on up because remember this word is not in the earliest manuscript of the letter to the Ephesians which doesn't mean it wasn't there I think the evidence points in the direction it was a circular letter and the letter that has been copied and spread down was the one that arrived in Ephesus but a few on the dress copies are still floating back there for the complex debate but Ephesians or the letter to the Romans letter to the Romans is to a network of house churches that he never visited but that he wants to visit and he the letter sort of like paves the
 for him however even in both of those letters what they're obsessed with is the Jew non-jew Division and unity in the church that's the main burden and saw all the theology that he develops in those letters is in the service of creating a vision of the world where Jesus is King and he's bringing Jew and non-jew together cuz that was the issue of that generation so maybe to put it differently what the New Testament letters are is there snapshots of the first generation of the Apostles applying the thesis statement that Jesus is Lord of all of the nation's then exhausted human image who loved us and gave himself for us this Grace gift was given regardless of any status rank value socio-economic gender class and it puts everybody on an equal playing field so we eat together we pray together we give our stuff and we're forming new families in the new Humanity
 that's the thesis statement and what we're watching in the letters is the apostles applying that in one particular cultural context that the early church spread into namely the Roman Empire in the first decades and as we watch them apply the gospel in that cultural setting we learn a lot about what it might look like for us to apply the gospel thesis in other cultural settings but it's a culturally located moment they're not floating out there as abstract theology that's perfect sense yes but as it makes perfect sense it continues to confound me why is that what we have a scripture and I don't want to put too fine a point on it but back to the great grandpa Parable let's say let's say he didn't just understand astronomy like he understands some secrets to the universe that like everyone really needs to know
 and he knew this about it and how it would help all of humanity and so he wanted to pass down his wisdom but for some reason he decided to give up my theological Bassett I'm not going to I'm not going to give them the whole thing all spelled out I'm just going to give him some correspondence from me and one of my colleagues or my friends and that'll be enough that's what I hear that that would be unfortunate. But fortunately that's not how the Bible works you know cuz we're on that analogy you don't have any core the Hebrew Faith Ministry Revival you don't have the core statement of what your great-great-grandpa actually figured out and discovered and what he wanted to pass down icy and so the Hebrew Bible and the gospels are the core thing that God wants to communicate the letters from
 apostles were watching the first generation apply that story into specific cultural context in across the Roman Empire trying to live out the reality of the biblical historical you had to say this twice now for it to start tool and for me it is helpful I have you did it completely opposite I think in my mind you've got all this narrative is just all this Preamble until we get to the good stuff which is tied all together for me create a complete kind of Matrix of ideas so that I can understand myself in the world I live in and how to please God it had to live wisely and all these things and you're saying all that good stuff is in the Preamble what I'm calling the preamp yeah that's right we getting the letters is just some like phone conversations it's like somebody
 some fun conversation. Everything is like some really important really really really really important watch the apostles take the biblical story and more fit into a cross-cultural story in language and apply it in cultural circumstances that Jesus did not have to deal with our encounters and if we didn't have that we'd be impoverished. Impoverished what if we just didn't have the letters would be okay it's sort of like the letters are actually this isn't even my parents both might be and TV rights remember it's as if there is a symphony that has say six movements that was the first three movements would be the equivalent of the Hebrew Bible and the gospel accounts what's missing is movement 5 what movement 4
 it is is a whole bunch of Scholars of this great composer who ever this composer he or she was reconstructed what the next movement would have been like sit with him for his act as it's not making any sense I think so keep it on for another generation of people who have studied movements one through three and they have written under the guidance of movements 123 a whole new movement that they think is exactly what the composer of wanted a cat for movement forward to be like movement 6 the way it all ends is also written the Gap is movement 5 and it says if we you and I that every generation of the church after the apostles is riding movement five under the guidance of movements 123 we've already watched the previous generation apply movements 1 2 3
 you starting and then we are called to follow their lead and live out the movement in anticipation of its culmination at 6 that would be the mistakes in this Parable is the Revelation 2 + 3 is the Hebrew Bible in the gospels and the fragments we are the letters of correspondences when you say we have to turn into a movement or kind of recreate the movement meaning there's some work we have to do to flush it out what the what the scholars do is they studied movements 123 and then they worked out what movement for needs to look like in order to get you on your way to how the story of how the symphony is going to and beer but they're still a gap and now what we are called to do we have moved this one through three to study and see the story we've already watched the previous generation apply at all
 to the next and we get to learn now we have two sources to learn from the actual story of Jesus Hebrew Bible and Jesus we've watched the apostles apply it and the cultural circumstances of first entry Jewish Messianic synagogues and Greco-Roman cities and now I actually you know you and I we also have Nineteen Hundred Years of church history to also clean to see how followers of Jesus have applied biblical story and cultures all over the planet but there's a private place given to the apostles letters because Jesus actually commissioned them and the point of time is his deputies that I want to invite people into with these videos is that the letters actually come out of the missionary movement and expansion of the Jesus movement you could say that this part of the Bible is actually the product
 and the fuel is both the product and the fuel of the expanding Jesus movement going out to All Nations this is Phil the Great Commission member in the Great Commission Jesus said go out to all nations and everything that I commanded you so what we're watching and the apostles letters this is them teaching all these Greeks and Romans and macedonians and what it looks like to follow Jesus in their city and their contacts and welcome to the letters welcome to the letters movements 133 come to us from a well-crafted group of 2nd Century describes the Hebrew Bible quotes bible quotes this narrative and poetic retelling of their history inspired by God spirit and in your metaphor of a symphony to create this tune to live by which is
 that there is one God there's one Creator God and he created us to be as partners and to rule the world and to trust him and his generosity and to use this power for good and the propensity for us to decide to land around and his desire to make this partnership work so we get this this melody to tune and we learned so much about who God is and how he works in his creation fails on family room but he tells that guy Abraham and Sarah that from them is going to come a multitude of Nations this was the second part of our conversation that's why he gets named off cuz he's going to be the exalted father of a multitude of Nations
 and so the story the particular story of the one nation of Israel carries with it God's purpose to bring all nations together as his Divine Images and partners ruling the world together with him is real fails so who is 133 is the Hebrew Bible which is through the guidance of Holy Spirit and in the scribes Bring It On tradition crafts it that's why do we have this beautiful complete that's my bike and that and it's and it's beautiful and it sat literally genius and meditate on it and all Humanity store in crisis and Israel story in crisis is all going to be fulfilled and brought together through one anointed representative Messiah the servant the new house that's the new David and Dawn soap
 the problem and of what kind of solution is going to need to be there that's the Hebrew Bible score tour of prophets in writing for correct which is for them to remember more ancient biographies of Jesus and how he is the climax of the Hebrew scriptures that's right in his death announcement of God's kingdom his death is the resurrection and his exaltation with some were sometimes called his Ascension to the Heavenly Throne Jesus is installed as the human image of God that Genesis one anticipated but no human in the Hebrew Bible ever felt so now Jesus is Lord that's the gospel just have that
 hang right yeah okay yes you got enough you know the story you're in you know the heart of God you know the mission you know the conflict and resolution you know the person of Jesus and you can decide Jesus is King of the universe and I'mma live by his ethic and from the resurrection narratives to the Revelation so to speak and be like in one day all nations will realize that Jesus is truly King and God's Kingdom Come On Earth as in heaven payment however at the end of Matthew and Luke actually all four gospels have some kind of commissioning Mark only does and its secondary longer for him that's all of the rabbit hole the gospels contain and Jesus commissioning his disciples to go out and expand and spread the news in the movement somewhere near the end-all for have a continuation like a...
 whether he was good for something... So yeah the question is now what now what is a Lord and he's been working through this with the people of Abraham and now it's opening up to all the nations know what Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would come and teach the disciples the apostles truth so that they could go and represent him and even within the gospels Jesus commissions the disciples to as his Representatives like when he commissioned them to go to buy too is already starting there they are going to continue on and expand the announcement and the Jesus communities farther and further and that's a thesis statement for all the goodness that made but it leaves a lot of questions practical questions very practical questions and it was the first very practical question was how is this Jewish religion
 our way of life view of the world going to now Messianic Jewish that can expand into other cultures cultures and it's not just Israel thing it's all Humanity thing that's what Genesis 1 through 11 is trying to tell us and so that's what movement five is predominantly preoccupied with correct sorry is now we're into this movement it's post Jesus resurrection he's commissioned his Apostles and they're out spreading the good news of Jesus kid and Luke with his second volume has given us a foundation narrative for ya for this first Decades of the expansion of the movement out from Jerusalem to Judea and Samaria then out to the land
 in many ways not all but most of the New Testament letters fit somewhere in the storyline of the book of Acts what we're doing right now I may be helpful in the video cuz the goal is to say the letters fit into a narrative context within the storyline of the Bible and access where they fit so XVI becomes movement five in the book of Acts as we're probably Paul but the stories of begins with e this exalted at the right hand of God and then he sends out his followers to the nation they receive the Holy Spirit and then they need to start spread them spread the gospel and a major theme of the book of Acts is how a Jewish Messianic Jews follow Jesus and non-jewish people who follow Jesus are working out how to live together as one family that's a major theme in the book of Acts so and then movement 5 so you have it you have a narrative but then you get all of these letters which are course
 what is Wendy's overly church-jesus movements about here's how to make this work in your community and I'm going to talk about the story and kind of up your select on it but then I also need to get really granular into like how this applies to you guys and the letters are prompted by an actual circumstances issue usually Boston a problem sometimes other things to move at 5 is unique in all the movements and that it has this element of Correspondence correct we get a narrative of Acts and then we get little snapshots of the apostolic Mission admission of the Apostles through getting the listening in on their correspondence in your car. You're creating then you're saying that now looking back at that there's some work to be done to reconstruct what were the issues I guess I'll be the main thing
 that's right
yeah so remember the first statement was these are letters letters require a context for you to truly understand what they mean so what we're doing right now cuz we're beginning to go through what I called for layers of context and the first one was context within the larger biblical story that's where we are at now the next two layers of context will be the cultural context of the Roman Empire culture Dynamics at work there that shape the tissues that the apostles face and how they address them then there's another call the context call a situational context this is the actual relationship between the author in the audience and the stuff that's happened this just assumed because he likes someone sleeping with their step mom or something so I think video number one on the letters can do those three movements of context than the second video on the letters will be about the literary
 contacts learning to read these letters as a unified statement developing thoughts from beginning to end so that we stopped at pillaging them reverse is out of context so the first two you would also apply to the other movements right where does this fit in the story and then also some understanding of the historical context it was incorrect yeah that's right it's the third one is unique to the letter to write the letters have an additional like element to them because they are letters letters are always written in the context of a relationship and the situations that they're written for cuz the fourth one is also something you apply to anywhere else which is real how do you read this thing as a whole and how do you see, themes developing and so and so there's something unique about this or we call it the 5th movement the 5th movement of what I've got people
 which we are to see ourselves as living with him and there's something unique about it where we have these correspondences that leaves it in a way not as complete as the other movements makeup using were complete like there's a sense of like I've created this this whole narrative structure and it's got some Fidelity in and of itself and it seems like what you're saying is that we get to the correspondences we got acts which acts that way it's kind of this complete narrative package but then we got all these correspondences they don't have that same Fidelity of completeness although you could argue that the book of Acts itself intentionally ends with a... Will they all do yeah when I say completeness I don't mean that the stores over the literary whole understand you don't need to then go and be like well what's situational contacts did the story happened in I think like that doesn't matter if it didn't give you
 information you don't need it you know like I'm reading a story in sure in the Torah I'm not trying to figure out you know yeah that's right so the letters are different than poetry and narratives in that they were written in an actual relation all situational context and a cultural context the shapes why they are what they are and we need to do the work of loving the biblical author as we love ourselves which was drive to hear them on their terms and not just listen to them to serve my agenda and I think I heard you kind of than saying that same Spirit of coming to this 5th movement and participating with it and a new way that you didn't have to do in the other movements is it actually setting the stage for the fact that in the sixth movement it's all on us in the spirit
 thank you yes yes thank you the spirit through Jesus followers to keep living out the reality of the Gospel that Jesus is Lord but in new cultural context that the apostles never encountered but because we've learned how they encountered new cultures and issues in the book of Acts we watch that will get worked out and then we watched in the letters them applying the gospel to first century Greco-Roman house churches in major cities that becomes an instructive guide for us independence on the spirit to discern what it means for us to live out of the Jesus is Lord in the Nations around the world today I think that's how much is completed for us so we know how it ends so I'm coming to this thinking there's a massive Gap hear them scandalous that seems like an oversight but what I hear you
 thing is there might be some sort of brilliant Define pedagogy to actually work for the spirit to be a part of the story correct and if you think that this makes a lot of sense The Narrative world at the Bible is one in which God's purposes on Earth are carried out and then threw his human images of the story is God wants humans to take charge and to carry out his will in the world which means that maybe the apostolic theology textbook it just simply impossible Endeavor because I would just show us is how the apostles work it out and they're sitting right but all that can never be for me is a guide that the spirit can use to teach me how we are supposed to do it in our setting and it's just the reality
 divine revelation through humans when God God created some crazy library inside cyclopedia with every decade labeled and you can just go to it and just pull out the back of your head and then yeah that's right there's a there's an analogy here to the two halves of the Lord's Prayer which is maybe we'll be done maybe Kingdom Come here on Earth as it is in heaven so we're acknowledging this is about God's name God's will God's kingdom coming but then the second half of the Lord's Prayer shifts the focus to how we are going to live in reality you're not light of that reality
 through trust forgot provision Daily Bread through radical acts of forgiveness and then by being faithful to God when we're in the midst of the test our own version of the test so God's kingdom comes on Earth as it is in heaven when God's people trust him employed radical forgiveness and are faithful to him in difficult circumstances so it doesn't it doesn't divorce how God is at work in the world from how humans are to live out God's will in the world that always together so this is all in service of your point there's the Divine pedagogy that leaves a gap for us to live out the reality of the Gospel in all of our different cultural context and the letters play a crucially important role cuz they show us how the appointed representative to Jesus the apostles did it in the first couple generations and from those letters we learn a lot about cross-cultural translation of the Gospel
 sex that we are living in is Spirit guided improvisation based on close study of movements that it's even more reason to be so saturated in the movements before cuz it good I'm going is good at improvising really knows the basics yeah that's right basic Melodies In the basic rules correct of them how you plan this tune yep that's right in many ways you could say the last 1900 years of church history is just the learning of different communities all around the world through history attempting to enough carry on the Jesus Story by the power of the spirit with varying degrees of success and failure
Macy's registry one final note here is the thesis statement of movements 1 through 4 the Hebrew Bible and of the four gospel accounts is Jesus Jesus is Lord this makes so much sense of why the gospels are all revolving around the theme of Jesus announcing or bringing God's kingdom Godsey rain here on Earth as it is in heaven it makes sense of why the resurrection of Jesus is portrayed as a royal instrument we talked about this in the how to read gospel singing video conversations it also makes sense why in the letters Chi Foundation Point shared by all the apostles is this conviction that Jesus is exalted as the king of the universe just keep coming up and I think a conversation to this series we talked about some of these texts like Psalm 8 which is all about a son of man human the god appoints is his ruler over
 we talked about Psalm 110 which is about a future king from the line of David who sits at God's right hand and those two Psalms together are the most quoted Old Testament tattoo in the letters they're fixated on them so I don't know if we want to look at any if that's helpful at all so the book of Acts begins famously with Jesus in chapter one saying and you know you're going to be my Witnesses in Jerusalem is a test of the Apostles you're going to be my Witnesses in Jerusalem today and Samaria and to the ends of the Earth the next sentence is after he said these things he was lifted up while they were looking on and a cloud received him out of their sight the Ascension Ascension but specifically the idea of GS es exaltation of up riding a cloud into the Divine and Heavenly realm this is all about Daniel chapter 7 the cloud Rider ascending up into the Heavenly realm exalted up Lux giving us a clue
 and this is hyperlink back to all of these Daniel 7 Things in the Gospel of Luke itself but we're watching Daniel 7 begin exhausted as God's Divine image at his right hand so once you step into the letters you see that they just take this as a given it just saturates their language do Romans chapter 1 begins with Paul introducing himself to the house churches of rum I missed the opening lines here Paul introduces himself as an apostle. It's one of these are Greek words the Spells of English letters Greek words spelled with English what I remember my Greek correctly it's the second one to send out this about one who sent sent representative
 so Paul he calls himself a slave of Messiah Jesus called as they sent one possible set apart for the gospel of God where do you find the announcement of God's good news well he promised it all beforehand through His prophets in the Hebrew Bible in the scription so you can see he's working with it here. The God wants to tell the world is in the Hebrew scriptures and then in The Narrative of its fulfillment which goes on it's about his son born from the seed of David according to the flesh who was declared to be not just to see the David but the Son of God Power by his resurrection from the dead according to the Holy Spirit who is this Jesus Messiah our Lord through whom we brush teeth Grace and apostleship we've been commissioned to bring about the bleeding loyalty among all nations for his namesake among whom y'all are also called by Jesus Messiah he sees himself
 in at 5 we have a 5 of our rest of our story has been exhausted as the Divine image and were sent as his representatives to go inform people of all the nations to give their allegiance and loyalty and Faith to him so what you can do maybe I'll just offer this to our listeners here get out of concordance will get online concordance go to Bible Hub which is the easy online importance and start searching phrases in the New Testament about Jesus being seated or sitting at God's right hand seated I'm going to be seated Bible Hub Colossians 3:1 since then you've been raised with Christ yes keep going to say your hearts on things above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God great example so as the first it was the first one but there's like one two three four five six seven eight ends in the letter to the Hebrews whoever that's written by in 1st Peter
 right through all the apostles have this conviction that Jesus is the exalted human image to filling the Genesis one picture and so the job of the Apostles is to go inform the Nations that the rulers of this world are not the ultimate Authority rather they are obligated to acknowledge one in authority over them too exalted Jesus the truly human one and they're going out starting alternate to alternate Empire of God in the kingdom of God would have been heard in the Roman Empire empire of God which 17 when in thessalonica when Paul goes there they get kicked out they have run out of town in like a couple weeks because people hear them saying this is the line they are announcing that there is another King Jesus
 so this is the big story unifying so that's one the exalted human but the implication is that then these communities coming around Jesus people are equal recipients of the gift of God's mercy and the invitation to this Kingdom and so this is huge Steven Paul but also in other letters that it's like the great equalizer because next step of contacts in the Greco Roman Empire everything is about status and rank in class stand in the way of the modern westerners it's almost impossible for us to the man really the people who have grown up in more traditional on a shame maybe Eastern or maybe southern hemisphere cultures they weigh more understand the dynamic in the New Testament that monitor jump into that that's the next layer of context in is of Jesus is exalted as lord of the nation's then the people forming around him are being unified across
 every single kind of dividing line and so this is famously expressed questions 328 he's riding to a church mostly non-jews there's been some Messianic Jewish missionaries who come in to say if you really want to follow Jesus you have to join the Jewish ethnicity group and be circumcised and just explodes in his letter he's so ticked off and he calls it another gospel a different announcement of good news because what he sees is that's an announcement of diminished good news cuz what it means is Jesus's only Lord of Israel becoming is relaxed in with us and he thinks this is just totally backwards and so yeah famous statement through the 27th the following uses you've all been baptized into the Messiah you close yourself with Messiah
 it's as if when you join the Jesus movement when you're baptized into it he becomes you become him about being the body of Christ yes yeah that's right yeah so famously says there is neither Jew nor Greek nor slave or free no male or female I mean you just went through basically there's no such thing as ethnicity no such thing as social class and they were free no such thing as gender power differential male or female you are all one in Messiah Jesus and if you're all in the Messiah you are all a part of the family of Abraham so don't get circumcised so this was scandalous in the first century Greco-Roman the class World structure the next layer is truly do understand what it was like to hear the letters
 in Greco-Roman cities around the Mediterranean
 I am trying to summarize my mind Jesus so he was a descendant of David according to this Earthly body is a flash stick is more than merely human could say the resurrection revealed his true identity it was an announcement of his real identity that is also being fleshed out in the letters is this identity of but they will constantly quote for next song Someone tear and try to understand that young idiot Jesus being this Cosmic King yep who is is one of got but you were kind of bringing out this theme maybe it's according to the flash son of David is that the whole point was that God would have image bearing humans who could serve as his right-hand essentially it's right to rule creation but the person of Jesus
 and now he is he is the cosmic King who rules from some other dimension
 and that there's plenty of people tripping out on that in the letters and then he says and some really kind of mystical way is like you are united in that like you are his body you've been baptized into him like his power is your power if the Messiah is in you he uses Temple dwelling language of the spirit of the Season you you are in him yet there's this Union and it's through that that we then regain the image bearing calling to rule with God is right hand correct his followers are his body the physical manifestation of the Messianic King here on Earth as it is in heaven I think we're Landing for me is that one of the reasons the letters is so confusing to me is because I've never given that thesis statement I can think back all of my years in church and that's never spelled out the way that we just talked about it and when that spelled out some
 of what Paul was the other Apostles talk on the letter just starts at the sparkle he was like but I'm just never explained that it's not other things it's about doing the right things the moral handbook part of it but that's also the saying and believing the right thing to go to the good place those are like the themes that I'm taught to pay attention to it so maybe maybe part of my hang up in the fact that it's a correspondence is that I'm just coming to the conversation like expecting to hear Wheatley different conversation even though I'm only hearing half of it I think that might be just a deficiency in your particular tradition in hearing Paul the body of the Messiah being the community of his followers that is the physical manifestation of his kingdom here on Earth and of GSS Ruby definition of power and Kingdom around becoming the servant yeah so maybe that's where our Traditions training
 both to maybe can not all our Traditions can treat us to let us up with wrong expectations about what the letters are and what they are about can you imagine the yeah I like think about listening to a correspondence and we had this experience you hear someone having a phone conversation so unless you brought this up and you can piece together a lot of the conversation especially when you know the person and then you think you know who they're talking to you can kind of almost here with the other person saying in a way but let's say you come to that conversation and you just have completely wrong paradigms about what the conversations about canceling like the main yeah you're pretty you're pretty preconceived assumptions about what is being talked about what shape how you read everything and what they're saying walking down the sidewalk and there's someone talking on the phone or with their little bluetooth earbuds and all you hear them say is he is so hot right now
 like it could be talking about their kid at home who's like got a fever could be talking about so-and-so's like latest you no boyfriend or something they could be talking about some athlete whose like totally like breaking all of their records this year you have no idea but based on what the person's wearing you might assume right decked out in like football gear you know this was just brought home from me I'm wondering if it might be helpful in this video to take some real concrete examples and I just finished of recent book by Scott H Scott McKnight called reading Romans backwards of Romans 14 15 and 16 give us the concrete situation and problem that Paul is addressing in writing about to Jewish Christians and non-jewish
 Christians don't like each other and they have divided in a meeting in separate houses and are not receiving each other to eat at the same table anymore and he wants he says it's the opening and ending of letter he wants to come visit the church so that they can become a sending base for him to keep announcing the good news about Jesus for the West so the letter the Romans is in service of that goal is to see ology that Paul develops is all shaped in the service of uniting Jews and Gentiles in the house churches of Realm that all becomes clear only at the end and because Scholars were preachers are usually exhausted by the time they get the Romans 14 15 16 X part we miss why Paul is saying any of what he saying in 11 through 13 did really well
 I can point at the commons like a short-form commentary on the book backwards so you start with chapters 12 through 16 then you go to 9 to 11 then you go to fight through then you go to 1345 momento it was so good and I all of a sudden there's passages in Romans that I remember reading and my first in my first year as a Christian and I'm hearing them in a brand new way and I think the way Paul intense them to be taken and that's that if you misunderstand the purpose of a letter you will misunderstand the letter and it's the point that's the basic point and this here of the image bearing through human who got had to become himself than the fill is so Central you going to send that the right hand side right who then we have Union with yep and we are the expression of here on Earth by the guidance of the spirit that's call Melody of the full Symphony
 and in the letters were watching the apostles guide for Century followers of Jesus in Greco-Roman cities around the Mediterranean learn how to live that out in their particular city that is so what's the next step in our conversation then is what was it like in these Greco-Roman cities around the Mediterranean and how did the cultural context shape and inform why the apostles had to write thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast if you'd like to submit a question for upcoming question response podcast we would love to hear from you you can record yourself asking a question and email it to us at info at bible project on cam try to keep your question to about 20 or 30 seconds in the email and you attach the audio if you want to go the extra mile Bridal summary of your question as well that would be really helpful
