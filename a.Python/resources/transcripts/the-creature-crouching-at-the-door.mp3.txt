we've been talking about the Natchitoches the serpent to in Genesis 3 shows up to deceive Adam and Eve in to their own destruction today we take a closer look at the snakes shrewd interactions with the humans the snake starts asking questions weaving half-truths and quoting parts of what God said to get the woman to take and eat from the tree that brings death but she actually thinks it will bring life the snake gets her to embrace and choose her own path back into not so rather than attacking the humans directly and Josh just tries to get the humans to choose their own destruction and it succeeds yet after this Yahweh proclaims that the seed of the serpent that is some descendants of the serpent will become a rival to the seed of the woman that is the children of Adam any this is ominous
 and if we turn the page we might expect to read a story about this rivalry but instead the next stories about two brothers that is two seeds of the woman in a bitter deadly rivalry amongst themselves and so where did the snake a human can buy their moral choices become the seat of the snake that can become agents of the snake and its desire to reduce the goodness of God's world back into the nothingness from which it emerged we all have a choice what type of seed will you be you yourself can be the snake based on the voices that you listen to so this is why it's you go on throughout the rest of the tour of the prophets the rest of the Hebrew Bible when you see bad people compared to snakes scorpions and dragons and lions this is what's underneath all of that imagery how is God going to raise up a descendant who's going to defeat the snacks today to Mackey and I
 talk about what happens when humans become the snake I'm done calling the new listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hey John hello hello
 we're talking about chaos I'm talking about the problem of evil in a way some way dragons and snakes and star beings aboard yeah we're getting there because we want to talk about why is there dragons in the Bible and hey by the way there's dragons in the Bible surprised they're there and they represent chaos their associate with the c Loft in the Leviathan the tiny and they come from a cultural story that would have been everywhere during the time of the the characters in the Hebrew Bible and in the forming of the Hebrew Bible just a meme of sorts actually see episodes of go called Dragon the mountain in the sea he adopts the word meme along with the word for cultural symbolic story myth because of the missing
 the theme missing which is essentially the meme merged with the meth meth what we mean is a story that uses fantastic images but it's trying to talk about very real experiences if life and death of chaos vs. order and so we looked at the creation story in the first page of the Bible where God encounters I guess that the state of being is described as a dark abyss will not. State of being does the tips but when it comes to God bringing into being something that is not how do you describe the is not
 and the way the 7-Day Christian are developments is describing that is not as a dark chaotic Ocean or as an empty Wilderness and you want us to think of it with the word nothing then nothing then nothing but nothing is the opposite of the something and what is the something that something is the good thing that God wants to bring him by his word so that nothing is the darkness and then God says well let me create something and that's the light yeah and then God separates light from Darkness the story the Bible is in God then saying now there's only the good and the Darkness the nothingness now doesn't exist in any way that doesn't exist doesn't give out house we got separate light from dark he doesn't do away with the darkness entirely what he establishes is a realm of light
 encyclical order with the darkness and so then God separates the waters and then the waters below he separates the land from the waters and the land is called good because that's where we get to live I mean there's life in order on the land and yeah and the waters it's intact in chaos I mean unless you're a sea creature you know which we aren't that's right see you at the story of human Centric perspective
 no it's not it would be but what if the people of Genesis 1 okay anyway so the payoff though was saying we got two Realms of disorder nothingness that got orders and one is the sea and one is the darkness and then surprise in the next series of days we get these two kind of bonus creatures that stand out like a sore thumb and one is a creature in the sea the cunning are there and then another is the creatures in the sky the stars which the Ancients thought of as the Spiritual Beings until you've got these two creatures and the two Realms that kind of represent God containing chaos
 and both of these creatures are then later applied evil Kings like Nebuchadnezzar or the Pharaoh and it when they're like doing their evil oppressive thing Gods like you know you're acting like yeah I'm like the sea creature yeah you're acting like a fallen star that's rebelling yeah or maybe in a little bit more powerful you have become an agent of you are through your choices and actions unleashing the destructive powers of the dragon and the rebel Stars you're in League with them by means of your choice is not till we're going to talk about in this episode right now human creature of the land
 become a partner not with the God of all creation wants to bring good how is it that humans have become partners with the forces of Chaos in the dragon how did that happen very easily so says the Garden of Eden story
 that's some real stuff are we're going to focus on right now is the figure of the snake in the garden story but the main focus so whether it's in art and religious media typically in the garden you're thinking of like I don't know a little gardener snake yes this is the second page of the Bible we've got the whole creature story that's ended yet but now we're like the story kind of begins again and says Okay God created humans puts them in a garden the tree of life is there it's good and I should try to go back to the culmination of the 7-Day creation story for the days of God working is to install images of God's Own Self on the dry land and say hey let's rule this world together you do it for me and make sure that any wild creatures out there that you subdue them
 you going to need to do that rule and subdue Rule and subdue those creatures and you just like why do they need to be ruled and subdued some of them want to get us you know like what's the problem you just got to read the next door to fill that up so Adam and Eve story picks up and it also begins with a nothingness image but the opposite of chaos Waters that the 7-Day story begin with but now with a dry desolate Wilderness so what's interesting is that we talked about this episode one that the Dragon
 can be depicted as an inhabitant of the the sea Waters in the waters are one common way in ancient culture around is real that you could talk about the non creation another way you could talk about the opposite of good and creation is with the Wilderness and empty desolate water the Wilderness and that's exactly how the Garden of Eden Story begins Genesis 2 verse 4 a land without water and so low and behold the dangerous inhabitant the chaos creature of the Garden of Eden story is not going to be a monster swimming in the waters because we're not in the waters it's going to be a snake crawling out of the Wilderness and sneaking into that Garden so to speak but in both cases the sea monster of Genesis 1 or the snake of
 Academy store in Genesis two are meant to evoke all the same feelings and associations in the mind of the reader does that make sense so that's just kind of the beginning point to what we want to figure out is when the snake gets introduced to us God create the garden out of the Wilderness forms a human one Adam-12 Humanity Mini Splits the human into male and female so they can become One X and Rule to do in Garden that's right that's the setup of Genesis to Genesis 3 verse 1
 introduces us to another inhabitant of that Garden not just God and Adam and Eve but God Adam and Eve and a knockoff and actually Genesis 3 verse 1 begins at the little background note saying know there was an OshKosh and Hebrew for snake snake yep 12 we'll get there we're going to spend some time but I called a knock off so we don't think you should know about the is it's really smart super smart and shrewd it English translations craft be but it's a word that means like yeah Autumn wisdom word it is yeah and it's if you read in the Proverbs it's good for people to be out Rim yeah actually you probably do good in life if you are a rim means you can cuz you said yes why is this guy when he sends out his disciples to go represent him
 be this way which means you can quickly read the situation and no what's the advantageous thing to do yeah that's a superpower it totally yeah they could be used for good or bad so what were told is this creature and its creatures exist on the land they're good I know that from Jens but God saw the creatures that you made on the way on Monday 5 right he loves them but this serpent had some had some knowledge more more shrewdness or wisdom than any other Beasts of the fields to work out at night and so that knockoff
 came up to the woman instead and here we go here we go here we go so what am I supposed to have in my mind for this creature well let's just do a quick like word search on NASA in the Hebrew Bible actually actually do it this weekend know how many times it appears 31 times the word nakasha seized in the Hebrew Bible that's a reasonable amount we can wrap your mind around that perfect you can read them all in an afternoon to put together a quick word stay or you can let me do it for you right now so it's used many times to refer to what we think of with our word snake look ground crawlers litters in the holes are probably out in the desert reptilian sub Deuteronomy 8:15 God LED you that is Israel through the great terrible wilderness
 with its fiery nakash describing what it would feel like in your skin if it bit you get burned so they had fiery knockout and scorpions and dry ground where there is no water notice I need to see the Eden imagery hear the story and he brought you water out of the rock that story so I'm 58 where David is the speaking voice describing people that want to kill him and he describes them like people who have venom like the Venom of an Akash like a deaf cobra
 who is describing his enemies like snakes Jeremiah ate the rebel leaders of Jerusalem I am sending nakashi against you adders bikers for which there's no snake charming these now they're just going to bite you too many of the movie called snakes however there are times where NACA can refer to a huge snake that's in the ocean
 Isaiah 27 verse 1 in that day which is describing when God does victory over evil and he builds his Heavenly Jerusalem up on a high mountain and has a huge feast where he swallows up death forever in that day the Lord will punish Leviathan The fleeing nagash with his fierce in Great and Mighty sword Leviathan The Twisted knot hosh the tiny and who lives in the sea as well we feel opposite how can it be both so an OshKosh is a word that could be used to refer to what we would call snakes across to be referred to this sea creature monster yep the tiny yeah so we think well those are two different species like we take a trip to Italy and I suppose in a way that's right so maybe we would use
 reptile like a reptile and you can call this a cryptology called the sea monster about what significance is that
 they inhabit matching environments and we think how is the desert I see the ocean in the imagination and invention recent imagination the desert and the ocean are both symbols of the nothing so you can have a knock in the water so you can have enough in the desert and in both cases that thing watches its fangs into you know you're probably going to die and then you'll become nothing she'll drag you back into the nothingness from when he did a marriage
 so one more interesting thing about the word Nosh is that all languages have words that are called homonyms
 so these are different words that are spelled with the same letters Hebrew this is really significant because of root words root you can swap and vowels and it's still a very similar word that's right yeah it's an English you kind of get a sense of that I suppose words sound kind of the same but here it feels like more more of a thing the biblical authors use this literary to a lot more well but man if you have somebody who's really good at making like puns or jokes like that that's the same type of insect life for us it's rhyming words but yeah words that sound similar but what's interesting is like you could create a joke using the word lead l e a d d like to lead somebody and then the word lead l e a d like a lead pencil
 and they actually don't rhyme cuz you say them differently lead is in a lead like lad and then lead but if you spell them they look exactly the same yeah looking at Penny how many amps in English I want to try something and oh okay I just here we go in English with lynda.com the man who fell into the upholstery machine is fully recovered
 that's funny, that's funny do you know that every day on the calendar is numbered
 okay yeah these are my my favorite jokes favorite helpers are subordinate clauses and they do it regularly so here's this is truly just fascinating the Hebrew root three letters of the root noon kitchen that spell nakasha the noun or also the root of a verb not which means to practice sorcery and specifically to call up spirits of the dead so you can communicate them and get them to tell you the future
 oh yeah what's that called divination mediums necromancy so the biblical authors perception of divination channeling spirits of the Dead calling them up from nothingness calling them up from the underworld communicating with the inhabitants of the underworld to give you insight and wisdom to use the word with the same root as the word snake is spelled with the same letters as the word snake it's right so in Numbers chapter 24 there's the famous story about Balaam the sorcerer tires in order to not wish to perform not to give the king of Moab like some sort of advantage against the Israelites who were coming into this land Deuteronomy 18 the law given through Moses to the people of Israel there shall be no one among you
 who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire that's a child sacrifice or one who uses divination or practices witchcraft or who nauseous that is to get Omens from the voices of the Dead
 so child sacrifice and communicating with the dead these are all practices that are bundled together so it is very interesting that the creature that crawls up out of the dark Wilderness from under some rock some hole from down below is named with the same word as somebody who tries to channel spirits and beings and the inhabitants of the underworld to get wisdom than the whole one of the words for practice divination you don't it's just the word knowledgeable one like shamans so these are all the feelings that you come into our mind okay when we see that snake It's associated with the underworld It's associated with death and the dead it's also associated with the Wilderness and with the ocean
 yeah or maybe just a snake and it in the narrative yes it's a snake but the snake is saying that they have the Bible works in the Bible bring up a character it's like it's meant to evoke all sorts of other ideas and associations that will be relevant to understanding the role that is playing here so hear what this is going to do is begin speaking half-truths to weave a web of deception to get the human
 to do the opposite of what God Said
 what God Said is if you eat from the Tree of knowing good and bad you're actually going to die there's all these other trees I want to give you but there's this one that the old I don't need of it and don't have life and the snake starts asking questions and weaving half-truths and quoting parts of what God said to get the woman to take and eat from the tree that brings death but she actually thinks it will bring life and bring goodness not to the effect of this chaos creature knows where is this snake gets her to embrace and choose her own
 path back into nothingness and death from which she emerged that's the role of this in the story so go back towards death is essentially to go back to the nothingness from which she came just from the dust of the ground from the definition of the ground and that's especially the role of snake the snake is associated with the Realms of nothingness but we're told is it's a creature so he actually doesn't lead to the question of why is this creature acting that way in was it got some axe to grind like what the problem yeah I mean there's the bigger question of I have went this guy come from with that an in-depth and we don't have time to do that now but as you go on through the Hebrew Bible and as of this moment is referred back to Time and Again by later biffa quasars and later biblical stories
 what you piece together is that the snake is a spiritual being that like the humans is choosing to do what's good and its own eyes and I think not just me but with lots of other smart people doing the tradition think that this is simultaneously the Rebellion story of both the snake and the foolish rebellion of the humans as well. This is the moment where they both have their downfall so to speak and in context of this conversation which is that were talking about cuz this last in the last conversation we had about two different types of creatures I get molded together until 1 yeah yeah but I'm pretty sure that you can apply to like an evil King whose embodying the corruption and in the evil of the creatures is both of the tanning sea monster and a host of Heaven yes what you're saying here is essentially the same thing you got a creature that's called
 Josh has a way to talk about the chaos creature and put it on the way and now it's a land cast creature yeah but you're saying that if you really trace this theme and that's what we did in the first part of series you see that it's also very connected to a spiritual being the snake is here is one of the powers of the heavens on the land trying to convince the humans look God Wants to Rule the World with you I don't know if you can fully trust the way he want he wants to do this yeah really say yeah are you sure he's not holding out on you because what he said is going to happen to you that you'll die that's not what's going to happen to you. You're going to become like so like us they are images of Elohim what more do you want that's the tragedy of the story through relevant for the this conversation at the Dragon
 it's significant that here you get a chaos creature of the Wilderness that is named by the same word as the chaos creature of the sea is not harsh and that creature is what gets the creature God wants to rule the world in partnership with to embrace it own demise its own Journey back into death and nothingness but by its own choice thinking that it's the good thing to do even though it's the opposite of what God said to do and the image of a snake chaos creature is the difficult as his way of signaling
 that whatever being creature is at work here it is an agent of death in nothingness and there but here it's not like a force it's actually a creature and intelligent creature person one could say person by person breathe in intelligence and the preacher Lee intelligence not human but it's intelligent but it's not a dragon well it's a knock us tonight with Kendra fer this is where the biblical doctors I think just have more flexibility in how they use language and imagery cuz on the surface of the narrative it's a snake a garden snake but you just finish the story
 about the 70 Christian where you know there's other things that can be called knockoffs and they're swimming in the sea in the things called by the same name and it's but it's on the land and it's a word off music in the Bible was used is used in a synonym to a sea creature that's right you must and so maybe would ask question is to depict this creature would it be appropriate to depicted in the way that sea monsters were depicted with all the heads or with the yeah or with with legs or no legs are there are some Scholars who think that when God says the snake cursed are you more than any beast of the field on the elitist all the days of your life on your belly you will go the implies that it either had wings or legs do you had wings like a cherub had legs like a some depictions of a drive we've made the decision to show a wing like a champ that's right if the point where
 people who read and study the song songs or physical poetry get to the same point it's just the biblical authors use metaphor primarily to communicate symbolic meaning when you try to visualize it gets a little funky can you take this visual images and try to draw them it's feels contradictory how can it be a sea dragon and a land snake the same time the point is the meaning of both of those places and creatures and that they are connected in meaning in your mind cuz I could have called it a cherub and then the Cherub came could have been a lot of things I don't know I'm just saying if we think this was a fallen host of heaven isn't the best way I understand it is to begin ago and there was this cherub a cherry beam one of the hosts of Heaven yeah yeah who is Crafty that's right more crafty than any other God's creatures
 and that's what is Ezekiel the prophet Ezekiel when he read the Garden of Eden because that's what he sees here a rebel the sheriff so yes I think that is what we are to see here but it's through the symbolic image of the Chaos Dragons okay and so what is the meaning why would the biblical author choose that image well with that figure associated with the sea monster and with necromancy go to channel the dead to buy dragon again I want to import my idea of like the fire-breathing cave-dwelling winged Serpent and buy dragon you mean the creature of nothingness the chaos creature yeah yeah and whatever form it takes. You can be depicted in many different visual form which is also true of the Caribbean by the way they are
 swertres snake
set step one, take one more step in what we're doing here and that's in the next store the story of Adam and Eve's sons kept and I just want to briefly highlight how this the snake the dragons right there you just have to know how to see it and Abel Cain and Abel so into the realm of death God stations to Cherry beam and a spiral sword the Gate of Eden and the scene happening in the Cain and Abel story is adamant even their kids near the gate or the door of Eden cuz the door is going to be referenced herein the story and they're offering sacrifices the two sons are able the younger brother bring some really sweet choice firstborn some animal and the fatty portions which should really special and he gives it all syringes at all.
 Kane also brings a special offering of his field to God but God is really stoked on Abel's offering them so he's staring or gazing upon able to knock in and can't get angry and here's what God says to Cain Genesis 446 I said scan for what reason is there hot anger to your game why has your face Fallen if you do good won't there be lifting up exaltation
 but if you don't do good at the door sin is a Croucher it's desire is for you but you can rule it we've been at the scene many times here for over the years as a choice between doing good and not good executive his parents faced at the tree of knowing good and bad and
 there is a animal catching that wants him that he's called To Rule and these are all the images Adam and Eve were supposed to rule over the animals subdue them yeah there's one animal that comes the snake ya lose crafty and deceptive and crawler as aware of a crawler ya calling Crutcher tempt them into death and so here is God saying can I see you're in a moment of Crisis here you're upset you're angry
 but this is the moment to decide are you going to let the creature have its way with you right or you going to rule over the creature and the name of the creature in this story is not Josh it is hot. Which is the Hebrew word for sin moral failure yeah you don't think of that as a creature and we think of that as a thing that somebody does the name somebody's action or Choice except in the lettuce Apollo in the New Testament where he describes then that's like a demonic Cosmic force that wants to take over your mind and eat your lunch meat you're so God speed stats up is you're sitting at the tree just like your parents there's a creature that wants you you can rule it but if you don't that thing is going to teach you
 YouTube for lunch slay the dragon is what he saying well I think implied is Rule the Beast the Beast you trying to help you here buddy and so when Cain Rises up it came about when they were in he and his brother were in the field and where the snake crawled in it was more crafty than any animal of the field crawled into the garden so Kane takes his brother out into the field and he does strike his brother he gives in to the Croucher becomes a snake he becomes the snake is teaching us is that humans can actually not just give in to the deception of the snake and make a dumb choice they can give in to the snake and make a dumb Choice and then actually become an agent of the snake to other humans they can become a snake to others wait to wow wow
 this a hundred times the significance of going out into the field and it's striking your brother out in the field is becoming the snake yep you take them out of the realm from which that crawls in the garden world and kill his brother and so this eliminates something that God said to the snake back in the Garden of Eden what he said to the snake back in chapter 3 it was this he said because you've done this that is deceive Adam and Eve you are more curse than all of the cattle in more than every beast of the field
 on your belly you will go you will eat dust all the days of your life and I'm going to play store set hostility between you and the woman between your seed and her seed he at is the seed of the woman will strike you on the head and you will strike him on the hill so apparently going out of this eating story is going to be Perpetual hostility between the woman and all of your children and Cain is one of those and then between the snake and all of its seed so what does that mean so it makes you think this is going to be about good guys and bad guys and from the woman is going to come to good guy it's going to crush the snake and it see it in from the snake is going to be at see what that mean right like you would imagine the next story being about someone who has to fight a snake again the snake the snake killed Abel Wright
 instead it's a story of a seed of the woman killing a seed of the woman but that she the woman who gives in to the anger. Says what you're doing these are giving into a Croucher yes giving into the cast was getting in another words the riddle of Genesis 3:16 is on purpose ambiguous you have to keep this class this is what we mean when we say the Bible's meditation literature the biblical authors intentionally put ambiguous puzzles
 into the stories and poems to force you to keep reading and they will feed you the clues to the riddle as you keep reading later to go back and reread it again so the Cain and Abel story provides you the key to understand what the riddle means and it's that humans
 can buy their moral choices become the seed of the snake they can become agents of the snake and its desire to reduce the goodness of God's world back into the nothingness from which it emerged this what the stories about this is why the moment that you go on from here the snake never appears explicitly in the rest of the Torah and Prophets like there's no stories in about another snake crawling up in talking to some where are the baby snakes baby snakes and the Cain and Abel story is trying to tell you now it's not like that would be too easy if I totally agree that a repeater comes up and tries to tell Jesus no you don't have to die to become the king of Israel and G
 receive the snake talking to him in his friend you know but you know that's what that's what the story is trying to tell us is that the snake actually your brother can be the snow your brother can beat the snake you yourself can be the snake based on the the voices that you listen to so this is why is you go on throughout the rest of the tour of the prophets the rest of the Hebrew Bible
 when you see bad people compared to snakes and scorpions and dragons and lions this is what's underneath all of that imagery
 okay well that's important because what's underneath here in the story of Cain and Abel is this idea of becoming an agent of the steak and bodying the power of the snake yes more than merely a way to try to understand or explain the horror of someone's actions like to be like me and that was that was bad yeah that was a snaky Thing versus saying like no you're actually becoming under the control of what you pointed out with the king of the Nebuchadnezzar I said he was compared to a snake and you're like actually
 kind of like I don't know how you said it but you were like he becomes an agent of the snake agent of a snake yeah I mean so funny as what comes into my mind were all of the
 James Bond spy movies that my dad has a kid but agents you know it's like whatever the British government spies and their agents of the government the three similar agents of the snake so for example so I'm 58 which I called you from earlier David is describing the people that want to kill him and he describes them some 58 verse 3 The Wicked they are estranged from the womb like they are isolated and unfortunate individuals from the moment they're born they go astray from the belly speaking lies their venom is like the venomous snake
 they're like a death Viper closing its ear to not hear the voice of the Snake Charmer so he's comparing them both their seed from their seeds so to speak but is ratcheting up the rhetoric here so he's describing like an absolute or like Sheva these guys that tried to kill him or take over his kingdom and he describes the snakes Tom 140 Rescue Me O Lord from evil men preserve me from the violent man they devise evil things in their hearts continually stirring up Wars they sharpen their tongues like a serpent poison of a viper is under their lips
 oh that's a good one Psalm 57 my soul is among the Lions I have to lie among those who breathe out fire even the sons of Adam whose teeth are Spears and arrows fire breathing lions
 breathing fire is the things that they know the dragon can do right and in the metaphorical is with the snake does it's like the fire from the snake yeah that's with it lies and it's where in the New Testament where Jesus talks to certain of the religious leaders in Jerusalem he calls them The Brood of vipers and see if I press so not only is the snake at work in the world in voices in our minds that get us to doubt what God has said to lead us to life you mean that's like a more fists like thing called sin yeah that's right yeah these stories are teaching us there's a voice in your mind that is putting ideas in your mind about things that are not good and don't lead the life but you'll do them because you think that they're good even though you should do with your anger you should call your brother your brother is right yeah and so in doing so humans become
 agents of the snake and therefore can be described as dragons and snakes and lions and Chaos creatures and once you have those pieces in place so much of the language of dragons and snakes in the rest of the biblical story will make a lot more sense that's has been my experience
 so they got snake is the cast creature the snake is at work through humans and how is God going to raise up from humans who keep giving into the snake
 a descendent who's going to defeat the snake I have that going to happen the prospects don't look good outside of you and that's the pot conflicted Drive the story forward after story of Cain and Abel so we're going to go from here is just touch down at different biblical stories in the Torah and Prophets where humans become agents of the snake and are depicted with the language and imagery of dragons and this will help us fill out the portrait of the Dragon in the story of the Bible
 pics of listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're talking about the scroll of Exodus with Pharaoh is the seat of the snake and Moses is the seed of the woman there's something about Moses that the narrator wants us to see him as an image of somebody who with God's power can have power over the snake today's episode was brought to bajor podcast team producer Cooper pelts associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor damn Dumbo editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey also mixed this episode and handle Who provided the invitations for annotated podcast in our at all of the music for this series was written and composed by Bible project staff Bible project was scrapped by the nonprofit week this to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us
