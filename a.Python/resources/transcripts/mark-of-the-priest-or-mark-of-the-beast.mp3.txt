this is a question response episode that is at the end of our a series on the royal priesthood as a theme in the Bible then I'm trying to talk to you about people questions yeah here we go this is great news episodes are always fun to hear from listeners and man I'm just always so impressed at the inside inquisitiveness it's great I'm in my basement where you John alright we are remote from each other and I'm in my kind of home office I happen to have gotten a nicer Mike at home and you so I'm actually sounds a lot a lot warmer and closer to to the person listening then you will okay that's good to know just just to let you know I might sound more cold and you might hear my kids dumping upstairs doing whatever they're doing all part of the deal so yeah it's been a great series I think we're going to start with a question from
 in Brazil hi Tim and John this is Tim from Brazil and I'll be following this series on the priests it's great and my question is and what is the relationship between the priests in the Bible and the modern pastors from our church has thank you very much I really practical question and one that makes a lot of sense depending on the context where you've grown up in attending synagogue or church and wondering what's the relationship between priests may be in the Christian tradition but then between priest Pastors in the priests in the Hebrew Bible cuz we don't have anyone who is sacrificing animals in any of these Traditions write or like doing those kind of things there is still a group of us Americans who live north of Jerusalem up in Neenah called the West Bank now and they still actively sacrificed animals specially a Passover be Passover so they have
 Steven alternate Temple they thought the temple wasn't supposed to be in Jerusalem it somewhere else so there an example of a Jewish group or an offshoot from Jewish groups that still has priests sacrificing animals but they are I think the only once but most of us have but some sort of person with it at the pastor or the priest who is elevated to the group and is there a connection between these types of positions and then this whole idea of the of the priests in the in the temple from ancient Israel will find it to the family and Axle family line with the ancestor from Levi and then the priests in particular were to be descended through the line of Aaron so it's a subset within a like a tribal family group so it's a hereditary office the term that you would use then yeah which comes with problems which means that the qualifications for the office don't have to do with
 how good a person you are necessarily it's what family are born in to be like being in the bigger Royal in England royal family run into it that's actually the main difference whereas in both Catholic Orthodox and Protestant different streams of the Christian tradition becoming a priest or Pastor or spiritual leader into one of those offices and all those Traditions it's not something you born into it maybe you know a parent who played that role in the model it for you and so you a spy too bad but it's something that's based on the individual's calling within a community of testing that they're gifted by the spirit for for this purpose that's why the main difference between the Rawls another interesting way to think about it though in the New Testament for example the roles that are given for people to play in the early Messianic Jewish communities or the Gentile commute
 what is there are rules that are described that they kind of well-known like in the gifts of the Spirit passages and Peter and Paul sweaters and you can get an outline hear of the Apostles already thinking through like what makes up for the healthy leadership of a local community and the officer role of priests that is never named in any of those there are others that are named yeah what are what are they there teacher Pastor evangelist Apostle Prophet evangelist Pastor teacher but then Romans or in 1st Peter though it is clear with broader Administration leadership teaching and so on service the seemed more that the roles that people played worried about individual passion gifting and then calling and the community saying this person has been a gifted by the spirit to play this role in our community so that's one way to think about it it's difference this clue not something you're born into
 yeah Paul talks about appointing elders and then there's a category named Deacon which is just the Greek word for Servant Minister and and Paul's letters in particular people in this role it seems mainly related to Axel's actual serving the needs of people who are in need in the community so the absence of priests from that list I think it's just interesting because as we talked about in our conversations John the Priestly language when it is used in the New Testament is applied to Jesus or to all followers of Jesus not to one particular person to roll right so and I think I've tried to say it with you before is that all people follow Jesus our Priestly and away then being a pastor for this question but I guess the same question could be what relation between teachers and Priests of these are way to mediate
 God to others and to the world if everything becomes a Priestly roll and I guess what's the relation between a modern priest and then inches age of the same same thing either one has their own traditions and how the hierarchy works and that kind of stuff how you describe the job titles that use many Traditions will use the title priest about a pastoral leader mediating figure they're all just these are all titles in different Traditions doing slightly different things but the differentiate how one person mediates God compared to how other people are doing it because it seems like in the New Testament there's this belief that we all have different gifts that all work together so that we can that we can do this in and unity and his guests are kind of named and title of the end but they're all Priestly kind of rolls evangelist Pastor teacher administrator
 all of those are different aspects of his Priestly rollouts at John I've never actually quite said it's myself that way but that's a great way of putting it and and all of that because it's a universal office so to speak or a roll of all followers of Jesus that's one main distinction between that and the priesthood of the Levites & Sons of Erin in them in the Hebrew Bible so saying thank you for the great question and it leads to really like the whole Theology of the priesthood of all followers of Jesus in the New Testaments pretty cool here's a question from Carlos item and John my name is Carlos and then from Winston-Salem North Carolina you mentioned the way that Moses face glowed as he stood in the gap for Aaron and the connection to the Transfiguration is this all supposed to connect back to the embodiment of God as His Image or sell them or seems like the burning bush thank you for inviting us into the fruit of your hard work
 so yeah there's that idea of being the image of God Carlos is mentioning he's the Hebrew word they're the story of Moses coming down from the mountain having encountered this image of the royal priests and the blueprints of the Tabernacle and he's glowing and his face is glowing I just connected to being an image and was going to pay the question is it connected to the burning bush glowing like the gold star Carlos for making those connections you're totally on on the right Trail you know there's so many things John you and I talking about these things over the course of years is inevitably we'd bring up stuff we've already talked about but after you think about this literature more it always shows you new things and so you don't you notice anything so I'll try this out this is something that I'm pondering and Genesis one as if I haven't pondered Genesis 1 enough
 remember those this symmetry between after God creates the three Realms the waters and then the land and then he feels the three rounds with inhabitants you have the rulers of the lights the sun in the great light small light in the stars and those are shining and they're shining and they are the rulers above and they're called symbols signs then you get matching them are the rulers below who are called the image and they're not shining pretty much not shining cuz they come from the dirt but there is this analogy between them that is explored in Psalm 8 which we've talked about and made a video about where God Elevate the rulers below to this exalted position is so surprising given their dirty origin to be exhausted even over the Spiritual Beings and the rulers above so just if you have that set of Aunt Connections in your mind when you start developing the store
 free of an idealized human who exist in a heaven and Earth space and you start highlighting like what Moses see is a shining garments to me all of a sudden that connection becomes much more clear that this exalted idealized human taking on the traits of the rulers above because they have authority over all creation so when Moses is on Mount Sinai the first time with Carlos you talkin about the burning bush he sees the angel the messenger of Yahweh in the bush and the bush is lit up with fire and light but then the figure who's in the bush talks as if that figure is Yahweh we did this in the gods Series so the idea of a humanoid looking figure in the Sacred Space who's emitting fire and light and that that's the one Moses to see him then he goes back up on the mountain for the you know
 cloud in the fire shows up with all the people and he is seeing yet again on the top of the mountain another vision of a human figure whose lit up and Shining but it's to be a human who goes in and out of the Tabernacle on the heaven under space so Carlos that's the connection you're making and I think you're right I think that's exactly the connection was supposed to make which tells us that the high priest when he's wearing all these glittery Jewels he is a physical image of the one that Moses met on the mountain who is the image being ideally describe for us in Genesis one but it's the image that no human really ends up being except for this moment where Moses His Face gloves and that's why I think you and I love the storage on is because it's this moment we're human becomes so close to embodying the character of gods that he starts to take on aspects of God's glowing Glory so cool which was the point of being damaged totally that's right and I think
 how to me a while ago that this is what the Apostle Paul reflects on when he flipping errands to do everything without grumbling or arguing so you may become blameless and fewer children of God without faults and a warped and cook a generation and then you will shine among them like stars in the sky and it that's it is the product of somebody who knows how to read the Hebrew Bible ever you can see that humans when they are fulfilling their ideal role they look like stars he's speaking metaphorically well yeah what's the other passages in the Corinthians one of the books of to the Corinthians where he is kind of waxing on about the resurrection body yeah that's right yeah your talks about how God's light is exhibiting from him like Candlelight exudes out of a cracked pot and he's like he has a pot breaking down but the light
 I've got the love and life that shining and me through the Messiah yeah that's that's that's going to live on forever and give birth to a whole new body transformed body so quick you know what Carlos you making the right connection that the image of God the Stars the high priest what Moses is doing and then ultimately than what that story about Jesus's transformation on the mountain in the Transfiguration with the disciples this is moment where his the disciples see Jesus for who he truly is here one moment my son is what's interact with me through the basement window
 Lego sets not building out and working out I'm so sorry buddy Lego sets not working out about that so you're saying Carlos and then even show how the connections you can go back to Genesis one with the Stars in the rulers above and below the soil set of connections is really basic to the biblical story questions from Gina hi John and Tim my name is Gina and I'm calling from San Miguel California I was wondering is there a relationship between the engraving of yahweh's Holiness on the plate of the priests serving in Exodus 3930 on errands for her and in Revelation chapter is 7 and 22 and is there also a counter relationship with the mark of the beast thanks guys so much for all that you do
 yeah people listening along are really smart you're like way smarter than me Bible sleuth, yeah so good yeah gold star Jena so Crown thing going on in the high priest League clothing passages in Exodus is really interesting so you noticed it's it's called a plate in Exodus 28 The Exodus interesting one is look that up just to remind myself the Hebrew word is which is also the same word as like a blossom and so it's a really rare word that seems to refer to some kind of Medallion type black its exact shape doesn't really describe here but then later on Gina in Exodus 29 in the the ritual of ordaining Aaron and his sons at to become priests that same thing on his head the gold
 saying that says belonging to Yahweh it's also called a crown the Hebrew word for Crown while which is nether it's a guy walking around with a plaque on his head saying I belong to you that way if that's what the phrase means but he looks like a shining figure but we're just talking about and he's wearing a crown he looks like a King glowing shining King written on his forehead belonging to your way and then he's carrying these Jewels the twelve jewels that represent all of the tribes of Israel he's a walking talking Israel image is an image of Israel will have the image of humanity which is an image of God it's really specific that these words belong to the alleyway written on the forehead so what school is that in the Shema prayer hear o Israel you always Are God Alone
 but then right after the description of the Shawarma whichever Israelite was to say and every Israelite did say it morning and night it said that as you say the Shema and you write out the commands it says they are to be the commands of the Torah are to become a symbol on your hand and something total vote between your eyes on your forehead so it's like you where the Torah commands on your hands on your forehead and this is you know the origin of those the leather straps phylacteries or some Jewish Traditions you know they wear on their hands on their forehead like I made you do one time when we are in Jerusalem's the Shema in Hebrew of having God's commands written on your hand and forehead it's as if every Israelite is doing and that act what the priest is in the temple actually doing embodied which is how
 their allegiance and a Blog and Yahweh written on this plaque on the forehead yeah so there's a connection between the priest and what's on his forehead between every Israelite saying the Shema sing the commands are on on my forehead and then there's also one more link Gina where the in Ezekiel chapter 9 is he kills having this Vision he's been transported in a dream out of Babylonian exile over to Jerusalem and he's cruising around the Jerusalem Temple but like in this Vision dream wish I could read this story it's really interesting because he says at the beginning he says the spirit picked me up by my teeth by by the locks of hair on my head and he says and I went in between the skies in the land in between Earth and Heaven
 not interesting phrase yeah that is interesting where would that be exactly the reasons a vision he's in the dimensional space the biblical cosmology it's his way of saying another dimension Iraq fully on the earth round yeah I wasn't I wasn't in this guy I was in between them yeah he didn't know about the ozone layer and what he sees is Babylons about to come and destroy the city but he sees God's Messengers marking this handful of people in the city with with the X on their forehead anybody who is just grieved about the idolatry happening in Jerusalem and they'll be spared and so this is a whole set of network of things being written or marked on the forehead of the high priest you have people saying smile you have these grieving Israelites who don't participate and idolatry and I think John and the Revelation when he talks about the people whose God
 God's name or Mark is on their forehead John's activating all of those with the symbols of God's servants have his mark on their forehead which is a counter to the mark of the beast fancy Mark the ante Mark yeah it's a good example of how John in the Revelation he's having his own in Between Heaven under a six. Yeah but you this guy's mind is so saturated in the Hebrew Bible that his Visions are themselves amalgamations of all these design pattern length from the Hebrew Bible and so anyway great job Gina such a good connection and then I just want to add a few more things in the mix there but that's pretty cool that is cool here's a question from Timothy Hay Tim and John this is Tim Roberts from Tyler Texas in 1st Samuel 21 while David was fleeing from Saul David was given the sacred bread a presence to eat
 Jesus said in Matthew 12 that that's was not lawful for David and his men to eat this bread so my question is why didn't God discipline David for breaking this law is it because God saw David as an anointed priest thanks I'm loving this series Tyler Texas that sounds familiar we've had a Tyler Texas before yeah okay so what's a question about a story in life of David but the reason why most Christians know about the story is because Jesus brings up the story in the one of this conflicts with the Pharisees about working on the Sabbath right Jesus and number of times got in trouble about how he dealt with the Sabbath in the day of the week that is marked as the day of rest God created in Six Days on the 7th Day and turd creation and and rested and then this became a very important symbol
 except Jewish people apart as followers of God and as far as His Image so Jesus as a Jewish man had been erected with the Sabbath how do you rest on the Sabbath what does that mean and he had a lot to say about that so going through and picking and doing some little on-the-spot grain processing you know cuz he got separated the scene from the chaff mean you're on a walk from Grand there you can pluck it pull it apart pop it in the snack snack but it is technically the way the traditional developed there's nothing technically about like don't process Grain on the Sabbath there's no law for that in the Torah but there's actually almost no explicit clarifications of what work what is defined as work in the Torah Torah says don't work on the Sabbath for Israelites but the only concrete explicit example that's given
 is don't light a fire and then the rest of them just talk generally about work or labor in terms of the laws the 613 commands so four generations typical Jewish Scholars developed portrait of like what what what defines work and grain processing was on the list and that makes actually makes a lot of sense yeah it's one of those like most obvious things that you're going to be working towards is a harvesting the field on the six days to go do that and there's one day where you say Yahweh is the king of all creation you know he is the ultimate provider for me from that field not just my little labor got calls me to labor but my existence of some kind of my labor so it's a good thing and Jesus doesn't think the Sabbath is bad news it's like it's legalistic to follow it there's something else Happening Here in the story so he's out there and he and his crew or picking G so they say hey like your
 violating the way that we all honor the Sabbath what's this about and so his answer is not have you read the Bible answer man to tell the story about David and there was this time where David was the Jesus quotes just a few little bits of the story and as always he assumes you've got the whole thing in your mind so this is the moment David's wife or he is running first running for his life from Saw who has become his enemy and made very clear he wants to assassinate David so the leaders of Israel want to assassinate David who has already been anointed as the real king of Israel and David storyline Dave is already at the actual Kang like in private he's been anointed but he's waiting for God to exalt him as the publicly recognized king of Israel in the meantime the publicly recognized king of Israel trying to kill him that's actually important for the analogy that Jesus is sitting up here
 so what David did was he didn't have any gear or food or any weapons so we goes to this Shrine and I he meets with the priest there any any ask the priest like do you have anything to eat and the priest says would know nothing except the Sabbath bread actually he said nothing except you know the bread I so he makes the Sabbath bread available to David and the Sabbath bread is this the bread that was described in Exodus and then Leviticus it's these loaves of bread that were symbolically placed inside the tent the Tabernacle and there were twelve loaves representing the tribes of Israel it says if it's an image of Yahweh providing food for his people and then Israel constantly sitting before the presence of Yahweh that bread is changed out every Sabbath day so what this means is David is fleeing on the Sabbath if you get the access to the bread the only way you get access to that bread this wind is being replaced on the Sabbath it's the day off
 yeah we call we called David just east of the bread the priest gives it to him and he takes it and what is paying attention to that was technically not legal according to the laws of Moses when you're done with that bread it gets switched out what's supposed to happen to it you put it away the priests can eat it but it's sacred holy food it doesn't belong it's not a snack for David and his toilet it doesn't belong to the to the Common People the whole point is to honor the sanctity in the Holiness of this bread and so what Jesus then is noting is like not only did he like go get the bread and the priest gave it to him but God was cool with it like it there's no sign in the narrative that this was a wrong thing for him to do so this is what your noting Tim even though Jesus says he violated the law of Moses the story doesn't like paint David in bad terms for his behavior Jesus says it was the right thing for him to do
 or it was David was authorized to do that why would he be authorized to do that and this is what we are looking at in the story of David he's presented throughout his character as a person in whom the role of Ideal priest and King are unified which is why he can also later go dress up as the priest when he ushers the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem and the god is so pleased with that in the next chapter after that God makes in Eternal Covenant that David's line will produce the Messiah so Jesus the saying in the same way I am a priest yes and me and my crew would get to participate in these Priestly things if you want to see it and believe that Jesus is putting himself in the place of David the Royal priest but then also it makes your mind to ponder the whole story of David is David is the ultimate Royal priest and it's his right to receive the holy food
 is the represents Israel all of a sudden that paints Jesus and his followers in this field this Israelite field in these really exhausted terms or he's presenting himself as someone like David the Royal priest and then the job the implicit job is this he's painting the Pharisees in the role of saw the illegitimate ruler of Israel who is persecuting the true leader of Israel but who isn't going to seize power he's going to let God exalt him all kinds of cool Connections in the story so it was a New Testaments call Nicholas parent who has a wonderful book called Jesus the priest or he's tracing through a lot of these Royal Priestly design patterns in the gospels and the he has a great treatment on the story that really opened my eyes to a bunch of cool things going on here from Ohio
 I love your podcast my question today is about the connection between 1st Samuel 2 and numbers 25 and 1st Samuel to you guys talked a bit about how God quote unquote canceled the promise that he made to the political priesthood Falcon number 25 the failures of this priesthood I get why God chose to do this but at the same time I was hoping you could talk a bit more about what were the make of the fact that God did break a promise here how do we hold this promise breaking alongside what we know to be true about God in that he's a covenant keeper okay so I can you do you drew attention to this I also Drew attention to it but you kind of flagged it and we're like it's interesting this is where Eli who's the high priest of Israel at the time when Samuel was born he's not a good person and his sons are really not good people but there's a Priestly leaders of Israel and so God sends this Anonymous prophets say you do
 before in the past I said you would walk before me forever and be my priest but now I say you're going down oh I'm going to chop off your arm metaphorically I'm going to take out your strength and your power to take it down and raise up a new priest yeah well I think she she has too well liked is that oops he's moment forgot I mean there's a bit of this and other narratives to I suppose it's this constant tension of all way back to the flood of like created humans to be in my image okay not working out till the land and multiply and they fill the land with violence and bloodshed and violence and bloodshed and so yeah I think I might suggest that we frame it is God canceling his promise and purpose as such or is that he's actually responding to the failure of the people that he invited to participate in that purpose
 and promised forgot to cancel the promised we'd be to say you know what I'm just kind of done raising up humans I've done with you I'm done with humans and I'm done and I'm done with Israel yep see you guys and then it would case the universe and clothes with with Moses right but I'm going to start over with you that's so you wasn't done with Israel but he was done with that crew that's in the flood narrative represents I'm done with humans while but there's this one that's just pretty good and so I'm not done with your man's so you know what God says is I promise to your house house the families of House of Arryn the you would walk before me forever you have blown it so now you you lost a job but then what God says is I'm going to raise up a faithful priest for myself and a faithful house that will walk before me forever so what God's changing is not the promise but who will get to participate in the promise
 so you can still wear the badge yeah yeah so it's not the gun is breaking a promise it's the he's going to withdraw and someone out you blew it okay then I'm going to call someone else up for that so I don't know does that technically breaking a promise it's changing who's able to participate in it I guess if the promise was specific to the line of Aaron and his house that was a promise your house and it kind of sounds that way your house will cause of raised will stand forever but if by that you mean the vocation of a Priestly house yeah yeah but then that continues correct just promise there Perpetual house to the Levites or to Aaron is actually brought up in the book of Jeremiah to where God promises in Eternal house to Levi and to David This Promise is brought up again this is the part of the way I think that the Messianic hope develops through the storyline of the Hebrew Bible it's god-awful
 each generation a chance to be faithful to him some generations do bad or something worse but ultimately it's what drives you forward through the narrative progression and what really begin to strike you generation after generation is not God breaking his promise but that he keeps making it available to each generation you know going on all over the centuries so in that sense that's what the biblical authors are after when they're talking about God is the Eternal Covenant keeper the keeper of his promises but who gets to participate in those promises is very much it's not a unilateral thing what God's doing it's a genuine partnership and so people can disqualify themselves from the promise in which case what God offered them is now off the table so if God said you I'll listen if you do this you will have somebody for me be before me forever you didn't do that so you lost the chance the promise is not offered to somebody else this is what happens with Wilderness generation
 it's a repeating seem so and it's what happens with soft in fact I think the next question is going to be about King Saul becomes before King David but it's the same actually design pattern working itself out what would you call this design pattern the it's the test it's the Tas yeah it's people failing the test this is the design pattern of failing the test when people fail the test what God said he would make available to them as withdrawn and then offered to someone else who the Next Generation that's the motif and you can see in the New Testament letters the apostles and teachers thinking about this about take this seriously interesting that it's at kind of conditional nature of the promise that any generation can lose it it's what drives you forward then that's what the New Testament authors are trying to show in Jesus he's the human image of God who finally didn't fail the test right and so going forward from Jesus there's just interesting
 we're like if you're in Jesus if you won't fail either totally yeah but as a human you will fail and you're going to fail and take us seriously and I don't fail that's right but but even your own failures can't undo what Jesus did on behalf of you and your failures and so this is the Romans 8:28 thing you know nothing can separate us from the love of the Messiah not even death not even our own failures that lead to death can separate us from the love of the Messiah but then Paul still will want to keep this failure of the test he doesn't want us to lose all its punch the like in 1st Corinthians 10 he'll use the Wilderness generation the war in the Corinthians to stop excluding the four in their celebration of the Lord's supper and so he warns them he thinks it's generation and he says ya don't fail the test you. You really don't want to take that off and fail the test that way
 questions but God has the freedom to withdraw a promise and offer it to someone else when it's people fail him and you know a thing about this this also occurs in one of the letters are in the seven letters in the Revelation where there's a church I forget which one it is but Jesus says I'll take away your lampstand if you don't like start representing me to the world Faithfully I'll come and take away your lampstand which is a vivid image of like reflecting God's light into the world so and that's for a whole church Community I don't know that's terrifying to bring it's actually pretty sobering issue but hope it's a it's a legitimate one and I hope that helps bring a little perspective but that's at least helped me kind of angle on that question over time all right one last question and this is from Aaron in the Netherlands
 hi guys my name is Aaron and I'm from the Netherlands and book A series you talk about David taking up their Royal Priestly roll up until I sat down to Olive that she packed I was wondering where is all fits into this picture especially regarding 1st Samuel 13 where our soul makes an offering to God because he was tired of waiting on Samuel which would seem to fit in perfectly with the Royal Priestly roll but instead it is a moment as Samuel at previously told Saul to wait for him why did Samuel not allowed Saul to offer a sacrifice or in other words for B is Saul and not allowed to take up the Royal birth control thanks for all that you do you've been a huge blessing
 answer my question who you were talking earlier about how David gets to do these Priestly things and God was cool with it saw does a Priestly Duty and it was not cool man the song narrative is so awesome so the story of Saul's offering there's a lot of actually complex details in the story a lot of the details are weird actually because they're glowing hyperlinks back to all these things going on in the golden calf story and also in the story of achan in Joshua chapter 6 and 7 essentially from the beginning even the the reason why I saw was proposed as king of Israel is because of the people's desire to have a king like all the other nations even though the origin of Saul's kingship is in the idolatrous desire of the people to have a human image as their King instead of
 damaged collectively instead of being God's image and having Gods as their King cuz that's what Samuel who's kind of their Priestly Prophet leader now the definitely not a king and a Samuels ticked off because he's like I said you can cuz he rescued you out of you know Egypt and you've never had a human king and you don't need one but the people demand one so that already sets us off into the story of Saul so suspicious that you know that human nature is at work here so when you get to the story of Saul being announced as the king of Israel Ted so does all of these hyperlinks that are portraying saw as the golden calf it's really cool as an idol he has become Israel's Idol we don't want to worship Yahweh we're going to worship song and then he then he becomes the like in you know a new human a new Adam figure out who's going to have his own series of tests of whether he'll be faithful to God or not and this is
 so Aaron you're right it is the moment he's supposed to go kind of steak an outpost for a battle with the Philistines and then wait 7 days and on the seventh day Samuel's going to come and he says all offer a sacrifice pray to God on your behalf and then you go fight the Philistines and so Sol's there and them in the narrative really focus is in the sauce sees the Philistines gathering for war he says his people start hiding think of Eden story The People start hiding themselves in caves and in rocks and he sees the people starting to scatter and he freaks out and Samuels not coming and so he doesn't wait and he offers to sacrifice even though it seems like incidental like the sacrifice but the whole narrative is that this was a test of trust that God will deliver them in his own time and it's all takes the reins and so then Samuel comes up and he's just like why didn't you keep God's command oh actually no Wednesday
 real shows up he says to solve what God Said to Adam and Eve its board for what he says what is this that you have done and lots of Eden hyperlinks there so it seems like the problem wasn't saw offering a sacrifice because that is taking up a Priestly roll the sacrifice is like his test moment is history of knowing good and bad test and he failed whereas David passes I mean he goes against the Philistines and is full of faith and trust and he becomes more and more of the idea of Roy priest up until the David Bathsheba moment so anyways it's an interesting contrast we really should spend more time in the stall and David store is one day yeah I'd like to get it is interesting that out of all the August conversation we've had throughout the years it's all in the Torah generally and even there it's like really focused in on Genesis and there's
 play a part of Genesis and my understanding of all the narratives gets more and more blurry as a story of missing you know like here we are in the book of 1st Samuel and the story of Saul is all being modeled and mapped onto earlier stories but that all roads lead back to the Eden story which is why Samuel says to Saul exactly what God Said to Adam and Eve cuz it's just human nature doesn't actually change very much a pair of life we slept in the story hey one other note is I probably the most repeated seeing and all of our questions we didn't even talk about okay which is about Melchizedek any questions about milk is a deck we are not trying to be responsible we're actually going to go if we're going to do you one better everybody we're going to have two episodes on milk is a deck after this one with two others
 Hebrew Bible scholars or Bible scholar Joshua Matthews and then Amy peeler and both of them have focused on parts of the Bible where milk is a deck plays a big role Amy in the letter to the Hebrews and Joshua in the Torah Psalms so will take a deep dive on the kids back in the next couple weeks here cool and then also in the next coming weeks we're going to start releasing these videos on the Royal priest and we decided unlike what we normally do which is a long conversation like this will get boiled down into one video we decided to series of videos and there's six in total and I think it would be a really great Series yeah yeah real time which is like we're in early April 2021 the first episode of the series on the priests in its Priests of Eden looking at
 Adam and Eve are increasingly figures Priestly figures and then that will continue into a second episode that'll come out in June on Abraham story and milk is it back yet and him and Isaac and some pretty sick stuff happening there and that that series will continue through the summer and will actually get through the whole series by this fall and that'll be done and that's really sad so thank you everyone for your questions you are also incredibly smart and it's cool to see an act with this content and Bible project will wear on her to do this because a lot of people are are supporting this so that we can make these videos have these conversations and and then we get to give it all away for free because it's already paid for by people like you thank you so much for nonprofit Portland Oregon we believe the Bible is Unified story that least Jesus has all these resources are two that tend to experience the Bible
