where does series about sea dragons in the Bible that symbol chaos and destruction in our last episode we talked about how humans can become creatures like the snake of Genesis 3:8 it's chaos and disorder in the world and today we're going to look at a human who's straight up is called a sea dragon by the prophet that is the pharaoh of Egypt who enslaved Israel in the scroll of Exodus the stories about him are designed compare him to the snake at Genesis 3 the idea that their lives are made bitter with harsh enslavement thematically snacks to working the ground in grief and pain and also their enslavement of odd is happening in the field which is where the snake came from like the snake drag them out of the garden in to his demands were there doing the work in the enslavement to the ground snake who was the promised seed of the woman who will come to confront the snake
 Todd is depicted as raising up Moses as a new deliver for the people the word salvation and deliverance is introduced in this door if that's the sad thing is flights from Egypt and Moses that the key figure in if there is an analogy between farro and the snake that makes Moses something like a new Adam the first thing God teaches Moses to do is to turn his staff into a snake there's something about Moses that the narrator wants us to see him as an image of somebody who with God's power and how counter the forces of death and Chaos today Tim Mackie and I talked about the theme of the chaos dragon in the scroll of Exodus I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us
 hey John hello hello hey what time we talking about chaos and dragons and sea serpents in the Bible and sea serpents and you're going to give a little summary of Where we've been a package it up Clarity when I was on a run this weekend I was like processing the conversations we have had and I think some things became clearer to me so recall how we started our Reflections which is on the dark chaos Waters in the second sentence of the Bible in the beginning God created the sky and the land cool great when how where why and then the Story begins and the land now the way I do you should know the beginning State Recreation state was
 wild and waste Darkness was over the surface of the abysmal Deep cast Waters Darkness was over the abyss Dark Souls 2 images out of a empty uninhabited on ordered realm and that of a dark chaotic ocean so that's the beginning of the 7-Day narrative when you turn to the beginning of the second story in the Bible which begins in Genesis 2 verse 4 it's the Garden of Eden story and they're you also begin with a lifeless on order chaos realm which is the desert so not the waters with the desert with the desert the one is too much water when is not enough water. So these are complementary images of non creation what we think of as like contradictory ocean ocean versus a Wilderness but on the symbolic level they are
 tentacle and I'll just look back to our cosmology series it we did some years back in the podcast and these were the two most common ancient near Eastern ways of describing the pre-creation state of chaos so what's important is that this is not chaos is not God's rifle in the Bible chaotic powers are the Rival of the most important gods in the ancient near East in Egypt you know whatever God happens to be in charge of the sun god or the sky God has to battle the darkness in the night like every day in Babylon and Canaanite mythology and someone however the unique condition of biblical authors is that God is
 like God's being is primary reality which is life in order and goodness and so the chaos is not God's rival but it is the Rival of creation meaning creation is something that doesn't have to exist and this is The Logical conclusion cuz everything around us is constantly disintegrating and going back into disorder and nothingness conditional conditional yeah its existence is conditioned upon something more powerful than it and that it in the claim of the closet is God who just is so the chaos is the Rival of creation and so this is why at the end of the Bible you have to do away with the ocean and you have to do away with Darkness okay and why the Garden City of the garden and not a Wilderness so chaos is the opposite of create
 then will you get introduced and he's opening stories in the 7-Day narrative and and the Eden narrative are inhabitants of the chaos realm but there are creatures they have the stars in the dark in the night time and then in the waters the two things that represent chaos darkness and Waters there are creatures there that God puts stars and then the sea dragons on day 5 and we're told that they're good they're not bad they're good then in the beginning of the Garden of Eden story you told about a snake that's a one of the beasts of the field that God made it's a good so whatever these creatures are they began in the biblical story that's good
 and that's important because for the biblical authors is it exists it's God's creation which means that it's good now creation can of course set itself on the trajectory back into chaos and death and disorder but that's not because the stars were the sea dragon or the snake are in their Essence evil or bad and so I think what we're seeing in the Garden of Eden story
 is a depiction of the fall of two types of creatures for the failure of two types of creatures to become what they truly are you have both the failure of this land creature that crawls threat the snake and it uses its god-given craftiness wish rudeness towards its own deceptive and then there's some backstory as I know why is that creature doing that and that's that's filled out later and dip their hints given in the narrative but it's filled out later in the biblical story primarily the focus is on the human Folly in failure
 so what happens then is that both humans and the snake become agents of chaos and disorder another words they can make choices that are opposed to the will of God which is to bring about Gardens in life and community and so the snake and the humans become agents whose choices drag creation back into chaos and disorder when were talking about the Sea Dragon the biblical authors have a unique view of the sea dragon that stands out in if they're ancient near Eastern context cuz in all the other dragon slaying mythologies of Israel's neighbors the Sea Dragon is the Rival of the storm God and is essentially evil and chaos and that's not how the biblical authors depict the sea dragon or the stars or the snake which all become emerged that just became an important distinction in my mind the Rivalry
 distinction who is W rival and then also that the nature of the Sea Dragon is that of a creature who like humans has embraced its own ruin and has become an agent of chaos and through its choices but not it's not of its nature evil any more than humans have an evil nature so we're coming into the team focused on the idea of a dragon but then quickly that get this connected to all sorts of other creatures that are also depicted as chaos creatures yes yeah snakes and scorpions and even lying and even Lions yeah but then it also gets us into a much broader category of just what does it mean to be a creature in Rebellion against God and then we've got not just the dragons but we've got the Elohim the Stars that's why they were also could be in Rebellion but then those two ideas getting emerged in a way where it will reduce this
 take it's this creature I mean we don't learn this in that story but we talked about this little mysteries in that story yeah but it's a creature who we learn is an Elohim who decides I don't I don't like my place yeah he'll certainly saw it that way because I'm that way back and lots of other second temple literature is even more with it it's an Australians get merge between these kind of what we would call fantasy creatures and let's not get into that beginner dragons and sea serpents and stuff and then these Angelic beings but then it also merges into the idea and we talked about this with cane is that you can become humans humans can be embodied agents of exactly so the dragon or the snake becomes an agent of Chaos
 in the Agents of chaos is like the broadest there to talk about his name yeah that's right but the way you become an agent of chaos is by turning away from God's goodness and wisdom in word and to be an agent of chaos is make yourself a rival to God but not in the sense that like you could actually really put up an actual fight against God but in the biblical imagination in that you are fighting against creation yeah that's right God is procreation like he want creation to win and so in that way your arrival against God that's right but being against what God wants to have exist in the world and embedded into that is this mystery of why does God allow for anything to fight against creation that's right and I guess we're not really getting into that the problem of evil I suppose no no I think more we're just trying to understand the nature
 of these characters associated with what we call evil do but I think it's really important to recognize that these creatures stars and sea dragons and the snake the way their first introduced is as good part of God's good creation however however they are placed in the realm which was separated from what was good at the darkness the darkness he bought if ya see it threatened those were called good those are separated and it was the light that was called good metal and that was called you got it so the creatures are put in a realm that's like not explicitly call the bad but it's separated something could be good or it why I think it's a hint towards the role showing an awareness of the role these creatures are going to play as the story unfolds
 but it's important also that it's a balanced view they are in the Realms of chaos and disorder and we know that they're going to represent chaos and disorder as the story unfolds but the bill cause he wants to make a very important philosophical theological statement about the nature of God in the nature of creation is it exists it is in its Essence good and if it has become an agent of chaos it's because of the choices made to decline away from its essential god-given nature which is to be good if it exists it's good that's one of the clear conclusions of Genesis chapter one that doesn't mean we'll stay good but it is designed for good which is why in Isaiah the prophet its vision of the new creation Mike and Isaiah chapter 11 but even the snakes are redeemed because babies play with them and the lions are there
 remember Darkness exactly the significance of that will become more important for somebody other than myself if we keep talking but somehow I felt important for me to say that to myself at this point in the conversation and those creatures specifically the Angels they can be good and they are often good and they aligned with God and we don't get stories of like sea serpent said yeah and I think they're it's just it's an image well you get three places there's also two Psalms where the Sea Dragon is called upon to praise God. Where is described as God's rubber ducky play in the ocean that's one way of minimizing right or dethroning or showing the sea serpent and it's good condition and that that is one of the Dragon taming strategies of the bill kalathas is to stay in its Essence it's a part of God's good creation but in another Dragon taming strategy does a Biggby Coffee
 loving you is this just to talk about. Smashing its head and that's leaning into the cultural mythology that was widespread and as we're going to see in the store were going to focus on today it's a human stat on an LG to the Dragon and also to cane so what we also focus on the story of can is important after the introduction of the snake is that humans can become agents of the Dragon who has become an agent of chaos making humans agents yes to the story of pharaoh and The Exodus story and find out how the biblical narrator is giving us many many cues the Pharaoh has become a new can that is the new agents of the snake and therefore a nation
 okay we have looked at Exodus chapter one that many times in different podcast series that we've done so I just want to set the scene and draw attention to a couple details in this well-known story so the exit a scroll begins with a summary of the 70 descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt at the end of Genesis where the famine food shortage Joseph was down there about food and they went down there as well so that's how the story begins then we're told that all the generation that was alive at the end of Genesis does a census of Exodus
 but despite that tragic death were told in Exodus 147 the sons of Israel were fruitful and they swarmed and they multiplied and became very very strong and the land was filled with them as the language of Genesis 1
 so what happens if a new king arises over Egypt in the in the future cuz this King didn't even know who Joseph was
 and so this King looks at this thriving multiplying immigrant population in his land that's gaining a lot of cultural influence whatever become strong represents some degree of favor abundance power and it freaks him out
 so he says what the people of Israel have become more multiplied and stronger than us come let us act skillfully with them or else they will multiply and when War happens they'll add themselves to our enemies and make war with us and go up out of our land and a worst-case scenario by a surviving yes I mean I suppose if you're just trying this is not popular to try and think and pathetically was ancient tyrants but if you try you can imagine the train of thought Ray could lead somebody to this conclusion but it certainly not the only way he could do the situation we are to give you his allies so what's interesting here in our firstborn podcast series we explored the scary story and how it's set on analogy to the story of Cain and Abel Cain looking upon the Divine favor
 blessing upon another and not that poses you know the face of them with a choice but that also the Cain and Abel story made us look back at the story of the snake and Adam and Eve and asked him what was going on with the snake that the snake felt like he needed to check the humans and Dethrone them
 and this is how the Hebrew Bible's meditation literature works so that little verb let us act skillfully with them they're worried it's the verb, which is the route of the Hebrew now I'm full, which is in profits we wise wisdom yeah it's not the word Autumn the two used in Genesis 3 of the snake the return the crafty drafty or shrewd so it's not a Verbatim hyperlink but it's a somatic connection it's the wisdom are we going to see you this is classic he revival-style as you go on from the story The narrator's going to give you more and more clues that this is a sneaky move in a snaky word in the guys because wisdom is a good thing just like craftiness or shrewdness for the snake is a not a negative word Brantley you can be good or bad with your shirt this you can be good or bad with your wisdom
 so he makes a bad choice he chooses to enslave and oppress them he makes them start mass-producing brick-and-mortar and enslaves them in the field and with brutality to build storage cities for Farrow the field where it came from Slade Abel where the snakes live a little quick study how Hebrew vocabulary in hyperlinking works in the Garden of Eden you were introduced the snake was more crafty than any animal of the field
 the snake pulls his move and what we're told is that because the humans listen to the snake that the ground is cursed on account of you humans Genesis 3:17 in grief you will eat from it all the days of your life thorns and thistles the ground will Sprout for you and you will eat the plants of the field and Yahweh Elohim sent the human out to work the ground from which he was taking saw this you're going to go outside the garden back to that desolate Wilderness work that's called the field and your life will turn to death and be full of grief
 yeah then you died I just enslave her to slave to the ground
 yeah and the end then the image that you probably got an Asian person is imagining than being a laborer and someone's field yes that's right just what a brutal life in a day after day just chilling and working hard No Rest yeah your body is being broken down until you die so these exact words are being activated in Exodus 1 when Pharaoh Enslaved the sons of Israel that is the same word as the word in the Eden story to work the ground though, but the idea that their lives are made bitter with harsh enslavement thematically connect to working the ground in grief and in pain and also their enslavement there of odd is happening in the field which is where the snake came from like the snake drag him out of the garden into his domain his domain
 where they're doing the work in the enslavement to the ground so all of that network of words is being activated next to this one and also the building of cities with brick-and-mortar has only happened one other time in the biblical story and that's in the building of the city of Babylon so the story takes the first kind of failure and Folly story of Genesis 1 through 11 in the garden store and then takes the last failure and fawley story of Genesis 11 with your book ends around that first movement of Genesis and it we've the language together in the story and it's the city that is Bill out in the wilderness yeah that's right and yeah that the humans make or I'll just come let us be wise to let them build cities with brick and mortar this is the language of the city of nimrod the king of Babylon
 Ferrell is being set on an LG to the snake also to Kane who brings about death in the field and also to Nimrod who are both agents are the snake yeah yeah well I guess nimrods not explicitly said that I was thinking of a condenser oh I see yeah but it's kind of like a pro do Nebuchadnezzar anyway so yeah that's the setup here so with a few quick brushstrokes the narrator of Exodus wants us to see that Pharaoh is a bigger badder snake cane Nimrod and he's unleashing death on a scale that we haven't done in the biblical story so far at least buy at the hands of humans we haven't seen any enslavement 3 miles apart well I mean there are slaves mentioned in the book of Exodus but in terms of the Genesis even you know people group
 making them prisoners for forced labor on to death. That's this is a new picture or a new low in the human human story
 capsicum there fast forward God raises up a delivery through the waters who's floats along an arc little boy that boy grows up in the house of pharaoh but eventually murders in Egyptian then you have to flee into Exile just like came and got spares his life and God Appears to Moses four years later in the famous burning bush story and he says go back to your people and Faro and tell Farrell to let my people go so Moses has five injections
 this Indian God have a long argument about whether or not he's going to do it and the third Central objection to the center of the five begins this way Moses in Exodus chapter 4 what is the people don't consider me trustworthy or listen to my voice and say hasn't appeared to you and then you always said to him well what's that in your hand Moses and he said it's a staff a shepherd and God said on the ground and so he threw it to the ground and it became an Akash
 snake snake and Moses ran away from the snake which is what your body automatically does fries or that's right we talked about this earlier in the series a different snake encounters that we've had although you didn't run you learn Tata so you always said to Moses send out your hand grabbed it by its tail yeah I know I'll see that it's had its fill loose it look just yeah whip around and yet I have you but he sent out his hand and he grabbed it and it turned back into a staff in this bomb
 how did this guy has power over the snake and a lot of face which is funny because he said what is the people don't trust me and I can actually and here he does trust God I'm just imagining like reaching out and grabbing a snake by the tail the bad idea God ask Moses to put his life in danger and so now he realizes like oh the snake than thing I was my whole body was telling me to fear I have power over that's right yeah because of obviously like God did something cuz I've got the power now in this story was interesting is that God is depicted as raising up Moses as a new deliver for the people the word salvation and deliverance is introduced
 in the biblical story in the story of The Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt in Moses the key key figure and if there is an analogy between farro and the snake then what does that make most of us that makes Moses something like a new Adam at least potentially so there's something about Moses that the narrator wants us to see him as an image of somebody who with God's power can have power over the snake somehow counter the forces of death and Chaos in the story so yours was super interesting is that when Moses finally goes to pharaoh and chapter 7 he's with his brother now and this is the scene where they meet her for the first time and so Exodus 7 verse 8 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron when Pharaoh speaks to you
 do is sign do a Wonder for us then say to Aaron take that staff and throw it down before pharaoh and use a reader like oh yeah I know it's going I know it's coming the Nosh of snakes going to come out to the street fair out with a snake and what the story goes on to say is take your staff and throat before Pharaoh so that it can become tiny in the tournament an easy dragon which is the name of the sea monsters from day 5 of Genesis 1 do we taking the vocabulary of both the water monster and the desert creature the staff come to become both and we've merged us too so we're back to this question of what are we supposed to have an ermine I know the visual picture how do I add a picture of throwing the staff and then morphing into this massive creature that like you know is flopping
 found a wet cuz they're out why am I here and you're like we'll get that monster out of here so maybe it this way remember our first episode we saw that the word NACA or snake and the word tiny in 4 sea monster there's this overlap between them they're both reptilian and the knockoffs is mostly associated with the desert the tiny and mostly with the waters but there are some occasions we can talk about it if not house in the sea that will eat you and this would be a case where you can talk about is Tiny and on dry land I see okay still likely a snake in the narrative but being called adenine yeah connecting it like this is a monster this is the chaos chaos Monster creature alive yes so another words it's less that you're supposed to picture a sea dragon like pooping into being from the staff and it's more of that it's a snake but with all of the cosmic significance
 Avatar name that's called a ton in other words it's the ideas that swap between the the nahashon Italian yeah and then the story gets another twist okay then so Aaron does this in front of pharaoh and his servants and it became a tiny called his wise ones and his sorceress and remember the word NACA mean Cummins the powers of the dead and channels them to Magic card when it's turned into like a title yes so hear the Pharaoh called his wise ones and Sorcerers which is like the knockoff people are the snake called a snake things to make wings and they did the same thing The Magician's of Egypt by their secret Arts each one through his stuff and it became
 tanning but the staff of Aaron swallowed up their staff swallowed in the dragon-slaying store is Elizabeth neighbors the dragon swallowing up his enemies this common motyka Israel Jonas get swallowed up by the Sea Beast so here is also yeah Moses versus farro but each one of them has a representative Moses has Aaron okay but he's given orders to her and Farah has his Sorcerers has its niggling snake lines and each one can produce a chaos Monster
 but Moses and Aaron is a chaos Monster in the service of God's good planned but somehow it can swallow up the bad calf monster I had such an interesting reflection the good tanning versus a bad thing in your life are there any good tongue in my mouth like a wind-up how we skip this story and Sunday school like I don't remember talking about the sea monsters eating each other and Pharaoh's Palace it totally is so how do we know that we're supposed to be viewing pharaohs a snake school there's some interesting words in Exodus one of this the story there's something going on here the first encounter with Pharaoh you think is an encounter with enough house and then when they end up in his court it's an encounter with Tony in another words they was just a conversation earlier and and Moses was by himself but now that we're in the face of the sea monster in human form of Farah
 then it says if the staff like knows how to scale up to become the Beast matching Pharaoh's own beastliness I'm just kind of meditating here sure why the shift from snake nahas in the burning bush store in Exodus for now to why in the scene is Italian but it seems like you're making a leap here that Pharaoh is supposed to be thought of as a ton mean yeah we talked about him being sneaky but are you going too far and thinking the Pharaoh is like the sea monster himself. That's a good question the story should at least raise that as an idea in her mind cuz for some reason the narrator has chosen to switch words to talk about what the staff because I can't be insignificant so this is often the case when you come across a little puzzles and difficult poetry or narrative and you just got to hold it that it's there on purpose
 if I just hold open that little puzzle a question that I have and keep looking for Clues as I read on there may be some light bulb moment that's been planted that will give me come back reflection and isn't it interesting that you read on through the story of the ten acts of D creation God brings about the ten plagues it ends with the night of passover and the death of the firstborn which does compel pharaoh to let the people go but then once he lets them go out into the Wilderness he follows them out there, like the snake swallows them out there and there's a big showdown in Exodus 14 of pharaoh charging down towards the Israelites who were just helpless camped by the shore gym really interesting seen it is realized you're stuck now at the edge of the Sea and the Pharaohs Army is coming so I says to Moses and the Israelites stand here and
 just do nothing until I tell you to walk into the waters so he directs Moses to take that staff the same exact staff and to smack the water strike hold it out over the water strike them back the waters with a female so yeah so yeah so once again we're like something's going on here the one with power over the snake and the sea monster is Moses is called the use the power of that staff to divide the waters and let them out to sea and then the water split so the Dryland emerges and the people walk through it which is a clear Genesis 1 in The Waters Dry Land appear and please using the power it's like God saying there is the power of chaos that lives in the chaotic Waters us now trapping you yeah yeah that is coming but like you have the ability through
 yeah to use what should be what which can be an agent of chaos become an agent of water in yahweh's hands symbolized by Moses's hands holding the staff even the Agents of chaos and death can become a pathway to life here cuz the chaos water is are the epitome of anti creation on creation even been to those towards his purpose for the preservation of life you were saying which is like chaos creature the Sea Dragon it's not God's rival right right it can represent what a creature can become powerful creature can become when it is anti creation but in and of itself is not bad sexy part of God's good creation and so here is a meditation on using it for good. He's in it for the staff
 is the sea monster against the chaos Waters themselves yeah which are not good waters are not good and they represent not existing anymore at the sea monster God can use against the calf Waterston rack of the staff is a sea monster it is so God can use and death to defeat the powers of death would you say that way or would you say god of the sea monster doesn't have to be nation of that that's why I didn't have to I can be the rubber ducky theme thing playing in God's good creation it could actually praise Yahweh it like you said the psalmist says and so while we have this category of the Sea Dragon is chaos there is a biblical
 the category of the Sea Dragon being good or being used for that potentially good and in the same way that we think about his angels because that's how we started that's right I'm the host of Heaven the stars in the sky you know are often thought of as bad I mean he's with the like the gods of the nation's right lol and yeah the other like could also be like God's Divine Council totally that God uses they could sing for Joy when God does his creative work and yeah let's go back to your beginning Reflections which is these are not Rivals of God they can be actually allies of God but when God creates when he sets into motion life outside of himself in some sense and the way that he gives autonomy to creatures
 he allows for creatures to become of him but Rivals of creation itself Rivals of their own existence existence is conditional independent it can destroy itself and I guess if it's an intelligent creature with the will and Minds that is somehow an image in a mirror of God's own mind there it can have its own choices choose to destroy itself and others like itself and that's very much the way it's a biblical story is trying to paint so here's Barrow looking at a whole group of people going their threat to kill them and slay them and that is letting
 anti creation and body him and become like the sneaky person and here's a meditation saying that seems powerful but it's not more powerful than God in fact grab the staff throw down the staff and grab the stuff you can control it it can be used in service of God like the thing that were afraid of the thing that could like turn us into monsters like doesn't have to yeah
yeah that's right so Moses holding the staff he's an image of God literally and metaphorically holding the snakes feel like I get out of here yeah and then using the power of the Sea Dragon to overcome the destructive power that's the crazy twist yeah using the power you would imagine like I'm grabbing the snake get out of here snake well I guess it's not the power of the Sea Dragon is God I see he's using the instrument of the Dragons what is that mean do I need a whole long walk with a cup of tea for that would certainly be so that'll provide clarification so in the next chapter after the Deliverance of the Israelites and the waters crashing in on pharaoh and his armies the Israelites sing a song about it actually Moses and the Israelites
 and then Miriam and a bunch of female prophets and singers thing and when it gets to the part where the retelling the story of what happened at the waters the stories we told this way this is a Nexus 15 verse for the Chariots of pharaoh and his army he is Yahweh cast into the sea
 his choice officers they sank in the sea of reeds the Deep Abyss the same word as one verse two of them they went down Into the Depths sinking like a stupid word going too far with all the connections of these images of like a c being the chaos Waters yeah you're right hand Yahweh is Majestic in power your right hand Yahweh shatters the enemy in your great excellent you tear down those who rise up against you you send out your hot anger and it devours them like chaff so you always hand in the narrative God said to Moses stretch out your hand meditated on this over the years now. Somehow the hand of Moses is an image of God's hand yeah
 so you look so fascinating when this story was Rita Lynn member this story was retold every year so this memory is one of the most important memories in the history of the people of Israel being rescued out of enslavement to the snake through the chaos Waters and had a freedom yep that's right somehow the Sea Dragon became that last critical moment the instrument of opening up the way to Salvation and Rescue mystery study check this out so this story is retold and it's referenced many many many times throughout the Hebrew Bible I'll just reference if you want to take him deeper Dysart chaos water yet into this I'll recommend two books that have the same exact title and they were released in the same year which is probably why they didn't get in the copyright battle two books called Echoes of x
 this one is by Alastair Roberts Andrew Wilson and the other is by Brian still both books called Echoes of Exodus and what they do is they show how through the rest of the Old and New Testaments The Exodus story is retold I just want to highlight one of those retailing and Isaiah 51 this is a prophet speaking mostly to Israelites sitting in Exile in Babylon hoping to emerge out of it and then hear the prophet talks to God hoping for deliverance from Exile and here's to the Palm Coast
 wake up wake up alarm of Yahweh clothe yourself with strength
 do the arm. So apparently always arm is asleep and get yourself up from laying down and sleeping wake up and this is an image in the Psalms often in the lament Psalms wild how long the lawyer how long will you be silent how long until on 78 that's described as being asleep while we suffer wake up but notice it's not just Yahweh it's the arm of y'all way right what is it called a ton of me I forgot which one what are those are the two options that the next to put on strength like a garment wake up as in the days gone by in the generations of old like in some past event for pastor that can I think of where y'all way I acted with strength with his arm
 wasn't it you who cut into pieces and do pierced through the tunning have is a name for the sea dragon in the Hebrew Bible it's the word to rage the raging one through rager the rager wasn't it you who dried up to see the Waters of the deep Abyss
 wasn't it you who made a road in the depths of the sea so so that the redeemed ones might cross over August was clearly talking about the story of ya back to this through the water skip those the Lord has rescued will return now it's gone future they will enter his eye on that is true Islam was singing I will be like the excess and as we retell the story we don't even mention Pharaoh we just mentioned the Raging Sea Dragon so yeah it was Pharaoh who is shattered in the dark at best yeah and hear the prophet Isaiah looks at that and he doesn't see Pharaoh he sees the sea Kraken yeah he sees the larger Cosmic force that is behind and acting through Pharaoh which is the Dragon
 but now I'm never leaving the dragon is with a Twist what's the twist The Twist is when the dragon was introduced the tiny which is called by the same name here it was good for in Genesis 12 the dragon has gone through its own failure and Folly right and that story is still emerging as you read through the process but both the dragon and the humans and slave to the dragon become sad vehicles of anti creation and that's how fair is depicted here so if we had any doubts the Pharaoh is being depicted as an agent of the snake and the snake of the agent of Chaos in The Exodus story proper Isaiah kind of just helps us clarify that that is in fact what was going on in the story
 but there's many Mysteries we haven't solved yet and I think we'll just have to pin that mystery of how the snake as an agent of chaos can be used to accomplish God's life-saving purposes that's a mystery at work in the symbol of Moses rescuing the people with the snake staff where we're going to go next is we're going to watch the same idea play itself out in a different way in the Book of Judges does the snake Dragon appears in the Book of Judges but in more of a Cane or feral like form in form of the human agents and we'll see how that works helps us look at the whole story from another angle but for now it's good to meditate on what it means for humans to become agents of the Dragon
