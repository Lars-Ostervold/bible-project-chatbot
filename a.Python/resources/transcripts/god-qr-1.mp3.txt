welcome to this episode of The Bible project podcast from John and this is Tim and we are in the middle of a series on the identity of God and in the last episode we took a few questions to respond to you this episode we're going to respond to more we've got a bunch you sent them in and we're going to get to do as many as possible and Tamsin respond as best as he can you ready to him I think so let's hear from you by Tim and John my name is Felipe I'm from Brazil in my question concerns the rebellion of the sons of God in Genesis 6 supposing the story talks about actual Divine beings as opposed to human can do we know for sure the authorized version of the story is the same as first Enochs the Divine being said actual sex with human girls and had actual superhero kids
 thanks a lot alright Felipe asked a multi-part question yeah the story in Genesis 6 as it relates to the whole topic of the Divine Council and other Spiritual Beings and the other famous Nessie leem and giants in the Bible holy cow what is going on here oh yeah so the strangest stories in the Bible it is it is in the fact that it comes in in the first few pages really throws really Bible readers for a loop when they're doing the read through the Bible in a year thing so you know this all goes under the umbrella of four years and years I've just been kind of under a sizing and putting off these Topics in the Bible cuz I thought they were weird and crazy
 and I realize I can't do that anymore I got to own up to the stuff in the rabbit hole is so fascinating and I realize this is all really important to the difficult storyline and how it developed at the stage Genesis 6 tells a story about the sons of God where we at the story so far so we've had Adam and Eve Cain and Abel humans first humans who are the Royal priests in the garden Temple got expelled for disobeying the Divine command and then they're expelled from the garden and then the next the story about the Next Generation that just replay it in a different way they're older son can replay is the transgression of his parents were slightly anyway yeah yeah and it in the new kind of way but in a way that's all the verbal connections between Genesis 3 and 4 show you this is a continuation of
 that's right of the Fall yet what that Clues you into is the fact that I owe the Nerdist follow are going to be all about the spreading and the replaying and replaying of what happened in the garden you saw it once and just three engines for and I are thinking up there I see what's going on tonight the part of the literate design of Genesis 1 to 11 is the set many different kinds of rebellion narratives in a series of patterns and they're all connected to one another they all of me are the same vocabulary Theo and so 6:55 I was a 55 a genealogy that traces the genealogy from Adam through Cains younger brother Seth and then goes down and everybody's dying except for a couple characters the guy named Enoch walked with God and then was not for God took him and then you go cut more Generations than you get a guy in Lemak
 and he has a son named Noah and he says that the sun's going to you're not Amanda nascimento comfort so no I will bring Comfort to at swordplay will bring Comfort to us and so you can go OK Google going downhill everybody's bright spot but here is someone from the line of the woman as promised in Genesis 3 15 somebody who's going to reverse the curse will provide comfort for it and some and then with that hope you turn 62 x awesome that was the point spread of the point so you must begin to multiply and the daughters sounds like a normal day that's what you do and
 then the sons of God saw these human daughters saw that they were good and they took for themselves wives whomever they chose now that they were good and took that's exact same language is Genesis 3 and 4 yeah that's right Adam and Eve saw that the fruit is good that the Earth was good saw that everything was very good and he didn't take he gave you guess that's the right I've been having you saw there was good and they take take the fruit all bad bad Kane what's the weather to do what is good and rule over the animal near crouching inside of a beautiful yeah they married any of them they chose yeah that's right and actually The New American Standard has saw that they were beautiful as well so the word beautiful however is the Hebrew word toes just means good so they were good
 providing a contextual meaning if you're looking for that key word that shows the design pattern of yeah it kind of gets off gets obscured Social Security if he gets translated beautiful saying that phrase and they married any of them they chose and he would add some more literally it says literally they took for themselves women whomever they chose OK Google, taking the well to take a woman for yourself is it is it is it to be to get married so everything revolves of course around this phrase the sons of God's first time to Pearson the biblical narrative it's not the only time it appears the full phrase the sons of Elohim appears a number of times in the Hebrew Bible and always talking about members of the Divine Council the Spiritual Beings had appointed to have delegated authority over the world
 they were referred to as the host of Heaven in Genesis 1 and also as the greater and lesser lights and the stars and then all throughout the rest of Hebrew Bible they'll be places in the song Chubb where the stars and the sons of Elohim will be set in Poetic parallelism and so are there are people who think that this refers to Royal humans like Adam was a Son of God so the phrase Son of God isn't explicitly used of Adam it is ideas there in the previous chapter but I think contextually if you look at the spread throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible the only meaning that makes sense of the story and its implications and how was red in ancient Judaism is that it's referring to be spiritual best Spiritual Beings saw human women and said I want that that's right
 and it's set on an elegy to the woman and the human seeing what was not given to them and God's order so this is another fall in there. Yeah it's ancestry is the fall of the human rulers the god appointed over the land this is a set in as a mirror image that it's the fall of the celestial rulers the god appointed rule over the right to rule in the upper in the Heavenly Realms not over the knowledge egos we've already had a story what seems like it was a Celestial being in those it's kind of a snake fall of sorts of the point isn't to say this is the first time there was any sort of and that's what we talked about before the order of the events in the sequence in the Bible doesn't necessarily there are some people think it does or doesn't necessarily
 correspond to the narrative that were supposed to reconstruct of the heavens money for a lien release I'm still figuring that out and so are lots of other people yeah he is on this topic there's this desire to then make a coherent story from whenever God created Spiritual Beings threat to what their purpose was and and what they were doing and then their their fall and this isn't trying to construct all that I don't think so but however the big lighters aren't just coming up with this material on their own what they're also doing is preserving a passing down materials that are ancient to them and what Biblical authors are often doing just composing you're taking pre existing material weaving it together into a narrative series of Pat let's take the story of Cain and Abel language
 Pieology in because it's important and about anywhere this is all coming from correct and now let's continue with this fall idea but let's talk about special to the snake that has its own rebellion and Genesis 3 and whether the snake Rebellion has happened in the past of Genesis 3 and then he's you know trying to pull humans into a dark pit in Genesis 3 or whether Genesis 3 is the fall Narrative of that being along with the humans but the point is that the humans with the snake says to the woman is you know you won't die if you sees nobody like her. You'll be like Elohim you can become more like I think God Elohim trying to merge with humans are inversions of each other three is humans trying to attain immortality and become Elohim on their Hunter
 here are the sons of Elohim trying to merge right trying to become more than what God gave them to be and doing it on their own terms crossing the boundary crossing the boundary at 3 the Temptation is I want to be like Elohim in that there's I'm a human and I live on the land I've been given from the land and I rule the land but there's this Celestial realm of divine being of which I am not one correct and we talked about this before despite that humans have this incredible position in God's creation correct but then the Temptation is what don't you want to be like that Bea and I love him and that sounded awesome answer than a human's breaking that boundary and what I'm trying to ascend so to speak and the story of the Bible's never humans breaking that boundary and becoming
 plus your bangs fertile soil for the Incarnation of humans trying to become God and you have you no lesser Divine beings trying to merge and restore eternal life to humans merge with humans and the Incarnation is the ultimate Creator merging his life with the human story human life and anyway sorry that's jumping way for Let's Escape our humanness correct this just spiritual our source keeping our body that kind of thing yeah that's not the idea that idea is like super charge Humanity deify it with the snake says to the woman you can become Elohim you can be humans that are also spur that are divided and that's never the perp it is
 guess what I'm asking is is the snake shortcutting what God was already planning on doing or is he giving them a temptation of something that human should never want to be I think within the narrative logic exactly that he's trying to it's a legitimate goal that they share in the life and proximity and glory of God but that they do it in a way in which they get to define the terms are so and knowing good and evil and this is why the Temptation story of Jesus in the wilderness is a mirror it's also one of his mirror narratives that's pattern on Genesis 32 that's exactly the test for Jesus from his snake figure is you can have authority over all the nations of the Earth with the story of Jesus is going but you can do it on this next time it's a good thing but in a bad way
 correct Genesis 6 it's the Elohim the sons of God the Spiritual Beings who decide to merge with Humanity so it's another crossing boundaries been the other way correct if we're using spatial language right vertical yeah that's the correct yeah so you can see how it once you see how in the design of Genesis 12 11 Genesis 3 and Genesis 6 are mirror images of each other it makes the sons of God to refer to Spiritual Beings I think it makes that interpretation unavoidable and it's also because that view of the sons of God is going to be drawn upon again later in the Book of Genesis another reason we know that the sons of God according to the author of the books intention Are Spiritual Beings is the way Genesis 6 also get developed
 I picked up by another connected story in Genesis 19 where again it's God and His Divine Council and he comes down to visit Abraham with two other Spiritual Beings who appears humans and then they go those two two of them go down into Sodom and the whole story demonstrating how horrible the people of Sodom are as if they want to have want to rape the Angels the men of Sodom want to write these angels so I understand that this story in Genesis 6 is crazy but the worldview of the biblical Authority by the way if you follow Jesus and embrace an Orthodox Christian view of who Jesus says that he's God and human
 that is no less crazy boy crazy in fact you could make the argument that that's there is no sexual deviancy impregnated by the Holy Spirit okay that's not a my Genesis Genesis 19 looked at him if we're going to use my craziness is a Criterion of whether or not to believe something is if you get my point is if you Embrace an Orthodox Christian perspective on the identity of these has become human strange merging of the Divine and the human its emerging of the Divine and human and Genesis 6 you already have a category for this and what Genesis 6 is telling us I'm not saying I find this easy to believe I'm just saying this is what the others are trying to communicate to us we have to reckon with it is so Genesis 6 becomes a story of a cosmic Rebellion among the heavenly host that they're trying to restore
 eternal life to humanity through this underhanded rebellious man The Narrative doesn't say that that was there no oh no there's just four sentences that you have again Jewish meditation literature the way these early stories in Genesis forwarded his spare so that you will gain more clarification the further you read on so let me read the four verses and then I want to hear what how you got to read the first two human beings we can increase in number on earth and the daughters were born to them the sons of God saw the daughters of the humans were good Cove and they took them took wives for them for they took my torta women for the Pittsburgh woman who ever they chose and then the Lord said my spirit will not contend continue have a foot not a yes or no. My spirit will not remain and getting your main goal is that one that I spirit will not remain in humans forever
 inhuman and human singular for they are mortal two days will be 120 years and then verse for is there a bar where on the earth in those days that had children by them they were the heroes of old men of renown for versus
 I've generated a universe of L literature and speculation first to tell you about the host of Heaven some of them breaks a boundary and take human women, they want three is God's response and so the response is also very cryptic response is cryptic but if we're looking for coherence which I think the Big Lots there's want us to do they want us to see that this response fits somehow is relevant to the Rebellion that just the thing that just happened that's so forgot to say my rule My Life Giving energy which hasn't been mentioned since Genesis one since its appearance in the second verse of Genesis 1 that the spirit of God was hovering to my spirit is what creates and sustains life the life giving energy of God life-giving energy won't abide with
 humans and actually the where to buy it is ya done if you look at in Hebrew it's graphically very similar to the word eaten I think the word play but my whether it's a by door at the word Play My Life giving presents won't Eden with human forever yeah what is a place where Divine and human together in the and now I won't give it to him alive to human life just like the thing for is that was right to become like elephants and when God God's response is I don't know the humans have become like one of us God says and solicit but they'll take from the tree and live forever so Genesis 3 of the grab for eternal life on Humanity's own terms this response from God here I think we have
 go back and reread it say God sees this as a grab for eternal life again but now it's coming from a cosmic Rebellion to humans that's why I said that I see because of her story until God says note The Offspring of these unions are flesh and so my spirit will abide with flash forever that's not going to Grant Eternal eyes are dumb to these rebellious unions in as much as The Offspring of these unions is Flash they've got 120 years and 120 years could refer God putting a cap on human life possible yeah I know this interesting although most people in the narrative follow we're going to live way longer than I even in the rest of Genesis
 main interpretation from ancient times and I think this is correct is that the hundred twenty years is the clock ticking until the flood from this narrative moment forward the time from the story forward you got 120 years until until the flood and those tournament Generations or something I just read this recently actually but this is an ancient view this actually interpretation is found even among reading some Genesis in the Dead Sea Scrolls so this is a very old view of what time is referred to as person in the planet comment 122 years wow there is a coherent contextual way of viewing What's Happening Here in the story and it does make sense of the stories function into contacts its relationship to all these are there
 links and narrative patterns and it's the view that the sons of God Are Spiritual Beings in rebellion of thread of humans becoming Elohim correct I didn't really throw illegitimate means religion means the snake says you can be like Elohim and then God says look they become like us and the tragic the tragedy is that humans already are like they're the images got here but it's a different type of being like it's not the same as being a top yeah it is to being so it's wanting more than what was allotted and this is fundamental Motif man this is going to go right through all the depictions of Babylon in Isaiah and Daniel and all the way forward to the son of man what God is going to Grant a human figure rise above even the sons of Elohim and rule on his throne at the Divine glory and that's why Jesus
 says he is that elevated divine-human this is a Thing video yeah what do you mean by that this theme of the desire to be more than oaic human on their own terms and the merging of Elohim and Humanity like you just Trace that yeah you could
 me what kind of eternal life in the supposed it would be like a video about eternal life but it's not just about eternal life it's the the role that humans are to play in the cosmos is according to God's ideal intention of a glorified existence that shares and participates in the Divine the Divine Life and the apostles believe that that's what has come about in the life and death and resurrection of Jesus which is the truth of filament of all of these misguided attempts at this moment that make up the storylines the Old Testament so I think we're going to have some other questions later on about Vanessa Lehman Giants and all that kind of things are good we could save it for later question though so the answer is well then then sleeping you asked about the Book of Enoch Enoch is a literary work from around the 3rd to 2nd Century BC was in the.
 latest formation last steps of the formation of the Hebrew Bible and it was an immensely popular work and essentially it's a interpretive retelling of these early stories from Genesis and it constitutes one of the oldest interpretations of the narrative in Genesis 6 that we just talked about and it fully identify as the sons of God as the Divine Council and 470 of them and they have a couple leaders so do we know for sure that the biblical authors Genesis 6 version and Enochs version are the same that was the intention and Genesis 6 around the time when the old is in its final phase of somebody who's not the earliest right stage right so they're way more likely
 get us in touch with the original meaning of the store and then Christians later on so there's a whole other layer or two of how Genesis 1 through 11 is Israelite versions Andre adaptations of current ways of thinking among Canaanite and Babylonians Genesis one about like God tames the waters with a word you know the waters are arrival which any Babylonian would have read and then like wait where's your God battling the water monster doesn't have to battle him he doesn't have to send the same way Genesis 6 is adopting a very common storyline and especially Babylonian mythology which is about Divine beings of procreating with humans and producing the great warriors and kings of old dogs are common mythology of ancient Kings
 their propaganda as offspring of the god and so you can see where this kind of story would just be a total jab all of that to be like you know if there's any truth to what the kings of Assyria Claim about being gods there's offspring of Rebel gods and they are not Gods they're just flesh and and their days are numbered and their days are numbered yep so that would resonate in your contacts this narrative would be bouncing off of other larger cultural narratives from the ancient empires and again it's an Israelite monotheistic feels comfortable to me talk about it in those terms because then I feel like I lose traction a little bit on how I should understand the stories I hear that because in one sense if I just put it in that category oh it's just it's just a response it's taking the mythological world
 that was around them and then using that to then explain what they believe is true about the world I wouldn't put it that way it's just that I would say it is that and it's more than that that's why I was saying I was described as it's the same issue reveal himself through these ancient all service is that symbol conversation again yeah or it's just a God's revealing himself he's revealing Torah instruction call the way back papa what's the point of the Bible read 2nd Timothy 3 1416 it's to make us wise for salvation through faith in the Messiah Jesus so it's it's wisdom instruction literature to teach us instruct us about what's wrong with the world what we need to be rescued from
 how that rescue is accessible to us when we trust and trust in him in Messiah who's that Jesus of Nazareth and so if that's my view of what the purpose of the Bible is
 then all sudden the function of the pentateuch I think it gets redirected towards its biblical intention and what we need to then I think we need to stop trying to make the pentateuch do something it wasn't designed to do and instead recognize what is author's are trying to do which is tell us of the unified story that leads to the Messianic salvation and so the vehicle for that or the ancient authors the gods inspired by the spirit which means he's speaking in and through how else he speaking in and through people who write Hebrew savior of the world is a three-tiered Cost Plus World you know where there's ancient empires saying that the kings are The Offspring of Gods and Men and so they're doing theology they're shaping their history according to a monotheistic Israelite covenants whole commitment and so different
 the God one really makes it stand out because
 once you say they're interacting with other cultures mythology a lot of people get nervous the first thing we know that's how ancient people thought of the cosmos and we know that that's not the way that the cosmos is actually ordered according to our conception of the universe with our telescopes and which is to say yeah their conception of the universe was built on what their ability to perceive it was at that point in his grandpa just like ours is a thousand years of the universe will hopefully head for the conviction is that God can speak to humanity at any of those points and through any of those cultures if you wanted to do it seems like there's a category of things that are true of real
 yeah God created. He sustains life as depicted as chaotic Waters were alternating light and dark or whether its Quantum Frost versus quantum Frost I don't even know what it is something that has to do with the energy is it is theoretically exist as particles are bouncing off of each other and if it's related to dark matter or not but you know what I'm saying like we have a conception of order and disorder at the front edge of whatever physics is at do you think quantum physics is just a big joke I think we're just messing around with us multiple like how much stuff can we tell him before they realize we're just making this up.
 It is not Nick Frost Frost yet.
 but when does this fundamentals underneath each of those different models that help people understand the universe order or disorder or both whether things are there's a purpose adult which which things are headed and the biblical authors existed in a cultural setting they're participating in and addressing I feel bored I feel like why do you feel more and more when it comes to this topic on Genesis 6 verses Genesis 1 and I don't know maybe maybe it's the same as just every time I come back to it I realize how unmoored actually feel I think it up fresh I might be I think it's the same issue the point is to say you live in a world where the Empire's around you way more powerful than you little Israelite and your petty Kingdom. They claim that they are
 ruled by The Offspring of the Gods and the these kingdoms were founded by the gods and you as an Israelite or being told no not there's only one she felt loved him and he rules the world through delegated human and spiritual authorities and what those kings claim is all propaganda if they are The Offspring of God there's any truth to that claim they're actually just The Offspring of one of these Rebel Spiritual Beings there when you say that if they are beginning to your head yes I said okay that's where I end up feeling unmoored is at what point can you start hedging like that versus what point you just have to say the biblical authors look and go up those are offspring of gods exist
 can you do exist and later in The Narrative of beings can exist in the category of the three tiered Universe which is a perception that they have out of the world that is accurate to the way everyone thought about the world back then but he isn't actually accurate about how the world actually is or or not and that's where it feels hard for me to keep my footing so I feel like I have these two kind of anchors what is the text what it says is what happened and then the other one is what you have just described which is why they're having a dialogue with all of these other ancient world HR worldviews and they're saying something very very important to pay attention to what they're trying to communicate and not worry as much about all the implications about whether they were actually Nephilim around or not
 I can go and hang on to either of those but then it kind of go back and forth or like like this kind of middle area that feels really I hear that and I I think that's where I make this thing to these days and I'm just trying to get to sort it out what I think we shouldn't do is allow our uneasiness to compel us to go back and rewrite this story is so that they don't present these problems and that's what I think many interpretations of the story through Christian history especially have done sons of God to refer to this human human rulers are Kings and there is a royal element there but I don't I think we're letting the car drive drive the horse there. Thank you for letting me know
 ongoing
 topic for synthesis and reflection and is not my final I'm not at my final destination should we talk about the Nephilim or you said there's a question with a question from Bradley who lives in Mount Sterling Kentucky my name is Bradley Combs from Mount Sterling Kentucky a passage it's always been interesting to me is 1st Samuel 16 14 says the guy sent an evil spirit to torment so it's connected with the passage you mentioned in First Kings 22 one of the only other places this Spirit type is mentioned I just wondering how your understanding of the Divine Council I'm helps us understand God's sovereignty through this passage thank you yes so
 clam the biblical authors make about God ruling the world through delegated authority human on the land and Celestial terrestrial terrestrial and Celestial raises questions about how the biblical authors conceive of God's sovereignty on page one that is sharing sovereignty self-limiting his own sovereignty to rule through sharing power power its already being his knowing everything is that what that is Rule and Authority with the celestial rulers and the terrestrial rulers so all right on page one really ground or whatever definitions of
 sovereignty that you have has to factor that in cuz it's amazing on page one and then what you see God working with and through other delegated authority is Bradley you mention two stories where God employs other Spirits so in 1st Samuel it's our English translations have God sent an evil spirit so Eva in English have a whole set of layers of meaning but in Hebrew don't quiet exist we think alike philosophical evil and evil witches raw and Hebrew can refer to some things actually very good about this before and I can't remember its nature or being as focusing on the things that this reality brings about it brings about raw it brings destruction and in this case it makes all sick and crazy it brings it and that is raw
 thing is not Rob but the result of what the big deal is going to bring about raw and therefore you call it a raw Spirit what do we say in English then if we met the spirit is going to bring about evil will rob gets translated by all kinds of other words meaning disaster tastrophe when it means these kinds of results got it when it gets translated as evil in English I think that can throw us for a loop yeah and so in that sense Bradley it's no different than the other passage you mentioned in First Kings 22 where God consult with the Divine Council about how I have is going to get taken out taking off the Throne of Israel so one Spirit comes up and says all deceitfully Inspire his court prophets to tell him to go in the battle in fact he's going to get killed and gods like yeah great idea go with that so God works with God works through delegated authority
 just couple examples of examples of that and Moses or David are examples of God working through human authority so how that works out with God's sovereignty is long long question what I actually have a friend Professor Systematic Theology Professor mind likes to communicate this idea he calls it a ship-to-ship theory God's sovereignty of the Shakespeare Theory God's the author of The Script such that he is literally pre-written and predetermined and is the ultimate who wrote the play of every single thing that happens we're living out of play that he already wrote everything we experience it as having free will but not actually does that view right to the other would be the Gods like the ultimate chess player and what he did is create you know his his ultimate opponent so to speak and he is more wise and he can Think Through Math
 cause effect chain could always be worse but he doesn't necessarily know what the next move is going to be he's waiting for his partner to respond to that why it's called the ship that's the open place open God this is very Broad and then another video which I think I'm trying to key on cuz I think it's more faithful to the biblical authors worldview would be this delegated authority of the Gods self-limited his own sovereignty to work in and through other authoritative beings so that the end goal is a community of Wills that become one
 so that would be like the ship Theory we're gods made the ship and the ship is going precisely where God purpose its it to go but aboard the ship how exactly the ship is going to get where it's going is going to be the result of a partnership between the captain and his crew and he's giving his crew a normal amounts of freedom to participate in how the ship gets to the destination they could even sink the ship got their plan for that that's ranging in the bigger topics that are very complex but the issue of God having a Divine Council raises the issue of what it means for God to be Sovereign question question
 Jeremy older he's got a question about the Gospel of Luke Cage on hi Tammy this is Jeremy from Lake Forest California I'm hoping you can shed some light on Loop 10 17 through 20 this is the passage for the 72 disciples return from preaching and report to Jesus that even the demons submit to them in his name Jesus then responds by alluding to Isaiah 14 regarding the fall of the king of Babylon but it connects it to the fall of Satan what's going on here does this passage refer back to the fall of the Lem you mention that takes place in the early chapters of Genesis and is this confirm that the Satan is the chief of Fallen Elohim just like the king of Babylon is the chief of falling rulers I'd love to hear your thoughts on this thanks yeah that's great question this is a good example of once you get to the gospels you see the Jesus and the apostles have fully internalized this the spiritual realm and the storyline of the Hebrew Bible which is telling a story of a human and an
 Cosmic Rebellion is as parallel and overlapping with one another and this is a great example so yeah that's how I'd describe the theme that we just talked about maybe yeah those two parallel storylines in overlapping each other and Matthew and Mark sends a group of 12 disciples ahead of him to going out to the kingdom of God and Jesus is coming through Village pretty soon get ready Rabbi any sense people had right to get the city's ready I'm coming yeah he did this for a couple years so Luke alone tells us about another wave of Harold's been sent out on another wave of this Mission and go around to different towns in Galloway and he says that it's a group of and there's a textual variant of the manuscripts of Luke here
 so one set of manuscript says 72 that he sent the other group of manuscripts reads 74 that nest of the NIV chapter 10 verse 1 he sends them out there it is 7207 day so this is really fascinating if it's 70 this another one of these symbolic acts just like Jesus picking 12 as a symbol of the restored tribes of Israel if it's 70 sending them out this was a very clear symbolism the first 70 you hit in the Bible is the table of nations in Genesis chapter 10 and member the table of Nations is closely connected to do laundry world and the 70 nations are ruled by the 70 sons of Elohim
 but God gets Israel as his portion so if that's the case then Jesus is very intentionally he sends one way of of 12 out and then he sends one way of a 70 out to and this duel sending of the tribes of Israel number and the number of the nations would be Jesus acting like he always did with prophetic symbolism and if your Bible nerd you would know exactly what you doing Jesus Guevara the read 72 would be essentially it's 6 x 12 so it'd be an intensified missions Israel so to speak and because 72 is the number of descendants that go down with Israel into Egypt so some would see here then it's a new Exodus team of Jesus sending out precisely the number of Heralds the correspondence is real going down into its Exile in Egypt now announcing that it's time for the return from the ultimate Egypt what's up people read interpret
 which one's the older variant I think people really there's the reason why our modern translation split you know that Aunt Ivy has 72 but the nrsv has 70 The New American Standard has 70 so there's disagreement among Scholars as to which variant is original I personally think not just from manuscript evidence but also from the part of the passage you're bringing up Jeremy later on a 70 I think the 70 number is likely what's intend to table of Nations number yes because 17 when the 70 come back and they said spiritual powers are subject to us in your name
 and Jesus said to them I was watching the satin fall from Heaven like lightning behold I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy it can't hurt you but don't rejoice in this that the spirits are subject to you rather Rejoice that your names are recorded in heaven if this is referring to this to the table of Nations and we know from was it you know I mean 1932 where Moses explains that the sons of God the Divine Council there's is dividing up connected to the 10K the reason why they're all scattered and into their 70 different languages is connected to Genesis 11 but there's is in the rebellion of papal office of spiritual reality
 happening where there is the Spiritual Authority is that actually are connected to each Nation correct and that's the way that they understood what was going on and then you can see that Daniel right that's right the Prince of Persia yeah yeah and so that's what's going on here when they come back there are tripping out on how this spiritual like forces that are evil that are doing bad things typically these other connected to the political and economic Corruption of the governments of these nations are going over us we go there and say we announced that Jesus is king of the world and that the kingdom of God is here and people are so excited to accept you as King Jesus and when evil Powers show themselves so to speak at the Cadillac Fleetwood
 that's right she was in the New Testament is the word for Rebel sons of God a rebel Elohim submit to you and then think of the stories when Jesus walks up and write this is some evil presence and that is where those two storylines of real life they threatened are connecting here correct and say as as he's going around talking about God's plan and desire for humans live on Earth that what they're really doing is there also connecting this is spiritual power that's been corrupting in a manatee is losing its power correct and so Jesus then reflects on this and he's like yeah I actually I'm watching Satan fall from Heaven like lightning which
 got to imagine is he's kind of waxing poetic a little bit because there's the whole idea of like stars falling from the sky correct stars are Celestial beings than that might be like a special being like losing its losing power and status and so he's saying the Satan the Savannah on the title the title in Greek the freezer is in front of the word so time so the opposing one among the sons of Elohim is being this round is round and I've given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and snakes and scorpions which is another way that the Bible talked about this spiritual evil Genesis 3
 find the 70 Nations they're being tied to a rebellion that's human and Celestial in Genesis 11 is totally connected to the snake in Genesis 3 and this figure called the opposer a Rebel Son of God the rebel elephant and so is this connected Isaiah 14 yes it's totally connected and Isaiah chapter 14 Isaiah poetically explores the mindset of the king of Babylon he's announcing the downfall of the king of Babylon and Isaiah chapter 14 and actually what he says that he tells the all of the Nations and 11:40 give me Isaiah 14 verses for this is all the nations are going to pick up take up this taunt against you
 but the word is Michelle is the word for proverb which if you remember the word proverb just means symbolic comparison to compare one thing with another Hebrew and it's translated as here but it's really the word proverb which means comparison to take they're going to take up this time against the king of Babylon yeah this is going to be a little poetic analogy and what is it well it's it's a poem about all of the kings of the earth The Babylon has conquered and humiliated and destroyed and they're all dead and executed them all and they're all in the grave and in this poem they all wake up and they see the king of Babylon who himself has been murdered coming down to the grave and a bit they sleeps going hahaha how the oppressor has ceased the scepter of rulers that you struck the people with you
 this kind of thing coming down to we are everyone's like who you become weak like us and your Pomp and glory is come down to the great you can say it again this is Isaiah tapping into all kinds of imagery from earlier in Genesis but also cast and language the Babylonians and Canaanites without
 so they say look you king of Babylon you fallen from the heavens you oh star of the morning morning star Morningstar which was about this passage before the star that hangs on the longest in the morning that hangs out the longest stand so to speak the light of the sun Siri like that that star has got the most power yeah but even eventually it disappears so son of the Dawn who end in Latin that phrase start the morning. Translated as Lucifer where this whole that whole Lucifer's Latin for Star the morning correct so you've been brought down to the Earth you've been weakened to the nation here's what you said in your heart
 getting it the inner psyche inner psyche of your battle of a king with his own power he's a God I will Ascend to the heavens I will raise my throne above the stars of God above the Divine council with exactly I'm a member of the Divine Council but I want more I want to be like not just the sons of Elohim I want to be like a Genesis 3 starts ringing in our ears now who wants the humans to not be satisfied with their role as delegated authority continues all the send above the heights of the clouds I will make myself like the most high never the less you'll be brought down to the Grave to the recesses of the pit
 so this is the poem it's about the king of Babylon but the king of Babylon is being compared to a Celestial ruler cuz that's how they found themselves out of the stars without the stars are presented to us when Genesis one that's how they thought it starts but then also that's how the king would think himself as yes you do this becomes like a parody of how the king of Babylon will be brought down but if you have it three to Royal Theatre of a cosmic excuse me of a terrestrial and Celestial then there're The Babylon at least an ancient world and their mind is connected to a rebel spiritual power that God will defeat and bring down and so Babylon of past then becomes the symbol to the narrative for any and all forms of human power that elevate themselves to the place of God
 but I need to let sink in for me as we wrestle through all the spiritual being stuff is that's intense that just looking at Humanity by itself in the destruction that we can do to each other yes going in wiping out civilizations killing people taking their resources and then creating a new Empire like Babylon was doing or even said the house today it's just it's intense in and of itself but there's this perspective and scripture that that's all being energized and kind of magnified because of an even more intense reality happening on another level and I forgot to put it in our category is happening in the dimension that we can barely perceive yeah yeah
 we talked about that before and we talked about how Jesus seem more interested in spiritual battle or not more interested but like it just as you are so connected to him that you'd seem to be such a focus of his correct we'll talk about this before but I'm just think it's sinking in my day thinking about it or if people who are keen on the spiritual warfare topic it's usually divorced from its connection to human power structures and it's it's more about demons terrorizing one individual person look at this corrupt leader and what does corrupt leader is knowing there's something spiritual e a r i correct beneath that spiritual
 is actually connected to her and this isn't too somehow relieve humans of their responsibility or accountability Mutual the way I've tried to think through it to myself is example in retrospect to look back on this for a generation is something like the Third Reich in Germany Nazi Germany so how do you explain that within the course of a couple decades a whole culture that represents the Pinnacle of human learning education music culture The Sciences government Germany before World War II warped view of humanity that a whole culture can embrace it as good to annihilate whole people groups in their midst
 and I think that's the kind of thing that the biblical authors have their eye on when they talk about Babylon that's in Babylon it's humans hijacked by something evil that unleashes horrific animal like evil inside of us and we think it's good we actually think it's good and the biblical authors want to see there's something much more Sinister than just stupid humans and that's what God says the cane What God Says to can cancers I see you're angry yes but here's the deal there is a spiritual level and it's coming at you I think we need a different word than spiritual even because of it for me that begins to turn it into my skeptical because it's your participating in a in a kind in a reality of evil that you don't understand and that will destroy you and everyone around you or reality
 42c is dimension the word spiritual is because Spirit meaning invisible energy reality
 okay so it's not like we don't have a category for an invisible power has so much baggage attached for many people that they're not able I think to retune to the biblical categories when they yeah I think I see what you're saying because if you come from a more naturalist worldview you're still comfortable with invisible energies sew-ins or whatever time I'll be right there it's just like what it's just an invisible reality and gravity and we can see it's a fact on the material world but we can't see it say word spiritual that it puts in his category of like why don't believe in I believe in spirits and spirits and ghosts yeah but I do believe in gravity even though it's not something I can explain
 to you or I can feel at the fact I can feel it to experiences the fact and I think for the biblical authors Humanities inclination towards evil is like that it's not something you can quantify or way or perceive and explain in a simple way but is ever-present and it's connected to a whole set of realities we don't need a whole set of characters main characters other beings are like us and unlike us so I feel like I did interrupt you though cuz they can point it was really good that's right yeah I mean this was always when humans give in to evil they are participating in something dark and imperceptible then you don't really understand that we become agents that wants to wants to play with that wants to devour Humanity
 and individually and corporately and that's it seems to me in the story like Luke 10 that's what Jesus has a Target on
 as it goes around announcing the arrival of God's kingdom and so when he says I see people giving their allegiance to me as God's appointed new human King and I'm watching people shift their participation from Human kingdoms give in to evil to the God's kingdom then he says I watch this at on fall from Heaven like lightning the ruler be dangerous around and you all can start crushing Snakehead which doesn't mean humans that's what the enemy has never another human it's the spiritual power behind yeah that's all right there might be human supposed to me as a follower of Jesus but the way I'm to view that is they think I'm the enemy of whatever modern progress or something and I think my the response has to be either we're both
 tempted by a much more complex enemy that we don't understand that's going to destroy us if we don't let Jesus rescue us
 and so quickly were just brought in the whole typical storyline great question Jeremy think you're onto lots of things was a chief among all of the Rebel sons of God that seems to be the case that there is a plural of these Rebel Celestial beings and that there's one in particular were like all the and it's one in particular is never given a name he's always referred by a variety of titles and Emma tiles an image of the Devil is a Greek word meanings of slanderer the satin is the opposer Christopher is Morningstar that there's the evil one like in the Lord's Prayer interesting the Bible never gives this Chief character attic the respect of a Day Too Much dignity
 too much dignity cuz it is not a thing it's the negation of good but it but it is a Bing apparently in a way that I don't quite understand sure Jesus in the same way. As a being in the way that I do or say hi Tim and John this is John from Houston Texas and my question is about to turn sons of God and how that is used in the New Testament we look at Romans chapter 8 we see that we can expect adoption at sons of God in relation to the only begotten Son of God but this seems like a totally different uses and what you guys described from Genesis so is there any connection that can be made there thanks for all you do and thanks for your help
 yeah once you internalize the importance of the sons of Elohim in the role in the biblical story and also the fact that God called Israel his Covenant people in Exodus chapter 40 says the Pharaoh Israel is my son my firstborn son it makes all of the Son of God language pop in the New Testament and really important ways so when John the Gospel of John you know when he opens his account and he describes Jesus as the one and only God who's in the bosom of the father where he's going to call Jesus Jesus can call himself the son referring to the father so what they're doing with in a Jewish context they're setting Jesus as the ultimate Sun there's the sons of Elohim that are like the minor right Celeste rulers but Jesus is
 the one and only son and he's so closely identified with the god of Israel that she fell off a game that you can also just use the word that asked to describe him he's the one and only God yeah so okay when Jesus calls himself the son he does often does it mean John is that more it's all over the gospel and the New Testament Son of God he is aware that this is then kind of alerting you to this idea of the Elohim many sons of God sons of God Being Human the human end, the Kings from the line of David and then also the spiritual appointed ruler start out so he could just mean I'm like Israel
 does society means I'm a human who who God has chosen to fulfill his purpose in the world yeah the potential meaning of her and so John out of the gate comes in as calling Gina The One and Only God who's in the bosom of the father 18 1:18 and he's going to go on later on Jesus will be called the one and only son but here he calls Jesus The One and Only God my translation says one of them except one and only want 1:18 and I be no one has ever seen God but the one and only son of God and is in closest relationship to father that the new living there but it's inferred cuz later on Jesus
 this is going to be described as the one and only the one and only lets say like in Carnation statement the word became flesh became human and tabernacled Temple among us and we beheld his glory to glory as the one and only from the father so much happening so if it's a one and only who comes from the father who is the one and only from a father it's a son that make sense contextually here but the New International Version Frozen song Frozen English words to clarify and then of course John 3:16 is one of the famous lines where it says for God so loved the world he sent his one and only son and it does use the word son explicitly there in Greek ouzo Jesus is the one and only son
 elevating him above the human sons and the spiritual sense of God and one and only as a phrase that it wasn't saying there isn't other ones only Muni mean there's no others got it so it means only in the sense of Jewish manasi us believe there's only one God is the only one she fell over him like we talked about and there is no other out of him beside him compared to some unique character only talks about the status of being the chief and the chief asked about going to a car dealership and being like who should I talk to you I'll talk to Rick he's the one and only
 and Russell point is he's actually participates he shares in the very identity of the one God that the one God refers to both the father and that one and only son to you move on in the New Testament to wear those who identify with Jesus and his life and death and Resurrection commit to him through faith they too can become sons of God plural like in Romans chapter 8 where he says those who are being led by the spirit of God are the sons of God we have the spirit of adoption as Sons by which we cry out to God we all got Abba Father so the whole point of Jesus is the one and only son is that he merges God and Humanity in such a way that God can finally have that family of sons of God which is a gender-neutral Sons and Daughters human human family
 alongside him he will rule the world and love and power God wants a human family Partners to rule the world with page one begins Powers Rebelle it all goes terrible God himself reveals himself as a Divine human to be the human that humans are made to be a failed to be so that the one God can become one with his human creations and they can share in this is divine love I'm busy that's the story I hear you
 the house that you with me no no you're not a lost okay I'm sorry I lost it let me know and I can clear know you are at me I'm sure you are I don't know it's just okay, next to partner with him to be Sons and Daughters to rule creation he also created Spiritual Beings to do the same thing but strangely in the biblical narrative the humans are crowned with more like a sortie majesty and honor that stretch of you out when you think about the fact that they're not Elohim and then these two types of creatures who are raining on God's behalf the humans who are raining God's Cosmos more specifically the the Land part of it and also are said to have authority over the birds of the air today
 call more than write this Rite land and so both are called sons of God both of these beings the human and special and so does the Jones getting at John R Us the question is it seems like these are two different ideas but what we're saying is they're still connected and when humans are rebelling it's the same thing as the sons of God in the in the heavens rebelling the two different ideas but they're so connected but they're also kind of one idea and so when and then we see this in when Jesus is introduced in the Gospel of John he's talked about as the one and only son and that is he is he is the true human but he also is connected to God's Own identity and that he is the true Elohim so you see the
 merging of these two ideas okay it's now bring me back to Romans like I just lost I just couldn't hang yeah it's that through God becoming human the way is open for humans to become the sons of God Sons and Daughters of God in the full sense which they were intended to be to participate in God's Rule and love and life in a way that the Human family currently does not and when we don't it's because it's connected to spiritual like evil that drawing us away but it also is because of us in our man is not a cop-out and Jesus having confronted that evil real reality overcome it is now allowing us to come back into our own correct so when Romans the saying to be adopted as Sons
 correct the adoption Motif is about being adopted into the Divine family in and through the one and only son the Divine family Define family's got family family of God pause track in with us so is the Apostle John the letter first John everything you just said that's what struck him when he saw the Risen Jesus and sat on it for however many decades and then wrote these letters so whoever can write virtual poetry like this first John chapter 3 is a great place to land our conversation he said see how great a love the father has bestowed on us that we can be called children of God what are the sons of God and that's what we are for this reason the world doesn't know us because it did not know him John sees the whole storyline of the Bible flowing out of Genesis 3 15 to Tale of Two seeds
 the moment that you have transferred Your Allegiance and identity to the family of God through the one and only son of God the family line which you used to participate becomes like a foreign culture so is the idea that the tail to see it so is the seed of the human who will overcome in this is see The Serpent and humans can decide, of which see there going to be a part of well we have a role we participate yeah we have a role to play in what seed were part of the whole Rabbit Hole it what I see here in Romans and enforce John is the sense of who we no longer have the title sons of God and we need we need to be adopted in like Romans or here we should be called children of God like this is a new development but humans are sons of God
 he's the son of Eve but he becomes so to speak metaphorically spiritually the seed of the serpent when he gives in to the animal inside of him so it's human to have given in to the seat of the serpent and kind of created allegiance to this spiritual evil correct being able to reclaim our true identity identity hauling in and through the truly human one and only son that's the mess idea here. That's why in first John chapter 3 he's going to go on to bring up Kane later in the pear cuz that story sets the tale of two seeds going out from there so yes the theme of adoption into the family of God Sons and Daughters is the New Testament realization of this whole theme of the rebels sons of God human and spiritual in the idea here is in now that you're in the family of God sons of God you are
 and the snake was saying you can be like Elohim is this being like Elohim or it's like him in that it's receiving his love and becoming a channel for it to give it out to others that love God is love Catholic community of the Eternal of John's fundamental portrait and so yeah when we see him let me see the Son of God appear he says we will be like him cuz we will see him just as he is we are meant to participate in something so much greater and Transcendent and divine did the current mode of existence that we now experience it's similar to what Peter says of the beginning of First Peter Were Meant to participate in the divine nature he's straight-up the okay or what else does Jesus mean when he says I pray that they will be in us just as I am in you father was that mean
 and it doesn't mean we far away it's like the ultimate restored rescue version of my experience of this reality this part of me that's been co-opted for evil that free yeah and I can participate and I could I could be human and in the more freeway maybe this is an eternal life theme video eternal life try and create eternal life on your own terms in which case what you create as hell hell on Earth and upgrading as hell on Earth cool well we wrapped up had a pseudonym
 thanks for your questions everyone wonderful questions we mentioned last time feel free to continue to send in questions as we go through the gods series from here we're going to dive back in to the conversations we had some time ago but they're going to carry forward what we're actually going to do in the gods video that has kind of been a big hiccup talking about the spirit world and in a way good one a good one good Hiccup and we'll talk about it more when we do the Divine being serious and stuff they didn't have God's ears we're going to be specifically looking at how Yahweh Elohim is understood and experienced throughout the scriptures on God's relationship to the world how we took out of the Bible Acts in the world is complex in the Hebrew Bible always through mediators of different kinds and that lays the groundwork for how the apostles describe and talk about Jesus as the embodiment of that
 in the New Testament so good stuff more exploration head
