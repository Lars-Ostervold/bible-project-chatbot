hey this is John at bible project and Welcome to our second episode in a new series on Ancient cosmology how the creation stories and Genesis are in conversation with other ancient near Eastern creation stories Genesis 1 begins with the image of what we called nothingness but Genesis calls a dark abyss another words a deep unruly chaotic ocean and while we don't think of nothing this like a chaotic ocean it turns out this was a very common image of the pre-creation stay in the ancient near East the so this is an inscription written on the coffin of a royal Egyptian official is the creation Now there's two voices that speak so the first a voice speaks who says I am the water's unique without second creation begins with water the water is personified and speak in another voice speaks up that is where I
 evolve or develop those Waters folk and then another boy speaks that says hey evolved out of the waters on the great occasion of my floating that happened I Auto-Tune the Creator M the one who wants evolved the chaotic waters are also in the Babylonian creation story called a new mow in the noon a leash is important to the honors the most ancient cosmologists of everything emerging out of the waters to establish the first world order but then it's about chaos descending on our world and who rescued us from the chaos marduke defeat the dragon in that Dallas has the New World Order in the new movie release the God marduke has to tame the water dragon the goddess team has the queen of chaos and he does so in an epic battle take some mace in his right hand gun for the queen queen of Chaos
 he covers his body with fire and the other nephew can catch him so he deploys the Four Winds he brings Four Winds in the four points of the compass going to trap TMI that's making a whirlwind Cyclone amount is terrible Chariot which is a storm creation emerges from a violent bloody tense standoff but in Genesis God's spirit simply hovers over the darkness and creates with his word in this scary sea dragon and Genesis one it's simply one of God's creatures who listens to God's word and obeys like all of creation she wanted a show we invite you to take a tour of some ancient cosmology he's in order to see how the biblical accounts was aware of and in some sense in debate with these other ancient near Eastern creation stories thanks for joining us
 here we go
 we're doing a whole series on Genesis 1 and 2 yes so buckle up to be a lot of conversation for the entire series really right now and then eventually we're going to start talking about specific themes the literary emphasis points and design of the opening chapters of the Bible is the last our conversation made biscuits you points one is if I was an ancient texts written by the first human civilization some of the earliest civilization and it has an ancient cosmology the word I cut twins when I use because Endo don't fully appreciate it but your understanding of how the world is ordered an account of The Ordering of the universe so those two things you have to remember that they are our modern ways we use words and his modern ways we think about how the universe ordered and there's also ancient ways that people use words described in ancient
 our first attempt to understand something shouldn't be to translate it all in the English and then assume that their words mean what they mean in light of our modern context okay if somebody I had never read the Bible at all and so what you first do is teach them ancient Hebrew and then you introduce them to the my phone whenever we could really get some traction did you read Genesis 1 and 1 through 11 over and over and over again you know it's not that hard to make this spare time switch and how you were you cuz I've read these texts a lot and it can happen if you can make the shift yeah that's right it's just using your imagination to imagine yourself into another culture adapting to an Israelite Hebrew for understanding what these words mean and so on but you can love your neighbor you can love these ancient authors enough to check your cosmology at the door and learn another culture's language and cosmology another helpful way to do this and that
 play Genesis 1 & 2 on the map of ancient cosmology is to learn something about the cosmology is of Israel neighbors that formed the context in which they wrote and so in this first video I want to make the points we just met and then I want to introduce people to a quick survey of ancient Egyptian cosmology a quick survey of ancient Babylonian cosmology and then see how Genesis one is participating in a dialogue with those cosmologists making its own unique claims because it shares some things in common with them something that takes for granted like we would take for granted in a modern cosmology that we live in a solar system planets orbiting around the Sun I'm not borrowing that idea and you're not intimating that I got innovating it and I'm not borrowing it from somebody at the MIT so there are some things like that in Genesis 1 and 2 it's taken for granted and that's how the Egyptians talk about it that's how the Babylonians talk about it that's how the issue lies thought about it there are other things where they
 and they do it precisely in contrast to their neighbors and will see both of those Dynamics cool
 we're going to do in this conversation is do a little bit of discovery about how the ancient cosmologists were discovered we're not even two hundred years into having access to these ancient Technologies cuz they were dug up from the ground or the Hebrew Bible never disappeared never disappeared that's right but its context did and so the farther we get from the recent contacts I think the more helpful these ancient archaeologists thank you Rocky ologist so in 1847 a guy named Austin Henry Lai yard he was performing an excavation near most people in Iraq and he discovered in this mound ruins of an ancient building that he eventually discovered was the library of one of the emperor's by ancient Assyrian Kingdom sweet fine and he discovered thousands of little tablets I mean we're talking like 5 in by 7 in these tablets the little vertical horizontal diagonal marketing for the size of a kid
 got the size of a Amazon Kindle 1850 still in the area where the Ottoman Empire is over most won World War 1 and then Britain inherited Ico his Discovery was during his discovery of these texts was doing that. So here's a gift over there Indiana jones-style these things are being found this was a really important find so these thousands of pieces are still being studied and there was an 1872 some Thirty Years Later you got a library and nerds are piecing together all this piece belongs to that piece of this we got broken in half these two together a puzzle them
 and so there's all these texts there's ancient spells there's a divorce certificates there's a land purchase agreement there's Royal archived notes there's battle account so it's all here cuz it was a library it was the library yeah if that's right put them on us going in Georgia Smith be published an essay presented his research to a society of Old Testament studies and as I was called the Chaldean account of the Deluge they'll use means blood and here's his account a short time back I discovered among the Assyrian tablets in the British Museum and account of the flood that I had divided the collection of tablets in the sections according subject matter and I've recently been examining the division comprising the mythological tablets and from the section there was a copy of the story of the flood on discovering these documents I searched all over the collection of fragments consisting of several thousand pieces and I recovered 80 fragments of these Legends
 by the aid of which I was able to restore nearly all of the text of the description of the flood and portions of other Legends and swell of the inscription describing the flood there are fragments of three copies containing the exact same text with great as he had three copies of the same thing so there's a broken section in one and so he's able to piece together from the three copies of what he says is almost a complete account this isn't the same guy that found them is another guy thirty-some years later he's in a library today he will use some artificial intelligence and get it done in like an hour and he says all these accounts together with considerable portions of other mythologies other stuff about Babylonian Gods in the origins of the Kingdom's I believe have a common origin in the plains of chaldea the return one flood near death at this point yes three copies that having description describing the flood but there's many other accounts they have considerable portions of other mythologies these tablets do
 they all have a common origin here in the plains of chaldea this country the cradle of civilization the birthplace of the Arts and Sciences for 2,000 years has been in Ruins its literature containing the most precious records from Antiquity is scarcely known to us except from the text of the Assyrians but beneath mountains and ruined cities now awaiting exploration lay together with the older copies of the flood other Legends and histories of the earliest civilizations of the world just imagine being that room hearing this guy give this address just electric so this late 1800's was a exciting time in biblical studies so two years later he brought it all together in a volume called the Babylonian Genesis and this introduced to the world two accounts one is the Epic of Gilgamesh or a numa a leash Witch is opening words of it in Acadian and then the actress
 does Epic and so the Babylonian Genesis the volume in 1820 through like 13 printings in the singles going Hot Cakes in Europe in the late 1800s no one has ever known about the stuff for and so this is just reshaping how everybody's thinking about Genesis 1 and 2 like finding your Grandma's diary or something so there's another scholar like his name he wrote synthesized all this for a popular audience in a book called creation and Chaos in the beginning in the end and his point was to show the Genesis 12 11 was an extensive dialogue and interconnection with Babylonian cosmologies from creation from water the chaos Dragon humans from dust the flood Stories the ancient Kings Before the Flood who lived for thousands of years all this is hitting the modern world barely a hundred and forty years ago not very long ago that was yesterday
 but my point is many people might be familiar with this ancient near Eastern Connection of Genesis 1 to 11 and so it's just up to me is fun to learn about the modern Discovery and to think about what that was like when it's brand new idea so basically what they're finding is all of these creation accounts and Other Stories that were written in the same time. As the creation account in Genesis part of the world are the world I mean these Empires review of time in the modern era so short right yes I like the same decade has been around for two hundred years or 200 plus years. Empire itself lasted half a millennium and these texts circulated the things moved to Los lower yeah yeah General time and what they found was there was all this overlap
 I remember first being introduced to these saying been a way of someone saying you see oh like for example with the flood there was a lot of flood mythologies and it was a way to kind of dismiss because I have a bunch of ancient one so it's not that it wasn't like novel or anyting but your point is yeah the certain things in these cats aren't novel that are just normal everyone thought about the world this year that's right and that actually should help us understand how it's being used when a deviates when they change the way that it when they do stay something awful then we can know that it's really important thing that there. What's novel is not that there's a flood narrative in the Bible other cultures had ways of accounting for the cosmos in terms of before and after a great flood
 what is novel is the interpretation of the flood that the difficulties give which is radically different than how anybody else talked about it in the ancient world so if you believe Genesis 12 11 exist just to tell me it's ancient video footage of things that happened then discovering these other accounts is is a way of saying I'll look the Bible's just a part of the ancient world of course any work of literature isn't just trying to tell you about something interesting that happened is trying to help you discover the meaning of what happened here and that's where the Bible pops into significance so that's in the on the Babylonian front on the Egyptian front window mullion storms the ancient world who were in the early eighteen-hundreds Trump and the Poli and set on world domination as many and many before him have been as well so it was when Napoleon annexed Egypt versus famous paintings it's like
 Chipotle in front of the pyramids Cairo that opened up Egypt to the Colonial powers of Europe income all the Nerds that opens that it's Debbie comes the political Gateway for the Nerds to come and start studying it on digging around Gyptian yep history so early eighteen hundreds in Egypt so you got Austin layered over in mosul and you've got John from Splash and pull you on down and Kyra and he's got teams down there that's the famous guy who deciphered the Rosetta Stone the Rosetta Stone this was a big statue Egyptian statue that had hieroglyphics and two other ancient languages who was the same inscription with three written in three languages one of them with hieroglyphics and so I forgot what the other two are those demotic hear this with the cracking of hieroglyphics figured out how would it be
 threat Rosetta Rosetta from the bike the software helps you learn its three versions of a decree from King Ptolemy the 5th and 196th BC the top and middle text use hieroglyphic and demotic which is a late form of Egyptian while the bottom is an ancient Greek and she is able to reconstruct from demotic and Greek what the hieroglyphics were could find and I was the first cracking the code so yeah this guy he cracked the hieroglyphics hieroglyphics is not a syllable system a word picture system so even the modern Egyptians didn't know hieroglyphics correct is totally similar to if you sit Modern English readers down with 12th century English is really difficult imagine troll century English was just
 pictures not pictures yet and so now you've got they've got about fifty years start over the Babylonians this in the early eighteen-hundreds so they've got a few decades ahead of the Babylonian Scholars and so you have all these texts coming out the end of The Book of the Dead Sonny's famous to Coffee text I don't know the next talk about things like I should know they're also cosmology is where they talk about the cosmos in language that you just like wow that sounds like Genesis one but also different from Genesis one quick tour of Egyptian cosmology quick tour of Abalone Abalone cosmology then we'll go read Genesis 1 and some things will pop in cool ways sweet sweat
let's just read a text here this is from I was called the cops and text the so this is an inscription written on the coffin of a royal Egyptian official. It's called a couple texts. Original creation active there's two voices that speak correct so I voice speaks who says I am the waters unique and without second creation begins with reality Cosmos Waters personified as the water is personified and speaking their concept of nothing is water is just water or the beginning of the beginning it's just whatever threat another boy speaks up that is where I evolved or developed so the water spoke and then another voice speaks
 says hey I evolved out of the water's on the great occasion of my floating that happened to me I Autumn the Creator and the one who wants evolved circlet who is in his egg
 so nothing is water's the concept of nothing where the beginning state of all things is just Waters and then there's someone there in the washer if someone there in the waters name autumn autumn autumn and he's like hey I floated up out of these Waters in my egg isn't my isn't it what season is the boundaries of the egg the shape of the circlet here I am I popped up out of the primordial Waters and in my egg see I began there in the waters see the flood is subtracted from me the waters recede and I am the remainder I made my body evolve through my own power I am the one who made me I built myself as I wished according to my heart so it's a picture of the just
 water call there is just in the middle of the ocean streamly arid arid dry dry dry dry desert but there's one light of the Nile River Lifeline this whole civilization is a huge River flood every year the floods and brings life and sustenance to everything the waters basic based on their fiscal environment is basic true for all humans are thinking back to the Earth like early as to how did this all come to be they imagined this being coming up out of the water the water is kind of like coming out from him in a way it doesn't
 picture of this like person raising up from like baptism arm so you know just cuz it's like coming up by the waters all the waters are going away and then he's the one that remains yeah and you find out like he is going to self the remainder and I'm the one who made me first mover and order water is necessary for life is all be desert but also it's the northern coast of Africa to go to the edge of them and they look out on the Mediterranean whole lot of water out there the waters the most basic the Dryland emerged out of the water and then the water is what gives life to everything else that everything is contingent on the water but in this way of living in this very intuitive without the water there's nothing and there seems to be a lot more water than there is land the land comes out of the water
 go to the coast and you'll watch you can see it when I mean I go to the beach to clear that the way the land is sloping up out of the waters we call them peaches if you do if you're trying to just use your eyesight what you see and intuitive cosmology the land emerges out of the water is okay. The creates that boundary line do but this is this isn't an account of the land, the water is just an account of autumn the Creator coming out of the waters yes we're going to go on but autism involves and he becomes the Primeval mound of dirt are we does from the waters and then everything else self develops out of him okay so we're abstracting the Dryland coming into existence as a being as an organism organism imagine that's a god emerging out of the waters which is Subway's is it too far from
 the way to Modern stink of the land was going to make that point of different symbols that organism that's right from the water and emerging from the waters we called and volcanoes are tectonic plates that we more and more realize that the way the land works it's not just this Dad Baron it's full of life all the wife is interconnected and it's like Mega organism organism superorganism superorganism like Prime Evil deity that he's the land is everything he's the circlet he's the egg emerging House of the Primeval Waters to correspond all of this the picture you get multiple pictures so
 this will be hard for people listening to podcast but there's a classic world picture that gets developed in almost all Egyptian drawings of the cosmos it has one figure it's always a woman who's Archie like in a yoga pose downward dog with toes touching the ground and fingers touching the ground and then the body in a big arch so you can Google would you Google the finest let's see her I'll just do it right now if you just Google Egypt cosmology a picture will come up with the figure of a woman in an arch I mean this is like one of the most prolific pictures in ancient Egypt pick up a picture of the universe from awesome emergent number of deities you have the dry land is called give and then arched above guess is the sky goddess Newt what the Hebrew authors will call Everett sandstrom I am the stove
 Landon die and dip in cosmology is called gave a newt Newt body is filled with stars she's the Sky Zone in the space in between gave food lying like the ground and newts who's artist Above as the sky down there is often all these other assisting deities for the mountains or whether that's what these other characters that go in between the the land and the sky dumb that's right and so you get all these developed pictures in this one on the right often times you'll see figures in a boat to a riding above the writing on Newt on the arch and so you have this concept here of the Skydome as a solid thing up there and the son rides on it sometimes raw is depicted as being given birth
 emerges out of newts and then Newt swallows him and then gives birth to him again every day for the sunrise and sunset then you have stars and newts body many of all these deities to account for different parts of the cosmos and all of these are manifestations that evolved out of autumn is an egg the potentiality of all life in order a picture like the picture. Zoom giving birth to all these days he is or what has autism swallowing his own reproductive fluids use your imaginations care and it's it's pretty vivid and so he keeps doing this self-reproducing and then each time a new cosmetic mergers out of him for the whole point is the cosmos is self-generating the cosmos is itself the Divine and it spontaneously
 generates itself so just put this in the language of philosophy all reality every reality that I see and touch is like contingent its existence depends on some other previous call me if my parents are the stable from a tree everything depends on the thing that can read that's right from the tree before at in the ground and so when the Greeks developed the idea of the uncaused cause there has to be a cause back there it's like the first cause so in the Egyptian imagination is the universe's self just infinitely its own cause all the way back and whatever is before the first cause is just conceived up in their imagination am the waters so just try to imagine water's always exist but the waters are not existence the waters are actually non existence cuz it existed what existed this is in this cosmology is
 ordered reality bug existence is Autumn and the universe emerging out of him that brings order in life so there isn't a time to the other ways to think about Waters one is thinking of water as anti distance correct the other way you talked about it as the source of Life yes that's right out of the chaos thing going on with the waters that the waters are like an enemy that have to be defeated the here in this imagination nothing this is just the potential of existence and that's the nothing the state is imagined as Waters Waters is nothing but also Waters is life in the life there's potential for something to emerge out at nothing and that's something special comes out of water potential that's right. If nothing has the possibility of something
 I have a feeling he knew that down with an ancient Egyptian is the water nothing that they would agree with you it would be like water is potential water is the problem is the English word nothing refers to a cosmological idea that didn't exist and their time nothing what do what is not here for his nothing you know what I mean like you have to have a view of the universe that what the universe is is matter physical matter that's what the universe is and so before the universe there was not there was nothing and you have to have a very I think pretty modern sophisticated even have those categories of the material Universe to have a concept of nothing but their concept was where did this all come from what we know that all potential all life and potential of Life comes from water
 this arid dry place what is the most biggest water lets us get food and all the potential for life and so when they think back to how did anything come to existence it all came from water and it all came in this egg genius lead emergency has caused emerges out of nothingness and then I'll reality and I will give you is just later developments of that first original cost and that just cost itself there might be an analogy here with older cosmology is I think in the middle 20th century of like the Eternal Universe the Multiverse Theory might fit into this category of like we're just in infinite Loop of universe
 is exploding in Lincoln tracking again and really what reality is it's just this is spontaneous emergent Aeneas latent in LA but logically what you're saying is the universe is just generate the playoffs you okay do you know where is generated self out of nothingness yeah that's very similar to Egyptian didn't say let me create every thing I came came from from the nothing I don't know nothing emerges from the nothingness yeah here's another one this is from what's called Papyrus Brenner must be the guy who is named after the guy who discovered it is Autumn he called himself the lord of the limit speaking after he evolved I am the one who evolved as evolver when I evolved Evolution evolved all Evolution evolve after I evolved Evolution becoming many in emerging from my mouth without the sky having evolved without the land having evolved without the ground or
 snakes having been created in that place I became tied together in them out of the waters out of inertness without having found a place in which I could stand to hear the poet reflecting on the first self-evolving cause
 we're mentioning ourselves in the mindset of autumn what is Autumn the first self cause cause here and so every it's only for the pantheism that all reality is just a manifestation of the Divine self cause cause they're using the word evolved and they don't mean evolution in the way that maybe marriage or that's right and you can into that there's development from the life cycle of birth and death from the seasons from Plants dying and passing on passing their seed to go on when he says when I evolve evolution of alt but it's what was the first development of anything towards order in life okay but he came to be being
 itself came to be him to be that's fine self cost about a difficult sometimes as me trying to really understand my wife. I'm quite serious and not cuz she's hard to understand it's like communicating with another human to truly understand how they see the world it takes work but it works. What you want to do is just do I think I get it so well at the deity but the deity is has no origin or cause but notice in this was most primary is the nothingness in the chaos yeah that's comes before the correct correct to me cuz we'll find out through first and
 everything is a personal being in the beginning yeah that's right and the beginning state of creation the nothingness out of which this being the three of us makes everything is the same Waters but it's precisely the order is reversed yeah and that's the point to be made another I just thought this was cool if you focus in on Raw the Sun God who rides the boat the back of Newt so he gets developed and stories about him and his significant give me the Sun God and then is the Sun God who rides his boat and there are lots of depictions of the sunrise dispels the night night time is the realm where the nothingness threatens to take us all over again
 so when the Sun rises it's deliverance from being reduced into nothingness parks in neighborhoods and certainly can't have can't grow anything yeah but just imagine every night like all right let's hope he shows up again so there's depictions and stories about every morning when Ross shows up he's dispelling dark powers of nothingness in chaos and in this picture that included I think it's the I forget where it came from but some sort of wall carving bits of the sun god read in the sunrise he's being pulled by a row of cobras and of jackals but he has a spirit and he's piercing the head of a sea serpent so another words at Sunrise every morning at Sunrise the Sun God is defeating the power
 where's the darkness and he does it by striking the head of us of a serpent we're so in the neighborhood of the biblical authors here now what the snake means in the biblical story is very different than the meaning of the snake but there's also overlap and that's how it always is there's a difference anyhow it's crushing snakeheads is Sabria leaky Motif in Egyptian stories of the Gods overcoming forces of evil and chaos to overcome evil and Chaos a common symbol is to crush a snake a crashing snake and then why does it every morning and every morning Chris snake head and makes us some coffee
 I love it okay last Egyptian let's go over to what moderns call Iraq
do you got the Tigris of North it's where the Assyrians kind of more up in that region and Linda loved it and then South is the Euphrates so in this area where these two rivers flow into the ocean is Mesopotamia where the first civilization threat human civilizations River delta at the mouth of an ocean and it's flat muddy and it was yeah it's where the first large-scale agriculture for humans develop large-scale so and then after thousands and thousands of years of humans being there and doing that emerged the first writing systems and therefore the first historical records and this is the culture of the Sumerians the earliest written traditions we have from them go to like the mid to early 2000s BC or where the first written texts come from like pictograph
 symbol writing satellite higher court so the Nerds Scholars on Mesopotamian cosmology. He introduced as it is name is Bernard Bernard battle he says despite the great variety of Sumerian cosmological narratives nearly all reflect the worldview of their authors who lives on the seasonally watered river deltas of the Tigris and Euphrates that have on their fringes the wide Syrian desert of Northern Saudi Arabia the Big River delta these Rivers seasonally flood providing the water that gets irrigated have you seen those like planet Earth ones where they show all the animals flock there that's right now it's in like sub-Saharan Africa yeah with these huge deserts get flooded they just all the sudden they're under 12 ft of water yeah.
 60 days and then happens every year and yeah the animals to migrate thousands of miles to get to go get some water and feed her human civilizations emerged from the floodplains Mesopotamia fed by the Tigris and Euphrates and on their border to the east is the northern edge of the Saudi Arabian Peninsula desert so he has any stories that describe a pre-existing or pre-creation state portray a desert Wasteland some of the words non creation is a desert in Babylonian it's either the waters or also the desert are the two features of non-existence
 continually says creation therefore is a process by which water is added to a Barren desert turning it into a fertile field which is what it would have felt like to live in the Delta yeah that's right so at the center of such stories is Anki the god of fresh underground water who makes the land fertile through the Tigris and Euphrates rivers ninhursag is the goddess of dry land who receives the waters gives birth to plants animals and civilizations related to this artex that depict animals and humans as emerging from the ground like plants are some more again if not environment the fundamental realities our land and the waters and everything emerges out of that and muddy land would be here wonderful wonderful thing it's muddy girl stuff grow some stuff so there's a cosmological text with multiple ones oh yes this one's called the sheep in the week and so just
 attention to the nearest cosmology what the assumptions are about the nature of the world began saying when upon the hill of heaven and Adam the hill of Heaven and Earth Cosmic Mountain where Heaven and Heaven is a d t names on who's the Prime Minister of all the other God like Autumn is to Egypt on isn't America mouth but the beginning of everything is up on Hill we're having dinner with meat that's interesting you so they're up on that hill on the deity spawned the Divine godlings since he neither spawned nor created Grand with them and sense in the land he neither fashion to the yarn of you to the goddess of weaving nor pegged out of the Loom 402 no sheep appearing no numerous Lambs no Goats No numerous kids the Sheep did not give
 Earth was twin Lambs the goat didn't give birth no grain from the mountains no grain from holy habitations no cloth to wear the Divine Weaver had not been born no Royal turbine was Warren no precious Lord no Kings had been born the wild animals had not gone out in the barren lands people in those days didn't know about eating bread they didn't know about clothes they went about naked in the land like sheep they ate grass with their mouths they drink water from the ditches
 this is where remembering the pre-creation state ancient humans during when civilization had a new phenomena back what was before human civilization and naked human they could humans eating like animals
 they're remembering they have a recollection of them creation is about order being brought to Civilization V the the ability to know how to bake bread bread clothing there's no Weaver so before there's any weaving before there's any domestication of animals before there's any Kings before there's any bread for all this either he's just in this is all the create the setting of when the gods came to be a long paragraph about day pre-creation state Pier but it's really slippery human civilization state right but that's the point. The point is that their concept of creation isn't focused on the material Origins it's focused on the origins of order the cosmic which creates human civilization comes from the gods
 and the pre-ordered state is the pre-creation state in our modern cosmology we think of existence as the material the existence of matter exactly in these cosmologies existence is ordered reality ordered Cosmos with with humans that's part of it in civilized order and that's what's being created by the gods The Ordering of the universe but the gods themselves going to represent all the matter you know like the diet and they self generate I mean he was just he was on he's just there on the hill to Heaven and Earth
 and he's spawning divide godlings when the prime deity is back their spawning all the other deities when did that happen well before there is any order and then those gods are going to go on to become all the features that are responsible for the order around us about this example is that's a good example of how their concept of creation is about the ordering of reality not be coming into physical existence of matter that makes sense except for in the Egyptian one it does seem like they're also talking about Barry adding that's right like emerging out of water and a bag of everything and then that sucks dividing into current all matter my point being this one up is actually this is more like how Genesis to work so Genesis to just begins with dry desert
 this land here and it says but there was no Agriculture and there were no humans here at work the ground and it was just right Springs coming up out of the ground water the land where to begin. It's the same type of mindset as we just read pre-order it was the desert the desert and so creation is about God creating ordered human civilization to create order and take it somewhere so the Sumerian texts like genesis 2 more like Genesis one now this is taking for granted the fact that there are two creation narratives in Genesis wanted to do we haven't talked about yet I'll get there but I mean if someone's listening to conversation that's right. Well there are two narratives that make up Genesis 1 and 2 from day one to day 7
 the Sabbath and then the second Story begins in Genesis 2 verse 4 with back when there was no Agriculture and there were no humans and every bit like a let's do that again let's talk about how could it assumes that it exists the Dryland whereas Genesis one is even really for sure they're correct stop monitor where is Sumerian Sumerian is the culture that existed in the packets yep tigris-euphrates Tamia after Sumerian culture pass from the scene what took its place and overshadowed it was the ancient Babylon came into existence so talking after Hammurabi Hammurabi is a key figure in the early founding Store The Babylon we're somewhere in the 1700's BC but in the same era and these were the text that George Smith
 resented the Babylonian Genesis so right this is the golden fishing stuff exactly
 there's one just came to be called the actresses that pic so you have it a tear of pre-existing DTS they just exist but they exist in really clear social order you have and Lil Danny Manuel who's kind of like Autumn or on in these other ones he's just there before everything else the chief deity, and he's got to Cody it is that he's mad ones call dhanu the sky ruler and 1 called Yankee got a fresh water under them or the upper-class deities called the Annunaki and then under them are the lower class deities who called the geeky I like them you like them as a crew of deities what does this is a this is a concept of the deities existing and a class in a class order that mirror is precisely onto Powell Babylonian culture
 very small number of people at the top track of rulers and then you got the upper class Quran and you got the Lord then you got the lower class and so the Iggy are the ones who actually make the cosmos run being tired of feeding providing food and clothing for all the gods above them so they staged the first labor union walk out walk out and they both go to enlil and they protest and they say all we'd ever do is work for you guys we get no benefit out of it LOL and the Anunnaki they send out these negotiators and what they agree on is hit let's make some robots some automatic ones who will serve all of our needs for all of us
 so what was that is weird robot just like menial work machines are work machines got it and so what they do is they get a a junior deity from the upper class and I slit his throat sacrifice him and they pour out his blood on the class with the clay and they make men's suede the Gigi the lower class yes the tired of feeding all the gods are like we can probably Outsource this to some even lower class yeah that doesn't exist yet doesn't exist yet and I have a great idea to do it take one of the higher class guys but one of the kind of lower of the higher class guys kill him kill him slit his throat fix the blood with clay clay and produce humid is the origin of humans
 so imagine in a culture this is the founding story if I said hey if I lived as a ancient Babylonia and I was like hey Mom what did this all come from and she would say well one of the one of the Gods flip throw another God and then guess what our King says he's the physical embodiment of these guys is different the upper-class the priest in the king's claiming to be the physical embodiment of these deities that's convenient which means I'm their slaves are really telling a story about that we are to feed them to giving Divine legitimation to even though they were also produced from the same yeah that's why the clay sacrifice baby they're connected to these other gods in the way that we're not correct so that's your founding story for the origin of humans it's the blood of the Gods Plus
 play makes humans to be slaves for the gods was imagining like telling a story to a class of kindergarteners so you know why you're here
 so as The Story Goes On why don't you think this is all public demand you just going to read the translations of it Charley fascinating after not very long of the humans doing all the work the problem is they smell but those other flashy and they make noise and Millie multiply like rabbits they love to have sex and so all of a sudden the gods regret having made all these humans and so the Anunnaki make a plan and they appeal to end well to send a flood to annihilate them but thank you who is one of the chief Gods along and low he thinks this is wrong and so he goes to warn the hero of the Epic atrahasis and he tells them to build a boat for a flood that's going to last 7 days he tells him to take the animals to get on the boat and there's this massive cataclysmic flood that comes wipes out all the humans except atrahasis
 his family and the animals on the boat and then is the waters recede he sends out Birds to go back and forth to see if the ground is dry and so on and walk to the biblical flood story but also really different story as you can tell by the flood was because of the Gods got annoyed at the smelling noisy humans that were supposed to just feed them and so has given him and the one guy was like that's not completely get rid of them correct and he hooks up where the flood story yeah the point is is that the flood stories were a dominant they were already a dominant Trend a way of talking about who we are where we come from and this isn't a civilization that wanted to get here that wants a year it's flooded gets flooded and that occasionally with cataclysmically flooded so much water that it just ruins the same the same gods that provide
 is the annual floods to survive sometimes are so angry and too much that's three generations ago our ancestors told us they are almost everybody was wiped out why they do that well wish lanolize messy and sometimes they don't like us and we existed there women get this kind of thing you can say you have a story like that would develop and you can see what a story like that would do to your psyche yeah it's not too different from like the Matrix type of were slaves to whatever beings are already know whatever that with those workers are the put humans in those weird incubators and are milking them for their life and Consciousness and then they put us in a razor batteries are at their mind I'll put them in a matrix two different so that's okay I've left the Crown Jewel for the last how you doing
 it's a lot to keep straight and I'm not asking you to keep all the details of course it's more just a big picture each one of these cosmology is I'm bringing out cuz it anchors into one real noticeable feature we go through three different nations yes because my allergies and all of them have certain connections to Jen Joseph wanted to correct and we're like dropping hints at what those are but we're not going into details imagining ourselves into the cultural environment of an ancient Israelite for stories that are now going to inform the next story which I really want you to care about correct the most that's what I'm doing is the stories crazy they have strange words do I have strange ideas it's hard to keep straight and do my best
 okay that's fine I know that this is not reading ancient near Eastern cosmology is here it's not like taking a walk okay so the the Babylonian Empire developed in such a way that it both recognized that I owed its existence to the Sumerian Empire that came before it but also claims that it was a new manifestation of the divine power and will for the world so what the Babylonian cosmology is often do is they adopt earlier ideas from Sumerian about the waters or the desert but in Hammurabi's Hammurabi's age the patron God of Babylon was named Marge and Homer Arby's age when you say that when you mean in Hammurabi's Hammurabi is connected with the. Of the rise of Babylon when it becomes a world by the political economic power and therefore they told stories about why and how this Kingdom came to power and Margie Duke was the sponsor
 God of this Babylon and so what they often did is if you are up early was here and I didn't know your son have been well there's a whole story is called a leash or the Babylonian Genesis it's the story of how marduke who was second Comer came to be appointed by all as the chief of all and it's a political mythology that has his analog with the rise of Babylon in the place of ancient Sumeria so think of Sumeria as the chief Babylon is he up start by saying this is the mythology about the rise of Margie and low as the chief God but he has a kid marduke and Marty's been taken over you got it in Mar de copas don't step on a crack in a lease begins with the akkadian words into the a leash which means this is begins with the with the uncreated State win on high no name was given to him
 nor below was the underworld called by name primeval Absol Apso is the deity but it means the deep is the deep ocean water so the Primeval ocean waters was their progenitor the one who gave them birth give birth to head to the sky into the Netherworld in the last line of opening statement and Creator T amount which is the salt water was the one who gives birth in the Deep abyss and Cat fresh water and it's the fresh water or below the land below the land it's the best under the land and then Tiamat is the salty water and this is before heaven or the Earth exist are they procreating together opportunity is freshwater and saltwater have a baby get together and they are they are the uncreated
 State of the State is salt and freshwater been mixing and mingling and notice how it's at this before having an earth so just so similar to Egypt also noticed that the creation of the heavens and earth is just as said when the heaven had no name and when the underworld was not called by a name so it exists then but just wasn't named what to be named is to have existence of Genesis 1 what did they just not happenin we talked about this there was no category of nothing that's fine what I sow hear what exists is the waters the different kinds of waters mingling together and this is before having a nurse in the labor before they were named answer the question is yes for them to the name means to exist in a meaningful way within a functioning ordering system listed maybe in some sense
 not nice if that mattered is that matter to them it's right so it goes on the water is mingling together no Gods had been brought forth the opposite of freshwater TMI the salty waters are there deities deities in a different way they're like primeval states are non-existent their non-being but they are potential and the potential for business, the water is in the Egyptian mythology none were called by names no Destiny sword and then the gods were formed Within These two so I have another picture from let's see this is from a stone cylinder found in ancient Mesopotamia and it depicts the freshwater God they're Seated on a throne he seemed in the middle of that will picture and he's surrounded by those lines those lines where the water's proceeding out from him so
 the god sitting in the middle is the first guy who's going to be born to emerge to give order to it all and then the two types of waters surrounding him on those two streams and are the two depression siwa. OK Google. Idea is you have the waters and then the first deity emerges from the water and you bring the order and so now the waters exist in nice ordered shape and then they flew out from the deity out into the world that they're very common way that they thought about it the first DD emerges so the first God and his name is Anki you're a God and he orders them so that land can a marriage and everything can emerge out of it so Anki establishes order so he brings order to the waters to hear something new we haven't had yet is the Tiamat after order and the gods and merge and this is almost it says if Sumeria emerges out of the pre-existence the gods of Samaria
 then shows up and she has formed an army of chaotic dark underworld enemies is the salty ocean the batches of the shoreline so now he's got dry land we've got a civilization we've got order the water's coming I ordered way water the land that the gift of the Gods okay so that's all set up and I'll get setup we know that story already what's interesting now is there's a new threat crashing on are on the beach and it's chaos Waters right think of the tide in the waves yeah he's no tsunami down there so they imagined even though the old gods were there in the established order the forces of chaos came knocking at our door and those forces are in the form of Tiamat who's a great water dragon so Tiamat forms alarm
 it's going to threaten to overtake the order of the old world so I'm quoting again ranks Drew up at 2 a.m. outside angry and scheming never lying down at night or day like the sleepless zombie army making Warfare rumbling raging convening an assembly that they might start hostility Invincible weapons giving birth to monsters serpents pointy things merciless incisors she filled their bodies with venom for blood Fierce dragons that she cloud with glories whoever sees the Army will collapse from weakness serpents dragons Harry hero men the wires ancient warriors of Old Lion monsters scorpion men scorpion Mighty demons Fishman bull man I was just like the whole yeah so Babylon comes in come to the rise of power it and after a collapse the Sumerian
 clapson Babylon emerges so this is a whole story that's going to be saying listen the whole ancient world that we all knew about from the Sumerian past collapsed chaos threatened War famine who emerged to rescue the world from the dark powers of Tiamat and Chaos Chief God is all the chaos that came out of the collapse the Sumerian correct she came yes it's just a horde of that's right I like it's right about the claps of the Sumerian Empire five main factors there was a famine there were three bad kings they would leave at the Scorpion man that civilization in the order all of it the weather producing Harvest that allow them to make the financial resources history that was all a gift of the Gods okay so that collapses that mean
 either our guides our week or somebody's attacking us and the forces of chaos or closing it to do and so the whole story of Animalia it's just about how marjuk the son of enki arises to fight the cast dragon now the chaos Dragon well sorry it's TMI who is the ocean water is that the right there but on the page that follows that we don't have to read it it's a poetic description of the battle and Margie just go straight to him up I'll just I'll just ask her magic takes a mess in his right hand is taking all this whole Army of crazy things all I'm self yes but he's bypassing the Army and going for T&M yet totally I'm imagining it feels like he's spending and Dodge in the bull man and he's another scorpion man and he's going to go straight for the queen
 done for the queen queen of chaos and one hand Thunderbolts before his face like a big staff with a metal spiky ball on the weekend he covers his body with fire and the other nip he's going to catch him up so he deploys the Four Winds he brings out the Four Winds from the four points of the compass and he's going to trap he starts making a whirlwind Cyclone he mounts his terrible Chariot which is a storm then he he in circles her in the net catches big net cast a net around 2 a month and up to this point has water the water is yes but she's she's in the form of a dragon a dragon in the net
 in the poem he brings her clothes he drives are near so that she thinks I've got to get our guy got a dragon internet you Trickett you make it think it can swallow you by bringing it in here that's his strategy, I want to get this thing to open its mouth so he brings it nearer to him then to your mouth open her mouth to swallow and he thrust in the winds so she couldn't close her mouth and he sends all the winds now to blow down her throat like a few sat in front of a really powerful fan that blows your cheeks open Bright Eyes Open to say Pathway to the to the heart to the heart now I said I'm going to hang up on this and it's a powerful enough to like half of the Dragon but it's not powerful enough of the Dragon can't like swallow martic through it
 it's through one of the holes they going to swallow marduke and at that moment Mary's right he's riding the storm Chariot so he sends the wind is he sends the winds pool opens up her go by herself I guess all the way down he sent an ill wind that he released in her face TMI opened her mouth he thrust in the ill wind raging winds bloated her belly shot the arrow it broke open her belly cut to her innards were shot an arrow through her down her throat in her belly pierced the heart he subdued her snuffed out her life flinging down her carcass he took a stand upon it marduke Patron God of Babylon Saves the World from the chaos dragon
 calling ancient Samaria he's battling chaos it correct of dude yet after the marathon crafted narrative that said the fall of ancient Sumeria there were five main factors what happened because the order of Samaria fell now there's enough order this and it's all this stuff I think of the profits when they depict the fall of Assyria the stars fall from the sky the earthquake no humans no animals its Cosmic poetry to describe the significance of these historical events that's what's happening here too and so it's a battle of the car Gods to bring about a new world order and so margit Patron God of Babylon is the one who saved us all with the rise of the Babylonian Kingdom
 is he is Tramp you know Standing On Top of Piedmont and so you have an inner Authority existed from the old guard for what he does is he takes her body he splits her into like a fish for drying laser laser of her he set up and made as a cover of heaven so half of the dress like one of the bike and never sees the waters cast water so I don't know what the Skydome already existed but now I'm marjuk is it says he's reestablishing the cosmos he's he's remaking retreating where is it was threatening collapse is recreating order and so now Martin even though he's not the originator like Yankee his father but now he's the one responsible for the current world order so he is now responsible for the heaven the laser and half Buzz half she is salt water dragon half above water
 yeah and then puts half below and it goes on and then says and then marduke ascended to the top of the Dome and built his Great temple Benny what up above built the Heavenly temple temple which if you go to the capital city of Babylon you're going to go see a huge ziggurat this the tallest thing going up into the heavens and it's the Great temple power Babylon
 belts to reach up to the sky down and to touch and connect with the Heavenly Temple that marduke built above the sky dumb it's the Heavenly version of the Earthly Temple so this is all connected in their worldview mardukas responsible for the current world order he dwells is Temple above the sky dumped him out that he conquered and our Earthly Temple is like the portal up into his Heavenly Temple I so there you go home and there's so much more that we could read here but this is the Babylons Foundation story if you just Google Margie to continue Matt you'll get some of the most famous images in the battles depicted sometimes team out to seven-headed Hydra Dragon sometimes TMI is a bull lion Wing monstrosity of this that float through out and then this basic skull is called this the combat mess but this appears in
 Canaanite literature as well except it's not Marge's gets bail who's the patron God of ancient Syria to the North of Israel also conquered our God is the real one real established order different cultures putting their God in this lot of March because I became the most famous that became the story that you tell to talk about your God is the most powerful in your Empire's most powerful so it's both a cosmology bales of God of the god of the Canaanites North of Israel there different titles syrians how they appear in the in the Old Testament or the new important cuz it honors the most ancient cosmologists of everything emerging out of the water established the first world order but then it's about chaos ending on our world and who rescued us from the chaos marduke who defeats the Dragon
 establishes the new world order out of the waters and so in this world is another group of people yes and they have their own identities write their story is that their God rescued them out of Egypt and these are the Hebrew Israelite Israelites yes and so we're going to read their ancient creation stories and we're going to see is how it really isn't a dialogue with these other ones in the same way that marduke is in dialogue to the Sumerian yeah that's right. It explains correct the ancient Israelites knew about all of this and the vocabulary and the mental models and all that stuff is shared but they want to explain why they are particularly important but then also their God as being ultimately Chief God
 we call this Genesis chapter 11 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast if you have some questions concerning the series on Ancient cosmology we would love to hear them and record a question in response episode with them so send us your questions by June 18th record yourself asking your question try to keep it to 30 seconds or so and let us know your name and where you're from next week we're going to dig in deeper in contrast to the Babylonian conception where Tiamat has to be slain and annihilated before the cosmos has created the biblical picture doesn't portray the destruction of the waters or the best rather their control and ordering by Yahweh within the created Cosmos so the portrait is that God can make the unproductive state of disorder work in
 his purpose to bring about ultimate order today's episode was produced by Dan demo and Zac mckinlay are show notes by Lyndsay Ponder and the theme music by the band tense Bible project is a nonprofit organization we exist to experience the Bible as unified story that leads to Jesus so we use all sorts of media to that end and we are increasingly Building Technology products to that ended everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you all over the world pitching in and paying for it which is incredible honor so thanks for being a part of this with us hi this is Anthea and I'm from South Africa I first heard about Bible project through a friend I use Bible project for research my favorite thing about Bible project is its incredible visual representation of the word
