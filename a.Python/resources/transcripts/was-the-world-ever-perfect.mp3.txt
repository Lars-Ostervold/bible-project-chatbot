we've been tracing a theme in the Bible that we've been calling the chaos Dragon the God but it is a rival to the inhabitants of creation because it's the opposite creation which is order we've looked through the entire Hebrew Bible have the dragon appears on day 1 of creation how violent even kings are compared to the chaos dragon have spiritual evil to become entwined powers of chaos and death and all of this actually can kind of get confusing and I want to make sure I really understand what the biblical authors are trying to say when they employ the image of the chaos Dragon evil is the opposite of creation the creation is to bring about a garden order then to do evil is really just undo creation will talk about why the biblical authors employ this ancient symbol of the chaos dragon in the first place and what does it mean that humans can become chaos dragon
 and will consider a big concern of mine which is why is there the potential of chaos swimming in the dark abyss and I thought God made a perfectly good world and then we screwed it up God has not set up creation to exist instantly and its ideal form he has set up reality so that it Journeys from chaos into the perfect and that Journey constantly forces God's rulers to make conscious decisions about whether we will align ourselves with the will and wisdom and goodness of God or feel lost to do our own version of good usually how we end up I'm doing good today to Mac and I are talking about the problem of evil and the theme of the chaos Dragon bring it all together before we move on in the New Testament I'm done calling the new listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hi John hey how are you today I'm doing good I just mention to you I feel like I've been doing a poor job on the station's I worry about people listening through and just be swallowed up by the dragon of the dragon as we Wade through all that I feel like I keep asking similar questions over and over and not sure if we're making new ground but I do feel like we are progressing Through the Bible does not necessarily with greater understanding you know I worried that people might be peeling off Michael this is just okay let me start with the and opening meditation
 so this morning I was on a run and listening to a lecture by the biologist British biologist main Rupert sheldrake I forget exactly how this turned onto his work really interesting character but it was about
 the study of form in order in the biological sciences he could said this is kind of an age-old question that goes back to Greek philosophy but it's just really intuitive to The Human Experience with just like when we look around why do things take the shape that they do and it's actually a question made intensified in the modern Sciences which has for many people the vast majority you do a naturalist materialist kind of set of assumptions for studying material reality and so the question is you know this so this is like atoms and molecules bouncing off each other what makes them take the certain shapes that they do the form things like why isn't it just Perpetual static buzz like what is it that makes molecules stick together and certain patterns and the worm take the form form of things that we caused basic level were talking hydrogen atoms yep that's right then get fused to
 weather to become oxygen atoms and helium atoms and I don't remember the order yeah that's right and then they become societies of atoms but in certain combinations then they accommodated into molecules yeah so he was talking about her at every level from that level up to the formation of cells to the formations of different types of organisms are proteins in cells in an organism yeah yeah on up to the organization of the material that makes up our brain up to the formation of planets and galaxies and at every level there's a whole set of like in tractable unavoidable problems which is why do these things take the shape that they do so regularly isn't every set of possibilities constantly being realized but like reality somehow Works in these channels and patterns don't have to take certain form but not always
 sometimes things deviate from their form and so in Greek philosophy you know the two kind of main Rivals were platonism there's an eternal ideal reality where the ideal forms of triangles and galaxies and humans and plants exist and reality is just a shadow version of that then there's Aristotle was a modification of platonism that said no they're actually is and I deal for him but it's not in some ethereal reality the ideal form is itself when he called the soul Suka in Greek which is there's an inner principle of mind or intelligence at different levels and that's really fascinating to learn about this but like he believed in the vegetative saw the plan are stalled in ya another words it's an energy or a force a mine so just break
 plant type of mind right that's driving plant material to take all these different forums movie modern thinkers talk about that in terms of Consciousness there's different levels of consciousness yeah it depends on what things are you talking about the guy and then there's the animal Consciousness which has plant level Consciousness but then a few more layers of sensory input and then humans have both plant and animal and then a level up with rationality and reason son but there's this order and that it's a surrounding or top-down set of forces that's driving the organism forward sheldrake's can I contrast is he said the naturalist materialistic worldview can't really account for form
 because if you're saying that there's no driving purpose or principle towards which all of this matter is aiming at then you have to account for the all of the forms of reality from the ground up and said each stage at which a protein combines and becomes the next level of thing in the next level of thing there's an infinite number of possibilities that open up but it could become reality keeps becoming certain types of things right and so the question is can you account for it from the bottom up that just out of chaos comes order randomly or is there some larger enveloping principal or form a pattern to which things are stretching toward toward becoming tell me what he says essentially what we've come to call what Aristotle called The Soul we call it Fields gravitational field
 clear fours Riley thinks all the forces yes force fields fields and he said they play in our minds the same role that the concept of Soul did in like a turtle that look like the Higgs boson the whole idea behind that is that the reason why matter has any sort of weight I suppose I think it is because her actual wait wait by Mapei. But there's a field called the Higgs field and actually gives matter the attribute of weight the metal Concepts is this we humans have been able to perceive for Millennia the reality is composed of parts
 right now we just have the ability to look smaller and smaller and bigger and bigger to see the parts that reality is combined of and we know that reality can take certain forms in orders that are conducive for human life and flourishing and for our minds to be able to like engage with reality and understand it and like cooperating with it but there's also this principle that all of those parts sometimes do and could at any moment just all the order could just fling apart and the question is what prevents it from Just Right shattering apart at any given moment fields and then what is it that keeps channeling everything to keep producing itself or reproducing itself in the certain types of forms and not others and I just dropped Mia. I was listening to his talk I just thought this is Genesis 1
 what is the concept of reality of Chaos versus separating things into orders and Realms and kinds and then coordinating their cooperation towards the production of life in flourishing and community and beauty and goodness and so on and we're having these conversations about the chaos dragon and I think that is essentially what this set of symbols in the biblical story is about chaos vs. order
 is but the fun one of the most fundamental categories of biblical thought and that order is this exertion of a force for the fathers of mind that can address the disorder of chaos which is what we would call nothingness and impose upon it in order so that that material that has no form all of a sudden is channeled along certain lines to produce and reproduce and that's the gift of God's blessing in Genesis one is that he both orders by separating and organizing things in the categories but then infuses them with a life of their own that's part of life right but infused to begin to reproduce and make more and
 whatever chaos is it's the opposite of that and so what the drama is about the dragon is that there are creatures inhabitants in all the different Realms God's world and they can either participate in the progression of order and Beauty towards the Garden or they can become like a drag I like a momentum drag that prevents creation from going where God intends it to go and it's like they pull it backwards back into the chaos and the first creature that we're introduced to this doing that is a snake crawled out of the Wilderness into the garden and through its deception gets the humans to choose as good their own ruin their own death and dissolution back into the ground in the test of the Wilderness then the humans can become agents
 of that chaos and death and disorder and I think whether or not the stuff about biology for the first 5 minutes of what I was saying was helpful at all I think that's what fundamentally with the set of Concepts and this video is about what I think the meditation on biology is just another way into thinking about life force of death of chaos vs. order think about scientifically thermodynamics versus like you know whatever energy Mordor energy conservation is and Fields and all that stuff but then we're completely out of our home. But the idea of life and death chaos in order like we get and then you can apply it and that will destroy the Bible then discuss his ideas God comes to a chaotic state which we talked about described in different ways was it the opposite of anything existing other than God
 yeah it is depicted as the chaos Ocean View
here's what I'm struggling with can we do this theme of the dragon can we do it by just focusing in on this one image of a dragon in the sea and being consumed by the dragon or do we have to talk about what the dragon is in the dragon connected to a bigger set of themes the themes of Chaos in chaos creatures so now you're talking about some sort of spiritual level and the Bible can use fallen stars they can use just the idea of death itself
 so do we need to explain all of that I mean I think the answer is yes I think I think you can't do the theme of the dragon and get to the Revelation where the Great Dragon was in the sky now and you know it is obviously more than just the chaos creature and it feels to me like a much bigger video then we typically do you mention the God video when we started making that video I thought I was wanting to be like 20 minutes long the other day we got it down to about eight seven or eight seven or eight with a lot of work and I'm very satisfying for some people I heard cuz it felt like we had a really smooth over a lot of things and not talk about a lot of things like for example I want to spend more time talking about these realms
 creatures relate to these Realms I really want understand that because I feel like to understand this team at its largest I need to get that more than our conversations Genesis 1 I noted that there are two Realms of disorder that are contained and then yeah framed within the order that God makes of the darkness contained By the Light but it's still there in the cycle and then the sea is not done away with entirely but it's now given a boundary of where I can and cannot be it can't be up on the dry land and then you flip to the eating their Devon you have the Wilderness which is the opposite end of the garden to get these three images Darkness see and Desert Inn in opposition to light dry land and garden and so on a literal level I can I start using the word literal and figurative but maybe that's a bad
 can I suggest experiential on the experience for level I can experience the Wilderness experience the ocean but then there's a level of meaning a deeper level of like significance what is that mean like you told the story a few I don't know whenever it was about being out in Mount Hood Wilderness and hearing coyotes in Solana experiential level you were in the wilderness hearing the hunting cries of coyotes yeah I couldn't hit by the look in my son's eyes that's how it felt to him on the level of meaning
 suddenly the krait you felt like the cries of like little girls screaming and the horror of it was running to connect you to this deeper sense of horror and Dread of like life is fragile and people need to be protected and there's suffering and pain out there and death is at the doorstep I'm on the knife's edge of like disaster I got the level of Mike meaning so when we get to the look in your eyes when you said that the knife's edge you know you mentioned earthquake and there was that earthquake as happened in Syria and turkey and they pulled out that girl
 seven days a little girl alive after 7 in rubble for 7 days and nights just like what does that even mean like so she was on a literal level like in rubble or something special level in trouble but like in meaning as she was and she all she was in death that's right yeah pulled out of that so you get these images of the Wilderness of the Sea of the night sky and an experienced a level like I can go out and watch the sea and it's okay I if I staled out there I've been sailing on a rough day and it's like it's intimidating to be wandering around at night when it's super dark and what that feels like you could be on the Wilderness and coyotes
 but then like the level of meaning is I think we're Genesis starts right like it employs those three images of those settings that we can experience but it's saying hey I'm not talking about these like literally like there's this level of meaning underneath of these there's the place of chaos of no life and so what I'm wondering is when men God creates the order right so then he separates the light from the darkness he separates the land from the ocean he creates the garden separates from the Wilderness now I can go I can go and see that ocean and now does the ocean the ocean represents
 the same feelings and meaning of the chaos but it's also just the ocean in one day yeah sure and like the Wilderness like Israel can water out the Wilderness in a meaningful way they're out in chaos that's right but they're also just in the wilderness and they can still survive out there and creatures can survive out there and then humans are told to rule over the creatures in the sea and the creatures in the sky and they're told to be no work the garden and there's this kind of the sense of like and you put it this way before the god his creamies outposts and it was to expand so I'm wondering because I'm saying all this to say when we talked about creatures in these Realms we've been talking about the chaos creatures are the serpent playing in the ocean just one of God's creatures and an experiential level
 like we get it this whales out there like I might like fascinating person I encountered a whale and I think it's like this Dragon but then on the level of like meaning as we tell these Tales of like the Sea Dragon it become something much larger and it's trying to connect to something deeper which is what you were talking about which is like what's dragging the cosmos back into destruction like what is the energy or Force that's like unraveling order and I feel like it's confusing to me as we can talk about the dragon is just one of God's creatures but then suddenly it becomes Cosmic Cosmic Cosmic Tyrant or Cosmic threat we could talk about being out in the wilderness like there's we read in one of the prophets about Babylon being cast out into the Wilderness and his ID and make a sound to death but there's like animals out there and they even become an animal out there and like then there's like a feast out there it's like you can serve
 I don't know Wilderness we can I mean we can't imagine it I think it's much more difficult for her nicer person. Yeah the biblical authors to imagine that cuz he had we can fill up for leather bottles of water are in how much water can you carry with you really that kind of thing is still true this is water out there I mean the animals without their their drinking something or some of them highly adapted though and we are not and that's the point so these are Realms where we can't live in this kind of oil and we build a real live out in the ocean we can't live out in the sky
 so the Realms where Humanity can't like exist so what does it mean for God to put creatures there that aren't humans and then what does it mean for those creatures to then become anti creation creatures and I feel like I almost feel like I need to understand that before I can really start to appreciate some of the Dragon it's interesting what did it mean the biblical authors that God put the tan Dean in the ocean on a fire so I guess maybe so one we are coming to the story The Bible which begins in the beginning so it has the feeling that it's creating all your categories of reality is even turned into the story world and go into it however that story itself took shape in a cultural context where certain ideas and images already existed
 and the dragon was one of them in fact the dragon in the chaotic see was one of the most well-told ancient near Eastern symbolic stories which is why we're still telling it today just in different forms so in that story the dragon and the katiksiz was like a main fixture of the ancient imagination and so the biblical authors start in the way that the sea is described and Leviathan is described in Genesis 1 is itself in response to or a conscious tweak away from a dominant way of thinking about reality which is the reality is the result of a Mortal Kombat between order and chaos but aren't we glad marduke one another year cuz we're all still here living in you know the shelter babylon's piece so the biblical authors want us to come out of the gate and say
 the most primary reality is the Beautiful Mind in the generous host of all creation that one is reality and there is no force that is rival everything is subordinate to the will and the purpose and generosity of that one and so therefore the chaotic C is not a rival of God it is a rival of creation because it's the opposite of creation which is the order and then for the creatures within creation the chaos dragon is not a rival to God but it is a rival to the inhabitants of creation do you think did he start out that way the Sea Dragon was it always
 when the Sea Dragon is placed in the chaotic see is that an idea of saying God separated the chaos from the land it's still chaos out there and one way for us to imagine that chaos is in this creature out there that if you encountered it it would take you out and that seems to be part of what the role of the Bison plays in the speeches God speeches of Jobe will look at in the future conversation cuz God saying he's a part of your world in fact you just you know it took a few swings at your job and it's not saying it's evil it's just that sits roll the cast of chaos creature it's also not good because there's no door light that comes out of it so it's separated away from the land but it still exists that's right what's that about in the biblical imagination that God allows this round still exist because at the
 in the Bible the idea on a symbolic meaning from level is it the sea goes away and the dragon is done away with yeah so why I put on there why you keep the C & W I mean I know why the ocean exists like because like we're on a water Planet oh yeah yeah yeah yeah where's play some roll then yes when the biblical imagination what role does it play why does God allow it to exist and this is where I start to think we get into the problem of evil conversation that's right yeah but for the biblical authors when we think of the word evil we have a problem cuz we think of we have this category will evil is the result of an intelligent intention
 normally that's what we mean by evil something a person intense yeah that's why when I rabbit scratches my son we don't like punish it. It didn't intend to do evil but we do feel like we need to account for other types of disasters we call it natural evil always been a strange phrase moral evil evil that was philosophical in theology a problem of evil what type what types of evil is naturally at all with the earthquake rabbit scratching your son's okay but we me and then it's just something that unpleasant to submit bill. There's there's no separation there's just what is conducive for garden life and point you in that direction and all the good stuff that comes along with that and then there's its polar opposite which is the desert for the chaos Waters where the darkness and that's like they said like a spectrum for whatever reason the biblical story is governed by a beautiful mind
 and when that one wants to create something other than itself creation it creates it to exist in a way that it has to Journey towards the Divine perfect but God has in-store for it it has to go on a journey from nothingness towards the garden is where different than God. Perfect we screwed it up he's going to be perfect and yeah it was about the World of Genesis one is good but God orders and separates out calls good he calls good but then clearly it's called to become something much more would also be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth and subdue it so do it and ran over it I see images so this is about God partnering with a creature that is not God but as participants an image of God's own life
 and then is to partner with God and the journey from chaos to the garden and that journey is fraught with the possibility that it could endure many cycles of chaotic nothing this depending on how the partnership goes but the fundamental premise is that God chooses not to create the cosmic Garden he chooses to create a tiny garden Oasis and then install partners and its partners are surrounded by creatures and those creatures and the garden itself poses opportunities for God's creatures to choose life or to choose
 to think back in the chaos of their own well and they're the dragon is just introduced of Hey listen this is not the cosmic threat to God but it will play at Cosmic threat roll to the creatures to Creation self to Creation itself unless the humans learn how to trust God's wisdom and power to rule over that beast that's the meta reflection what's the biblical story doesn't say is why God does that Justice League that's how God has had set it up so the darkness is there the Wilderness is there in the chaos ocean is there
and going back to the very beginning this conversation with god creates creatures in these Realms so in the waters it's the sea dragon in the night sky it's the host of Heaven the stars and what to bring God's light to the darkness in the very ordered pattern right but we do have with the Stars is a backstory of sorts of going well why is there a force of decreation that's like a creature will you get a story of well I guess maybe this isn't clear in the Bible but it may be the second temple literature where you get the story of the Fallen Angel or the OIC well you get it was in the Hebrew Bible itself but the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel but what they're doing is they're looking back on those inhabitants on the stars and and on the dragon and on the snake and they see there a mirror
 sure of what has been happening in the human that the story of the human ruler so so the human rulers wanted more they wanted more power and more wisdom sooner and buy their own schemes whereas God wanted to give it to them but by his own timing in his own wisdom and so they see that story being played out in the human realm resulting and lots of death and chaos and they share with us the mirror Narrative of the snake snakes downfall and of the richest also the downfall of star Isaiah is that the big Cosmic bad guy is used as an analogy story for the king of Babylon so the king of Babylon can be likened to a star falling from Heaven because it tried to go up higher and then I also can be likened to the snake in the water so it gets head chopped off in the point is to say there's something deeper there's a deeper force and
 mating Nebuchadnezzar humans when humans unleash death and Chaos on the land we are actually participating in a much what do you say I'm much more substantial or a cosmic power of decreation that supposed to wear God's trying to take the world
so I think this is getting at the heart of maybe what I want to understand in the morning if needs to be part of this video is that that force in Summit philosophies there's like you said that is the yin and the Yang and there's just two opposing forces and it actually creates the cosmos as we know it and they're actually needs to be like the balance but it seems like we were talking about it saying No this is this ultimate creative Force everything relies on God and God and then when God comes to create he appoints creatures that we understand could use the land humans who bear His Image but then there's these creatures that God creates that also reflect his ruling power in the sky and when we decide
 to fight against creation we can create what we would call evil corruption and violence and in the same way so I can look like evil is the opposite of creation creation is the bringing about a garden order then evil is something that we do but evil is just detracting from the goodness it's actually not even doing anything to do evil is really just to undo creation on do good but you don't do evil even though that is literally house phrased in the Bible what doing evil means his undoing it feels like when something is happening the absence of good what is poverty except the absence of abundance what is paying except the absence of wholeness your pleasure interesting that's what's going on
 mirrored by a cosmic level on a cosmic level which we don't have a very clear view of it's like kind of just talked about in yeah it's a cosmic background narrative in the biblical story yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean is there from the beginning from the beginning and then it hovers in the background in significant ways throughout that story in the Bible at the foundation of the steamer feel like is understanding that there is a creature like us but unlike us like us in that this creature can reflect God's rule unlike us and that it lives in a realm that we can exist in and it has a type of being that just fundamentally different than ours and if we encountered one
 we would think this thing is crazy like in powerful and like you know ya let's do it again I was going to st. Joe's but now you're talkin about applying the category of Leviathan to these things and so how do we get how do we describe these creatures and we have to use something experiential yeah what else can we do but now it's bright Planet but a light in the sky that seems like I ought to behave with all the others in the normal patterns but it's deviant deviates from its pattern of experienced a level that's what we're seeing is very thing but I'm on a new level of meaning we're going I know there's this Force this is being that this creature like me but unlike me and it is in Rebellion
 and so I'll talk about the phones are all talk about the veneti creature creature but instead we send the store is that I hear it's just this chaos forces once a swallow everything up and death so then in my imagination then I'm thinking when I think let's go back to this the dragon now then to see Dragon so I employ the Sea Dragon think about the meaning of this chaotic force of being that and rebelling against God and wants to drag things and I do good
 when the Bible talks about the dragon like you said in Jobe we haven't talked about it yet sometimes it's talked about on when I'm calling experience a level right we're not saying hey this thing is the rebellious creature with a saying this thing exists like the ocean exists deal with it and we might think man this thing the problem and Godlike no sure it's a part of my creation but then we talked about the dragon as the rebellious creature when we take it and that's what we mean like we mean like the forces of the rebellious distraction what that means of being an inhabitant that is now purpose to undo good yeah now this thing this thing is built like seven headed dragon that needs to get laid open and Destroy its right and when the biblical authors want to talk about that
 when they pull out the full on dragon slaying mess up their neighbors that it's an enemy of Gods
 by being an enemy of his creation and he's going to kill it going to smash it and not let it prevent creation from going where God wants to take it what it's the other thing when it's just the creature in the sea represent in the cast of the sea is it a spiritual being away we would think of as the angels as the host of heaven or is it just hit the symbol is it just a creature like like a cow but of the ocean refers to the big thing out there yeah for sure and it occupies the same place as mountain lions do in my imagination yeah because of the Bible talks about lions and scorpions and those kind of things you don't see them haunted with spiritual evil as much or too you certainly did
 yesterday when we get there and Lumidee calls demons confrontations with demons treading on serpents and scorpions shaped by this is the same thing as saying there's a creature let's take this creature from experience level and less than let that thing become a symbol a symbol of this menacing destructive evil it's good so that works with the dragon but it also works with like Wilderness creatures is that how they think about the Stars it's the same thing with the Stars are how many understand that category of creature yeah well I mean the Stars Are Meant To Be glorious images of God's light that represent him in the darkness and they're called the rule creatures are not called the rule I'm just trying to play it out
 call the rule no and if it tries to rule that's you know it's like a the Rebellion so for a Star to deviate from the timekeeping courses in patterns and the lead people astray by going on a rebellious course to try to ascend higher and higher or try to hang on as long as possible while the sun is rising they like I'm going to resist the rule of the sun that's what's going on in Isaiah 14 write the morning start a Morning Star so that represents a creature of misusing its rules and responsibilities so what's so fascinating then about the merging of star and dragon imagery is this thank you John it's like a merging of the two where it's this thing is an intelligent representative of God like under the humans but really different right
 and it's called the rule within a certain round but then when you merge that idea with the cast monster then you have a creature called the rule that's chosen to be essentially work in opposition to God's purpose for creation and what a what a sad monstrous reality and this is certainly why I was kind of waiting for the right point to ensure this remember most of the Dragon images we talked to tell him up most of them are symbols for human behavior so they're the dragon is also a spitting image for another land ruler
 is it goes astray and becomes opposed to God's purpose for creation so the dragon symbol can be applied to the star Rebel Heart of the land Rebel helpful OK Google sway ultimately were talking about what we would call spiritual evil archangels and demons and I don't know the best words to use yeah that was too sweet and so what you're saying is look like humans are called to rule out of Heaven to call to rule and the Sea Dragon is put there in the galaxy but it's just another creature but it's a dangerous dangerous creature when we get the joke there's a dangerous land creature to the Behemoth that's right right and there's lions and then you know it's just like the creatures can be dangerous but they're not called to rule in fact we're call to rule over them and they're not necessarily they're not bad or evil they just like
 but they are not images of God they're not images of God and when we encounter them we could be encountering the creation like a lion to kill us at least there's something Primal yeah and maybe this is why historically that concept of rationality intelligence moral intuition these are the things connected to the image of God because these are precisely the things that experientially set us apart from animals in the neighbouring like stories the Sea Dragon is like yeah yeah trying to create chaos yeah the symbol of anti order there is kind of like I want to take down creation of Consciousness Locust it just does what it does is that's what the hell God's scribes these creatures in the speeches which I'm talking about in the neighbouring Miss I understand got it I don't know I haven't
 yeah but it is a rival to the storm God to the Rival and it wants to swallow up everything in death threat conference present
 but I feel like you were getting to something and I want to get back to it is that when we want to talk about the sky rulers and Rebellion all the sudden we could we go you know what is this chaotic creature in the sea and if that thing was in rebellion and became kind of this Cosmic hybrid of like the sky rulers with that that thing is the way to describe like the horror of what it's like for this spiritual evil to be in rebellion and that makes a lot of sense because you got all these stories around you that that's what they're doing they're employing that image and so you can just adopt that image and say yeah I like that thing that you've seen on The Clay Pot of the Dragon to the store you heard but in the world the way that the Bible want you to think about it is that these are God's creatures that are meant to rule like humans but are in Rebellion rebellion and the snakes
 image of snakes can fly and have wings in ancient imagination and they also go and underworld and they can go on the surface of the land until 1 all the say the dragon is like a vessel it away like the dragon to set of clothes but the costume feels like a costume yeah and I'm a rebel host of Heaven can be described with that costume when it plays the role of anti creation and humans listen to the snake whispering in their gear and become an instrument of anti creation humans can be described as dragons
 in fact that's primarily what dragon symbolism refers to in the Bible it's just count up the number of times human visible institutional are imperial evil but then you dig a little deeper than that and why is there yeah there's this alliance between our relationship is a relationship and I don't fully appreciate that yeah but humans are captive to do the will of the evil one kept slaves enslaved
custom the dragon is a costume to symbol that refers to anti creation it was so well known to the biblical authors that we near the pier as in Genesis one it's a dig it's a Twist on the well-known ancient near Eastern dragon slaying story where the dragon is the Rival to the storm God and anti creation the biblical authors introduced the dragon as a part of God's world but it's a part that's not scribe is evil but it's also not going to create the garden it's got something to do and needs to be subdued. The partners are the hosts of heaven but that partnership isn't really spelled out in detail but the main partnership is with the land rulers Dragon symbol can be used to describe deviant star rulers and deviant land in a way
 to use your category of natural a nice natural disaster or natural Evil versus what was the other two Morley Morley via what humans and the pictures are doing we would describe some moral evil and correct yes yeah yeah yeah but what the Sea Dragon does with the ocean does that's just natural that's just like the fact that what you said we're on a progression God didn't create a perfect State he separated out he allowed to place for goodness to thrive but then go and expand it what are you spending into we're expanding into yeah something's going to fight back that's right yeah and not cuz it hates you because I hate you it's just it's the opposite of what God and you want to make together that's the dragon that's the dryer at a beginning State the dragon is just dragging is a symbol a symbol of the cosmos fighting back against you that you have to subdue and so
 conversation number 9
 I think if I could go back and tweak now all the ways I've been talking about the Dragon live with now would you yeah just a little bit and maybe if I go back and listen to it it wouldn't be that different other words the dragon is a symbol and this is why there can be dragon-slaying scenes in a lot of passages were looking at but the opponent is the water's very often in these dragon-slaying text in the Hebrew Bible sometimes the dragon is there in the waters and sometimes the dragon's gone and it's just God versus the waters yeah and that's because they are two ways of talking about the same thing anti creation that thing is anti creation but not through the vehicle of a creature meant to rule but you the vehicle or something that needs to be ruled something to needs to be ruled by needs order imposed upon it okay like what I was trying to represent the views of Rupert sheldrake at the beginning
 it needs a mind a purpose imposed upon it to give it form in order otherwise it's just infinite unorganized potential and we talked about this in terms of you know a new creation a toddler to play with the snake so the snake has been ruled and now it's not that it's not there anymore its function has been changed into that now you have a relationship with me that's different and so you can then think about what does it mean for the ocean and for the Sea Dragon well in the age of imagination you're like we don't need the ocean in the new creation New Creation the ocean is the Revelation 21 22 no more see no more Dragon no more night right but when we think about New Creation we don't think about why we don't need the ocean right like Ocean Park creation release all Christians and atheists
 does every girl in the fifth grade for me to be a marine biologist
 it's amazing it's good but what does it mean to rule over and subdue the chaotic elements out there and expand the garden and when you encounter something that's not a like a not a mortal creature not a creature called the rule called the rule but when your countering a force that's fighting against you your encountering the dragon the dragon in the form of the ocean in a form of a lion rice or Scorpion or snake or in the form of your own mortality and Death Dragon you back down into the grave sites the dragon it's the dragon dragons like the bunny. It's just like that's what it does that's right and it's a way of saying God has not set up creation to exist instantly and it ideal form right
 he has set up reality so that it Journeys from chaos into the perfect into the ideal and and that Journey constantly forces God's rulers to make conscious decisions about whether we will align ourselves with the will and wisdom and goodness of God will peel off to do our own version of good witch the biblical story is trying to say we usually how we end up I'm doing good and so when we start here when we employed the dragon were using anyway very different than the Contemporary mythologies saying the dragon isn't arrival to God it's just a rival to us and cremation installation okay now
 that's a great place to start because then the next step is where you said earlier which is really helpful which is golden how can we best understand and describe what does it look like when the rulers above rebelled against their place what's a way to think about that then we take the dragon and we like hybridize it becomes even more terrifying hungry more terrified dragon with intelligent but now it's like the dragon The Crafty serpent comes down from the sky and actually now is what we might call moral evil it's like actually trying to corrupt us so now the dragon becomes more and that's the snake we meet in Genesis to its right and then what you said is when we get to The dragon-slaying Motif in the Bible that's what God is slang these nuts laying there like Leviathan that's what we were meant to rule over he's
 playing the more like Cosmic like hybridized evil and you can apply that to the Spiritual Beings you can apply that then also to us that partner with the Sky Dragon and become land dragons as it where which them bring the story Cain what you're experiencing that anger inside of you can it's in it's a monster that wants to rule you but you need to you need to rule it and now we're not talking about ruling the big thing out there in the waters yes we're talkin about ruling the rebellious evil force that mirroring and some way you're rebellious evil impulse it's humans partnering with a more
 intelligent more Cosmic force of anti creation
 and we just are dimly aware of it which I think is mirrored in why Ellen the biblical story those forces are so rarely explicit on the stage but they appear just often enough to let you know that they're there at least the biblical authors want you to see that they're there so this is the dragon is a costume is really helpful and so cuz I've been emerging I think I intuitively just because in all of these passages there's this linking of the Dragon with the star ruler as a rebel but very helpful because Genesis want to sing the dragon in the waters is just like the lion on the land break it's just this is what God says in job 40 whatever like like this is just another of my creatures that's right it's a way of talking about just the reality of God creating something other than God self to go on a journey towards Divine perfection
 and so the nothingness out of which it Journeys toward Perfection can be described with these images of anti creation and I think even there there's some complexity because again talking about experiential versus meaning I can go and experience a lion and it's just it's just another one of God's creatures yeah you can cuz you can see if I can yeah but I can see if there's an ally of the only people with the Leisure resources and desire to do that working which is why they're statues of like a king that you could go I can visit you know in the palace but when you see a statue he's like 9 ft tall mini holding a lie or yeah I saw that they were holding a lion by the neck cuz there's like a kitten so that's then the imagination of like all that guy
 you must be like a god yeah so David talks about slaying a lion yeah I mean he's like he's talking about being pretty impressive to bring order and creation that is real cuz he can he's confronted you know just the pass out there and overcome it but he does not overcome the chaos that Whispers in his ear I want that woman he didn't conquer that Dragon so back to the question can we talk about the dragon without talking about spiritual evil because in a way really most of the tax return, as a dragon is a costume and what is the cost of doing it's animating us and or it's humans and also what's the right word the costume is something that gets put on the the human rulers were the sky rulers when you
 are describing how their choices are not forwarding God's creation project rather they are dragging it back into the chaotic nothingness so the theme were talking about really is a deviant rulers yeah yeah yeah alright has been immensely helpful for me I think it's good. Then got more of your doing not employed in addition and I'm here with a friend of mine to say hello Evan if I will project on staff here for pretty close to five years so what I do is a little bit everything overseeing the Portland Building and the facility all the vendors that kind of come and go I have a big part in connecting with staff and its culture and
 onboarding process to way to just make sure that all of our team-mates are equipped with whatever they need to do their job was really important to me like on the hospitality side what are all the things that need to be done to make sure that someone feels welcome when I walk in the door so I'm going to open the room for a while I was a real elephant we used to Black and you have the same profile picture forever I want to look at your photo I'm pulling it up so you're in the left-hand side of the frame and your eyes are closed because there's an elephant standing next to you and you're holding his trunk and he has reached his end of his trunk up and he has it like on your left cheek your smile taking up your whole face the Highland Mist probably 2016 or so we went to an elephant farm and then they had an area where they were feeding elephants and opportune to go up and feed them and there was this one
 baby elephant that they said you know what if you could talk to this one elephant it'll give you a kiss and totally intimidated by this large animal even the baby you know it's like this huge suction cups like putting the band of a vacuum cleaner up to your face and tell me a little bit about your life outside work and love being outdoors or you still think when my daughters were young it was just a really important I'm just to like it was a a break like that was something I did for myself as like I took an hour in the morning to just like go do something else was good for me and I just became part of my routine and part of my lifestyle including producer
