opentracing the theme of the sea dragon in the Bible and today we arrive at the scroll of Daniel when the story of Daniel Begins the nation of Israel has been conquered by Babylon and many of its inhabitants have been carried off into Exile including Daniel and his three friends Shadrach Meshach in a Bendigo and right off the bat the narrator of Daniel points out that these guys are all from the line of David by saying in the opening lines that Daniel and his friends are from the Royal Steed the author's linking Daniel and his friends back to that ancient conflict between the seed of the woman Genesis 3 15 and then the snake and it's do the whole book of Daniel is a dramatization of Genesis 3 15 this is a story about the seed of the woman from the line of David who will defeat the dragon then we're going to expect to encounter service and so it's going to be no surprise in a day
 seven when there's drama of what's happening in the world is described as a drama between one like a son of Adam and then between this is monstrous series of B12 so monstrously can be described Daniel chapter 7 is an incredible apocalyptic dream that Daniel has Reese's for chaos monsters rising up out of the sea desert creatures that are in God's world but they're monstrous boundary-breaking what's important about all these beasts is the mixing of the categories Yahweh appears on his throne in the sky but there's another character as well but Daniel calls the son of man if he rides up on a cloud to meet Yahweh on the throne and between the two of them the monsters are slain if you go try the Hebrew Bible the only one who ever ride the clouds Yahweh but also the only one who sits on the cosmic from is Yahweh and no one
 two attributes of Yahweh the enthroned 12-step about the cloud is now being broken up into to figure the Ancient of Days was on the throne and then this one like the son of Adam today to Mackey and I are talking about the theme of The Sea Dragon Scroll of Daniel and then call it a new listing the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
it's all right we're moving through the Bible and a tracing the theme of the sea dragon as one does but like you do and man has been to the category Buster for me new pathways are forming to Clarity that your questions have push me towards in my own thinking has been really helpful too so I agree I've learned a lot so far so we're going to look at the images of the monster particularly in the Book of Daniel yes and this conversation and things are not going to get simpler I'm imagining yes you know we often do summaries at the beginning so maybe just I'll try and do the briefest summaries just set up what's happening in Daniel and Isaiah
 one way of thinking about the basic plot line of the biblical story is when a God who is existence in being in God's Own Self chooses to share that existence with a creature that is to make the creature with him to share existence God is not threatened by not existing in the biblical imagination God's distance but if God wants to share in genuine relationship with something that he brings into being that means calling into being something that was not and that is what creation and creation comes into being in Genesis 1 the language of its non-existence of pre-christian state is just a dark haddock ocean the sea and God brings them to existence a good but fragile order this just one little garden spot on the dry land protected from the waters and the water is in the darkness become the primary images of
 chaos disorder that threatened to good world of order and then there's also an inhabitant in those Waters called the sea monster and the sea monster well put in a realm where it belongs like the sea is just perpetually potential danger for the dry land and the creatures on the dry land if it were to exert its 4 but got put in its place and is a boundary boundary question in Atlanta and then partners with human images of God and exalts them to place of authority responsibility and partnership to take the blessing and life in order and goodness the God is establishing than to spread it to fill the land and spread that order in life and that's the potential of the biblical story but the question is will humans trust God's word and wisdom that established the order and
 create and spread God's order by his word and wisdom or will they choose to do what's good in their own eyes and as they do so we're introduced to another type of chaos image which is the Wilderness in the Garden of Eden story that's another picture that aligns with the dark chaotic Waters is a waterless lifeless Wilderness and there's also a corresponding sea monster in that Wilderness in the form of a snake that slithers into the garden of the where is the way I've been thinking about that because if we create the category for chaos and the creature of chaos a sea monster but it's in its place right so it's dangerous you know the ocean is dangerous to see mustard dangerous but it's in its place where it is it will as someone forces play play in the reason your way whatever that means chaos to be freezing out but one God of chaos it's like as an artist confronting a can
 lots of like a battle that's right and to slay the Leviathan he doesn't fight it he creates it and puts it out there in Genesis let me get Janice's too and there's another creature and it's not the Sea Dragon but it's a snake snake in the wilderness of the field which is another name for the uncultivated land out there and what we what you've drawn attention to is that the chaos Waters and the barren Wilderness are two different ways talk about the same idea which is rounds of chaos disorder or non order yeah and so snakes and scorpions and even like lions jackals become a way to describe and habitants of the Realms of chaos and I was just thinking about when Israel goes into the Wilderness when they are being liberated out of slavery but then they have to go through their time of testing in the wilderness there's a
 story of them complaining and disobeying and then got ten snakes venomous snakes come and it's the creatures of the Wilderness to bring death yeah that's exactly right and so just like the sea dragon is a creature of the sea that rings that snakes are creatures Wilderness to bring step the land dragon land dragon what's another way to think about you but what's so interesting is another layer here though because this isn't just a venomous snake this is a crafty symbol for an intelligent being yeah yeah there's some intelligence behind it it's how we began to talk about this is that it's another creature using the power of the dragon as a costume or as a front to describe an intelligent Heavenly being as a snake means that what it is doing through its actions
 what is spreading in God's world is not furthering the good order that God has in mind but actually dragging creation back into death and no longer that contained it's like out there yeah it's crawls into the garden and so this brings us to the story of how is there a like a fall in Rebel ruler of the sky and that's not what this team is really about or say yeah but there is one and he's co-opted the power of chaos he's outside the boundaries and he wants to deceive the land ruler yeah it's trying to exert its influence not within its proper realm or God assigned it but because her influence on creatures of another round on the land and then we get the story of Cain and Abel where we begin to realize that that same co-opting of the Dragon taking on the power of the Dragon using the dragon like a costume
 it's something that humans do to humans do when Kane gets angry and killed his brother got says that is sin is crouching at your door. Come on Serena wants to have you and then we see Kane be overcome by this monster and then we see just over and over humans giving in to the power of monster so much so that the most powerful humans in the Bible the Kings when the prophets want to talk about how corrupt and violent horrible they are they will just straight-up start calling them to see Dragon barrels called dragon in Ezekiel Nebuchadnezzar's called the dragon in Jeremiah straight up for using the power of the dragon and then you know is reflecting on those songs we read I think it was a song where the poet is looking at how Babylon took out Jerusalem took out the temple and everything is laid waste and the Poetry does God Like You
 at the beginning of time ordered creation and in doing that you slay the dragon overcame its power its its power is nothing to do you know how to be a yes and here I am now living in the midst of utter ruin & Chaos do it again but this time it's chaos that's been co-opted through human powers human powers and in League with expired energized by spiritual powers and so the theme of God giving his rule over to other creatures humans and Angels create a dynamic in which the power of the dragon can become something even more intense and so it sets up this Perpetual conflict between the snake in the humans doing the dragon and the humans
 and the dragon can describe the Heavenly rulers or Earthly rulers that want to lose our actions to establish their own kind of order in what's good in their own eyes but in fact creates disorder and death for the people around them and so this this is the basic set of ideas and a whole lot more at work in the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible so with all that said let's turn our attention to the drama of Daniel will specifically focus on chapter 7 and following but we got A build-up story to get there in the first place
 so story Daniel is placed right in the first years of babylon's victory over the southern Kingdom of Judah and over Jerusalem the Nebuchadnezzar comes knocking when they're still a kingdom in the southern part but it's just a few tribes now the northern tribes got taken out a hundred plus years ago by the Empire of Assyria and so in multiple invasions of her course of little over a decade Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem would plunder it take a bunch of people captive and then go back to Babylon So Daniel and his friends were taken captive in one of those Invasion so what were told about Daniel is one that he and his friends are from the Royal lineage of Jerusalem kings that is from the line of David so they are the seed of David
 do use Jeremiah's language does he described Nebuchadnezzar as a dragon getting swallowed by the dragon they're in the belly of the day that the Book of Daniel works we have a video on Daniel edible explain it better than I can right now so if you want to maybe you can go watch the video but what's interesting is that the biblical author is portraying the story of Daniel and his friends in Babylon on an allergy to all kinds of stories in the Torah and Prophets through hyperlinks in there to patterning and by saying in the opening line to Daniel and his friends are from the Royal Steed of the author's linking Daniel and his friends back to that ancient conflict between the seed of the woman from Genesis 3 15 and then the snake and it's seed
 and so it's going to be no surprise then it Daniel chapter 7 when the drama of what's happening in the world is described as a drama between one like a son of Adam and then between the monster series of Beast one of which is so monstrous it can be described
 so the whole book of Daniel is a dramatization of Genesis 3 15 and not sense the drama between the land ruler that God wants to exalt as His Image overall and then and the Wiley deceptions and violence that the Beast that wants to use its power of death and chaos to defeat God's appointed ruler and here were talking about the Beast not merely the Sea Dragon but the Sea Dragon being co-opted by spiritual powers and Earthly and and if we talk together so the most famous Daniel or the tests that Daniel and his friends face that are all modeled after the series of tests starting with the garden choice that Adam and Eve have about the fruit of the tree and so I could it snow
 coincidence that the first test in Genesis chapter one is about food but what's funny is he vows to only eat vegetables and fruit and he refuses to eat you know the Delicacies Meats of Babylon and that test at which their lives are at stake are Vindicated and exhausted to an even greater place of ruling Authority the same happens with the fiery furnace Shadrach Meshach in a Bendigo and the same happens with Daniel and the lions den they face a threat of death they are faithful to their God and our God delivers them to a place of rule and authority and everybody celebrates the kingdom of God their God is the true king three tests us there are two paired stories in chapters four and five about to Babylonian Kings a father and the son and the father never took another won't acknowledge God's Reign and he becomes an anime
 actually a beast with really sharp fingernails become like Claws and it's all meditation on how when humans don't take up their god-given Destiny as images of the Divine in the world their behavior and their mindset is reduced to that of an animal just pure Instinct survival song his son chooses the same route and finds himself assassinated and killed so that's sure not a way to be successful image of God
 select chapters 4 and 5 and then a two and seven are linked together because they're both dreams stories about dreams chapter 2 is a dream that the king of Nebuchadnezzar has a big statue with for parts and each part represents a kingdom in the Statue get smashed by a meteorite or exits not calling me to write call do a rock and this is important that the Hebrew word for rock is Evan Evan Evan Evan Evan to be into a v Evan like the name Evan so this rock that comes and Strikes the statue and then grows into a huge Cosmic mountain is an image of the kingdom of God smashing all human Earthly kingdoms that one exalt themselves as a God and then the mountains fills the world
 or Daniel has a dream about a series of four kingdoms that are violent terrible and that they are destroyed and God's kingdom set up forever but instead of in Evan,
 what happens this is about the enthronement of a been which is the Hebrew word for sun so the dream of the rock coming and of the son, being exhausted and Daniel 7 are linked button Daniel 7 the four kingdoms are described as an image of god statue they're described as like Beast cescaphe monsters but with all new twists so is that fairly clear how that all works I'm also looking at the poster that yeah we're looking at the Daniel poster Love You video which you can watch it so let's just read Daniel 7 this is of the Beast this is Daniel's vision
in the first year of belshazzar and Daniel the dream down and related the following summary I was looking Daniel said in my vision by night it's dark and look the Four Winds of Heaven were stirring up the great sea all right we're in the sea yeah the dark windy stormy sea right there Darkness was hovering over the abyss and the spirit of God member of the word cetera. But this is not like God's order angry while the Four Winds is that a hyperlink the Four Winds when were talking about creation and for Tuesday four points of the compass Soca meaning just the cosmic winds were stirring up the great see what kind of big to this isn't the spirit of God wins
 storm storm door I'm with her because what does the storm produce out of the chaotic C4 huge monsters Beast coming up out of the sea all different from each other the first one was like a lion but here's the thing it was a land monster I like a creature of the desert a lion but it had the wings of a skyflyer and not just any skyflyer of a predatory skyflyer and Eagle in the eagle Eagles are virtually a in the kosher food last in all the carnivorous birds are predatory birds don't eat them don't need them so they're creatures that live off of the life of another creature and they're creatures of the sky that live off of the life of creatures of the land that they violate The Foundry so to speak so you got Lions which we've been talking about aren't your friendly Zoo Lion
 these are the ones you probably never see your them and you only see it if they crawl around in the dark and they stock yeah you only see it if you're about to die and it has a hybrid creature of a lion and an eagle but then it swings get plucked and it came out of the sea it came out of the seat so it's like what's important about all these beasts is the mixing of the categories we looked at an image of like a lion eagle hybrid from somewhere yeah ancient Egyptian art and Babylonian art and Canaanite and Israelite heart is filled with hybrid multiform to creatures which more more symbolic statement back in the chair beam the Caribbean or multiform animal creatures but there they represent all the creatures of the land shouting their praise to God where is here
 these are creatures that are in God's world but they're monstrous boundary-breaking on categorize Isabel works so there's a second piece that something like a bear but it has all these ribs in its mouth and people are saying to take eat more eat more and he's just like that terrible bear is the most normal creature in the bearish kind of creature was eating eating something eating much meat second beast bear third one is like a leopard but it had four wings and had four heads like a dragonfly four-headed leopard and it has power
 and then I kept looking in my night visions knows the darkness has brought back up again and a fourth Beast Dreadful terrifying unimaginably strong with huge iron teeth
 the iron is human product weird iron teeth so it's like it's even now it's like getting modified a Human Weapon it devoured and crushed and trampled down what remains with its feet I was different from all the beasts that were for it oh yeah and you should know it had ten horns and then I was looking at those horns and then there was one more horn sprouted up and first of the three horns were pulled right up by the roots that just like popped him out when it came on how do I like a human and it just was talking about how amazing and Powerful it is butter and grape boasts yeah so where is the stuff of nightmares so the biblical imagery of the they all come out of the chaos C
 so it's by a principal of 42 the very common to do 1 2 3 bonus it's a very common climactic pattern in biblical literature to list things and three and then to have the four for three things even for 4 and so all of them are creatures of the Wilderness the first three are the first and the third are both Wilderness creatures but with wings the great categories notice if you have four creatures but the third one has four heads Adam up and you have a total of seven heads okay let me just tell him he's got the lion the bear for leopard has the super monster beast and then the leopard s4c are the seven heads and ten horns train horns 7 has yet so if you combine them all together
 seven heads and ten horns these are numbers for completeness exactly a super mega super duper Beast
but then all of a sudden Dennis I kept looking and I saw Thrones plural Thrones set up and then the Ancient of Days the Eternal one came and took his seat
 his clothing was white like snow cuz I pre-stressed interesting look up the hair of his head was just buy a wall like gray hair white hair is thrown was just completely on fire and I had Wheels cuz it's a throne Chariot roll around in a burning fire and then a river of fire was coming out from before him so remember how the Garden of Eden was the reality towards which the later Tabernacle in Temple pointed and the center the tree of life for God's life made available maps onto the holy of holies and you know very often fire and light were associated with God's parents in no special places in the temple Tabernacle in the garden what you got was a river of the water of life it's a river of Fire
 the river water has become a river of fire that's unfortunate flowing out it's unfortunate if your beast but if your creature that submits to the fire the fire will purify you like Daniel is friends have been purified through the fire yeah Daniel's three friends went through the fire and there was like some other puma in like figures in the fire with them and they came out the other side of the fire and we're exhausted to rule
 so the riverfire was flowing coming out from before I am and then just that wasn't on thousands ten thousands on ten thousands of his courtiers to see this is up in the heavens this is the Heavenly Council of my heavenly crew the court sat or literally judgment which we think of Justice Gods sitting down to bring Rule and Order and scrolls are all opened Scrolls of planning and purpose and consultation so this is kind of like I'm imagining if I'm taking back just the story of battles of the Dragon versus the storm God of imagining like that battle is about to happen he was like some crazy new version of it normally the slaying of the Dragon myth goes the storm God shows up with fire and Cloud to come take out the dragon but now we got the
 super duper Dragon for parts with the seven heads and ten horns and then we've got God in the Heavenly hosts coming on the fiery Chariot but they're not like making their battle plans that's right yeah and it's not just some like lower-level storm God showing up this is the Ancient of Days this is the one Chief then I kept looking because man the sound of the boastful words about horn I just couldn't I couldn't get it out of my ears and then I kept looking and that Beast was slain the fourth one fourth one its body was destroyed given to the fire and the rest of the beasts their Dominion was taken away and they lived on for a little while and appointed time but that was a quick little battle and then I kept looking noticed all of these begin with I kept looking I kept looking in the throne I kept
 the Beast of slain I kept looking and what with the Clouds Of Heaven one like a son of Adam about this is written in Aramaic Daniel is one of the only option of Daniel Daniel's 2 through 7 are written in Aramaic and Hebrew well so the phrasing are America's Bar Bar nausea but that is Aramaic for the Hebrew phrase been a dumb son of Adam the members in chapter to the rock candy out of the oven it's smashed the four kingdoms now 4th monsters are just saying like what I told you it's almost kind of like Daniel like looked over me like a well they're gone they have to happen and this image of I kept looking I kept looking all three of these parts the whole vision is has three parts than they all have the same introduction so they're Corden
 it's as if they're happening at the same time okay so the ancient one comes set up his throne in the fire goes out and then what happens the beasts were slain and given to the fire at the moment it's all happening what else is happening at that same time well with the clouds of heaven cuz that whole scene of the throne was taken place in heaven and one like a son of Adam was coming coming up to the Ancient of Days up to yes he came up to another words so he's now he's riding on a cloud approaching up cuz he's the son of Adam the land is human yep or he's like that's what he's like a son of Adam so one like the human is being brought up from the land up to the heavens and exhausted and he was presented before the Ancient of Days are so fascinating if you go throughout the Hebrew Bible
 the only one who ever rides the clouds is Yahweh he's called the cloud Rider in Psalm 68 the one who rides the clouds but also the only one who sits on the cosmic Throne is Yahweh
 and now one of the two attributes of Yahweh the enthroned one who sits above the clouds is now being broken up into two figures the Ancient of Days who's on the throne and then this one like a son of Adam riding the clutch is riding the clouds go up to the Ancient of Days and to be presented before him and then the Ancient of Days gives to that one
 the Dominion and glory and Kingdom and All Nations and all other humans might serve that one and his the kingdom of the son of Adam that is now in throned beside Ancient of Days is eternal forever and ever will never be destroyed is Daniel's Vision the rest of the chapter is going to be Daniel asking questions about what it all means I got some questions okay well I think I've heard people try to connect the B supposed to the stock that 4th piece two different human kingdoms you learn in the interpretation the straight up there called Kingdom become an angel comes and he starts talking with him and ask him questions but also it corresponds to the King's dream from chapter to where the four parts of the Statue of world record for King Toca so these beasts are
 should we be thinking of them and the way we were taught about the cash dragon is human kingdoms human King's taking on the power of chaos and trying to deal with Park house which is just going to do a new creation he's a human Kings and kingdoms who are dressed up as that is taking on the role of the sea monster and when you do that you are also in some way I use the word and league with or cooperating with or mirrored by the spiritual Rebellion it's doing the same thing yes that's right and you learned that in the next chapter Daniel ate where he has another dream that subject to animals battling with each other around me to go but then what he learns he sees an angel that comes and what he learns is that the conflict that he seeing
 between God's faithful people and then these kingdoms that oppress them is mirrored up in the heavens between Israel's representative which is an angel and between the other Heavenly beings called the angels of Persia the Prince of Persia so there you you get this image of okay well if the monsters are the human versions of like a Heavenly being that's acting like a sea dragon then the Earthly it's the Earthly people that is the humans who are part of God's faithful ones also have their Heavenly hero as it were and that's the son of man your son of Adam it was a soft it up another words to dual aspect of the Heavenly ruler the Heavenly Dragon and the Earthly monsters are at the part of Daniels world to you as yeah it's almost like I mean if you think of this purely through anthropomorphically through human perspective
 you think okay when someone gets just like extremely violent and powerful thing I can think of them like using the power of the Caster they become the chaos dry yeah yeah but it's not just that it's also them in League with spiritual evil which is also taking on the power of the Sea Dragon 2 power-ups that the human King is doing to make it like not at the monster like a double monster monster yeah you know I'm trying to think I can't think of an actual movie but there's this movie Trope where you have like a bad guy or bad girl and you know they've been hurt something terrible has happened and says the deal with their pain you know they decide to team up with something much more Cosmic or demonic and then they let that thing and Powers
 how to do the evil
 you know this is a common Trope for bad guys or the bad guys are kind of bad but then they League up with something that's like really bad yeah and then together and then the ultimate Cosmic Badness kind of uses the human as a channel trying to think of the examples did you ever watch the 4th season of stranger things has not a kind of not kind of fits into that gets in the backstory of 11 turns into a pure horror horror flick flick okay that's what I've heard is not as bad but yeah that's what I heard and saw spoilers but 11 you know she grows up in this like laboratory where they're kind of playing with kids and giving up hours and so this is one kid is being experimented with who wants to fight back and he kind of joins forces with this the dark it was the thing of the upside down I think of the upside down Okay order to fight back
 the doctors wow so he's the one who unleashes the upside down anywhere on the image of human Kings and kingdoms who began like a cane but for one reason or another they allow this well this heavenly power to lure them into thinking that the way to deal with to do what's good I need to crush some heads and all the sudden you've got a human Heaven and Earth empowered monster that are having the same effect in the unleashing the see the power of the sea that's what these symbols mean that these creatures come up out of the dark stormy sea
 so what is interesting about this scene is notice how the dragon-slaying moment happens with the twist cuz you have all the sudden the deity is too is both the one on the Heavenly throne and then this one like a son of Adam who is exalted up and is given and becomes part of the Heavenly Kingdom
 and the beast is just laying pretty enigmatic since you don't have a head bashing you haven't Psalm 74 Psalm 89 how did Isaiah 51 but here a son of Adam who was in The Realm where the Beast was trampling sosus inference I see the son of Adam what happened what yeah what's the backstory let's hear what happened off camera here so what we chose to do in our video and in the poster of this moment is to highlight that the son of Adam to get exalted was on the land where the Beast was trampling so it's a subtle inference that the Beast was trampling on Sons of Adam and one of those sons of Adam is exalted up and actually shares and God's rule yeah so this is where it's you study Daniel and these Visions what you'll find is loads of hyperlinks
 to suffering servant of Isaiah and this son of Adam figure is being mapped onto the vocation of the servant in the latter poems of Isaiah and there are so pathetic man so in those palms and Isaiah like an Isaiah 51 you have a poem asking God's arm to wake up and smash the head of the Dragon but then when you get to Isaiah 52 and 53 will you discover is that the arm of the Lord has revealed that that famous line that Isaiah 53 begins with who believes our message to them as the arm of the Lord been revealed the revealing of you always armed coming to smash the dragon's head will take place through the servant who actually lets the forces of death and evil men kill him
 and then he will be elevated to a place of cosmic rule after suffering because of the sins of Violent Men so when Isaiah the Beast is conquered by letting the Beast conquer the servant and that seems to be what's happening with being activated in this portrait of the son of Adam in Daniel 7 this is a major twist yes this is Elizabeth Winstead cuz you would think okay to fight back against the dragon and all its forms like we need but you always did it begin equation that's just the beginning yep we need a more epic battle and that battle feels more like a surrender right yes but tell me against when Isaiah I kind of missed it so you're saying okay I definitely want come on God wake up where's your arm is your arm let's cut Rahab in pieces slay the dragon the arm of Yahweh has been a major Motif in the drag
 slang imagery from the victory over pharoah at the sea is all about you always right armrest wrong Hannah's done away with the dragon in the sea Isaiah says let's do that again new Exodus wake up arm of the always pierce the dragon and then you can follow through as his poetry is a big emphasis on yahweh's arm that's going to bring about salvation and rescue but then when you get to the suffering servant poem it says that the arm of Yahweh is revealed through what this servant does and what goes on. Is that the service is going to suffer death at the hands of wicked men evil men how do you know that the arm is connected the servant the introduction to the servant poem and Isaiah 53 one who has believed our message about how the arm of Yahweh has been revealed so we have a story to tell about how the arm is coming yeah The Apocalypse of the always armed it's coming
 when in the form of the pundits has happened and what it look like it look like this guy who gets beat up and everybody think he's cursed by God and trashed humans actually he is suffering for the sins of Israel and all humanity and he dies at the hands of wicked men as you read through the phone but after his suffering he sees the light of Life he's given a portion among the great he divides the spoils with the strong as from the ends of palm and he's elevated to a place of rule in this given a crew
 a people called his seed in the family so even Isaiah 53 that kind of designed along the Arc of the dragon-slaying story but here the dragon is here the way to confront the dragon is two seemingly lose against the letters yes and Daniel the whole book of Daniel the story of Daniel and his friends and those tests this was about letting the Beast devour them with fire did I leave them with Beast Daniel in the Lion's Den ya letting the Beast eat you and so this is back to the seed in the belly of the Beast you gotta go into the belly of the beast but that can become the womb for new life that's right yeah or in the language of Genesis 3 15 that riddle the cast of Monster is going to get his head smashed
 but its head smashing will be simultaneous with the snake right exacting its own wound on the heel of the Victor and somehow that Mutual destruction will bring about the destruction of the snake but it won't destroy the seize the moment it's somehow it's lost is its Victory and the poems of Isaiah explorer that mystery book of Daniel really it's a dramatization of slaying of the dragon by letting the Dragon Slayers Victor
 which is a major Twist on the dragon-slaying theme but it's that's the mystery at the heart of all these different themes in the Hebrew Bible and it is the Mysteries with the gospel authors want to narrate for us in the form of what we called the story of the life and death and resurrection of Jesus cuz Daniel 7 is just all over Jesus whips and the language of the stories about Jesus calls himself the son of man he calls himself the son of Adam all right well that's what everybody was staring podcast team and we're doing another employee and reduction here Universe show and to understand my name is Sam and what are you doing here about 5. I work on our Global team my role and get boiled down to being a production support coordinator
 with our Global team what does that look like kind of on a day-to-day basis for you A lot of it currently is reviewing and also creating myself project files that we can send off to our International Teams so it's almost like creating a template from our internal Animation Studio lighting rothbart files animation files that are all kind of boiled down to their user-friendly way that we can easily handoff to these other Studios and they can work with it in a way that where it's like you know when you open up someone's like this is terrible and when you open the closet is messy stuff everywhere yeah we want to be a nice clean and tidy closet when they when they open up that door so they can know exactly where things are and how to use things and just really make it as like efficient and clean and quality of experience for artists internationally to work with the same files that are in House artists use
 worst a lot but seems like the people is there anything that you would want say folks might be listening right now to be like the closest to like our iPad ring doorbell so whenever the doorbell rings I'm always there to get it when I am in the office I am able to buy them and show them around but it really is just a highlight and it makes a difference when you actually see someone face-to-face tangible impact it's making him individually someone's life thank you everyone that comes the part let him think the Bible project saying hi and we will be about your work outside of work or do you want to walk around this area since I live so close and then walked to dinner for food carts been getting really into baseball for the first time ever for blocking baseball through watching the nearest why did you study in the baseball I think I'm a little bit probably have a bandwagon fan but it started doing good last year and I think I caught wind of that and so I was like you know next year
 maybe I'll start like I'll start following baseball and see if I enjoy just keeping up with it will tell me a little about the guy who's sitting down here and get this dog named Packer 8 year old husky mix about a little over a month ago now she is so friendly and he also looks like the Dogecoin. Yes I got a little bit of Today Show came from our podcast team including producer Cooper Powell and Associate producer Lyndsay Ponder our lead editor is damn gone additional editors are Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey also mix this up and Hannah wounded are annotations for the Bible project app Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit everything we make is free because of your generous support thank you so much
