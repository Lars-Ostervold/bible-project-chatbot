as we near the end of the numbers scroll Yahweh leads Moses to the top of the mountain where he can look out onto the land that is promised to Israel a new Garden land a land he will not personally get to enter Then you always selects Moses's Protege the new leader of Israel because the congregation are like animals that need a chef the job goes to a man named Joshua a man described as being filled with the spirit of wisdom now there's only three other times in the Hebrew Bible where the spirit of wisdom feels a human the third time that this phrase appears in Isaiah 11 describing a future Branch little offshoot from the family line of David that will Sprout up one day in the future and this figure is going to bring Justice on the Nations bring peace between humans and animals and he's going to bring God's people to dwell so that there is no
 pain or destruction in all God's holy mountain cuz all the Earth will be filled up with knowing our you seen so far it's been Moses who shines with God's Splendor Moses mediates between God and man Moses is the leader who will rescue Israel Moses is the closest we've gotten to a delivering Messiah but now that torch is being passed to Joshua and so now Josh was going to be the next main character on the stage who starts filling out even more the portrait of the kind of deliver the God's people need to bring them into the land plant them in the new Eden land I'm John Collins this is Bible project podcast today we continued the third movement of the scroll of the numbers and I need to apologize in advance as you listen you'll hear that I was dealing with some sickness thanks for joining us.
hello Tim hey John by there we are in the scroll of numbers and we are in the third movement of the scroll of numbers and we only have a couple more conversation before we need to be done that's right with numbers and move on to the last scroll in the Torah Deuteronomy we're moving towards the end of the whole Torah really explanation to the Torah it seems like we're just Landing down in these movements on specific stories trying to give a shape of like what's going on overall in the section section but then just really landing on some specifics and actually reading them and talking about them that's what we've been doing care and numbers were in the third movement we landed down and just read that first story after the senses of the daughters of zelophehad
 the number scroll has three big movements it begins at Mount Sinai where there are arranging the camp of the tribes around the Tabernacle where God dwells frightened stutter and then they leave Mount Sinai the center movement of numbers is about the journey through the Wilderness and it's a collection of multiple Rebellion narratives that keep increasing in intensity both in Hoovervilles another words it's not from the people to the leaders to like the most important leaders and the Fallout of the consequences keep getting more intense so that eventually the whole generation that was rescued from Egypt and slavery dies off in the wilderness and so here in this last movement it's that next Generation that's being instructed about the wisdom of God that they need to live by as they
 get ready to go into the new Eden land and that's this last section the week all numbers 26 through 36 and it began with the senses that matches the first movement of numbers shown that numbers itself is its own little chiasm and then the story of the daughters of zelophehad who come and say hey boys yes which would mean by the law that we have currently our father's Clan won't hear any land and that seems like an injustice and Moses like let me check on that and sure enough Godlike yep that would be an injustice there right those daughters can inherit land yet like a son and then the story of the daughters is completed by another story that's forward-looking which is not about the new wisdom because people will need to live in the land but it's
 about the new leadership that got the people will need in the new Eden land and that's the story that begins and numbers 27:12 a little what might feel obscure corner of the Torah that actually has huge significance for where the story of the Hebrew Bible is going and maybe just to recall the name of Joshua who's the key figure here in this whole story is the Hebrew name that's at the root of Jesus of Nazareth name Yeshua yeah so the longer form in Hebrew is yehoshua yehoshua yehoshua which is a combination of the Divine name Yahweh and then at the end and then stick the short form of Yahweh off the beginning of another word for the yaha turned into Yahoo anyway songs
 Semitic tip dogs and then the oshiwara comes from the Hebrew root Yasha or Yoshi and it's the word to deliver bird rescue so Yahweh rescues disguise name and then I got shortened both in Hebrew and then Aramaic to Yeshua and then guess who I got rendered into Greek as Jesus and then it got rendered into Latin and then romance languages as Jesus Jesus when you can hear that name pronounced in Spanish today which sounds much more like the Greek form of Jesus to Jesus anyway I come to Jesus Jesus to Jesus Jesus what will your name one day be in two thousand years from now that's a great question
 I think the most interesting one is how Jacob turned into James that was just a full pivot yeah yeah but it was still at his linguistic development where the of Jake Cub still survives I think it's an Italian yeah, but it became silent and other romance languages which is where you get like in Spanish Hi me I'm locking James just want his name of the Bible is the urban legend Scott McKnight's super dance no stone unturned James commentary has a long long footnote on the linguistic development from Jacob to James Super little thing that nerdy the think linguistic but now it started fascinating yes it is nerdy but I'm I'm used to it
 Nevers 27:12 then Yahweh said to Moses go up to this mountain of the very name which is an actual mountain or Hill somewhere on the east side of the Jordan River but it's a word play cuz of our dream is spelled with the same letters as those passing on which is a Hebrew euphemism for like a similar to our English passed away so go up to the mountain of passing away and see the land that I have given Unto the Sons of Israel and when you see it you will be gathered to your people just like Aaron your brother was and why Moses let me remind you in the wilderness of Zin during the Maryville Debra word is the word that means fight or Coral
 during the coral of the congregation you rebelled against my word and didn't treat me as holy before the eyes of the people there at the water and we talked about that Story 2 episodes ago we did that's right this is Moses's suffering servant moment where he is going to die both because of the sensitive people and also for his own sinful rebellion and he's told to go up to a mountain and look at the land that God is going to give not to him but to the descendants of Abraham this is a hyperlink right here at the Genesis chapter 13 oh and Abraham surveys and land this is Genesis 32 Abram after lockup separated from him now
 lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are and he's up on the hill near a place called Heaven on look from the place where you are north south east west at all the land that you see that I will give to you and your descendants forever so do you know how she is just as Abraham was given a promise of the future Eaton land for his descendants so now Moses is being given the gift of seeing the land that's going to be given to the sons of Abraham but not him he's going to die because it wasn't generation but then Moses do you have something to say about that Moses spoke to you always saying oh yeah the Elohim of the spirits of All Flesh would you please appoint a man over the congregation Beth Adam so weird way to say this request is it weird I don't know it's in Hebrew
 baby that's just how they talk okay but you could have just said is Yahweh please appoint a successor the Elohim that gives Spirit to All Flesh may you appoint a man over the congregation this is a good example of a phrase you like why is that there yeah that's Genesis to write exactly right or God breathed his naparc yeah exhales his breath into the dirt to give life to the human so this is a good example of I mean I can show you two dozen other little random or oddly phrase replaced things in the section of numbers that are all little Eden hyperlinks so what mode is the saying listen I'm going to die outside of the new Eden land yeah I don't get to go in
 but could you please by your spirit give life to a flash person and what he says you were the God who brought life out of non-life who gives life yeah and that you know this goes back to the we started this whole journey Movement by movement through the Torah in Genesis 1 through 11 tracing the pattern of spirit correct and it was really cool to kind of see in the biblical imagination framework of God's spirit not only being involved in creating order and sustaining the order of creation but then also being what is giving life and sustaining life for all bios like for humans and animals and it's just a pretty remarkable way to look out into the world and to imagine this is all being sustained by God's presence
 all sustaining presence is the focus of God's spirit hovering in the dark Waters in Genesis 1 in the 7-Day narrative in the Eden there it says which is a compliment sitting right next to the 7-Day narrative that works on a different time frame it focuses in and it shows the role of God's breath in animating and empowering one particular creature to become a representative in the Eden space to mirror God's life and character to the animals in the creatures and that Eden image is actually it's both cuz what Moses says God you give locked all flash so that's Genesis one of like God's spirit is what sustains all life and being but then it's all so generous as to where it's he's going to stay so appoint a human
 come and fill a human like a point one particular a new human who will be over the congregation and then he's about to describe the congregation like animals that need a human over there don't turn to the melody we're back at then at the beginning of the melody recreating order yeah numbering the tribes tribes is the fruitful and multiply that's the role of the senses place the abundance of Genesis 1 and now we're getting to wear then he's going to appoint a human the daughters of zelophehad is about God appointing male and female to oversee the land together yeah it was his Genesis 1 and now in terms of the section yet what you doing in this is true the biblical authors often organized stories or moral hazard material following the sequence of ideas in Genesis 1 through 9 and that's what the section is doing what you call the melody
so now we're calling God animating a particular creature to oversee the animals in the new Eden land of the congregation who will go out and come in in front of them that little phrase go out and come in as a figure of speech for Leading the People out and feeding them in okay. That's what he says next who will lead them out and bring them in so that you always congregation won't be like sheep who have no separate ruler of the animals that people are like sheep and what they need is an overseer and an Eaton that was Adam and Eve and now here we need my human will do that so you always responds to Moses is man you know I got you you got your boy
 not his actual son but he's become like his Protege take Yoshua the son of noon a man in whom is the spirit I'm actually already been working with this guy that's been what do you say developing Joshua and this is the culmination of a whole set of kind of random mentions of Joshua in the tour up to this point he was one of the 12 Spies that's where you first met him maybe even more particular is a great example he first appears out of nowhere in the book of Exodus that's right in that story about when Moses has to go up on the hill and hold the staff up high but Israel's fighting an enemy that like I was trying to bug them in the wilderness Joshua was the one Leading the People out in battle
 so the first time you've meet Joshua he's Leading the People into battle where God rescues them through Joshua's leadership the second time he appears you told that Joshua went up with Moses to the top of Mount Sinai it's really about the right yeah but it didn't go all the way up right there's no ambiguity was hey you in the elders and Erin go up to the middle of the mountain and Joshua and then when God said to Moses Moses you come up what the narrator says is Moses got up with Joshua's servant and Moses went up to the Mountain of God and you like well why did Joshua get up suggested little ambiguity and then when Moses is coming down the mountain with the tablets in his hands at the golden calf story all of a sudden Joshua is like with him as it comes down the mountain
 it's really interesting and then Joshua appears yeah he's one of the spies in numbers who believe that God could deliver them and then here we are here so he is a suggestive character who's always like right next to Moses to write with Moses and what you learn this is that Joshua is empowered by The Same Spirit that Moses is empowered with so lay your hand on him this is what people bring sacrificial animals do to the animal when they surrender them at the altar in Leviticus it talks about the laying on of hands do you depress depress the hand press and work out and then you go by the symbolism intuitive of commissioning of Representative like I appoint this person to represent me so lay your hand on him
 and have Joshua stand before Eleazar the priest and all the congregation and you will command him in their site you shall take some of your own this interesting I forgot about this
 so I'm reading The New American Standard right now in a 27-20 it says you Moses put some of your Authority on him so that the congregation of Israel May obey him but that will fit now that says or literally the Hebrew word means Majesty would this be connected to the word glory and has Tim is the word which is talking about the visible Splendor or Majestic Royal appearance of a royal Figure 8 what is human that use take care of him to sign of human that you pay attention to him you have given human Majesty that word a little lesser than the Heavenly beings yes the word heard it appears what 24 times in the Hebrew Bible and in the Psalms this word consistently describes God's app
 Prince when he's depicted as the king of the Skies sitting on a Heavenly Throne close to translate a splinter Splinter yes so here is connected to all the little links to Joshua before in the Torah what he says is take some of your hood your Splendor your Royal Splendor that's what it actually means in Hebrew translation
 the English Standard Version says invest him with some of your Authority interesting definitely interpreting their New International Version 2720 give him some of your Authority all of them so that all of them are really into the authority King James now shalt put some of thine honour on him we're going to go closer there good job King James put some of your majesty on a 2-1 this assumes that Moses somehow has some radiating splendiferous Majesty sound like a Calvin and Hobbes word and we know we know of Moses's Splendor don't we it's not just a meditation than the biblical story so far remember this course you love this moment in the 80s
 find it for me a little bit with the horns
 that ruined it for an Army in a little bit more interesting but like yeah it kind of bothers me a little bit actually son Exodus 34 when Moses comes down from the mountain and remember Joshua was just suddenly right there with him and strangely seems like he gets up to go up the mountain with him too it's really that narrative leaves it intentionally ambiguous anyhow when Moses eventually does come down in Exodus 34 what we're told is that the skin of his face and then the Hebrew word is Karen which is the verb of the Hebrew noun Kevin which means horn like animal horn so the skin of his face sent out horns
 yeah wits and I maybe I wasn't clear I think it's a figure of speech or is it I just like you're not supposed to imagine him like turning into a stator or something at this moment so here's the thing is that this verb this very bad peers oh yeah one other time to talk about an animal actually sprouting horn simple growing horns so this verb is used can be is literally to grow horns however the noun horn which almost always refers to animal horns does on one occasion and I'm looking in the Hebrew and Greek Lexicon the Old Testament I call her and Baumgartner
 oh yes okay there is one I should have brought this up back and we talked about this back in Exodus in habakkuk chapter 3 verse for the noun horn is used to talk about rays of the Sun that flash out like Kevin like it's the plural Carnelian horns like a flash of light is described as a little practice before as a horn of light so is it a homonym maybe like it's not it doesn't actually relate to animal horns it just sounds like the same word but it means Brilliance hair shining I think that what it speaks to is the human perception of light beams were light rays at me look at the Sun and you don't see light Progresso you're right but sometimes you do and that's like yeah like when you draw a son as a kid become draw those little horns around it the little spikes
 Radiance the radiance and inhibit the noun used to describe animal horns is used to describe the radiance I clearly did not make that clear enough when we are okay well this is hyperlink back okay this podcast hyperlink it was settled that for me thank you I was getting creeped out by like the stator Moses coming down and but my point back in that conversation in Exodus was the use of the word Chiron there's a many words for sign that the biblical author could have used in Exodus 34 and that the choice of emit horns is intentional because one has a way of depicting the light but also as a way of depicting Moses as a sacrificial animal oh that's right because he has already suffered and surrendered his wife on behalf of the people in this very story
 so that is the only other story that comes to mind in the Torah that could possibly be what's referred to he uses the hold yep and here and numbers 27. Says you should put some of your hold on him Moses in the hood means a visible manifestation of a royal figures Majesty power and Beauty blender which is not like a visible thing it's like the it's an aura of Sword all right and they shimmered with in gold and jewels and are all here I mean any like rulers going to have asked Majestic robes and that's right shiny metal on them and yeah they're going to load you can host up one point here is that Joshua is being depicted as a new Moses so put some of your Splendor on him so that the people listen to him
 they listen to you now they're going to listen to him so Joshua is depicted as a new Moses in the same way Joshua is depicted as a new Adam from the link above Elohim of the spirits who gives Spirit on All Flesh appoint a human over the congregation because the congregation are like animals that need a Shepherd so this is the narratives way to take Joshua the new Adam and is a new Moses and lo and behold it's interesting that the ideal human figure is depicted as a like an the high priest as a shiny shimmery figure and then Moses is depicted as the shiny shimmery figure and so Joshua here is depicted as someone with the Splendor of Moses to yeah so awesome Authority isn't too far off in the sense of if you're thinking just about biblical patterns like why a point and Adam to rule and Authority that was the logic of the declarative
 yeah it's already isn't what do you say it's not a wrong translation it's an English word that doesn't get you the visible Splendor in the element of meaning hides that meaning you totally whereas if you put the word majesty I think that's why the New American Standard had a footnote with Majesty cuz it would sound odd but I think that's the point here it's an intentional Oddity meant to invite the reader to meditate 21 he either is Joshua Castille speaking of Moses he will stand in front of eliazar the priest who will inquire for him by the Judgment or decisions given by The Dream before y'all know we never talked about the oriented we okay all right so up to this point Joshua is depicted as a new Moses but now this is interesting
 what's a Joshua ends up in a scenario where he doesn't fully know what to do but would Moses do you feel up the mountain like in the story right before this one would just go into the tent and consult your way here Joshua is a new Moses write needs to make a decision what to do his way of Consulting ways to go to the high priest Eleazar and the high priest will make an inquiry for him how by the decision of the Orem Orem you like we're about to uncover some conspiracy so cool bullying us all to the high priest garments in Exodus member to Long chapters about the high priest's clothing make list 28 29 and when the special
 brass plate with the jewels representing 12 tribes of Israel there was to be this little couch tucked into the back of the I don't know why I actually don't know why I just the stuff the Bible makes you meditate on and in that little pouch are to be too little objects that in Exodus 28 verse 32 called the rim and the Tomb in the word frame is the Hebrew word for lights what what lights like I liked lamps okay so this is the Genesis 1 support and that word is not where it's the same meaning just the two ways to use the word light to spell lamp you can say or you can say Hey or okay the both mean light and both recall the light of day one Genesis is the plural word of life and is the plural of lights lights and then
 who name is the Hebrew word for complete or the King James translate this lights and Perfections the lights in Perfection so most of our English translation sexy straight-up don't translate these stupid words which is why we have our agreement through name in Semana translation which is spelled them with English letters this feels very sorcery yeah it feels very like divination Kenneth stop the Lots in the Bible talks about casting lots these are them these are the lots these Lots out there called lights imperfection called lights and Perfection it a lot technically is what would it technically be the word lot is the Hebrew word go raw but both Reid and swimming and the go raw cuz Joshua's going to use these to actually divide up the promised land and there's this deep conviction and there's Proverbs about this in the Book of Proverbs that you know people cast lots but
 the decision comes from Yahweh right so yeah this was a way to hear from God of Discerning the will of God by the priests and early Israelite leaders sometimes it's like the previous chapter right you have to use your mind or you take a case before y'all way right like the daughters of zelophehad yeah other times it requires asking for a sign and a symbol in this case by Rolling the lots and both are ways that people in the Hebrew Bible to Serrano. It sounds weird to us I think it's not dissimilar from moments when people reach where they don't know what God wants them to do or there's a decision yeah and so they asked essentially forgot to give a providential sign
 yeah and that's an equivalent I think okay yeah like okay if you feel like I should move towards this opportunity or take this thing then I'm just going to trust you black open the door to that opportunity or close the store and whatever happens you could look at it from the perspective of just pure chance cause-effect operations Chaos Theory but I think committing to a theistic view of the world is that through the nearly infinite numbers of cause-and-effect chain patterns in the world that there is some sort of underlying purpose moving forward and so if that's asking for sign about whether you should take job
 and ask God to order the circumstances or rolling that we're able to name its kind of two ways of doing the same thing least I think so God gave the high priest like magic the Gathering dice yep essentially yeah it's kind of crazy so that's the Ravens to him but was fascinating here is Joshua has been depicted as being a protege of Moses I like Moses but also unlike Moses he just goes into the tent speaks face-to-face with y'all but Joshua is a new Moses but also a lesser than Moses it's like Moses is the high point and now the Moses role is being split into two figures the high priests and high priest goes into the 10 and Joshua who stands outside the tent and he represents the Royal role of Moses where is the high priest
 represents the Priestly role of meiosis is this interesting you know what it's actually more like then give me a sign it's more like Rock Paper Scissors Shoot and settled so many things with my kids yeah yeah yeah right it's like yeah all right I don't know let's just shoot for it and I've ever done significant decisions like usually those are like a doesn't matter what could be this happy that I see but like you know
 my kids are making super significant even though this seems dinosaur associated with games for us this is like you know should we go into battle or not should we settle in this Valley are in that Valley like those with the decisions will have steaks yeah that's kind of nuts that they would leave that to a two dice essentially instead of I mean why not like take a vote so I agree with you this is fascinating this is an example where in the Hebrew Bible the ritual practices the ancient Israel engages in I'll be more specific the ritual practices that are commanded by God to Israel are at home in their ancient near Eastern context yeah they wouldn't have thought it was weird rolling sacred Dice and then there were other phone
 friends of essentially divination and Omens so not by Consulting spirits of the dead but by off and I was taking a sacrificial animal removing its liver after you Slaughter it and then text me have these like liver dishes they would make a plaster mold of a liver in the shape of liver and then they would Elevate an actual liver like a warm fresh diaper and then drop it onto the mold plate and however the liver kind of splattered and fell into chunks and pieces would be a sign of communication from the gods
 and they did this in the Bible no no no neighbors did this is Rose neighbors that this practice is described in the Book of Ezekiel that's something the king of Babylon does to determine which city he's going to attack in a campaign was filled with different ritual practices for Discerning the will of God's one of them was rolling sacred eyes and that is mirrored here in the practice of the room in the domain and you know I guess to take this up with in a larger biblical framework or the biblical story it's another element were God, dates or contextualizes his relationship to Israel to their cultural context and does it rain in the sky mean we're viewed as a way that God would have, did it to practice a new but then also you actually use it for his providential purposes least I think that's what we're supposed to conclude
have a good time in this little story about Joshua I like that so Moses does just as Lord commands he took Joshua he said him in front of Eleazar the priest before all the congregation he laid his hands on him and commissioned him just as Lord spoke to Moses so you're so interesting this last movement of numbers concludes the number scroll the book of Deuteronomy is one long series of speeches of Moses that all take place in the course of one day and so when you reach the last paragraph of Deuteronomy this moment right here with Joshua what is picked up again Deuteronomy thirty-four now Moses went up from The Plains of Moab to the top of the top of the Mount of a Rheem right and here in Deuteronomy it's called to the top of Pisgah which is the name of an actual Hill there too and you always showed him the land do you see we're doing the thing the number 27 said
 numbers 27 begin so I thought you already did that number 27 oh no he said to go do it lord said to Moses who's number 27 go up to this mountain of Ava Raymond see the land okay then Moses said but hey wait appoint somebody is the Joshua thing and then all your told is Moses did it is a command commissioned Joshua Deuteronomy thirty-four comes around and it actually it's a backflash to the moment and then fills it out even more for the cause of Mount something else that calls the mountain by different name so go to Mount Nebo the top of Pisgah and they're always showed him all the way that's not uncommon for a place to have different names nope that's not uncommon all happens all the time in the Bible to what's interesting is he gets an outline of the land according to kind of the rough tribal allotments
 Iliad as far as stand naftuli Ephraim and Manasseh the land of Judah the Negev he's looking for North all the way down to South you always said this is the land that I swore to Abraham Isaac and Jacob that's a nice hyperlink end of the last paragraph of the Torah and the type of thinking back to the first goal of the Torah Genesis 45 so Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land according to the word of God he buried him in the Valley of the land of Moab by Fayetteville or and no one knows where he's buried not even till this very day to clear it has a speaking voice the narrator is some distance from the events Moses who was 120 years old when he died his I was not dim
 nor had his Vigor abated literally the word Vigor there is juice moisture his moisture had not drained he wasn't a dry old blind man that could be what it means I could also be referring to his reproductive fluids he was still even at 120 he was in his prime it's a figure of speech is everybody weeds from out of this and then verse 9 really for them after here then Joshua the son of noon was filled with the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid his hands on him and the sons of Israel listen to him as the Lord commanded Moses
 so the ending of the Torah ends with a glowing hyperlink back to this commissioning seeing the numbers yeah and well I'll let you observe there's some significant little differences here ok Google that's Pop Quiz pop quizzes reason why I feel like Moses said hey your The Thrilla Spirits all flash point of human and then yeah he always says to Moses this guy Joshua he's been hanging out with you and he's got the spirit so yeah commission him and they do and they do but notice the difference in the difference here is okay then God gives them a spirit of wisdom and know he has the spirit but he's he's filled with the spirit of wisdom totaling so there's a difference between I think the numbers narrative is depicting Joshua has a new Adam
 yes the spirit so to speak of like spirit level one he's got the like life spirit that everyone has a suppose but I seem like it was more than that I didn't seem like it was more and then now we revisit Joshua and the spirit and he got even more on top of what seems like a little more and the new title for this aspect of God's ruoff is crucially important cuz it is the spirit of wisdom which this is a good chance, is child searching hebra yeah man it is yeah the phrase Spirit of wisdom a three times in the Bible only three times it appears to talk about an artist from the tribe of Judah named Bethel oh that's right whom God commissions to make the intent
 the sex is just because Hulk Mama means it's like it is an artisan ability to be able to like use materials wisely whatever one's craft is whatever one's craft is you are proficient in hyperskill done it the second time the free spirit of wisdom peers in the Hebrew Bible is right here at the end of the Torah Joshua it's filled with but not to build the Tabernacle but to lead the people to lead ya to be the leader of a group of Migrant people who are going to go settle in the land that's full of people who will oppose them and attack them try to destroy them so that takes some skill
 keep a group of people alive surrounded by people who want to kill you the third time that this phrase appears is describing and Isaiah 11 describing a future Branch little offshoot from the family line of David that will Sprout up one day in the future and the spirit of Yahweh will rest on him know I called him yeah it's know his name is a verb and the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and strength the spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh tell you one time I'm glad we're here except this time I had this question you've called this the Sevenfold spirit and I was back in here and I was only reading 6 wisdom understanding Council strength knowledge fear of the Lord and then repair site but then the first one is the spirit of Yahweh okay so if you count the spirit of y'all way but it feels like the six
 are like defining what the spirit of Yahweh is for sure that's the number of times this words words associated with Spirit the spirit of spirit of Yahweh Spirit of wisdom and oven standing total of seven but in six traits six traits of what Spirit of Delia's and what's going to be interesting is this figure is going to go on to bring Justice on the nation's a lot like with Joshua is going to do lead Israel to become Gods vehicle of Justice on the Canaanite tribes he's going to bring peace between humans and animals this is a Christmas card you know the wall for 12 the lamb little babies will play with snakes and he's going to bring God's people to dwell so that there is no pain or destruction in all God's holy mountain cuz all the Earth
 will be filled up with knowing our like the waters cover the sea is Genesis 1 verse 2 so yes it's so cool so the Spirit of Hope, Lynx Joshua to than this like
 Messianic figure that Isaiah talks about yes years and years Generations later because Joshua is way before even the time of David this is well past the time of David another words for the final compilers and Shapers of the Hebrew Bible as a whole they've arranged the story of Moses as the deliverer of Israel from their slavery out of slavery through the Wilderness on the way to the promised land he's one portrait of a delivering figure in the Hebrew Bible but now even he failed and so he's going to die outside the land see all of his stories of being gods arm of Deliverance still stand there in the Torah giving you a picture of the kind of leader that got people need
 but now that baton or you could say that torch is being passed to Joshua and so now Josh was going to be the next main character on the stage who starts filling out even more the portrait of the kind of delivery of the Gods people need to bring them into the land plant them in the new Eden land and so we'll get from numbers all the way through Deuteronomy and Joshua will be Joshua story but then he makes at least one mistake and then he's going to die and yeah, man I thought he was going to write so now you have most of his story and they're clearly set on an LG to each other and then you keep reading forward this is how the Hebrew Bible works that's Messianic literature and then the judges will all give you crazy upside down inside out inverted portraits of the kind of leader we do or don't need and then when you get to David David will be the same like a positive figure but then huge failure and death
 and so in the book of Isaiah this future seed of David is described by using language of a new Adam the Garden of Eden language he's described as a new Joshua cuz he has the spirit of wisdom when you're in Isaiah that preys Spirit of wisdom takes you backwards to the Torah so this future figure is described in terms of the language of Joshua and of Joshua's victory over you no hostile Nations but also described as a new Adam and then if you go on through the Isaiah scroll this anticipated figure is depicted as a new Moses and has a new David and this out here about works so when you're in an obscure or seems like a random will story and numbers 27 how do you read a story like this and I think this is part of what we mean when we went through the paradigms questions about reading the whole Hebrew Bible as Messianic literature this story and numbers 27 in his
 one of a whole network of stories that light up throughout the Heap Revival all interconnected in hyperlinked pointing to a future deliver figure
all right this is Ratt coming to take us back this is how these stories and numbers are designed according to the sequence of themes and ideas in Genesis 1 through 9 in the melody we just with the census cuz people are fruitful and multiplied this number 26 first part of number 27 was about male and female having responsibilities of the land together. Joseph's Ellicott second part of the number 27 appointing an atom a new human filled with the spirit and Splendor to rule the animals rule the animals that is the people in that land so I wonder what comes next a test actually that's true but let's say I miss cycle through the themes I wanted a round off like that yeah that would be awesome oh that would be beautiful I would expect the number seven like a Seventh-Day rest some of their missed cuz we're just painting the ideal picture here
 and ideal pictures like Genesis 1 culminated in the seventh day dude Numbers chapter 28 and 29 are like the number seven on fractal steroids
 it's so crazy man so it's the longest list of sacrificial offerings in the whole Torah it takes up all of chapter 28 and all of chapter 29 but it's just one list and it's all about the offerings that the Israelites are to offer on the feast days has talked about categories of offerings that you bring in needs of the moment when I want to say thank you to God writes right when I wants to talks about when to do the feast days but it doesn't have the list of what offerings to make on what feast days and why not keep it to this part of the Torah what we've done is we saved the list but could have been at home in Leviticus in by we you mean the the biblical authors
 I was imagining okay check the other Tim the biblical authors have saved a list that would have been right at home at the end of Leviticus I kid you not I would have been perfect there yeah they took it out and they put it here and it just sticks out like a sore thumb like what's it doing here but this is a moment in the melody where we're about to Signal the end of our stage 1 of like the gift of God's Eaton blessing rest with male and female is rulers over the land with a splendorous image of God to guide them this is Abel giving the good offering the Cain and Abel murder and without the Adam and Eve XL yeah but it says idea of what was Adam and Eve didn't have to do stuff in the butt remember Adam and Eve their job description and it's called to work and to keep the garden
 and those are the descriptions of what the Levites and Priests do in and around the Tabernacle their daily dude working keep it ya a list of what offering happened at what times so you know it's interesting we going to start well with the offering it takes place at morning and at night and evening it's the same words in the evening the morning and in the evening so I stay won the Genesis so it goes through so that's a day one here is the next offering then on the day of Shabbat offer this kind of offering to the seventh day so it makes sense we're going through Genesis 1 and then we're going to start going through the fractal the 7th Day on out we start with the evening and morning and then we rest on the seventh day and then we go to the Sabbath day Sabbath day rest then at the beginning and it's the word
 so it's the same word as the word in the beginning from Genesis 1:1 at the beginning of each month so here at the beginning of the 12 months can I sit here the offering to do at the beginning of each month then on the 14th day of the first month the two-time 7th day it is Passover additional offerings Manning made in the Tabernacle in addition to the Passover offerings and we're going to do is and then it's like on the seventh day you shall do no work we're going to go through Israel's whole calendar the seven feasts and offer a whole new layer and it's just all the language of the seventh day and resting and it's a good example of what's this doing here it really belongs in Leviticus
 but it's been put here as a note portraying the ideal rest of the new generation in the land this is what's possible and this is what it look like in your calendar you are like these are the moments for you to go yes we are in the land with God these are the activities were doing exactly numbers 28 and 29 in this first section of units in the third movement of numbers the final movement of numbers begins with a set of stories in laws that are portraying this generation
 as being like Adam and Eve set up in the ideal good land and so now this too long chapters are all in expansion and meditation on the seventh day of Genesis 1 of resting with God in this presents surrendering as acts of worship to the will of God so that together we can live and discern the will of God in the New England that's the picture here numbers 26 through 29 all this animal sacrifice stuff to me feels like I don't know like I'm easy like I'm not around dead animals a lot just scanning this like the word soothing Aroma appears all the time yeah yeah and you get this sense of there's actually something really calming and soothing
 variant of Noah's name it's a no Roma of rest when humans are at peace with God and they're all the sacrifices represent surrender of surrendering before God what's most valuable as an act of Honor it's the smell of barbecue in reality it's the smell of ribs smell of smoke BBQ yeah so I know that we took two episodes here just to crawl through one you know what four chapters numbers 26 to 29 but I think the value here is to see that what can feel like a hodgepodge jumble of Life at school and that's cool that's cool but why are these here there is a logic to the organization of sections in the Torah it's just maybe not a logic that feels native to us or like how we give it to it
 so it does raise the question what to go wrong well that's what I was going to ask is like then am I going to anticipate some sort of failure yeah here's what's fascinating kind of kind of what follows the numbers 30 is a random set of laws about making vows but specifically it's going to be about what happens when the valves of a husband and wife are in conflict with each other or vows between a father and a daughter that was our when you make a promise or you say you're going to do something and you bring God into it and so in the cycle of the Melody I think if you dive into vocabulary of numbers 30 will you find the vocabulary that recalls the Eden story where Adam and Eve have a conflict of Wills over what God Said and whose word is most important here and so the
 failure is reflected in that moment there and then after that numbers 31 you get a story about conflict between Brothers Cain and Abel but it's a story about a war between Israelites and their relatives the midianites interesting is designed along the motifs of the melody all leading up to the tribe the Reuben Gad and half of Manasseh deciding that they want to settle on the east side of the Jordan not in the land which is like a bit of a rebellion yes interesting it's interpreted as an act of rebellion that first and Moses gets in their faces and is like dude he doesn't say God's going to send a flood but this is actually the story that recalls the flood narrative where what these guys do is interpreted by Moses as a great Act of rebellion and he's able to avert Disaster by compelling them
 to cross over the land the arm command cross over and help their brothers and what they are to do is set up little refuges for their wives and children that house like little arcs build little refuges for your animals
 your children it's like exactly the list of what Noah brings along with him it's the animals and then his wives and his sons and daughters-in-law and then they have refuge in the ark and so these tribes are to leave their families in these little our refuges they build until they cross through the waters to go deliver their brothers and then okay we went through the cycle and poop so now that's numbers 26 to 32 is the unit is the opening unit of this movement it's exactly the themes of Genesis 1 through 9
 okay let me just say two things learning how to discern this has been a skill that I've had to work on and develop I know that some people would say this crazy year made up I'm convinced it's not makeup it's like right there to be seen so this is a skill set that I've learned from a number of Hebrew Bible scholars so you just know this isn't like me so summer Jewish Israeli Scholars Yitzhak Burger unit on Grossmont and then some are Hebrew Bible scholars but here in the states David Andrew Teeter or over in the UK Williams human so the people who'd actually see the stuff and really make a good case this is how the Hebrew Bible put together and once you look at things from that angle did he Revival black tank-top to scan the final two or three
 we're going to touch down next time so we're going to touch down on the last chapters of the numbers scroll and it's going to be all about as the Israelites go into the new land what do you do if there's murder Bloodshed in the land you know like in the flood leading up to the flood and the blood cries out from the land Highway going to prevent future floods of judgment if there's innocent blood crying out to God in the land you know we need we need a new kind of Arc but not one that floats we need a Arc that's called the City of Refuge that we need to plant all over the land and did is so cool but we'll talk about next
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we wrap up the scroll of numbers we're going to look at a store you were two and a half of the tribes of Israel decide not to go into the promised land they look at the East side of the Jordan River and think this seems a good enough these two tribes are replaying both the failure of Adam and Eve and also the failure can because this illegitimate seeing Desiring and taking what God has not given for them to take is going to lead to a division within the tribe's now the land that was supposed to be for all of them together will be only for the 10 and a half and it will be for two and a half over on this side that they've carved out this little Eden in their eyes and this leads to a division is Brothers Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts and edited by Dan demel and Tyler Bailey Lyndsay Ponder with the show notes Ashland Heights in McKenzie buxman provided the invitations for our annotated podcast
