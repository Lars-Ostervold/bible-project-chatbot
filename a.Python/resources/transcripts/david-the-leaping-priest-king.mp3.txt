who's John Collins at bible project we are in the middle of a conversation examining the role of priests in the Bible never just joining us I recommend that you stop this episode and just go back and listen from the beginning episode one but if you're like a know I could hang great thanks for joining us here's a quick overview and episode one we looked at how the first priest in the Bible are Adam and Eve in the cosmic table not explicitly call priest but the entire narrative paints them in that role showing us that the call of humanity is to be God's priests in creation the second episode looks at the first character explicitly call the priest a man named milk is a deck he's with a priest and a king of Shalem the city that will eventually become Jerusalem the third episode where introduced Aaron the first priest of Israel and the beginning of Israel's Priestly line and now you might expect the narratives about the origin of Israel
 priesthood to paint those Rosy picture but instead what we get is a bumpy ride ending with Aaron's two sons losing their own lives because they misuse the role of the priesthood today we jump forward in the story Israel's now in their own land it's been ruled by tribal judges and the Priestly line has continued so you walk into the book of Samuel and you're immediately introduced to a free from the line of Aaron Jasmine's first name you wanted to Eli and he's got two sons who actually like run the sacrificial system and there's a whole narrative dedicated to how he lies real neglectful absent-minded leader whose sons are stealing Back special offerings for the people God has had it with Israel's priests who tells Eli that he's going to do something different you going to create a new line priest we're going to do a priest from the different mind going to raise up a new Facebook create with a new family I'm going to build for him Facebook house
 household new priest and a new family and with his new line of priest comes a new Wrinkle in the role the person who is going to be priests will also serve as the anointed one that future coming one here in 1st Samuel to is called both a priest and my anointed one anointed ones the word Messiah my Messiah and then the first person who really fits the bill at my promise is David so today on the episode we will look at King David and a new vision for Israel's priesthood thanks for joining us here we go
well we are making a scene video on priest in the Bible of priests being with priests in the Bible the role in the office of the priests in the storylines bible really great I've been really enjoying it we started where we usually do in Genesis 12 3 we talked about how Humanity as a whole is described as the image of God we talked about that many times the kind of layer of emphasis I wanted to really focus on that it's important for understanding the role of priests in the Bible is it the word image is one of common words describe Idol statues that would get placed in temples and so the concept is that humanity is this human embodiment of the Divine glory and presents in the Sacred Space witch in the story of the Bible is going to be precisely what priests are in do in the Tabernacle at Temple they are the human image
 God walking walking Run is it go around the temple so that's where we started Adam and Eve in the garden for his priests the first priest in sacred high mountain garden and they aren't mediating got anyone else cuz they're the only ones around totally would have this to be a human in the garden is to be the image of God in Temple of sorts that from that heaven on Earth space they walk past the Guardians of Sacred Space which is the hybrid animals creatures that represent the creatures of the land is your land creatures with wings so they represent having dinner together if they go in the blessing and life and divine presence of Eden is now inaccessible unless God were to make it accessible and so what we're looking for
 comments and figures who bring the blessings of the Eden heaven on Earth space out to others or people who open up the way back into the Eden Heaven on their space even if it's just for a glimpse or for a moment little bit and that secrete the category of the word kohane it's actually a very common Jewish family name it's spelled with a c mostly Coen Brothers make movies if your last name is coming it's the word priest soap priests are these figures who then stands as human Gateway figures between the life of Heaven and Earth and the Earthly realm that brought us to Abraham because God selected him and his family and to be
 navigate way back into the Eden bus route back in but that's what God says I'm going to do with you and your family and then we follow Abraham and we we looked at two stories connected this theme of being priest one is that Abraham meets this in the Bible because of that and it was a priest and a king from like a Proto Jerusalem and he kind of brings this even blessing to Abraham out of the Holy Mountain just cool image and then we have a story after that of Abraham going to a mountain that is later associated with Jerusalem as well to make a sacrifice to kind of atone for his yeah they're blowing it yeah and eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad on his own terms and so trusting God and God meets him there and actually provides a toy
 for Abraham said he doesn't have to make that sacrifice and then the narrator speaks up positive story and starts talking to you the reader and saying that Israelite reader dear reader this is why we say Jerusalem that what God did for Abraham is what God is doing for us in the in the sacrificial system of the temple today us that sacrifice Abraham the god provided that is why we're still doing this today. It's the sacrificial system as a gracious gift that God provided for them to get a taste of divine forgiveness which is the way back into Eden will have to involve forgiveness for him and failure is part of the Eden blessing now is forgiveness yeah we fast-forward Abraham has a few generations of kids that's Book of Genesis we get the book of Exodus this family has grown and now they're in Egypt and our slaves
 in Egypt in orange juice to Moses really important character in The Bible Moses he is called by God to be God's like man to rescue Israel to be a priest of assorts to be the one that mediates the people to God and to mediate what God wants to Pharaoh which would be more of a profit I guess on the overlap of those two roles as their representative yeah but the prophet is more about communicating between the Divine in him okay the message has been called to be profit and Moses doesn't want to do it and he keeps saying five times he's like says I don't want to do it and God is a first-time guy gets angry in the Bible gets angry and Moses and then says well then I have a concession why don't we have your brother Aaron do it with you you don't have to say anything Aaron will speak on your behalf and in the story The Detail is that it
 who is a levite and that detail is important because what would just set up is we've created a model of what the priest is yes that Moses needs an intercessor to help him to fulfill what God wants him to do Aaron will stand in the middle and mediate that's right and as a result of Moses's unbelief and stubbornness so the Moses and Aaron Duo go to Pharaoh immediately we get glimpses at this whole idea of a Priestly mediator from the Levi's family there's something not quite perfect moment Aaron steps into the narrative things start going wrong not the way that they're supposed to be going but they do get out of Egypt to do and they're in the wilderness they go back to the mountain where God first commissioned Moses on this task
 and on this mountain now God wants to make all of Israel at the Kingdom of priests so that they will all be mediators for the Nations to the Divine who got is Awesome Kingdom of priests and so Moses goes up the mountain to meet with God and he goes up and down the mountain a lot so I get confused it's hard to fall seven times he goes up and down here at one point he goes up for 40 days to the 7th 7 anyways for 6 days and on the seventh day down time is on the 7th day he goes up into the clouds up into the sky where God's Powers been manifest and he's up there for 30 days and when he's up there he's given the blueprints for the Tabernacle kind of recreating Eden in the sacramental way and he's given basically the car
 new design for the priests they were the ones that get to go in the Tabernacle comes back down we just have that beautiful image of the shimmering shining human one white linen they were loyal and in all these gems and gold and so in this beautiful crown know I realize just now we can talk about the crown the crown it's this beautiful part of the turbine Crown but then there's this gold big plaque on it that says a Holy One or hold set apart for Yahweh but the crown supports called the nether portal for something so we'll talk about the regalia of a got a beautiful image Moses comes down we and here's Aaron now our priests and instead of waiting it out he gets anxious and Eve
 still at 8 solve Israel putting a gold together and they make a golden calf represent the very first command they were given not today and the tragic irony is that while Moses is getting a vision of this image of God human roll instead of clothes that are in the supposed to wear had the chance and he did get to but you have a chance to do it without blowing it out of wearing this outfit that would make him look like Adam and Eve 2.0 and what he is doing is giving his allegiance to an image instead of being the image of God they end up worshipping the image of an animal and it's the second version of Genesis 1 where that kind of yeah that's for sure what Paul is thinking about so this is all connected to the question how does Humanity get back in Seattle
 Sacred Space to be connected with God and his eternal life partnered with him to rule creation and this is a glimpse of a way back in this mediation between by a priest but it's just not going well at all yeah that's right the one real surprising thing though is that Moses goes back up and then when he needs for his brother intercede for Aaron and all the people kind of does a Priestly going to move even though he's the one that forfeited being a priest to Aaron in the first place and then it goes so well that he begins to glow and shine and in body what it is to be the image of God has Bruce Lee weigh so much so that he has to put like a veil in front of the Ya-Ya Moses is up in the heavens offering his life for the sins of his brother and of all the people and as he does that he begins to take on the Divine go
 shining skin shining his life for the sins of the many let's of Isaiah 53 figure out there but then Moses a story goes on after that high point and he had to have some successes and failures and then one big failure later on the book so now you want to take us fast forward to a whole new era you have Israel with King David that's right
so coming out of the Garden of Eden you know the promise of the seed of a woman will crush the head of the snake we're looking for an image of God will open the way back up to Eaton it's going to be someone like no kiss attack and like Abraham was not store it'll be someone like Moses at that moment of offering his life but it's not can be actual Moses so you keep forward to reading looking just as a quick tour come up just now and then in the story as we leave the pentateuch and Moses and Aaron so the priests in the Tabernacle or cruising around with Joshua take possession of the land they don't play a huge role as a couple moments that we don't have time to look at it to get into the Book of Judges it's another really negative critical portrayal of the priests the only priest that get portrayed and especially near the end of the book are really corrupt money-hungry priest or sexually abusive priests it's those really bad stomach turning stories at the end of
 I just was all have priests from the line of Levi and Eren at the center of them once again - score for the levite priesthood in the Hebrew Bible it's not good PR for a priest from the line of Aaron who's sitting on a throne chair but two sons who actually like rum the sacrificial system and there's a whole narrative dedicated for Samuel 1 and 2 so how Eli's really this neglectful absent-minded L his sons are stealing sacrificial offering this from the people there's these Priestess women who watch over who comes in and out of the Tabernacle and Eli
 sons having sex with these women in the round the temple it's bad stuff from the narrator's point of view and Eli when he hears about it and gives the sun's a little talking to but he doesn't like stop them at all so in for Samuel to we're introduced to just the speaker called a man of God a profit comes with a message for Eli and this message is crucially important it's anticipates the whole drama that's the following the rest of the books of 1st and 2nd Samuel Susan 1st Samuel 22 verse 27 man of God damn this is what you always says didn't I clearly reveal myself to the house of your father when you were in Egypt under Pharaoh I chose him your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be a priest to me to go off, iron alter was that I had chosen to burn incense to wear
 episode one of those shining garments my presence and I gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the sons of Israel from the beginning why do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings why you lie do you honor your son's more than you honor me fattening yourselves on the choice parts of the offerings of the people this is what y'all are the god of Israel says in the past I said that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever so that's recognizing hear that in this is some passages we didn't have time to look at but in the Book of Numbers there's a story about a priest named Phineas who is zealous and faithful to God and God says I reward the priesthood of your lying with an eternal priesthood you going to be my priest rapper
 the line of Aaron in the priesthood three leave I would walk before me forever but now you always says no that's not going to be the case with translations God says far be it for me to do that thing that I said I was going to do those who honor me those who despise me I will treat as cursed that sound familiar so you will be blessed are those who treat you as cursed I will curse but what if you have people from that family who it's not about whether or not they curse their own family it's whether or not the honour or despise the god of Abraham and that's what God saying about the priest of Israel right now you're supposed to honor me but in fact your tree
 with contempt the days are coming when I'm going to hack off your arm and the arm of the House of your father and none in your house will reach old age I am going to raise up for myself a faithful priest
 cool what is a faithful priest do well he will do what is in my heart and in my my soul my nefesh b'nefesh yes well it's the same same video I mean God is two pictures is easier as a lot of Levi and Eren represents the priest said that's just like any other crap Human Institution but God is on a mission to raise up a priest to what that priest just does is what that priest wants is what God wants is what God wants. I said yeah yeah this priest will emerge with God's will allow me right now it's hard I'm going to build for him a faithful house house that you can count on his house metaphorically here it's like a family failing to not only a singular I like the high priest yes he's a high priest so you have a high priest
 and his house is family God saying I'm done with your family starting again we're going to do a priest from a different different line than her family I'm going to raise up a new Facebook priest with a new family I'm going to build for him if a faithful house household new priest and a new family and it will walk that is that faithful house will walk before my anointed one for all of the days so up a 30 God said Remember the past you lie when I said your house would walk before me forever but you clearly didn't and so I'm going I'm canceling that promise and what I'm going to do is raise up a Facebook priest and a faithful house that will walk before me walk before my anointed One Forever God's going to raise up a priest what's his anointed one referring to exactly the same as my anointed one
 doesn't seem like it where is the Facebook priest alongside my my anointed one as a people think what's being predicted here is the rise of a future priest who will serve alongside a king could also be that the faithful priest is the anointed one and so that's going to raise up and anointed priest and also a faithful house that will be faithful to the vision of the Facebook page either way what does promise does is it sent to you on reading into the book to say okay well I'm looking for a faithful priest and a faithful anointed one that is somebody that God is going to build a house for Eli he's just the man of God was prophet the way to highlight their message who it was didn't matter What mattered was the message that they bore so so you're just now you're on your on the hunt as a reader to look for this one
 the next figure who gets raised up is Samuel and he's awesome he's like sleeps in and around the temple his mom makes from this beautiful little Priestly robe every year that he gets bigger he talks with God and you like a sandal he's awesome maybe he's the one turns out it's not Samuel Samuel anointed Saul to because I'm the first king of Israel maybe it's all you read through his story definitely not saw but when Saul finally disqualifies himself in the first name of 15 the next a narrative God says to Samuel go to Bethlehem to this guy's house named Jesse and among one of his sons is the one whom I will make my anointed one yep protector to the raising up of a house It's Time by David I think the narrative is every line points that this is an anticipation of David okay what's fascinating about future coming
 here in 1st Samuel to is called both a priest and my anointed one in English the Hebrew word underneath this which is Misha and then the first person who really fits the Bill Evans promise is David for the sons of Jesse one of the sons of Jesse son first time in 16 step total yeah it's an epic story wish we had time to read that but oh, Nate's in David being brought in from the field as the youngest son and Samuel takes out the horn and animal horn haul it out carrying oil and he pours it on David's head and it's the word Messiah as a verb and then right when the oil is pouring on him he's empowered withhold the spirit of Yahweh also came upon him and we're starting to think like well this guy we're getting pretty excited
 so awesome I've learned so much about the David story in the last year we'll have to do something and some video somewhere the next day after he has anointed is he goes and confronts Goliath a Nephilim and he defeat Goliath by a head wound he crushes the head the story is so interested in Goliath head and how David what David does chops off in that chops off the head this is the snake crushing teeth telling for sure without a doubt read a great study of the serpent Genesis 3 15 Motif in the book of Samuel related to the David story called The Serpent in Samuel by Brian Verrett so good it's like a theme study of snake design patterns the Genesis 3 design pattern Network in the book of Samuel pretty legit and so David is set up as being the seed of the woman figure we're like
 great let's see what happens with this guy the culmination of his story was it reaches its high point is in the book of 2nd Samuel chapters 5 through 8 and we don't have time to look at this whole section but one of the key moments is when he takes the city of Jerusalem he goes to Canaanite called gibbous is that City where milk is a deck and where he was the priest king with that was when the possession of it after I called and he makes it the capital of all the tribes it's right on the boundary between Judah and the South and then the tribes in the north protected in the Hills toilet then what he does is he decides to move the Tabernacle and the Ark up to it up to the highest point of the city and that's the story we're going to read right here all day
 yeah yeah so since 2nd Samuel 6 verse 12 following
and David went and they brought up the Ark of God from the house of Obed Edom into the city of David with gladness this is really clunky translation translation in English but it's great Hebrew in English and they brought up the Ark of God from the house of Obed Edom into the city of David with gladness and so it was when the Bears of the Ark of Yahweh had gone six Paces he sacrificed an ox and a fatling oh yeah this is Bill like this is the parade really slow parade every six Paces a second make sacrifice 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 of the creative use of the number 7
 7th they stop and surrender and offering up to God so good and David was dancing before y'all way with all his might and David was wearing a linen how do you pronounce ephod in Hebrew know I don't say it the way you would said now David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the Arc of Yahweh with shouting and sound of a trumpet of the trumpet and it happened at the Arc of you always came into the city of David that Michael number, call Mija the daughter of Saw looked out the window and she saw King David leaping and dancing before you go away and she despised him in her heart and they brought in the Arc of Yahweh and they sent it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it and David offered burnt offerings and peace offering
 before y'all were at David finished offering the burnt offering in the peace offering and he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts and he distributed to all the people to all the multitude of his real both men and women a kick of bread and one of dates and one of raisins to each one and all the people departed each to his house and David returned to bless his house the story continues into next and this is the high point where David declares that the high point in Jerusalem is now the new Eden spot isn't it interesting that this story brings together a whole network of what by now in the Hebrew Bible you know where many books in is all of these images that are design pattern motifs based on Genesis 1 1 through 3 so they go up to the high place this phrase Ark of God and Arc of Yahweh each of pierced
 sometimes the store in this chapter yeah yeah every seventh step they offer sacrifice David is dressed like the high priest is as the garments of the of the prettier one that Moses was told about Nexus there's a group of people that are just called the carriers of the Arc of Yahweh know those are Levites but they're not called Levites here is if somebody doesn't want us to be distracted with the line of Levi right now there's something new happens there's something new happening where the king of all the tribes are coming together in unity to recreate Eden on the high place of Jerusalem and David takes up the role of Israel's priest and King in Jerusalem and he's going for it I mean he is leaping
 why is it just the attention of is just on the ark are they bringing the whole Tabernacle app not just inside the tent which David pitched so there's like Artie there David to set up for the tenth yeah and this has to do with the role of the Ark in Joshua specifically and then and in the book of Samuel where it becomes kind of the icon of the whole thing where it's at this box that represents the whole Tabernacle package David's having a great time he's having a great time one of David's wives thinks he's making a fool of himself and that's actually what after you stopped reading then very next day so that's that's one of the argument that he has yeah but I'm just trying to bring the Arc of Yahweh and install it on the high place he does what Noah did when you got off the arc he does what Abraham did when he first got into the land and went up to a high place called
 near The Oaks of Maura Murray Boo Cakes of bread date cakes and raisin sweet sweetness is all design pattern stuff of Eatin of abundant food Lessing worship humans with God and one particular royal priesthood connecting the people to the blessings of Eden on the high place in Jerusalem like Moses up there like interceding giving his life for the sins of the people he starts glowing that's his high point this is David High Point right here we're still maybe this guy is going to he's going to bring us all back into God's presence and then the nation of Israel to bring all the nations
 and in the story of Israel this is the first person like this no one's brought together these roles the only other person we've met like this was also a king priest in the same exact City that's interesting yes David is adopting a milk is attacked like roll he's rejoining the office of priest and King yeah he's doing the thing Generations before before this was an Israelite City before there was an Israel there was a man who was a priest-king from this place you came to Abraham and provided a feast and blessing he did exactly what it says if no kiss attack and who he was and what he did was like a script waiting to be played out here in the same city for shadow and and Dave
 intentionally picks up the script and begins acting the milk is a deck roll it is cool so what about David's Behavior there's some people who see David's behavior is inappropriate cuz they assume that that division between King and priest was like something God wanted David becoming the Royal priest and God's response to it is in the next chapter which is a watershed moment in the Hebrew Bible 2nd Samuel 7:12 is like Grand Central Station to the whole story 2nd Samuel 7 is that whole Blessing of Abraham is now going to get channeled into David and Steve
so like a sandwich 7 is awesome and we don't have time to go into it in detail I just have a little chart in the nose if you just go through What God Says David in this chapter and you recall all of the times God spoke to Abraham it's like what God says to David is the greatest hits of what he said to Abraham but then with some even more awesome stuff added in the remix so it's real quick what God says to David I'm going to make your name great that's why I said Abraham I'm going to make a place for my people and plant them and they will dwell in their place that's eating vocabulary got planted eaten but now the people are the garden that's going to plant people in the new Eden spot the David just said up there will be no more trouble and evil people won't depress them anymore I'm going to give you rest from all your enemies remember what milk is a text to Abram he said Blessed Be
 God of Abraham who delivered your enemies into your hand so part of God's blessing is to bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you away is going to build a house for you David remember the met the man of God speech was I'm going to raise up a faithful priest and a faithful house David is our King praised and now God's promising to build that house so what is the house it's not a building seed descendants I'm going to raise up your seed after you one who will come from your loins and I will establish that seeds Kingdom that seed will build a house for my name and I will establish the Throne of that seeds Kingdom forever I will be a father to that seed and not seed will be to me as a son that's good stuff in it doesn't get much better than this so distinct member back to the father-son connection
 to the image of God you have to have a few conversations go have a son Seth son of Adam is called the image of Adam the image and likeness of Adam some father-son language becomes and another way of saying that someone is the image so when God says this seed will be the sun it's another way of saying the seed will be an image of God now it's that seed does evil than God's going to bring punishment on that one with a human Rod of humans and with human strikes so what does setting us up is always fun to do in a classroom setting cuz if you stop right before here everyone in the room so I called Jesus right here but if he does evil for the whole story of the line of day
 what is to follow in the book of kings and there's going to be almost twenty generations and every one of them is going to strike out and so that's what this whole premise is setting us up for because look at what God says when someone of your line does evil then they're going to get what's coming to them but God says my loyal love will not be removed from the seed your house faithful will be your house number and that was the promise we'll do a faithful house and your kingdom will remain forever before me your throne will be firm forever so any generation of David seed can either rise up to the occasion and fill the role that God has destined for the seed of David or they can disqualify themselves in which case they'll get what's coming to them and of the promise we'll pass on as an opportunity for the Next Generation that's the logic care is it also hinting at Solomon in the temple a little bit
 yes I saw him and becomes the first seed of David and he builds a and he bailed out house so it raises the whole question of how well is Solomon the Fulfillment of it and there's a moment when Solomon is inaugurated as king he says that he's the Fulfillment of the promise you quotes this new Pharaoh cool looking building that's like the Tabernacle you know * 100 but he fills it with treasures and then the rest of the book of King and it took any and all kinds of stuff it seems really not like maybe we got asked for his lion Throne you know he puts his house right next to the temple but bigger was the one detail that is so much swag there was like all in like just all this like who's the Lions Red Lion Throne 10 steps
 oh yeah did carved Lions yeah that's how that house that Temple they built just get slowly vandalize degraded and destroyed and eventually burned up but my oil level not be removed from your seat of your seed and your house will be faithful yes and the throne will be from the narrative is already telling us that David seeds going to blow it is preparing us design it's already the story's already been told from The Narrative perspective not from you the reader you still just going on the journey but from the narrator's point of view on the mind and so we know from the perspective of the Hebrew Bible that no one of David's line ever she filled his promise and that the temple in Jerusalem was not the ultimate house
 God wanted to have built for him but there will be a faithful house connected to the seed of David and all the way back to the beginning of Samuel he's a king but he's also a priest you're saying this was written after the destruction of the temple yeah the final shape of Samuel flows right into Kings and the last event and in King's is about the the destruction of the Temple and so this story is being written from the vantage point of somebody who's knows the temple is going to be destroyed her act knows it is going to be Exile still wants you to know that despite all that baseball schedule of when I first got together we know that milk is it important David is intentionally taking up that milk is giving him yep and also remember the whole story of Moses and Aaron was telling us that the line of Aaron and that priesthood was a failed project from the beginning so we were already looking for a priest or a royal priesthood
 from some other place and we are both surprised but not surprised when ends up to be the shepherd kid out in the field from Jessie's house here in the surprise is named Shepard who ends up being elevated as the faithful Royal priest this is the high point this promise right here becomes the high point and even though it's about a future king it's about a future king priest because that's what David has just taken on for himself and the whole thing of the building of a house means the building of the temple this King will be the architect of a true Temple the re-establishment of Eden so all of this is crucial for setting up what will become a major theme in the profits in the Psalms is you read on from 2nd Samuel 7 that's the high point it's immediately starts going downhill not but a few chapters later David has
 is Genesis 3 moment when he sees and desires Bathsheba on the Roof Inn on the high place he's up on the roof in Hebrew the it's the word Gog and that letter Deemo looks exactly like another Hebrew letter which is the letter noon so if you squint at it just went out at what you also see is the word gun which is the Hebrew word for garden David is on the god this is the literary art kind of thing to say he's on the roof but if you squint at the word roof it turns into the word Garden so David is up on his high place and he sees and desires and takes a woman and then at least of the downfall of his house and so you was the reader like oh well he's not the one but whenever the one comes he's going to need to be that Royal priest Melchizedek
 David type of figure and so the book of Psalms is all about this The Book of Psalms this is one of the biggest compositions in the Hebrew Bible and it's an elaborate set of poetic meditations on the core themes that work in the rest of you were viable and this whole theme of The Royal priest from live David is front and center for us and it just so happens that this all Russia's together in one particular song that is the most quoted and alluded to Palm in by Jesus the apostles also happens to be the only other place where milk is attack is named in the Hebrew Bible we called Psalm 110
 Psalm 110 is short and dense like Hebrew like everything that comes in two halves it's it has two symmetrical sequences are tryouts lot like the design of Genesis 1 YouTube major is related to David a song and utterance of Yahweh to my Lord sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet
 you're strong scepter may you always and forth from Zion rule in the midst of your enemies your people are Noble in the day of your power and holy array from the womb of the Dawn that's cool cuz I usually translated what's that the womb of the Dawn some will translate it it's literally the womb of the which of the metaphor for Sunrise it must be translated differently in the womb of the Dawn American Standard English Standard Version the womb of the morning from the Dew of the morning swim there
 Wilmington this is an utterance of y'all way to yes my lord said it's related to David and it's as if David is speaking to the reader at the Palm and the first thing David says it's a let me tell you something that I overheard you always say to my Lord David call Jesus Tunis on your way cuz you always a way of talking about someone who he sees as his authority that the other than y'all way you overheard this conversation in the last line of this first half is to do as yours I have forgotten you yeah it's one whom God has declared his son
 so what David overheard of you always saying to his Lord is a quote right here come sit at my right hand share my throne and rule over the nation's and God says I'll make your enemies your footstool did this is this is the image of God in Genesis 1 subdue and rule the image of God is one who embodies and God's Divine rule over anything that's hostile to God's purposes David speaks up and he says of this Lord he gives them well wishing's here is the second part you are strong scepter may you always send forth from Zion rule in the midst of your enemies it's as if David is saying yes my Lord may that be true of you rule from Zion rule in your enemies but then we're told that this Lord of David has a people who are coming in the day of his power dressed like priests
 in holy garments that's what that's mean that in holy array holyclothing so now we have the Key of David who comes alongside this King and they're all dress like priests and this is like a new it's a new morning it's a new creation yes it's a it's the sunrise and the image of do the Dew of the morning is this important biblical poetic image of new creation of this magical water to water the land who knows where it comes from or where it goes and just like the morning the new birth of life so God is declaring that this Lord of David is the Divine son who got an image of God who shares in God's Rule and with him is the kingdom of priests
 and it repeats it begins with another thing that you always said except this time it's what we read is Yahweh swore enough and he will not go back on that us go yeah I remember when you went back on enough 1st Samuel to Canada and yeah that's true I was thinking more of those to David made this promise I'll take the oath that God won't go back on and here it is you the Lord this Lord of David you are a priest Forever on account of milk is attack we will talk about it then David speaks up again to talk about his Lord Yaweh is that your right hand I thought he was always right but now you always at his right hand to read each other's right hand soap the Lord of David's it's that you always right hand But now y'all way is that David Lord's right hand when he's out on the battlefield confronting his enemy
 remember you always said I'll make your enemies your footstool so it's as if when they're when they're in the throne room the Lord of David said that you always right hand but when they're out confronting the enemy's Yahweh is with him at his right hand and kings in the day of his anger judging the nation's filling up with corpses he shatters the head over a mighty land the head shattering and then the last poem he this is the Lord of David will drink from the stream on the path then he will lift up his head and the Parliament this is Lord drinking from the stream of the pass in the sting of this king is a mail cuz it act like a priest because of no kiss attack on account of some milk is it did something that is now bearing fruit
 that the lion of David is now being declared a royal Priestly line is a guy named milk is addicted something well there's one and it's a story about how he blessed me and remember we go why is there a whole story about this guy who's the first one to bless Abraham after God says the one who blesses you I'm going to give blessing to buy what I think because that narrative is setting us up for the Seed of Abraham who is David who's going to come later in the narrative to become this Royal priest that God is going to bless David's line as being the source of this true image of God Royal priest who will do the milk is a text saying in Jerusalem which is to be the king and the frame
 so most translations translate this according not to the Hebrew but according to the Septuagint translation which reads you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek which amounts to the same thing but and Hebrew what it says is because of milk is that is this milk is it at did something that now is bearing fruit and so the rest of the poem goes on to talk about this milk is it at Royal priest see the David will shatter the head will be the snake Russia and then the last line is this little Narrative of he's out on the battlefield next Thursday so we kneel down by a stream like drinks the water and then list of his head I think this is ripping off of the story of Gideon when God test his army takes it down to three how they're going to drink and it's all about if they drink with their heads raised up at the stream refreshing themselves as they fight the mid
 so you know this is a dense obviously is the dense all the songs are like this they're all just hyperlinked but you know you can see this poem is drawing together seems from Genesis one from Abraham story from the David story remind me how did Jesus use this because he quotes this Jesus quotes this two times in Jerusalem I thought we could look at it later but Jesus at two crucial moments starts a conversation with the leaders of the Jerusalem Temple about the significance of this pain here and the net effect of where we're going with this is that Jesus saw himself as the Lord as David's Lord and even Jesus saw himself as a priest who's coming to assert his authority over Jerusalem the image of God fully realized
 Melchizedek new David figure coming to do what David actually never ended up being able to fully do or any of the seed of David which is to build a house for a true house for God on the high place why do they have to get so McCobb to hear about corpses filling up I think it's connected because so much of the snake crushing Motif is carried forward through the nearest snake but there's a seat of the snake bites and some of the enemies of David are depicted as being but sometimes Israelites are the seat of the snake depending on their choices so Jesus saw himself playing out the script that is all brought together here in Psalm 110 and I know this is complicated I know this maybe we can do an explainer
 is there was a simpler way to tell the story of the priesthood I would want to do it but this is how the Bible tells the story and Jesus clearly cared about all this milk is a deck David stuff is really important cuz they are so front center and it's a big deal in the letter to the Hebrews so I feel like if we really want to honor the story of the priesthood we have to find a way to do that I think we can do it I think we can do we covered a lot of ground yeah
 thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast next week we'll continue this series looking at priests in the Bible Peter says to Jesus a rabbi Mass so glad we're here right now do you make three Tabernacle you'll get your own you'll have a special Tabernacle just for you but you know Moses and Elijah they should also have a tabernacle and then Mark I love this Mark stepped outside the store I need tells the reader he didn't know what he was saying they were terrified and then all the sudden then next verse all at once they looked around and it's all done and if they were coming down the mountain Jesus gave them orders strict orders don't tell anyone what they saw until the son of man rises from the dead so there's something that they just witnessed that won't make sense to anybody until his death and then his Vindication for that then the story will make sense and so what
