we have done it we have reached the last episode in our journey through the entire Torah Ohr in the last movements of the last roll of the Torah Deuteronomy at the end of a grand Journey it's good to stand proud and celebrates but today that would be insensitive because Deuteronomy ends with a death the death of Moses before he dies Moses stand before his real one last time to give a farewell speech it's a poem in which he predicts that is real will abandon their Covenant with y'all with it's a poem that future Generations can look back at soberly to realize that it is they that have abandoned your way but not the other way around the language of Genesis chapter 6 looks at the human heart in the generation of the flood and the purpose of their scheming heart is only Evil all the time as severe as you always saying I know their purpose to know their hearts
 do I want this song to stand as a witness that I know they're going to band in me and in case you ever want to say that I didn't this song will stand here as a witness home in Deuteronomy 32:4 Dick's Israel's coming rebellion and it repeatedly refers to a group that Yahweh calls his people the ones who will remain faithful to the who are these people it's not all of Israel Yahweh is identifying himself with a persecuted religious minority throughout the whole of his real history those are always actual Peep and the majority of Israel associated with the Kings and Their Kingdoms and their Wars in reality where the faceless ones and Yahweh will bring Justice on those who deserve it but for his Remnant people they are a source of joy for the nation and they're connected with atonement that will happen for the people in the land Deuteronomy 30
 you is a poem that takes a look back at Israel's history and also takes a pathetic look forward to the future of Israel it's a mysterious poem and the fitting way to end our journey through the toilet so this poem is laying out the program that you're about to go read in Joshua Judges Samuel King in the former prophets and at this point I'm right here like every book of the Bible is the back to and builds and develops vocabulary Moses becomes like the archetypal profit here and every Prophet it becomes like a mini mosa near the end of the tour and all the sudden you looking down the rest of the Hebrew Bible and you feel like you're looking towards the New Testament today to Mackey and I talked about Moses his magnum opus of poetic song becomes a pivotal points in the story of the Bible of Joan Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 it's him it's on this is that this is a momentous conversation for us I think we just counted for us the end of 48 conversations going through the tour I guess that doesn't count and Cuban are episodes that brings it up to over 50 have finished today or walk through the main literary movements of the Torah yes it's been a good pace and choosing to do three episodes per movements yet or has how many movements does that then will we B 12 + 4 16 movement 12 + Genesis has 4 and Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy chapter 3
 I think yeah yeah I've been wondering about Leviticus I can actually do see how there could be too but either way it puts us in the ballpark of 4 + 12 which is around 15 16 oz means we haven't looked at everything by no means but we've gotten a really good overview of the shape of the Torah of some of the main patterns that are left on throughout the Torah and then we landed down in certain stories and then gotten real in the weeds and certain senses and here we are at the end of Deuteronomy the last scroll the Torah where in the last movement of Deuteronomy and we're going to be in the last session the last the last movement of the last letter a unit of the last movement of the last Scrolls of the Torah says Deuteronomy 31 through 34 in this section Moses is
 going to say I'm going to die and then he's going to sing some final ponds and then he's going to die so this is about the death of Moses but the way it brings all the themes of the Torah and its language together is it pretty cool way
 we need to do set up over the whole Torah again I feel like we've done it so many times no not the whole Torah but why is Moses can talk about dying yet where is he who's he talking to you Moses is addressing the children of the Exodus generation on the east side of the Jordan River as they are about to go into the land he is not going to go into the land both for his sins and he also blames it because of the sins of the people that made him send but he's called the servant of Yahweh and he's going to die for his sins and for the sins of his people outside the land he was the one who delivered them the one you always use to deliver the Israelites out of slavery and mediated their Covenant relationship and the giving of the laws of the Torah all the Mount Sinai and now Deuteronomy it's just one long side of speeches calling them to Covenant loyalty see our way so that this generation goes into the land but
 Bobby Moses who brings them in it will be his Protege a man named Joshua in Hebrew which means Yahweh brings Deliverance or salvation what the guys name is good then yeah it is a good name so and just macro this generation of Israel standing at the border of the promised land the promised land is depicted with all the language and imagery of the Garden of Eden so what Adam & Eve forfeited and lost through their Folly and Exile from Eden now here is this generation standing outside of a new type of Eden and their entry into it and their ability to experience long life and blessing in the land depends on whether they will listen to you always demands and decreased like out of me felt too
 so we're going to die then your Deuteronomy 31 and think to start reading and I'll point out cool stuff and it's off of Deuteronomy 31 verse 1 so Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel and he said to them I am 120 years old today
 I am no longer able to come and go and besides you always said to me you're not crossing the Jordan
 it always an extra versus nasty self the question who is it that's going ahead of the people to bring them into the land
 it is Yahweh your Elohim who will cross before you he'll destroy enemy Nations before you Yul dispossess them Joshua is the one who will cross the head of you just to see how is spoken before you it's Joshua who goes before you so both Yahweh Elohim and an image of Yahweh Elohim kind of like two sides of the same coin
 Zoe Kazan verse 6 be strong and courageous don't be afraid of or tremble at the nations in the land you always the one who goes with you he will not fail you or forsake you
 Moses called Joshua in the eyes of Israel saying be strong courageous you will go with these people into the land that you always warned to give them you always the one going ahead of you he won't fail or forsake you get the idea this is the passing of the Baton happening right now as of all the people so what Moses has been for the people now Joshua will be for the people he's a new Moses
 and he's going to be portrayed as a new Moses when you turn the next call Joshua he is going to give them a speech in the Joshua chapter 1 the sounds just like Moses about obeying the terms of the Covenant he's going to go ahead of the people and lead the people through Waters that split and they go through the sea as if on dry land doll stuff from The Exodus story but now it's Joshua doing it and then the people say after that life we will listen to you just like we listen to Moses song
 so that's the setup here okay we're passing On to the Next Generation verse 9 so Moses wrote this Torah this tour are referring to the guy we talked about Moses is writing down something and passing it on it would have have to have been some protein like we call it the pro tour okay but the author an aerator you know who stands at some distance from these events wants you to see the thing that you were holding in your hand has essentially the same thing as the thing Moses is writing even though narratively if you know there's all the stuff in the tour that we have in our hands that comes the narrative or the perspective of
 bits and pieces all the love from Genesis all come from a later perspective but there is a deep continuity between Moses's Proto Toya in the Torah we have in our hands and we were meant to see them as deeply connected cool I guess that there seems to be a Nuance between the Torah that God gave Israel at Sinai and then what Moses is doing in Deuteronomy which is reestablishing that for the next generation is it that like renew to Torah that Moses is giving to the second generation or is it in referring to the whole Covenant
 like yeah I think that's what I'm saying within just Deuteronomy it seems to refer to the actual content of a Proto Deuteronomy before you the reader you have in your hands you know a five scroll Torah scroll yes and Deuteronomy has been eluding back to every part of the earlier Scrolls of the Torah right I think that's kind of what I mean I see that what Moses has in his hands of the Prototype version of what do drawings going to be which is just a part of the entire Torah where is putting in front of us has the five scroll Torah which is meant to be encapsulated in this phrase just the store I'm saying at the end of every seven years you know when you release everybody from debt slavery and that's at the Feast of booths so in the seventh month
 so at the end of every seven years in the seventh month get everybody to gather together and read this Torah for all the Israelites men women children immigrants everybody
 so they can hear and learn to fear Yahweh and all of the words to tour
 okay then, I said to Moses look you're about to die
 forget Joshua present yourselves at the tent of meeting so that I can commission him so Joshua went to the tent
 yeah we appeared in the tent and a pillar of cloud the cloud stood at the doorway of the tent this is Bo's recalling the end of Exodus when y'all wake came to you know Living tent in the cloud also recalling the Eden story when y'all wake came to dwell in Eden and were Cain and Abel came to present their offerings at the door of the garden so this is to tribal brothers so to speak and one is passing on the mantle of leadership and authority to another
 she always said to Moses look you're about to lie down with your father's and this people will get up and become a prostitute
 with the strange gods of the land the land of going into they're going to forsake me they're going to break my Covenant that I made
 my anger will become hot against them in that day and I will forsake them so just recall what he said up two times here is a Joshua you're going to lead the people into the land and I will not fail you or forsake you be courageous I don't feel your forsake you but these people are going to forsake me and so I will forsake them
 and I will this introduction of a new metaphor for divine Justice here I will hide my face from them
 and they will be eating up
 and many evils and troubles will come upon them
 so we've had imagery of God's hot anger it appeared for the first time at Mount Sinai when y'all way was commissioning Moses
 and Moses said yeah I'm not going to do it makes me realize I didn't go against pharaoh to yes I'm saying the first time it appeared was at the burning bush story when Moses that I know I don't worry and that was the first time you always got angry but it wasn't followed by you know when active judgment it was Yahweh called Aaron his brother to come help him a second time. It's hot anger is referred to is in the poem retelling the story of what God did the Pharaoh in the waters and so destroying pharaoh and his army in the waters was viewed as the first time that you always anger is mentioned in the story where y'all way acted with an active swear that in The Narrative of the plagues there was reference to God's anger against Pharaoh no no
 yeah God's anger towards the first time in the burning bush with Moses and then the second time in Exodus is mentioned as in the mix is 15 and both of those the importance of that observation I owe to Daniel hawk in his book the violence of God is amazing study of God's anger got the violence in the Hebrew Bible so but here we get the addition of a new metaphor of another was when God what does it look like what are the different ways the Hebrew Bible describes God bringing judgement on his Covenant Partners disloyalty and so hot anger is one of them but abandoning them is Deuteronomy 31 17 I like forsaking them they want me to leave them alone cuz I want to go after other guys like I'll leave you be
 and that is equated with hiding my face from them
 which is the opposite of the blessing of Aaron from Numbers Chapter 6 may the Lord bless you may he keep you may the Lord lift his face over you and give you some is a such a vivid image like of relational intimacy if I'm looking at you that's a sign of favor attention and a relational connection yeah but the hide your face from somebody silent treatment is the silent treatment and they will be what's the result of Yahweh hiding his face they will be eating up the land in the nation will pick them up the waters will come back of wash over them and the people will say in that day isn't it because our Gods no longer among us through all these peoples have come on us
 so the idea is if you always with us in our midst it's his face shining on us and hold back the chaos holds back the waters gives light instead of Darkness will keep the wild animals back and we'll keep the Nations that are hostile to us it's sort of like Yahweh is life but the moment Yahweh leaves then the water is its wash back up over the land Darkness instead of light wild animals and armies invaded so we're back to the images of creation and Chaos from Genesis chapter one here that's idea Yahweh hiding his face was an image of Yahweh another phrase that's used for divine judgement starting here going on where does he always handing people over
 I give them over to XYZ which is another way of talking about Yahweh withdrawing his creative protective life giving presents
 so you flags at this inconsistency of thought and I won't forsake you but you can take me somewhere for a Q3 hot what what do you do with that well so I won't forsake you when he says to Joshua in the people I won't forsake you it's when they are going forward into the land their small you know they're a band of escaped slaves that forms makeshift Melissa to Koken to the land where there's established you know Fortress cities throughout the land inhabited by Giants so that's this make up here so go forward and Joshua leave them and I won't I'm not going with you guys right now but and so if they play The Prostitute with other gods and forsake me then I'll give you what you want which is to be in the
 and so I will forsake you in other words it's the people's disposition do y'all way I think that is the hinge I'm going to do this thing for you and you can trust me I'm going to do it when I bring you to the land and even though it's it's scary and brats I will I will protect you but then after I've done this thing for you you're going to turn away from me and which other gods and then I'm going to give you what you want if you don't want my face to shine upon you will do for you but you're not able to do for yourselves but when you don't want to be in relationship with me anymore then you can go out on your own good luck with that
 that's the logic are so there's 19 therefore God says to Moses write this song for all of y'all teacher to the sons of Israel put it on their lips so that this song will be a witness for me against the sons of Israel
 Moses just wrote the Torah and that is a statement of like the Covenant terms
 clean garden is real but now we're going to write a poem
 is on now when I bring visitor lights into the land flowing with milk and honey that I forwarded their forefathers and when they eat when they're satisfied and become prosperous and when they turned other gods and serve them and break my Covenant then it will come about when all the troubles and terrible things have come upon them then this song will be a witness that testify against them cuz it will never be forgotten on the lips of their to send this for I know the purpose that they are scheming to do today the purpose of the human heart this is the language of Genesis chapter 6 what God looks at the human heart in the generation of the flood and the purpose of their scheming Hearts is only Evil all the time so here's you always saying I know their purpose I know their hearts
 so I want this song to stand as a witness that I know that you're going to band in me and in case you ever want to say that I didn't the song will stand here as a witness so this is all irrational for the writing of a poem that we called Deuteronomy 32:4 Moses says okay everybody assemble all the leaders and the tribes I'm going to call the skies in the land as Witnesses here after my death you're going to act correctly exactly the same language has
 how the land in Genesis 6 Before the Flood the land was corrupted here is he are going to act correctly and turn away from what I've commanded and terrible things are going to happen at the end of days
 you will do evil in the eyes of Yahweh why did you just send the days this is a unique phrase that is what Jacob said to the sons of Israel at the end of the Genesis scroll on the other end of the Torah All My Sons assemble gather around let me tell you what will happen at the end of days and now here's Moses Gathering the great great great great great grandson of bad things guy and saying gather around let me tell you what will happen at the end of days and so here's the problem it's long 43 vs Raptor really fattening stuff
 actually married then NIV translation just cuz of the new American Standards difficult English
 listen you heavens and I will speak here you Earth the words of my mouth
 let my teaching Fall Like Rain Let My Words descend like do like showers on new grass like abundance rain on tender plants
 scrimmage beautiful image yeah so Torah my instruction
 is the source of Life Tree of Life imagery here God's instruction leads to come and fill the atmosphere and it's going to descend down and grow gardens
 I will proclaim the name of Yahweh will praise the greatness of our Elohim he is The Rock
 New Image okay Rakim is for sure he is the rock yeah I'd like to make a theme video on this Monday its equivalent to the mountain who did the same thing but he has the mountain or you talk about this when we did our metaphor video and how to read Series yeah we talked about the land being a fortress and a rock and a safe space against the chaotic Waters so he is a rock his works are tamim their perfect is the NIV translation but they are complete is no crap
 they're mixed with it they're right all of his ways are just he's a faithful God he doesn't do wrong upright and just is he
 in contrast they are corrupt and not his children to their shame they are a warped and crooked generation
 these are the children of like Abraham this real you always called these people my first born son when you redeem them out of Egypt but they are who this is interesting that word corrupt it's the same word as the generation of the flood Genesis 6 and then this word to their shame and if you translate this to their shame but it's the word moon it's the word for the opposite of tamim or hold a complete number this is language of sacrificial animals to the animal needs to be Tom Meme and it can have no room that is blemish okay like a spot or a piece of like for the missing hair or before I got on so Israel's being depicted here as like a blemished sacrificial animal
 they are a warped and crooked generation
 is this the way you repay Yaweh who foolish unwise people isn't he your father your creator who made you and formed you to people who have received the wisdom and teaching of Yahweh who were formed by Yahweh is the language of the Eden story but yet who end up in bracing Folly said yeah is that him and Eve language hear the foolish language Yahweh the Creator formed someone gives them instructions they are the children of Yahweh but they become foolish unwise this is the language of Adam and Eve and what does what do you mean then that they are not his children
 yeah what is the point yeah yeah it's a little seed to sprout the Palm who are the children of my it's clear that you have a whole nation now and among the many people who are not loyal to Yahweh at all so who really are the children of God who are they
 cuz a whole bunch of them are foolish than wise and kind of so some at least some are not his children really interesting
 remember the days of old consider the generations long past we quoted this line in our video on eternal life
 this is the world the word old here days of old is the word for age and Hebrew remember the days of the age which sometimes gets translated eternity it's not quite what it means are the days of the age means all the generations from Abraham up to this point
 we asked your father he'll tell you ask your elders they'll explain to you when the most high gave switch to the ESV now for a reason stuff talked about
 when the most high gave the nation's their inheritance when he divided up humanity is the table of nations in Genesis reflecting back on the scattering of Babylon and the
 division of the sons of Noah into the patient's yeah 70 70 Nation
 when he's fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the ESV has the sons of el sons of God now his feet turn to the NIV it says he set up the boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of
 Israel Israel
 oh that's interesting here's what's fascinating here this is a genuine manuscript different versions of Deuteronomy there are Hebrew versions of Deuteronomy found among the Dead Sea Scrolls
 the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible in What's called the Septuagint right here they have the phrase the sons of God referring to Spiritual Beings like of Genesis 6 the host of heaven and there are medieval Hebrew manuscripts called masoretic text that read what the NIV goes with those manuscripts thing sons of Israel and it's the difference between and Hebrew the phrase been a witch is Sons of about Nal Nal which is what the Dead Sea Scrolls have in the Septuagint points two and then medieval Hebrew manuscripts to say been a l the plus or minus of three Hebrew letters in different manuscripts
 the artist fascinating Rabbit Hole Spiritual Beings and their dominion over people in version where it says he divided up the day the Nations and inheritance is divided up Humanity according to the number of the sons of el what that reflects is somebody who is reading Genesis 1 through 11 according to its symmetrical design would never come up with that interpretation of Genesis 1 to 11 unless you were reading it meditation literature symmetrical saw it in the design of Genesis 1 through 11 the snake in the garden which is just to pick it up as a snake but then you start to think that a rebel Sheriff then you get the deception and the act of the sons of Elohim
 Genesis Rex the three Mega rebellions in Genesis 1 through 11 the Folly of foolish rebellion of Adam and Eve at the instigation of the snake and because of the snakes Council the woman sees that the food is good takes it eats it
 Genesis 6 the sons of Elohim see women Daughters of Adam and that they are good and they take them for themselves so those two are joined as the hyperlink together through the identical vocabulary
 but then what you also have is the building of the city of Babylon as the other main Rebellion narrative on the other side of the flood and what this interpretation in Deuteronomy 32 represents is reading all of those three narratives as if they are next to each other and each one illumines the other one because the sons of Elohim and what they do with women is connected to the birth of violent were giants in the land who are called to give over him and lo and behold isn't interesting that the Builder of Babylon in Genesis 10 is the guy name Nimrod name is we will repel and he's identified as a gyro ring with one of the giveaway in one of these vile Warrior Gods so all of these snake the rebels sons of Elohim the Giants the rebel kings in the Builders of Babylon are all joined together
 do hyperlinks in symmetrical design in Genesis 1 through 11 and here in Deuteronomy 32 verse 8
 the division of the nation's when God scatter Babylon resulting in the scattering in the division of the Nations that we see reflected in Genesis chapter 10 the table of 17 Nations which is the number for like a complete number of the correct yeah 70 Nations that's connected here connected to some how got handing the nation's over to the sons of Elohim and their Rebellion this referenced in Genesis chapter 6
 does that make sense you yeah so what's fascinating is that the medieval Hebrew manuscripts connect the division of the Nations into 70
 according to the number of the sons of Israel and in Geneseo does that mean well do you remember how many descendants went down with Jacob to Egypt at the end of the Genesis G 77 t a next button important symmetrical Link at the beginning of Genesis in the end of Genesis that now we have seventy Nations living under the powers of the Rival Sons of Elohim Exile outside of Eden and in order to restore blessing to all of them he creates this family remember him that at the end of Genesis is also going into Exile out of the promised land as a group of 70 and those two images of the seventy nations in the 70 Israelites
 exiled from the promised land are set in relationship to do that in Genesis so actually both these manuscript differences are linking into design patterns in Genesis that are actually the hair so scholarly consensus is that the reading sons of Elohim is the most original and that the interpretation of the sons of Israel is a sign of scribal discomfort
 with the idea that work under the idea that God would hand over the nation's to the 70 sons of Elohim that may be right I have a few reservations about that it could also be that both manuscripts are realizing two different ways to interpret the significance of the palm and the well this is what another words what Moses is reflecting on here is about Israel being selected out from among the Nations I'm sorry I didn't read the last line which is the winning point so Moses asked the generations of old about the time when y'all way gave the nation's their inheritance according to the sons of Elohim number of Sons of Adam verse 9 because you always portion is his people
 Jacob is his inheritance so yeah we gave the nation's their plans inheritance
 and you would think they would say and so y'all way gives Israel their inheritance but it flips it and what it says is yahweh's inheritance or two special people so this is the way of talking about Israel being selected out of the nation's God called Abraham a reflection on there's all these peoples all these nations and they worship all these out and and y'all were handed them over and how did you come about well we have a story where everyone was of one mind and one way of talking and they built this Tower to send up into the heavens and God destroyed that project well he's got a project and
 then you've got the nation's and this is saying
 in the subtext of that is that God then gave everyone a portion of land out there and God mind and some way Elohim or leg over there I think a later expression of this idea will be in the Apostle Paul we'll talk about he's out there spreading the good news about Jesus is Lord to all of the different nations and he talks about the nation's the Gentiles
 living under the rule of the principalities and Powers language are the rebel sons of God but Jesus is Lord to confess Jesus as Yahweh is to come out from under the rebel sons of gods Sway and to give our allegiance to Yahweh the Creator that's the idea of work here
 anybody's interested the significance of this idea for understanding the overall biblical story was first really emphasized made clear to me by Hebrew Bible scholar Michael Heiser who has a podcast called The Naked Bible podcast and we'd interviewed him on that part podcast before but he really does a great job and number of his books and podcast of exploring why these two verses here Deuteronomy 32 8 and 9 or like pivotal
 how you think about much of the overall biblical story pivotal because it's saying it's always nation's worst because all these Gods but Yahweh came and said I had this nation has people making divination and I'm going to be their God these verses bring together in a short statement in a set of ideas that are right there through Genesis 2:1 through 11 about the triple cycle of rebellion bleeding from the garden to the Rebel Son tell him to Babylon and out of all of that you always selected one family but that's 11 complex chapters where is here it's just a few verses those ideas are condensed into one spot and you wanted to draw my attention to the switch and language we're so and I don't think it landed for me but so all the nations they've got their boundaries and
 their inheritance all the nations their inheritance is what their place to be left where they live and instead of them having a nanny also they have a plot of land yeah it looks it you would imagine it being and their inheritance is the promised land promised that it says for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob being his people a way to describe people yes is his allotted inheritance yes the whole nation can be referred to by the name of their ancestor Jacob Jacob or Abraham or Isaac Jacob diverticular because he becomes the man named Israel is named Israel and then becomes the father of twelve tribes does yoway get an inheritance that's a silly kind of
 right here everything yeah it is but it's a way of highlighting the special nature of his relationship with his chosen people like they are his special inheritance set apart for him to enjoy all of this is a set-up member Moses said hey I'm going to teach you cuz I know what you're going to do your a corrupt generation but y'all way he's just as good and right and everything you does throughout history baseball and right and just example one when he scattered all the nations and handed them over to the rebels sons of Elohim he chose you
 here's another thing y'all waiting continues the story yeah we did that is right and just
 in a desert land he found him
 he peeing your way and found him being his brother Jacob so he found Israel in the wilderness in a Barren and Howling waste that word barren waste is the word tofa from tohu bohu in Genesis one very empty and the tofu ya and waist is what awaits us the word yellow it's referring to the whistling wind and like that's howling howling Wasteland so it's one word is howling waste the howling waste and the word barren is come to the Wilderness so in the wilderness you always found his people in the wilderness
 Yahweh shielded and cared for him he guarded him like that apple of his eye who this drat this is the interpretation of the the phrase apple of his eye what it is and Hebrew it's that you show naino Ki Shan has the word tiny human little human vision is Sean it's referring to this man if I get close enough to you and I look into your eyes I see myself in your people oh my goodness and that's the little man he guarded him like the little man of his eye and what it says in Hebrew not a beautiful figure out a connected to my face shining upon you yeah oh yeah sure my face is so close to you I can see I get why they translated the apple of his eye cuz I don't get it I don't even know what that means actually
 I think I do either but the little man of the eye and that cool it is cool it would actually read a little weirder but then I will let you yeah yeah this is cool so we're describing you always finding Israel in the middle of a chaotic nothingness and we've used one of the words from the pre-creation state in Genesis one of the uninhabited land for must land
 next so he found him then he shielded him guarded him like a little man of his I like an eagle stirring up its nest hovering over its young
 and that word however is exactly the word describing the spirit of God hovering over the waters in Genesis 1 verse 2 back on all this imagery from the very beginning of the tour of the basic Point yep so alone let him and no foreign God was with him so we're reflecting on the Wilderness Journey stories that when Israel was going through the dark chaotic Wasteland that is the non creation via anti creation there was Yahweh hovering over them like a spirit did it over the waters and giving the Manna giving them light giving them water
 and no other God delivered them the whole logic of the argument is going to be listening from the beginning of History I selected you out for him and then hung the nation's your mind I have protected you sue the Wilderness you would be dead if it weren't for Yahweh
 and the store is going to go on y'all way made his real ride on the heights of the van he fed him with fruit from the fields he nourished him with honey from The Rock when was that what's the Poetry of Savannah water is honey here at Water becomes honey with oil from the flinty krag with Kurds and milk from heard and flocks fatten lambs and goats Choice Rams aboshan finest kernels of wheat you drink the foaming blood of the grape and you were basically having a royal Feast out there in the wilderness 120 current foaming blood of the grape you know like so there's life is in the blood there's this like since after wine yeah it's good stuff
 so yeah you get the idea here like you got a royal feast in the wilderness yeah yeah it's imported goods to yeah. I keep saying Psalm 23 of the psalm 23 Echoes this Motif if you prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies the enemies are like the dark chaos desert water out there that Yahweh makes a little Eden feast in the middle of the chaos so what was Israel's response to this verse 15 yes you're ruining grew fat and kicked is a word it's a nickname for Israel and it's ironic it sarcastic or come it's from the word you sure which means the upright one
 so it's a nickname for Israel the upright one okay but it's introducing a poem about Israel not being upright but you always the one who's up right but interesting Lee I just remember this is the name for Israel used only here in Deuteronomy and in the book of Isaiah who's going to pick this up and so the upright one who really is Yahweh but is a nickname for Israel yes you're ruining grew fat and kicked filled with food they became heavy and sleep and they abandoned the gods made them they rejected the rock their deliver
 they made him jealous with foreign Gods angering him detestable Idols of the poems going to go on to say well if they rejected Yahweh then there's 19 you always saw this so you rejected them he was angry with his sons and daughters and said I will hide my face for them and see what their end she'll become they are a perverse generation children who are unfaithful
so what goes on this to say you going to work through the things that God is going to let happen to them because of their unfaithfulness so and was going to read some of these asking the question what things does Yahweh let happen and what things does he always directly caused to happen to pay attention to that or 23 I will keep calamities on them
 I will spend my arrows against them
 arrows are often an image for sickness and illness
 I will send wasting famine among them consuming pestilence deadly plague I will send against them teeth of wild animals the Venom of vipers gliding in the dust
 the clear like Divine initiative here so I will I will I will but we're describing here is like a food shortage
 or enemies attacking enemies attacking or snakes and animals animals yeah snakes so we go on to say they're going to be conquered people will die in War I will scatter them that's what you always did The Babylon the same idea I will scatter them
 there's 28 they are a nation without since there's no discernment in them only they were wise and would understand the word there for the cinnamon bun are bean so if only Israel could understand the patterns of the history they could see that when they abandoned me terrible things happen and when they turn to me there's life and there's goodness If Only They would just clue in
 but verse 32 their Vine my people's buying comes from the vine of Sodom
 from the fields of Gamora their grapes are filled with poison their clusters with bitterness their wine is the Venom of serpents the deadly poison of cobras mixing out of so many metaphors here plants like a Vine but they're growing up in Sodom and Gomorrah not eating
 and how do you know their true nature well when I drink the wine it's like drinking serpent Venom my people are snakes and yep so there's 35 it is mine to avenge I will repay Park what's that line Romans in due time their foot will slip the day of disaster is near Doom Russia's upon them 36 but Yahweh will vindicate his people
 and He will relent this is the word when Moses interceded for Israel when they made the golden calf and he said wait remember your promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and now it was like oh yeah that's right so he relents Yahweh will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servant
 it seems like a turn where he's like you're not my children hear you guys are dumb and you're going to get what happened and then this is a big turn-off certain you will vindicate his people and relent concerning his servant so who's that remember all the way back up you ask that question of like who are his children if the people the children of Israel who in God's their father in their creator if they are not his children because they have forsaken them. Who are these people and servants they always going to relent and wife indicate he's going to vindicate and relent his servants in his people when he sees that their strength is all gone
 when there's no one remaining slave or free it looks like there's no Remnant everything is wiped out and gone but there will be these people called the servants
 whom Yahweh will relent vindicate we go down for 39 look-see is the always speaking I myself I am the one there's no Elohim besides me the history of Israel I'm the only other him truly governing your history I bring death and I bring life
 I wound and I heal no one can deliver out of my hand
 this is the view that is real whole history
 from this moment upon into later in the Hebrew Bible the disasters are Yahweh and the Eden blessing in life is Yahweh
 I lift my hand to the skies and swear this is Yahweh depicted this like swearing on oath
 as surely as I live forever when I sharpen my sword my hand will grasp it and judgment I will take Vengeance on my enemies and repay those who hate me about to get intense I'll make my arrows drunk with blood my sword will eat flesh the blood of the slain in the captives even the heads of the n a l I was ready for this to start getting like like it was starting to turn towards I got this Remnant but rejoice
 all you nations with his people
 or he will avenge the blood of his servants
 he will take Vengeance on his enemies but he will provide atonement for his land
 and if people
 okay so it started to turn so their Doom is coming they're going down the road of self-destruction and you always knocking stop it fact like Pharaoh's heart heart he's going to enforce it
 and then all the sudden we heard that there's this group of his people and his servants they always going to relent and vindicate them and they come out of nowhere because everyone is is corrupt their Vine is from Sodom right there like snakes but then all the sudden there's this thing called the servant and he always says the whole history of my Covenant Partners it's going to end and there will be a great Act of divine Justice and it's depicted in very vivid imagery of vodka a warrior out on the battlefield as it makes my stomach turn to really imagine it specifically talking about is real well what's interesting is that the poem go up to I myself from here there's no other job says me I could definitely bring life I wounded and I heal no one can deliver Yahweh makes enough I'm going to sharpen my sword and take Vengeance on my enemies
 who are the enemies and who are his people cuz he would sit so far your setup to think okay his people are Israel there's a little man of his eye and then we have to go out the rest of it is the bad guys out there but he says early in the poem Israel no longer has children yeah right we're least they don't act like it my senseless people he says you are not my children those are not his chipped out my children this poem is showing an awareness that Paul will articulate later than the letter to the Romans that not all Israel is this even within the Covenant people of God there are those who are loyal to Yahweh and those who are disloyal to our way and in this poem is a dichotomy is not Israel versus the nation this is Israel versus Israel this is those loyal within Israel
 the servants the Servants of Yahweh and this is the seedbed write this poem is the seedbed out of which this is a major theme in the book of Isaiah that and Isaiah is a day almost all everybody else is going after the other gods but Isaiah and his little prophetic Clan he calls the disciples become this Remnant that is purged Burns through the fire as soon as Raton for an odd that purging comes a Remnant it will survive through the days of disaster to suffer for the sins of you always faceless couple of people
 to create a Remnant called the servants by the end of the book of Isaiah and that those ideas are developed in Isaiah but they're not new they're right here in this pond
 Moses is saying that the majority of Israel is going to behave as though they are not his people but there is a group called my people
 and so now it's within Israel there are my servants and my enemies and I can't remember it now if it was in this conversation the last one but we talked about the scattering of Israel if they're going to be dispersed that's right and that this version is here frame doesn't act culminating active judgment just like it wasn't even just like it was was Babylon but there will be those in this version who my servants will be in circles and they're just called my servants in my people and then so you're given to images Yahweh is going to vindicate his people and relent concerning his servants but for my enemies I'm going to bring the enforcement of its all these images of death destruction chaos
 and Yahweh as the bringer of justice is depicted as a warrior on the battlefield overcoming his enemies and specifically smashing their heads make the member David my people who are not loyal and become like snakes Moses says and so if you set yourself against Yahweh enjoying the snake you will find your head crushed along with the snake but Rejoice O nations with his people the last line of the poem he will avenge the blood of his servants
 and he will bring Vengeance on his enemies
 and in so doing will make atonement for his land and his people
 so there's coming this future division within Israel excuse me there is this division in Moses day and it's going to keep playing out where it will be a Remnant called my servants my people and the nation should Rejoice that that group exists see that verse 43 hey Nations Rejoice with his people if people being the service is he will avenge this it was the blood of the servants to remember in Genesis 3 15 What God Says is to the snake there will be hostility between you and the woman between your seed and her seed and then the Cain and Abel story showed us
 what it means to become snake seed it means to follow the law by embrace the LIE of the send snake and murder your brother and so there will be those who join the snake and opposed the purposes of God and here it's recognizing that that will result in the death of God's servants the blood of his servants table the blood of Abel yes yes and as identifying himself with a persecuted religious minority throughout the whole of Israel's history those are out you always actual people and the majority of Israel associated with the Kings and Their Kingdoms and their Wars in reality where the faceless ones
 and Yahweh will bring Justice on those who deserve it but for his Remnant people they are a source of joy for the Nations and they're connected with atonement that will happen for the people in the land this so the book about the whole book of Isaiah is about this right here
sub this poem is laying out the program that you're about to go read in Joshua Judges Samuel King in the former prophets and then the prosthetic Reflections on that story that happened on Isaiah Jeremiah he killed and the 12 Prophets
 and at this point I'm right here like every book of the prophets eludes back to and builds on and develops vocabulary it's kind of like my friend Andy Peter calls this this becomes like the archetypal profit here and every Prophet it becomes like a mini Moses could see all the way down the line to the end of Israel's idolatry leading to death but that somehow out of that death y'all way it will bring atonement and life that will bring joy to the nation's
 and it's remarkable near the end of the Torah and all the sudden you're looking down the rest of the Hebrew Bible and you feel like you're looking towards the New Testament the blood of you always serve it kind of in a way wraps up the whole Hebrew Bible but still then leaving a ton of questions and ideas to be developed developed and the rest but it does feel like there's the seedbed of all the things that the whole Hebrew Bible will be a conflict between within God's uncovering of people will be a conflict between the servants
 who are persecuted and being killed by those who are from Jacob but not my people and then somehow Yahweh will vindicate his servants though in a way that provides atonement for his land and his people and that last line what is it that referring to what is his land and people I think remember all the conversations about the Tabernacle Israel sinned and faithlessness both is Strange's people from Yahweh but it also vandalizes
 the Sacred Space remember I found the day of atonement what's happening is the purification of the heart of the Sacred Space
 with the blood of a righteous blameless representative on behalf of the people which is the life the life of a blameless one is surrendered to Yahweh and then taken into the holy of holies to appeal to God to forgive and you always will accept that so what we're saying is the faithfulness of this faithful group who gets their lives even unto death called the servants. Where'd you get that Yahweh will avenge the blood of his servant there going to be Servants of Yahweh that are going to suffer and suffer and die
 and Yahweh will bring Justice on those who perpetrated this but and I said I'm looking at the paper what I'm doing is looking at Deuteronomy 32 verse 43 and I'm doing a literary analysis on the poetic design of it and the blood of the servants sits in a parallel relationship to
 Jolly providing atonement for his land to this makes sense because it's the blood of the animal that's right which then is the life force and that at owns yet in the temple virtual that's right and so and we talked about that and legs the suffering servant poem and Isaiah 53 and then the way those ideas are developed in the rest of the Isaiah scroll our meditation meditation on this line right here LOL yeah and both Isaiah and this line right here are meditating on Genesis 3 15
 about the seed of the woman who will be both struck by right to snake and you know just crossed the snake at the same time in the land and the people here it's specifically I'm wondering is this getting better now this point is making atonement for the land all the land and all the people yeah or is this very specifically about the promised land and his servants are leaving town for yeah sure well I think it's ambiguous probably on purpose but we are at the conclusion of the Torah and Israel being given a specific land
 is the way that you always going to spread that you can blessing out to all of the land which was the whole point of the first Eden which is the Yahweh of points caretakers so that life could spread out all the land so we're still focused in on that Covenant family of Abraham but it while we are told what you always does for them and bringing both judgment on evil but vindicating his servants in their blood providing atonement is a source of joy for the nation's 443 begins with a nation's this thing is going to go down and you rejoice and it will mean salvation for the cosmos launches forward but also links back to the first statement of this mysterious promise the snake Crusher who is struck by the snake while striking it
 and in a way when we come back out of this the death of Moses who is so chapter 34
 Deuteronomy we got to read the last least protect real quick on the last chapter so in Deuteronomy chapter 34 Moses is the first person in the Hebrew Bible called my servant servant of Yahweh and he dies outside the land and remember most of the scroll of numbers was about his brother and sister betraying him like resisting him oh yeah and then all of basically Moses becomes like the first persecuted serving of Yahweh and he's the one you always appointed to save them but yeah he's the one that they're constantly resisting and so his death outside the land kind of makes him the first archetype servant of Yahweh
 who dies who liked Israel exists because of his righteous intercession on Mount Sinai and yet he dies outside the land and the Moses becomes the first
 kind of person who lays down this pattern of the suffering servant
 so let's chill we read the last paragraph is the Deuteronomy thirty-four first five so Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in Moab just as you always said
 and he buried him in Moab we talked about this before in the valley opposite Bape Pilar but you know what even to this day nobody knows where his grave is exactly this to cool little things are very than I think I know why you laughed but I want to hear why nickered when we when I first read this is he buried him who buried to me we know that Moses was buried you have a who's the other he yeah well the Moses died just as Yahweh said and he buried him in Moab and some unknown secret grave and then that's Jeff like we're so far down the line in Israel's history that no one even knows where the grave is it anymore so we're not this isn't like Moses died yesterday
 120 years old when he died his eyes were not weak nor his strength gun that Israelites grieve for Moses in the plains of Moab for 30 days until the time and weeping and mourning was over now Joshua son of nun was filled up with the spirit of wisdom
 Moses had laid his hands on him Israel listen to him and did what y'all would commit to Moses
 you know since the first time since then since those days long ago no Prophet has ever Arisen in Israel like Moses
 somebody who meow a new face to face
 somebody who did all the signs and wonders when Lord sent him to Egypt you know what he did the Pharaoh and his officials and all that no one has ever shown the mighty power or perform the awesome Deeds that Moses did in all of the eyes of his real medicine the last paragraph for the one like Moses yeah it is the power he was a source he was an image of yahweh's power to create Andy create nuts with the ten plagues were all about it called a prophet somebody who represents the words of Yahweh
 but this is also the conclusion of the paragraph of Moses dying so I suffering Prophet who was a source of y'all with power and word among the people and who died for the sins of the people we just we need another one of those and it has not happened this day was so long ago that nobody even knows where he's buried anymore we have been waiting we're just waiting
 the very forward pointing hope that the tour concludes with and you set up to think well maybe Joshua is filled with the spirit of with them and Joshua is this great new yeah the Next Generation the new leader know that the spirit but then it ends with like but you know what there's no one like Moses so your time together all these ideas which is when we've been on this journey with Moses and he's been the intercessor he's been the right hand of God he sees God face to face Well yeah if you've got the pack well that's but he sees more directly the present to be always in any other person the other person he shines with God's glory he goes into the tents he receives the law like he intercedes for Israel so that they receive Mercy instead of justice and so it's the image of a human
 you can act on behalf of all of the rest of us humans who aren't able to be in God's presence and to be that connected with God we also see that Moses wasn't perfect yeah that's right cuz he also he died for his own sins as well as the sins of his people but man he was the closest thing yeah that we've had two to Redeemer I thought you were someone who can crush the snake and mediator between God and humanity and he commission's Joshua Joshua's filled with Spirit but fast for Joshua and then all the leaders after that there's no one that you can comes back to what we had in Moses and we are connecting that too is we just read this poem about that looking far into the future of Israel that
 there is going to be these servants Moses the servant of you always going to be continue his legacy will be carried on through ongoing lineage of servants who will become little mini Moses's throughout the devil story and then there was that wild reflection at the end of that poem where their blood is events for and then God makes atonement for the land and for the people and so you kind of start to anticipate like okay you can take that to the prophetic hope of the snake Crusher and you think is going to be someone who is going to be powerful enough to take on evil it's going to damage them
 but in their suffering and in their death is going to be a Reconciliation and we're far out in the future and the vantage point of the voice speaking to us in Deuteronomy thirty-four is somebody way down the line just like we're still waiting new but if we just stick in the narrative let us pay attention to the person who picks up the mantle next year is a guy named Joshua God says which the way you spell his name in Greek is Jesus Jesus filled with the spirit to carry on the legacy of Moses to bring the people into the land and taking them through the Jordan River it was no accident that all of the gospels in the New Testament
 focus in on the moment when Jesus goes through the waters of the Jordan and is endowed by the spirit to become the new servant who will go through the Wilderness and stuff are on behalf of Israel's faithlessness and come out successful to announce the kingdom of God and his death that's the righteous servant provides atonement for the land and the people so the gospel narratives are all keyed in to what we've been pointing out here at the end of the Torah it's really remarkable
 so there was man we did it we didn't do it quickly but we didn't but you know I guess hurry is not a virtue when you're meditating on the Torah lower we could have I know that was a full year of going to the Torah we're going to do a question response and I will be reflect on all of that but here we are we've finished the last movement of Deuteronomy last role of Tora thank you Tim John thank you thank you
