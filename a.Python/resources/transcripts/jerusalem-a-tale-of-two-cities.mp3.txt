in the story of the Bible Jerusalem is introduced as the city of God city of justice and peace a city that can unite Heaven and Earth and this is especially true under the reign of King David who found the city of Jerusalem yet even the city of Jerusalem is corrupted by human Folly and violent so much so that the prophet says see how the faithful city has become a prostitute you were like silver you were like Choice wine you were like a faithful partner but now I feel like a prostitute your rulers are Rebels your partners are thieves they love bribery nobody defends the cause of the orphan in the Widow's case it doesn't even make it into court these days for Isaiah one of the key indicators that Jerusalem was rotting from within with how it treated the poor and the marginalized in the laws of the Torah how people who are the most economically vulnerable in the sea
 we're in their society women immigrants orphans are the most vulnerable in that social set up these types of people are treated is the barometer of how faithful Israel is being to the Covenant or not and so for the profits they bring up these people as the signs of the times for Isaiah Israel was meant to be a picture of the Heavenly Cosmic city of God but instead it has become like a Babylon like Nineveh Sodom and Gomorrah and so Yahweh is going to enact judgments on his Covenant Partners who have now become enemies because of their oppression of others the fiery tests coming for Jerusalem but the purpose of the fire is to destroy what is impy so that what God has called it to be will be brought out of the Flames to become the faithful city of righteousness and justice
 today to Mackey and I talked about the city of God in the scroll of Isaiah I'm just calling and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey Tim hey John hello hello here we are we are here talking about the Bible as we do that's kind of the thing we've been doing it for about three hundred plus episodes and will continue on in this theme of the city in the Bible and we are in the profits and we're going to be in the scroll of Isaiah and we're going to look at ideas around cities does it mean to be a people that live in cities what is a good City what are the bad City we are going to look at the elevated poetry of Israelite prophet Isaiah and hang out now that's cruel and specifically The Tale of Two Cities that is told throughout poetry of Isaiah the major Motif the two cities being
 this Cosmic sometimes Earth late sometimes Heavenly Jerusalem will talk about that that's one of the city's one of the cities and the other city is given a variety of title the Fortified City the exalted city the city of Bloodshed or sometimes just Babble on the ideal setup for God and humans as his partners and representatives place we're having dinner at the one in the beginning is that of a lush Garden on high mountain the Eden Paradise when the humans are deceived and then exiled from that in the Next Generation which replays and intensifies the Folly of their parents one of those son murders his brother and then flees and build his own City and so the city originates in the story The Bible as a result of violence in this for self
 section V of the city walls founded by a murderer intended for self-protection for the reason of somebody might find me and kill me and so as we've been tracing it God wanted to protect that murderer but not aligned with the sign on described have to let the hyperlink simulator stories teach you what the sign would have been to that one day we did it
 we didn't the City of Refuge City Line Is God saying I'm going to build you a City of Refuge in the numbers scroll and is right go into the land and numbers late 30s always forget if it's 34 x 34 35 there's a whole bunch of cities set apart for anyone who accidentally or purposely murders someone if they can flee to the city so that whoever finds them can't kill them with all the language of the Cain and Abel story describing the city's to prevent the spilling of blood in the land so that's the later story building back on now could be
 I said this is important because God now provide cities as a place of Refuge to prevent the spilling of blood and its crate of inversion because cane city was because he spilled blood and force his own self protection instead of trusting the sign that God would give him so what was the sign what we know is later in the biblical story what God provides for murder those Israelites is a City of Refuge and if I remember correctly that the word play here because sign is kind of similar to the word City yeah there was a network of wordplay is there in the Eden story that compared that actually contrasted between the thing that God provides for the human the need Kaiser Kaiser which is a delivering help or delivering rescue and then what kayn builds for himself is that year which is the city through those look very similar
 yeah that's right there in the word out sign would split God wants to give the cane is a word play of another related word or which is skinned and we talked about that a long time ago so back in episode whatever two or three or four so the story is that City's originated from the human mind as a form of self-protection as result of murder and so we've been tracking with how that portrait of the city just gets Escalade an escalated in the story The Babylon and Assyria and Sodom and Gomorrah Samaria and so on but then you also have the first positive City in the story is when Joseph is elevated to be the wise cool ruler of Egypt he turns the store cities of Egypt into a blessing for the Nations in time of famine
 and so cities can be a source of life where they can be a source of death they can breed the preservation food for the preservation of life or they can breed violence you know for the taking and so cities become like extended humans most like human bodies with many partition of us yeah but the scaled up yeah I was thinking about we create cities to live with in or around us but then they kind of in a way begin to leverage us and become an extension of a yeah but we both make them humans make them while the cities are also making the humans what they are forming them in the cities and there's two ways to make that we use this phrase that the city is your mother yes that's right so could be a protective Life Giving Place Building off of the comparison between he's and what God providing
 Eve for the lone human and then God providing the city of the city and this guy could also become a Monster yeah That's Right mother or Monster so it's a tale two cities yeah so when we get to the Isaiah scroll which is the first scroll in the latter prophets so he revived it was three big parts for a prophet's writings the middle part prophets has two sections the former prophets which continue the story from the Torah of Israel going in the promised land blowing it big-time building lots of cities that are become terrible a den of vipers and violence and then they get conquered by that one and go into Exile then you get ladder prophets Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and the 12 prophets for Scrolls
 and these are mostly political there's a lot of narrative and they assume that the reader is fully tracked with all the design patterns and I for length of the Torah that's why they're so hard to read that is why they're so hard to read they just assumed so much of the reader here and what we'll see is that all of the negative cities get Guam together into one Mega Monster often called Babylon even though that was one of the city's multi-headed monster the positive cities throughout the story there haven't been that many there were the cities of Egypt in Joseph's day but then those cities became a source of death for The only positive City
 that's really a bright stars Jerusalem but even if it gets corrupted by the later Kings from the line of David but it's always viewed as a tragedy of like what could have been on the been in so Jerusalem becomes the image of the good city and we talked through the stories of even the founding of Jerusalem that's right it is not a story celebrating founding of the city of God and some like idealistic way it's not great propaganda yeah for through slum is the capital city of God embedded with all of these concerns and problems the story commemorating Jerusalem becoming the sacred capital of the tribes of Israel is told by comparing it to the failure of Adam and Eve in the garden
 if there is any City in the Bible that can represent what can be good of a city how can a city be our mother how can a city be a city of God by the Jerusalem isms closest comes closer to ya maybe I kind of think back to our years of thinking about the seam of the image of God yeah and just like Moses came closest came the closest so that on and to the rest of the Bible even in the New Testament where Moses is still a glowing example of faithfulness towards God Jesus is compared to similarly Jerusalem is kind of like the closest that you get yeah cuz Moses his origin story has a lot of details that you know him to be a pretty effing flag I can't secure and then he ends yeah in a way that shows that he's flawed but he is the human who can Ascend the mountain hang out with God get the Covenant and see the head of my temple.
 if it's a Jerusalem is founded as a city that like the Tabernacle of Moses oversaw is like an Earthly image of the Heavenly City and the Heavenly Temple all of this is why the prophet Isaiah is so bent out of shape out of shape about what he sees going on in Jerusalem and him there so nothing for it even explain himself kind of opening of their this call and let's see what happens with The Tale of Two Cities
 Isaiah chapter 1 verse 1 the vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem to Judah being the region but big tribal territory in Jerusalem is in that kind of north eastern part of the territory of Judah so the vision concerning Judah in Jerusalem that Isaiah is Yahoo yes Yahoo you shall sign of almost saw during The Rains of and then you get for Kings from the line of David who's Isaiah Johnson he has a zakiya yotam occurs in his Kia Kings of Judah hyperlink to the Kings scroll how far down are we from David's time we're like 150 years yeah. David and is the
 northern kingdom get branched off the kingdom is split and that bothers Isaiah he knows that they're supposed to be unified the hostility between the North and the South is over a century and a half will now immediately after David this is a vision concerning what we would call the southern Kingdom of Judah Judah in the capital of the Kings the Isaiah song with you haven't listened hours for Yahweh has spoken and what do they speak I have raised children and brought them up but they have rebelled against me and he's referring to so here it's Yahweh is like a parent here and the children are in their failure to be faithful to Yahweh is the Rebellion Covenant is
 like a rebellious teenage can I get out of lesson kid I just listen to punk rock is able to recognize its owner and a donkey can recognize the feeding trough of its master
 but Israel yeah they don't they don't recognize and my people yeah they don't they don't know dumber than an ox dies or an ass in class of King James literally an ass and not only other rebellious children but even animals know the one who provides for them and cares for them and like know how the relationship works but Israel has fundamentally misunderstood who it is to call them into existence
 so I'm just sending this to the general contact of Isaiah's message as a hole so he's he's pronouncing doom and destruction that will come in the form of Yahweh handing Israel north and south over to their enemies named Leah Syria and then that one and I have been talking at the door and is sending emissaries saying you better. Took out the northern kingdom first that has not happened yet but it's so you know. That's right yeah that's right with our of their city is the capital city of Nineveh absolutely are kind of like the icons of these two empires and that you Enter the Dragon yeah that threatened and took out the cities of Israel
 I could understand hear the word of the Lord you rulers of Sodom hear the Torah of our God you people of Gomorrah why were we bringing Sodom in today are they still around this time I got to think I went out they got close to a thousand years ago or a thousand years ago so it's comparison he's comparing comparing his real daughters of Jerusalem I see two in the moral social conditions of Jerusalem to Sodom and Gomorrah that's one of the infamous cities Bible and he's drawing the comparison hear current Earthly Jerusalem right
 see how the faithful city has become a prostitute so he sees the Jerusalem has some Facebook Origins he calls it the city of face
 CyberLink dating faithfulness and trust is a keyword in the David story specifically about when David sounds Jerusalem as the capital city of the place where the Tabernacle is and God says to David if you continue to trust me I will give you a trustworthy or a faceful monarchy and descendants and I'll make the city a place where is real can be safe so that it's recalling the days of David but the faithful City so notice however depicting the city as a woman oh like a faithful wife wife love as faithful to the Covenant has become a prostitute so here we are in the imagery of idolatry Israel giving their allegiance to other gods as adultery what's interesting is usually when I think of this metaphor of a faithful wife or a wife that prostitute yourself
 I think of not the city but the people in the city is there a real blending here I mean like the city and what we represent and the people in the city and that's good like we said like the city becomes an extension of us are exoskeleton it's like you can't completely teaser part it's a part for whole or hole for parts but this theme is us trying to say what does it mean to build a city and what our city is Nostalgia Critic City and all the stuff but you can't talk about a City without talking about people away that you can't talk about like a turtle shell with the city is the people so yeah the people in the city are as stupid as this is as wicked as Sodom and Gomorrah and
 any calls and prostitutes he's just coming out swinging but their Origins are like Adam and Eve images of God destined for faithfulness in representation because it has become Unfaithful she was once full of Justice
 righteousness. Yep and righteousness those are two words Justice and righteousness right relationships between every member of the community righteousness actually used to camp in the middle of the city but now murderous Kane Lemak metallurgic Metallurgy yeah your silver has become dross what is dross when you heat up precious metals and they liquefy dross is a disease of the rocks and dirt and gravel in y'all got into it I saw you skim it off and I drained out your choice wine has gotten diluted with water so you were like just a really great but yeah and you pour it into the glass cleaner just pouring out of the notice that idea of the faithful City you were like silver
 we're like a faithful partner but now you like a prostitute you're like dross you're like really low quality wine your rulers are Rebels your partners are thieves the driver is the name of the day they l'bri Breeze they chase after gifts nobody defends the cause of the orphan and the Widow's case it doesn't even make it into court these days cuz she can't drive anybody if she doesn't have the means so we're at the brass tacks it's really about how are you treating each other yes that's right yet and are you doing it with well you take care of each other or are you taking advantage of each other in the laws of the Torah how people who are the most economically vulnerable in the city or in their society which was the patriarchal Federation of tribes settled in the Agriculture and so women immigrants orphans are the most vulnerable in that socialist
 it's on the laws of the Torah they're like a barometer how these types of people are treated is the barometer of how faithful Israel is being to their Covenant or not and so for the profits they bring up these people as the signs of the times so what y'all Abe says is I'm going to relieve myself of my enemies and avenge myself of my foes that is Kinda Yeah my Covenant Partners I will turn my hand away from you I'm going to purge your drops
 I'm going to remove your impurities he doesn't pick up the wine imagery again I'm going to purge I'm going to melt you down
 yeah that's what I mean and I will restore your leaders as in days of old as at the beginning
 and then you will be called the city of righteousness the faithful City so this is a Redemption story back to the faithful City but yeah me that there is going to be a purging a melting fiery ordeal a fiery test coming for Jerusalem but the purpose of the fire is to destroy what is in pure so that what God has called it to be will be brought out of the Flames to become the faithful city of righteous Justice this isn't some reform you just got the whole book all right there right there it's either going to be poems pointing out just how bad it's become it's going to be poems announcing the coming of the fire and the fire is a Syria Syria and then Babylon
 and then the fire is another city the fire is letting other terrible cities whatever belch up there boo whatever terrible stuff and they're going to come after you're bad City and then what God's going to do is bring down those that cities through the next Empire Persia which gets an out still so in the book of Isaiah and there's going to be these cycles of cyclical floods of human evil spilling over until the ultimate final cycle out of which will emerge the faithful city of righteousness and that's the story arc next part of a 27 Zion which is the name for Jerusalem will be delivered with Justice and her repentant ones with righteousness so how do I how do I know whether the fire
 will be bad news or good news for me 5-minute habitan of the city cuz there's a there's a purging Fire coming so it's going to carry away all the bad stuff but that burning is also called here in just 27 or rescue Zion will be rescued through a Justice here is the burning Injustice do you think it's bad news but then it is also delivered and it's the repentant ones that are rescued through righteousness are with righteousness that mean rescued with righteousness yeah could be referring to God's righteousness that he is doing the right thing he's doing right by his Covenant by bringing the consequences but then also fulfilling his promise to use these people to blast All Nations or it could be that the repentant ones will carry out a life of
 doing right by God and right by neighbor and that will demonstrate their repentance and all the sudden the sounds just this whole thing sounds like John the Baptist John the Baptist this right here is Generation G
 so this is the story arc so what's interesting is right now it's just one city but really that one city is now being talked about as if it's two cities is it it's the faithful City and now you've become the prostitute City you used to be the city of righteousness but now you're a city of murderers so the same city can be either the Earthly City cane or it could become the Heavenly city of righteousness and faithfulness but it's the same city the same city but then after a flood of Justice another city can emerge the same city the same person
 can be good or bad so maybe I'm not saying that enough away at each City another where's the state of any individual human and the fate of any individual city is in Destin that's what God says to can send the culture right at the door but you can rule it like you have a choice here didn't have to go this way and it doesn't have to keep going this way you can turn this why it says Ian will be delivered with Justice and her repentant ones will be delivered with righteousness so that's the fate of the city and it can go right now it's the same city facing a choice that goes into directions to able to stay that way okay so when you say that there's two cities what you're what you're saying is the one city has two choices for the one city has to Destiny's you can be
 I can be wiped out what could be repaired and the rebirthing comes as a result of the flood of justice but then gives rise to an opportunity going to be restored to a faithful City you got it
Isaiah chapter 2 here we go we're just moving through there this is what Isaiah son of our most concerning Judah in Jerusalem
 in the last days at the end of days the Fulfillment of the times the mountain of yahweh's Temple will be established as the highest of mountains so we start here with the mountain in a temple which is Jerusalem in the tree cuz it's on the tall Hill that it's Eaton imagery and it's eating and the Tramp it will be established as the highest of the mountains exalted above the hills and all the nations will River into it here which yeah it's making us think of the rivers that flowed out of the Heathen Temple Garden that went to all the nations yes I'd like the goodness of Eden was streaming out to the nation's and here now all the nations are streaming up in two peoples will come and say hey let's go up to the mountain of Yahweh to the Temple of the god of Jacob he will Tura us his version but as a verb
 he will teach us his ways so we can walk in this path than the but comes back in the Torah indeed will go out from Zion the word of y'all way from Jerusalem so the mountain is the temple is in the city and first all the nations come in but then you always instruction will go out what time is it in and out in the ministry and wins the tour goes out he will bring Justice between the Nations and settle disputes between many peoples with what result the people will Hammer their swords and turn them into Vermeer equipment equipment and Spears will get turned into pruning hooks for you know you fake trees near olive trees and harvesting and Nation won't take up sword against Nation nor will they prepare for war anymore come see YouTube Jacob
 we should walk in the light of Yahweh so there is coming a day of light and that they have light involves the exaltation of the Mountain Temple City that will both receive all the nations into it but then also you always instruction and why is commands will go out from it to bring peace and Shalom to the nation's so it's clear we're talking now about what Jerusalem could become we're at to become that faithful city of righteousness I think it's striking me right now I'll listen to the Virgin is trying to imagine myself in the setting right so you've got these pretty gnarly Assyrian Kings yeah yeah with just intense armies and their just beautiful lavish Sittin and they're out in the East Nineveh cereal later Babylon
 and they're marching around and they're just destroying your neighbors and like they're making you pay tribute and if you don't they're just laying waste to your land yeah and your cities in your cities and you think man these guys suck obviously and but I think also your thinking one day maybe we can be that great city right maybe one day we can be the ones that go out and Conquer instead will go pay him back will conquer them back because that's kind of what happened in Babylon Babylon bee they were the guys in charge of Syria now is in charge and it's going to be this Neo Babylon that's going to take back over there like and yeah it's always a kind of like who gets to be on top and be the ones what city is going to be in charge and in that contacts you've got this Prophet say
 what we're supposed to be in the faithful city of righteousness that's taking care of each other that's what we need to be doing it at we focusing on that we're not going to conquer Nations we're going to bring peace to Nation yeah sure they're all going to come here like who else was thinking that way during that time yeah that's a good question I mean this is very exhausted as hell yeah this wasn't minority view point this wasn't the like yeah yeah yeah but the profits are keeping alive this tradition that seems to have been a minority view in Israel throughout its history that they were called by the God of all Nations and all creation to become the source of the conduit
 of the Creator's blessing to all of the nation's somehow and so Isaiah is using here both language steeped in their own tradition that we find in the Hebrew Bible all this Eden Temple imagery but there's also connections here the king of Assyria built Nineveh and his Palace in Nineveh with a blushes Garden on top of the big hill yet with the rivers little like I would call those some human-made Aqueduct canals or Canal is going out from the garden into throughout the city right he had his own little man city yeah so these were cross-cultural motifs of the hive Divine mountain with a river flowing out but here the direction of the rivers inverted so what you saying is comprehensible to they're Assyrian neighbors but it's also making a more Cosmic claim for sure and also this remember this multiple contacts for the writings of the prophets there's a ride
 if we think about them in the days that they're situated in the story but then there's also many generations later the prophets who are compiling all of this earlier literature after a serious hell yeah after his wheel got to come back yeah totally deserve it after being conquered exiled and returned by Babylon well that's where we're going in the next couple things and Isaiah but right now it's a bold hope that the faithful Jerusalem city of righteousness can become a heaven on Earth source of life and peace and justice for all the name of the glory and its associated with the light of Yahweh you can walk in the light of Yahweh if you hold this promise before you that's the image are no we know that to get to this exalted State there's purging on the way here and that purging is going to take the form of Assyria coming and y'all will hand
 is people over to Syria and then it will take the form of another Empire after that that one and those are the themes discussed in Isaiah 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 and what I want to turn our attention to is like the alternate great City the enemy great City are okay which is Isaiah chapter 13
so and Isaiah chapter 13 and 14 will you get what you call the oracles against Babylon and their remarkable and they would require many podcast episodes to the to our way through I just want to survey the opening lines it begins by saying the Oracle of Babylon which Isaiah son of almost Saw & The Echoes exactly the the words of chapter 2 that's how chapter to begin except the city that he saw and chapter 2 was Jerusalem very clearly comparing the passage we just read to this one I got one now and the opening lines are on a mountain that has been swept clean go raise up a banner lift up a voice to them wave your hands so that they can enter into the gates of nobles so somebody's being told to go get up on a high mountain and
 raise up a banner the banner would signify well so this is why this would take many podcast episodes the banner was identified for you and chapter 11 okay and then chapter 11 what you're told is that the future Messianic King from the line of David will stand like a banner for all the nations and his place of rest will be divine Glory
 to get an image of Jerusalem being ruled by a king who has lifting up a banner and all the nations and the Divine Glory Cloud that arrested over the Tabernacle will somehow identified with this King resting on top of the mountain track now you're being told that that Mountaintop is going to be there with that banner and everybody you better enter the Gate of the city and get to the top of that Hill swept clean meaning this is kind of post of the day it's a new start so every single one of these lines is the words is hyperlink to the earlier parts of Isaiah the mountain that is has a signal on it everybody is coming up to it so there's a summoning to come up to the city on top of the mountain why well a floods coming yeah I have commanded
 my holy ones I have called my Warriors for my anger
 those who rejoice in my exaltation it's the sound the sound of a horde on the mountains the semblance of a great people the sound of an uproar kingdoms Nations being assembled Yahweh mustering Army is an army of War they're coming from the distant lands from the edges of the heavens Yahweh in the Implements of his anger to bring ruin on all the land whale for the day of Yahweh is near like Devastation from the almighty it comes
 so the Conquering armies are on their way there's a cosmic Army coming and the apparently you want to get up to that high hill and hang out with the king from the line of David in this city is a cosmic army or is it just an army I mean it's coming from engine Heavens meaning you must distant Place yeah you look out on the Verizon and where the sky meets the land are coming from out there from the edges of the cosmos yeah I'm just saying this is Cosmic poetry we're talking about a battle that's going to happen but we're using Cosmic language to describe it in Army on the mountains the kingdoms of roaring with all of these language of The Horde and the Uproar is language connected with the flood in the coming of a great flood and so notice how the Warriors are being described herein language was at another place if we can follow the hyperlinks describes
 have a great floods so you're saying this isn't merely a poetic way to talk about and invading Empire this is something more than a poetry to describe a great battle that is we're going to see exactly what he's talking about in a moment. So what he's going to go on to talk about is well he's going to continue the cosmic language in fact he's going to talk about how the stars and their constellations will go dark the sun itself will go dark all the land will be held accountable for its evil and you like the end of the world well for the those who participated in evolve yes I'll put an end to the arrogance of the proud
 and I'll bring low the haughtiness of the ruthless I'll make humans more scarce than gold and humankind more scarce than the gold of ofir so what is happening here or 17
 I am going to stir up the meats that the Persians against them persons
 oh gosh I totally forgot this is about Babylon yeah yeah yeah there's a great tumult final battle coming and there's only one mountain that's going to be safe cuz there's a flood happening down in the valley and what's the flood will you find out it's the Persian army from 17 on it just describes the downfall of Babylon which is the beauty of Kingdoms the glory of the Chaldeans Pride will fall to the armies of the medes and verse 19 it will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah something other reckonings another Reckoning and then it goes on to talk about how it'll never be inhabited or lived in ever again and then just itemizes all of the like the Scavenging creatures that will take up residence in the ruins of Babylon like owls and ostriches Shaggy goats live there hyenas jackals
 now after Persia came and took over though Babylon was Babylon done was there no City there anymore it is interesting the Revolt ended up being not very catastrophic in other words it was more of a political coup that ended up happening okay but that's even more interesting there was conflict but it didn't destroy the city the person's just moved in and they were in church or so and then later Persian cities became the capital but the point is the cosmic rhetoric or language used to describe this another words Cosmic poetry invests these historical events Cosmic Heavenly meaning what do you mean
 what do you mean Cosmic Heavenly meaning the downfall of Babylon to the Persians that happened in 539 BC is when the key events took place is being described as an analogy to the flood on analogy to the downfall of Sodom and Gomorrah on analogy to the Exile of Adam and Eve into the land of wild animals than Dustin death in desert so it's inviting Israelites to view the events of history as a part of a bigger pad that God is working out in history that when humans choose Folly and they choose violence that it will ruin them and God hands humans over and they will be undone by their own evil which will come in the form of an invading Army flood
 cities that humans built because of the consequences of their own murderous evil in the city of Cain actually become the punishment
 Jerusalem has become like a new Sodom and Gomorrah so what will God do hand them over to a bigger badder version of Sodom and Gomorrah this is Babylon and then babylon's version of Sodom Gomorrah will engulf Jerusalem's Sodom and Gomorrah and it hits this handing over the city becomes both the it's a consequence and Punishment by Cosmic you mean not merely what is happening but why it's happening with the profits to do is they interpret the events of Israel's history from a cosmetic or Heavenly perspective from God's point of view that's what makes it a cosmic you mean from a Divine point of view just means from Cosmos views all of reality as an ordered whole okra and some way so the point is like well it's not just that Yahweh was asleep
 pray that he's less powerful in March and got of Babylon it's actually Highway who's behind all these Cycles on my girl at the end of days there is an end to this at the end of day is the mountain of the House of Yahweh will become the exalted refuge for all of the nature of our go-to as they attempt to appease yet so these become our two cities the mountain of the House of Yahweh that is like of Zion and then Babylon that is destined for Cosmic ruin and the kind of these cities were historical and they were events surrounding the events of history but they're perfect portraits kind of rise above those ancient historical event and they become images for the later profits to describe the whole history of humanity is now A Tale of Two Cities the city that God
 its purpose to build
 and then the city that God will have to tear down to make way for the city that he wants to turn Krishna into and in a way that is what the rest of the drama of Isaiah's about so how you doing fairly clear this yeah but it's clear to me what I'm think I'm saying but when you have that certain look in your eyes are like there's something that's not clear which usually means there's something new for me to learn o
 I mean I think we can keep going because I think my questions turned into more like
 well I think there's a question why not answer it
 what seems to be happening is the biblical story of saying look
 humans are going to build their cities it's not going to work I'm going to start over so the flood the first example where does Noah and up he has up high on a mountain sacrificing to God back of Temple like a little spontaneous Temple altar up there for like a moment and then things are unwinding again resulting in the building and more City or cities Babylon just like the story of Moses up on the mountain with God getting the Covenant just a flash of good of this idea of the city of God may be able to be established before he comes down and there's I don't write you get King David bringing the Tabernacle up and in that story they're like blowing it someone else died and date
 at the time somebody ended up that was some of the other day and David's Kingdom gets split into and immediately right and so you get this hope of the profits of life but there's going to be at I'm going to get back to the bill but we've been there before we get there and stay there right that's the question and it feels like there's been no point history we've been there for more than like a fraction of a second right it's so like there's all this hope of it happening but like it's like we're holding on to that fraction of a second and going we can have eternity there and that fraction of a second it's like this story teaches you to have a really sober realism some might call it pessimism about human's ability to build the city of God the heavenly City here on Earth
 and I think that is part of what the biblical authors are trying to do inside of us but also not make us doubt or lose hope that God can bring about a new creation right here in the middle of our world outside of Eden but it does make me doubt yeah yeah well I told both of this both of those in front of us like your we are building our babylon's and Yahweh will handed me over to self to ruined as we want to build but he will maintain his promise to take the story ultimately towards the New Jerusalem that will come down out of his realm a city not made by hands and in the meantime what we well I'm getting ahead of us cuz I'm going to the next episode but what Isaiah wants to do is hold out the hope
 primarily which I guess there's so much we could do and Isaiah but there's one ultimate New Jerusalem Palm that we've got to read Isaiah chapter 60 all of the many themes of Isaiah scroll come together
so you're right I mean I want to name the tension that you're feeling and it's exactly the tension I think the drives the passion of the prophets it's both yeah this pessimism and just radical unflagging hope in the purpose of God to bring about New Creation the phrase New Creation comes from the score of the prophet Isaiah I will bring about a new heavens and a new Earth which is different than talk about a new city or is it actually what he says that I will bring about a New Jerusalem a couple of the New Jerusalem Palms in the next conversation I guess it's the perfect yet what Jesus was doing when he announced the arrival of the kingdom of God but I think for now she's good to sit in these really
 realistic and hopeful portraits that realistic yet hopeful realistic in The Sermon on the Mount for those who hunger and thirst to see righteousness done in the world for they will be satisfied blessed are those who hunger and thirst if they want to see a world that right was people right with God right with neighbor and they don't see it they desire it and Jesus says that desire will be satisfied maybe not in the way or timing that they would prefer but that's I think to sit in the story and view the world through this lens I think you're saying that's interesting hunger and thirst for righteousness and I've heard you make the sentence before being hungry and thirsty is not a great experience now
 ever the continual Quest everyday it's not have that experience and you're saying my tension is like you're saying is that the same frustration or anxiety or dismay of like being hungry this of like we're not going to be able to do it like cities or just going to destroy us as we build them and just multiply are evil and there's maybe a moment like a hot second that we can like celebrate but then it'll go away in a Flash and you're saying that's being hungry yeah that's right and Jesus has this optimism where he goes you're hungry
 I can be so yeah you'll be filled more like it says that the Samaritan woman or to the people when he gives them the loaves of bread does a Gospel of John you know he says you come to me cuz you were hungry and I gave you bread and now you're hungry again but I've got some bread to give you that will last to life on to the edge and that's the equivalent of what Isaiah is talking about here there's just the cities of Ruin and then there's the city that does not made by human hands and that's what we'll look at in the next episode.
