exploring the theme of the sea dragon in the Bible as a symbol representing chaos and death is our forces that God and trolls and seduce money orders Creation in Genesis chapter 1 and then these are forces that got a point both angels and humans to rule over on God's behalf for the story of the Bible is about how God's creatures don't rule over the chaos and it's dead become chaos monsters themselves the snake in the garden that deceives Adam and Eve is a spiritual being become a sneaky monster out of Annie's son Kane becomes a sneaky monster in this world Exodus king Pharaoh is depicted as a snaky monster behind all of this is this prophecy that a future human will not be overcome by the tank but instead will crush the head of the snake and stays up so we're going to look at a story in the school of Judges it's the story of the prophetess Deborah
 she's a human mouth piece for God she embodies Gods ruled over the people judging and leading them and she loves to sit under a tree to Tween high place and House of God on the mountain of Debra is a new EVE tasked with striking down the bad guys of the story who are a crafty King and his sneaky Commander but the story's not just got Deborah also about a non-israelite woman can I pay and JL through the female profit. Going to raise up to a female deliver real lures the snake and Commander into our tent and as he sleeps as she drives a tent stake through his skull she counted to seize the deceiver and she killed them smashes his head with his all Genesis 3 15 seed of the woman smashing the head of the snake but in this case to see this woman is a woman
 today Tim Mackie and I look at the story of Deborah and Jael in the scroll of Judges thanks for joining us here we go
 hey Tim John hello hello again hello again we're making our way through the story of the Bible focusing in on the theme of the Dragon Age dragons however it's not merely about how is Nicole that there's the Bible talks about dragons and why it is that it is that but as we've dug and we realized it's actually more about what does it mean for creatures to fight against God's creation and become creatures that want to black drag creation back into nothingness into its decreation state and I mean that's horrifying yeah it's also pretty intuitive I mean my kids on a regular basis are dragging our house back into a state of depression we both have two boys
 Seattle now in like you know pre-adolescent and wow that's a lot of stuff gets broken at my house needlessly just from just curiosity and carelessness you know what I mean I'm sticking yesterday my kids it was a sunny day in February in Portland yesterday and might get spent the whole afternoon outside and I walked out and it brought out a card table and they were playing card games and they had made a big fire in a we have like a metal fire pit thing in our backyard and they were just burning so much stuff but like they felt the need to shatter it all before they put it in the fire cameras a while just breaking wooden stuff apart and I was just thinking like that's what they want to do I just want to break stuff and then burn it and that's where my kids are at right now do you know what I'm talking about just that impulse to take your kids have that stuff apart and break it
 maybe not as much as your kids maybe I haven't given them enough opportunity to break stuff for apps on a silly level but there's something terrible is about that where we just kind of when we make stuff and we break stuff and it's just a matter of the Paradox in our nature anyway there is a people pointed out that I have a characteristic personality trait and which I like to kind of poke at things like if something starts to become a little bit chaotic I like to cut it to start prodding at it and be like where's it going to break a master like backup let's see what this thing is really made of white ones David memory I think the first time yeah remember we were with a friend who had like a really powerful four-wheeler
 and there is this really it was wet like spraying Northwest day up in some woods and there was this really really steep muddy Forest Road and we tried to go out there and it just got stuck and spun out and you reversed back and I thought like we're going to just back up and go away
 and then you're like it was so nice but we made it up but it was I thought we were going to tip over embrace the chaos embrace the chaos is that okay but we're talking about the kind of chaos that we should be really afraid of like it's kind of chaos that work when Cain is angry at his brother yes it's the chaos that God says that's a Monster yeah and it wants to devour you but he says you you can rule it that's right and then in the last conversation we talked about how in the story of Exodus where are you got Pharaoh as the pirate king enslaving Israel he's depicted as them the chaos Monster he is the snake is the timing but then most who is the deliver the new Adam and what came could have been he is told by God to throw down his staff the staff becomes the snake and then when he died
 is it again he claims it has power over it. And staff it's also not just the snake at the time even when he throws in front of pharaoh it's that staff that he uses that God has amused to split the waters Waters to order the chaos water so that land can emerge so that they can walk into Liberation and then we just stopped and we like what does that mean that an image of God a new human could not just like get the snake out of the field or get out of the garden back into the field or like crushed the snake but actually like grabbed it by its tail and use it as like an instrument for order so we back up to the portrait of the snake in the garden it's a creature
 that's good but that used its wisdom to cause the downfall of God's human images so that they now die and so that snake which didn't begin is bad we're told in the 7-Day Christian narrative the sea monster with a part of God's good world so it through its choices and Folly becomes an agent of chaos and then humans who listen to the voice of the snake instead of ruling it become agents of chaos so that the scene at The Parting of The Waters in The Exodus story is about a human image of God with power over the snake versus a human Pharaoh who's caught in the Web of Lies with a snake and so the arm of Yahweh shatters the head of the sea monster that's how Isaiah remembered the story is he retold The Exodus story
 but what actually happened was the waters themselves caused the downfall of the human snake agent so that story sets up kind of icky Paradigm for many of the stories to follow so we could choose many basically the devil's the way the biblical story works is we're just going to keep cycling through this core idea and each generation is going to replay its own version of Adam and Eve story and of The Exodus story in the players are going to swap and each iteration of the pattern gives us deeper insight into the ways of God into the ways of the snake and into the nature of the human heart and the whole thing becomes a mirror for self-reflection it but also a window into the wisdom of God and where he's taking creation so I want to take us is to a story when this became clear to me what's going on in the story was just like
 just a great day so what story this is the story of Barack and Debra and Cicero the evil captain in the story of Judges chapters four and five so begins after Joshua has led the Israelites into the land promised to Abraham Isaac and Jacob are in through the chaos waters flow from Mount Herman in the north what were told is that the Israelites go into the land and they keep giving their allegiance to foreign gods and that each time this happens God hands them over gives them over into the hands of oppressors around them and essentially this cycle in the Book of Judges idolatry leading to depression and then they cry out to the Lord and God raises up a deliver and then there
 this is The Exodus story in terms of Oppression crying out raising of a deliver rescuing except the reason why they end up back in oppression again is because of their own sins and I guess in a way and threw away the Israelites ended up in Egypt was because of the sins of Joseph's brothers against him that's all I got down there so just judges itself is already set on analogy to the basic plot line of Exodus story and he's in the vocabulary of the Israelites crying out and God praising up at the liver is Right From The Exodus and remember the Exodus story was all set on analogy to the Eden story human flourishing in a garden you got a snaky figure to seize them that results in slavery and death in the field
 from which God is going to raise up a seed of the woman to stomp on the snake that's eaten story we saw it in the last conversation of The Exodus story has been mapped onto all that so now in this story in judges that's just on reply but in this particular story I don't know why bring so much delight to me of the way so both The Exodus story and the Eden story are going to be a dear and I want us to just look for the Snake look for where you see the snake appear in the story the snake fighting Mission snake finding mission
judges 4 verse 1
 and again this Israelites did bad or evil in the eyes of Yahweh and whatever they did it is it's a signal for idolatry but it keeps happening over and over again so now that's all the narrator has to say hi and you just got you know that kind of thing and I heard the guy last judge who was the last judge who stabbed the king of Moab and stomach the whole story he died just like in how access begins when Joseph died in the past generation dies
 pursue so yeah we sold them into the hand of Yavin the king of Canaan who reigned as in Hots or it's the word for discernment Bean Bean on the hand of
 wisdom the wise King skillful one the understanding King yeah he's the crafty yeah now you should know the captain of his army was named this really
 okay here's this Destiny this is not a Hebrew name its name is not Semitic where is that a transliteration it's a transliteration see Sarah yeah it's either luwian which has a a language spoken by neighbors up to the North of Israel blue Ian is not a Semitic language but it's this rot and you know it's a name for this guy and then also way later and Ezra Nehemiah there's a sister that's among the Exiles have returned to Israel so it's not clear what this name means at least in color baumgartner's Hebrew Aramaic let's consult testament which is the most kind of update
 language with that analogy of Hebrew words so I could be making this up entirely so you think it's use cuz it's got a hissing quality to it I don't know I can't prove it. It's just I just wait for her story works out so we got we got the crap the king and his Commander is Commander the hissing cat and he was living in how do him how do I say yes is the word for handiwork like referring literally if you like make a stone statue or a wooden table than you would call that your Hiroshi the working of the nation's the word hugging him as the nation's so this guy represents some sort of wise skillful King who was commander whose name sounds like the hissing of a reptile and he lives in
 the land of the the craftsmanship The Crafty working trying to create a nation's it was imagine the person building the tower to the sky building the city though like the Empire yeah you know what the nation's do they Rage of these guys so they have you ever used for Abel's blood crying out from the ground and this is what it is related to do when they cry out to Yahweh from the slavery because
 he that is Jasmin had 900 ironchariots was at the last set of Chariots know there have been some charity Army sent Joshua that were all actually also hyperlink to Sarah
 and he that is yummy in with his chariots and sister a captain oppressed the Israelites with cruelty for 20 years exact word used in the back of the store that's the setup for pivot now here's something reader that you should know around that time Deborah the prophetess the wife of libido was the judge in Israel so she was the one car was risen up at that time to be the spirit empowered tribal Chieftain now she's the wife of a guy named flame Deborah means be like a honey bee sting like a bee Muhammad Ali the wife of flame was the judge of Israel this is rad you have this prophetess who's like the honored judge and leader of the people
 the season and you know she loved go sit under that palm tree of Deborah you know between high place and the house of God from on Bethel children will Garden Inn Hill Country of Ephraim fruitfulness come on woman mouthpiece forgot she's an image of God cuz what she says is a representation of what God wants to say she embodies Gods ruled over the people judging and leading them and she loves to sit under a tree between high place in the house of God on the mountain of fruitfulness in the English yeah but that's how they do it this is how they are with the palm trees are there on the tree yeah but Rama and Bethel yet you have to know what's the high place and House of House of God
 I'm walking now yeah yeah but Hill Country is just the word mountains and you know from Genesis that if Ryan is the word plan fruitfulness from the blessing that Jacob is Stir Fry if you been using your concordance to look up names name is all of these names are always significant but we're painting at Eton seen here also and exodus scene with the therapist like this is your last warning in his Chariot is oppression its own
 so she sent and she called for a guy named lightning Barack lightning the son of my father is delightful Aveeno alarm from the holy Place Kadesh of naftali
 and she said to him hasn't Yahweh the god of Israel commanded you go march to mount tub or and take ten thousand men from the descendants of Knoxville I and several Hoon she's speaking on God's behalf here but it's God will draw out sisera the commander of your veins are me with his Chariot and troops to the Wadi of Keyshawn body is a seasonal rental streambed so it's dry cuz it's in the desert but when it rains up in the hills it'll turn it on a river flash flood today
 they're at the place of the flood the floodwaters there I'll give them into your hand
 so all the sudden now this female Prophet speaks God's word to lightning son of my father is delight and now the sky is a choice what you going to do you just heard God's word Barak said to her you know if you go with me I'll go but if you don't come with me Deborah no I'm not going to go okay you could take it as a lack of trust right where in the word of God yeah he's a condition as a man and a woman now debating about but it got there what did God say Bender the dangerous
 she said alright I'll go with you however there will be no glory for you in the past that you were taking okay so it's definitely a concession she makes it clear that he just didn't trust in the Lord of Galloway so okay alright you didn't want to trust in the word of y'all way that I would give him into your hands that's what God Said so they'll be no glory no honor for you in the path we're taking because he always going to sell sisera into the hand of a woman and Debra stood up and went with Brock to Kevin so the rock should have been the one to crush the snake but he gave up his Chance by forfeiting right forfeiting that chance and so now through the female Prophet God's going to raise up a female deliver the word where does inverting all of the the stuff with eaten here because
 it was a woman first because of deception of the snake touted the word of God and then she gave to her husband and he ate and presumably I mean that starts with the logic chain that he accepted the deception and disobey to but in here it's inverted and so now it's going to be that's the female represents the voice of God and is the female who's going to be the deliverer Surat inverting yet so Baroque summons Zebulon these are tribes and not tolerate the cat actually went up with him ten thousand men
 there's 12 when they reported to cisra LeBrock the saint of Avila bomb had gone off to Mount Tabor cisra got all this is tourettes oh I just somebody in the story where is something important happens and then it'll B to speak and it was told to so-and-so and you're just like woohoo so just a crew like it's one of their spies are the sister has summoned all his chariots all 900 ironchariots the whole Army it was with him from the car wash s how go in the working of the nation and they went to that little flooded torrent planned of Keyshawn driving up a snake the dead of snakes have an amount and the form of Chariots so Debra said the lightning get up this is the day that you always given cisra into your hand hasn't Yahweh gone out before you so Brock went out from Mount of war with 10
 thousand following him Yahweh through sister and all his chariots an army into confusion this is a nerdy hyperlink but this word confusion this is describes what Yahweh did to trust chariots once they got into the whatever the seabed but here they are thrown into confusion before the edge of Barack sword so sisera had to get out of this Chariot and he's ran on foot he's just get out of here so I've got stuck. Got stuck you up or confused or something so Brock he just sees the Chariots you don't get confused and he goes after the Chariots and what were told
 sisera Wentz he'd abandoned his army all the way
 so we're told that all the sisters Army fell to the edge of the sword no one was left but sisera he got away so he fled on foot and he ended up at the 10th of this woman Yael yeah it's the name of like a a mountain goat sound like a a deer of the Mountains mountain mountain camp so we fled on foot to the 10th of y'all tell the goat of the mountains she was the wife of clever you know from the line of paint so she goes into the wife of guy named Heather who's a descendant of can't do it just get spelled with a K in an English translations can night but it's Kane's name as a family description remind me how his line is preserved post the flood well it's kind of a it's a mystery
 because in theory Cannon is lying are all like washed away in the flood but then you just meet this people group later on the biblical story who were called the cainites just got to deal with it. So you're thinking well as she's a canine that house is going to go like this could go a few ways you know you should know that there was peace between Yavin the king of hearts or and the house of pepper pick a night in those days. That makes sense why her temp out there
 so y'all came out to meet Cicero and she said to him I turned aside my Lord come on don't be afraid come inside so he went into her tent and she covered him with a blanket she's hiding him and he said to her so thirsty could you please get me a drink of water
 so she opened up a little bottle like a leather bottle of milk and she gave him a drink and she covered him up and he said listen could you stand at the doorway of the tent and if anybody comes and asks you and says is anyone here will you lie you lie and you must say no so it's this world scene at the tent and now jail woman is standing at the door and she's guarding him she supposed to use deception he wants her to be the wife of Henry the canine took in her hand tent Peg and a hammer
 she went quietly or softly to him so she's like hiding under the blanket right full of warm milk
 he's all yeah maybe he's napping we just escaped the battle you know it's so he thinks that she's here and she's sending she just imagine that like where is his head in this blanket I see you there around mass and she went through and just drove the pig right through this temp it went through his head into the ground though he was asleep cuz he was exhausted and of course you should know that he got it all that will happen it's a side effect if she crosses the head she crushed his head he pressed his head and it just some random woman in her tent stake snake found yep yeah yeah so the snaky captain of The Crafty King's Army
 was trying to get her to deceive the one God you know God's chosen leader Barak but in fact it's through the hand of this woman who does a counter deception she countered to seize the deceiver and she killed him
 what is all Genesis 3 15 seed of the woman smashing the head of the snake but in this case to see this woman is a woman
yeah first the hero woman is Deborah but then it just shifts because the battle happens sister of fleas and now it's a new woman yeah that's right and the finishing him off the mountain and part of it is that once you go remember Kane had a choice he's not the embodiment of evil right he's a foolish human who made a bad choice if you do good you two will be exalted so if you go out and you meet the cainites later on in the story they split off and you have good K nights will become allies with this real like in the story and then you also have stories of bad canine your ass thinking about Kane when we were talking last time about Moses is Cain killed his brother is cast out into the Wilderness and Exile but
 given a sign of protection by God and Kane could have I mean the story is so opaque in a way it's like you know what is the sign and what was he supposed to do with it what he does he built the city and later meditation we did this in the theme of the city we talked about how building a city was him protecting himself yes it's all I was saying. Saying I'll protect you write complete protection the Sevenfold protection and then I think about with Moses Moses kills ya guy if he does it's a cane movie it's a totally again Move Ya Hills he now it's not his brother it's an Egyptian Moses grew up with the Egyptian by that point of his brother yes yeah he's exiled
 and God we're not told he's given a sign but he encounters God out in the wilderness and what Moses does what maybe you can imagine cane could have done which is out in the wilderness like Embrace this identity of going okay I screwed up I murdered my brother but like I want to do I still want to do the right thing and there was still more to the story for him and now you get to this story where it's like yeah there's more to the story the Canaanites it's not over for him to come from hell yeah this is kind of a it's a Redemption of Cain's line as it were but what's interesting is that happen through happens to a murder for a to killing four but it's through killing a snake it's as if she's doing what I said it's all being creatively inverted in many ways
 but you're right is a descendant of Kane's house who actually becomes the snake crushing woman seed of the woman so you're saying the story on its surface it's like okay so a woman graphically kills the bad guy that's a cool story of course my pass out onto my kids like that's a great story tell me what you're feeling at the moment at the moment you're just saying hey she's crushing the head of sneakers High she's doing with the seed of the woman was called to do so Yasin in cisra are yet another iteration to give us another image of the snake if humans as agents of the snake in this case it's a multi Kingdom Alliance to enslave in a press another people group in their land
 and these deception and Military might to do so so the story comes to a partial conclusion by just saying and 423 on that day. Subdued mean king of Canaan before the Israelites the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder on Yavin until they destroyed him. They were being enslaved by the sky run away or finding a freedom this is there that's the end of the story judges 5 comes back around and it retells the story in the poem just like the exit or entrance where X is 14 is the story of the Deliverance through the waters text is 15 is the poetic version those even that itself is modeled after The Exodus story and so it's a long complicated poem that there's actually a very lot of really archaic difficult to translate
 parts of the Hebrew I just want to highlight a couple points in the story in verse 19 of Judges 5 it focuses in on the battle and this is how it retails the store it says the kings came they fought the kings of Canaan spots at Titanic By the Waters of megiddo and they got no plunder and silver megiddo that's not where they were though right oh yes yeah mount table or and megiddo are not that far from each other and that's why he's there there's a big plane The Plains of megiddo and that lead further east and then South into big playing not too bored as a mountain specially a big plane with mountains surrounding it to make it a big play Bali Bali okay
 can I use my mental math right now so you have all of these deep ravines the go down into the valley that if it rains up in the hills they'll do the water bottle brush down the WaTiki Sean okay so the kings are fighting down in the valley and then 420 says the Stars fought from heaven from their courses they fought against sisera so this this was the idea of God confuse them like the poet is saying what was going on with that their daughters were fighting yeah heaven in Earth the battle on the land had some mirror of what was happening up in heaven so even the stars number stars are the sons of Elohim the host of Heaven
 we're participating in this battle against the snakey armies of the working of the nation's so the Wadi torrent of Keeshond swept them away the Raging Water Heater and watee torrent of Keyshawn sorry are the stars fighting on behalf of Israel or a behalf of sisera they're fighting against sister gets. I just want to notice the stars and then these flood waters raging torrential Waters, Kansas to Heaven Genesis one when you come to places later in the Hebrew Bible so the Israelites fight against this right now we're being told that also the stars and the Darkness above
 and the flood waters Unleashed from the mountains come raging into the valley and they were also fighting against CE Sera the forces of chaos just like the Waters of the Sea of reeds were used to fight against Pharaoh defeat him in the water so so now she is being defeated by the floodwaters and buy the stars and just like Moses could take the sea serpent in his hand you know which is the stash and use it as an instrument like the stars which are often thought of as it can become these chaos creatures are actually fighting on their behalf yeah yeah it's just the poem it's almost as if the poem goes back in retells the story to give it a more Cosmic frame Cosmic layers of meaning using a classic chaos images from The Story So Far darkness and flood
 but in this case the waters and the stars in the darkness our agents of Yahweh to defeat the sea dragon or the snake know there's no word plays I can find the story on any of the words for snake for Dragon but the Eden Echoes were there like the Chariots the Pharaohs are being called a king do the wise just kidding why is King I mean that is a bit of a hyperlink out of town so we made a video about Psalm 148 Karissa Liston the horse I saw there's a few years ago she did the voice for that and there was a couple Jesse and Leah Roberts who are the band poor Bishop Hooper at that time they were going through and making a song an original song for all of the 150 Psalms and so we got the commission them to make Psalm 148 out of order out of order
 show me the lack of 92 or something so they did that for us and I love listening to their Renditions of the songs I haven't listened to it when I run and I remember the day I first heard their intuition of Psalm 83 and I was like oh my gosh and this is so rad okay watch out some 83 works of God do not be silent don't keep silent or be still owe God for look your enemies are roaring those who hate you. Their head
 they devise cunning schemes against your people this is the exact same word used to describe the snake in the garden are room they consult together against Those whom you protect they say come let us an aisle 8 through them from being a nation so the name of Israel is remembered no more the consult together with one purpose and make a covenant against you that's babbel language in it together as one yes yep we talkin about here we're talking about the tents of Edom the descendants of Esau
 they just met lights Ismail Moab son of lot
 headrights that is Sons of Hagar they're all of the Rival siblings from Genesis Jamon who's from son of lot on the left who are the descendants of Esau Celestia to come from the line of ham and tire who are the Canaanites living up on a island Fortress
 Assyria also has joined them also a son of ham to 1010 Nations and you met all of them in Genesis as rival siblings who respond with hostility to the God's chosen one
 do to them like you did to Midian do as you did with cisra since and Yavin at the Wadi of Keyshawn they were destroyed at Endor the fountain or the spring of door is also spelled with the letters of Eden to walk around they become like dung on the ground is make them like oreb and Zeeb and their Chiefs like is Eva and Zama na these were the enemies of Gideon in the next story in judges
 they said let us take as our possession the pastures of God oh my God make them like Tumbleweed like chaff before the wind like fire burns of forest and Flame sets mountains on fire pursue them with your storm your Tempest terrify them with your storm fill their faces with shame so that they may seek your name wait what was that work you destroy them so that they can stick your name since their destruction somehow like it's not permanent let them be ashamed and terrified let them be humiliated and Parrish
 so that they may know that you whose name is Yahweh are most high over all the Earth at Psalm 83 these are the Psalms that I'm just like me and this is the deep end of the pool yeah I got to skip these yeah I just thought I'd start no one of these I'm not this one you're looking for better is one day in your car that's the next song
this poem is a meditation on all the cycles of humans and their tribes or nations that become agents of the snake and their goal is to erase God's chosen images from the world and when they do so they become like that cunning snake in the garden that they were described in the language in a 350 bars cunning schemes yeah yeah and they're roaring like seadragons Lexi dragons I mean well roaring is a common description of either the wild animals in the wilderness lion but then also like the wild sees the chaos mess are they roar roar how can and so God is going to defeat them with the flood storm that's what verse 15 said but then
 we have all of the stuff basically about we named every bad guy except Babylon in the list of 10 Nations and what we're saying is do to them what you did to and then we named the stories of their being crushed Deborah and Barak and then of Gideon and if you look in those stories the bad guys know stories are all described in the language of pharaoh where the snake backing up here all these stories are really about one thing they're about how humans become agents of the snake and when they do so they introduce chaos and decreation Endicott the world
 and so what God does he unleashes the forces of decreation on them to destroy them the fire and those meets them with fire in the storm wasn't fire are like the comedy creation Motif in this is the key thing in our last conversation God uses the chaos Waters of the Reed sea to destroy Pharaoh who's becoming an agent of the snake who was killing people in his own chaos Waters by throwing babies into the Nile so it's measure for measure God brings on the Destroyer the destruction that they have to read another's
 but then there's that interesting little timid at the end where it's like destroy them forever so that they may know you and seek your name means like those that are left in there like ooh I'm just the image is right there somehow this destruction leads to a recognition even by the enemies of the name of the salon one level the poem makes you want to say wow okay I want to be hyper aware that I don't end up in League with a snake take away and everyone don't know I was naked pictures but of course the Hebrew Bible is Ben
 telling us everyone's going to do it and I we all a lie with snake in large and small ways so what this phone doesn't focus on is the deliverer of the snake it just describes God is the destroyer of the snake by its own destructive forces and you know I think there are times when it's just good to focus on that thought and crushing the God is on a mission to remove and deal with and bring an end to destructive human Empires institutions that Unleashed decreation into God's world he won't have it break raises the question of a fool who gets to call hou the snake and Jesus will have a lot to say about that as you go forward into the biblical story but you know I've never had to live under it and not military occupation and so I don't
 really know what it's like to pray this prayer from a place of deep ceiling in solidarity with the people who wrote These poems lived under military occupation for centuries and so who am I to tell them what they can ask God to do or not or how you're talking about this feeling of God like just wipe them out with your fire tournament is chaff and Tumbleweed that in and of itself if you are the one enslaved in the field if you were the one being oppressed like pick me up a static with that black man this violent corrupt King just needs to be taken down within the poem takes a weird turn is what you're saying how much is it goes
 so that they will praise God and what's inside the craze in God and the pain doesn't provide resolution than that so that's another way of thinking about the ways of the snake in the world through humans and a way of thinking about what God is doing and will do about it that's as judges we're going to look at next is a story that's really going to focus on the seed of the woman that God is going to raise up to defeat the snake on land or sea and that's going to be in the story of David that will look at next book thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week talking about a famous Adoration of the theme of the Castro the story of David and Goliath his humanness is clearly being be emphasized that his monstrous qualities are being brought to the fore he has a helmet on his head
 the word for bronze but it's spelled with the root letters of the word snake and that we're going to use for X to describe Goliath
