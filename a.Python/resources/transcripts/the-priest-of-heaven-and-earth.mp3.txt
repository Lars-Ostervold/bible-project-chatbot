hey everybody this is Tim at 5 for project and welcome to the Bible project podcast this episode is the second to last conversation John and I are having about the biblical theme of priest and specifically the royal priesthood throughout the story of the Bible do they were going to dive into a story that depending on the Christian tradition you may be a part of a group in you might or might not be familiar with the story but this is a story that provides an important window into the role of Jesus as the exalted Cosmic Royal priest the story is the Ascension of Jesus the outline of Jesus living dying being raised from the dead is pretty familiar but there's also a crucially important story at the beginning of the book of Acts where Jesus leaves his followers and he does this by ascending up into the skies and disappearing into the Heavenly realm what is this all about
 going to explore this story and also Ponder why this is particularly challenging story for modern readers to fully comprehend we're going to look at what the story and actually a bunch of other passages in the New Testament have to say about what Jesus is doing right now as he is this very moment serving in this Priestly role interceding on behalf of humanity before God as father so that's what the head this episode and also a bunch more thanks for joining us here we go
today we're going to finish our conversation talking about this theme of the priesthood the royal priesthood of royal priesthood and we've gotten through the whole story of the Bible Jesus talk about Jesus acting like a priest doing things like a priest having a show-off not to show off Showdown with the high priest Caiaphas and idea of the priesthood and then also where is this all heading it started in a garden with Humanity who were called to be priests essentially working with God on his behalf Imaging God and doing this in this Royal vacation but kings and queen over creation that's where it begins. All falls apart but there's a hope of of this Redemption
 vent sidings that's what we talked about today Dynamic to this if you are podcast listen ever been listening through the series you won't know this but we recorded the first five episodes of the series a while ago and then we took a break started just writing and we realize that this team video is actually going to become a team series that's right so which we don't normally do what we saw was a big Topic in and of itself and then we realized man there's so much cool stuff about the Elohim we could do a whole series so that was kind of theme Series this video on priesthood what what actually happened was I think I told you this but maybe the listeners would enjoy hearing about you is that we want to do you want to do some more work on a
 website so that you can dig in deeper to these ideas after watching a video like modules were throwing out the word quick study some sort of kind of like interactive thing and so I was writing one for the series and I just like got so deep into it and saw how lovely like it is to be able to take every step slowly talk about Abraham and Melchizedek and his and Isaac and then that just being a video and then how about Moses and Aaron and the Tabernacle and that is being a video I just really slowly walking through that I just got attached to it like let's slow down and you like okay let's slow down so this will actually be a six-part video series called The Royal priest or royal priesthood my Royal Priest The Hood At the Robin Hood so we're we're at then in those 6 steps will be about Adam and Eve as the first real priest and how they forfeit their calling invocation video on video
 video to will be about how Abraham is called to mediate God's blessings world he meets a real priest and ends up having to act as a priest to give up his own son for his sins and forgot provide to substitute video 20 and both those events happened on the hill that will later be called Jerusalem in the biblical story of video 3 about Moses and the one at Mount Sinai Tabernacle Priests of the baron the failure of the priesthood Baron video for will be about David who rekindles the royal priesthood of Melchizedek New Jerusalem and then fails together in the announcement of the kingdom of God and presenting himself as the Royal priest video six and what we want to focus on in this conversation right now is about how Jesus's resurrection and his
 tension or about his installation as the cosmic Royal priest and as such he is working through a royal priesthood that he formed during his Earthly part of his mission and that royal priesthood is called people Jesus or it's called the body of the Messiah his body on Earth takes the form of a royal priesthood which is his followers so it's kind of this duel Jesus Royal priest in the spiritual realm corresponding to his Earthly body which is his people doing royal priesthood stuff right now until the new creation that's what this video of the amount I think what's interesting to me is that normally when we get to this part of a theme there isn't some big surprising twist after Jesus and feels like get to Jesus that's is kind of nice surprise bring everything together in a way that you
 expecting but not fully understanding and then you see his life death and Resurrection through that lens then I feel like the story of us and his followers and then there's hope for New Creation just kind of feel like a snatcher what you're talkin about is this kind of mystical and feel like curveball of like okay we got the Royal priest now he's going to be seated in heaven in the spiritual way while his continued to work on Earth is now this amalgamation of his followers which is like there was any hints of that well maybe there was maybe walk me through that but like it just feels like whoa. I got a left-field a little bit unless you talk about it cuz the way I see it it's in total continuity with what has already been before okay because this will be the concluding video and cuz we're now to six conversations and let's go back to just some Elemental points from the very beginning about the connection between
 in Heaven and Earth and God and Humanity in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve as the image of God are presented as this idealized Humanity the royal priesthood sweet for that already but and I can't remember if we said it is clearly in our conversations but we came through it a Clarity in the script and I've never said this way before but forcing the right to stop really helped me that there's this parallel this is on page 40 of the notes the connection between a Sacred Space and then the people who inhabit and work in that Sacred Space there's an important analogy or parallel between them so you know we made a video about how the ideal goal of creation from the Garden of Eden and forward into a new creation is for the union of having an earth to the Garden of Eden represents that it's a space at the Hyatt Place in the skies we're having an earth or one where Divine and human
 meet together and work together and later the Tabernacle concept of the overlap of Heaven and Earth when the place but then you have the overlap of divine and human in the people who live and work in that place and so without a minivan as the image of God as Royal priests and then later with the Tabernacle at temple with the priest who work there but the whole point is that they are also a meeting place of Heaven on Earth in their very person in Genesis 1 and 2 they are the image of God you look at these figures and you say well that's like God they are like. I am looking at an image reflection of who got it so they represent God to the creation but then they also are themselves Creations that represent creation back to God the representing Gods themselves we are representing.
 and that you have God and then creation and then in this middle spot or these these Priestly humans are creatures so they represent all the Jason before God but then they also represent God to out to the creation got it and so there are union of having a nurse and divine and human in their own selves it away both this idea of a place we're having another one and people in whom heaven on Earth are one they overlap yeah in Genesis 1:1 that just analogy I think it's significant cuz they're both point of the same thing place and the people we're Divine Life love and God's character become one with creation joined a nudity so as you go through the storyline of the Bible then the role of these sacred people who live and work in the Sacred Space
 they have a job description of Duties that emerge from it and I think there's three parts of that Duty they overlap but I think their distinct enough will be kind of cool is to begin this video was just saying okay let's go back when does just remember hears about this overlap of play sand people and here's what Adam and Eve and what the priests are called to do you could use these three categories talk about what they do the first is worship we looked at Adam and Eve that little job description they were there to work and care for the garden Genesis 2 and we looked at those two words cuz of the word on work of odd is the same word as to worship or so what the Priestly activity of working and worshiping in the temple was the phrase the NT Wright and assessments color uses as a shorthand for this that really stuck in my imagination you talks about the priests wear these Representatives who gather up the inarticulate noise of creation
 and direct and transform it into praise towards God so I think about the great creation Psalms in the Book of Psalms Psalm 104 Psalm 148 and they just start taking you on a tour through the cosmos of all the end of the heavens and the creatures in the sea and the creatures in the mountains and all of this and they talk about how the creatures are talking the God crying out to God the oceans Roar with their cry rising up but it's inarticulate it's noise is Birdsong lions roaring we forgot it's not even God would know what it is but using the word noise maybe that preloads it with a bit of a negative I just mean it sound but one of the roles of the priests and then this is really highlight in the book of Chronicles really cares about this is about how part of the Priestly duties were to organize themselves into groups and choirs with rhythms of prayer and price and so the spray is it in TMNT rights they
 turn the sound creation how about instead of noise so, the sound of creation they transform it into articulate praise to honor the Creator that's a key part of the human vocation transform natural sounds something that we would call Beautiful worshipful so little imagination so on one level there's not much different than like the bird trippin you know in the morning to the other bird and then me talking to my son's in the morning about what they want for breakfast do sound waves at different frequencies to biological creatures there's the sound of creation but then what humans are doing is of extremely sophisticated right Code system of sounds that communicate meaning
 and I think that's essentially what the act of praise and worship is it's taking what is less articulate sounds of creation and turning them into meaningful statements of Honor towards God worship me or we could do a whole hour on worship we could perhaps we should begin work study of odd is that right yeah because when we talked about it last week talked about a lot through this lens of work and worship and that's really interesting so bad that I feel like I still want to track down with you now you're taking a slightly different place with it saying there's also an element to worship which is transforming sound and you just kind of scratch a little bit of a niche maybe that I'm just like wow that sounds really she must be talking about it but I feel like we kind of have to leave it there but to worship is to ascribe honor and significance to someone and how that relates to work again to work
 oh well it's just it's the the word play the double meaning word play Adam and Eve doing the garden they work and care for it but those words are also the same words as worship and guard the Priestly liturgies of worship the same word it's it's two different words said the same way it's one word that has multiple meanings and sometimes clever authors can use the one word but mean both things I see activating both meetings okay I called and fancy phrase for as an example in English would be the words read like read something or the color red said the same way a little bit different it would be the one word that has two distinct meetings but you're actually trying to activate both of them what is it what you just described was hominem which is two different words that are spelled with the same letters
 actually they're not spelled the same letters in my example and red know you're right but lead and Lan LED my glad that's a holiday that's spelled the same pronounce the same two different meanings to different mean and you can activate either or both when you use it I ran to the store so if I say I'm going to go run to the store but what I actually do is run Drive Wright in all right to go to the store but since I'm riding my bike really fast cuz maybe I need to get something in a hurry I am running I mean that in the sense of to run means to go fast even though what I'm actually doing is just seems like more like a turn of phrase that that gets kind of coin into something more than what it literally met but on one level the word run means to use your legs and back fast whatever Locomotion but it cannot
 so abused metaphorically to describe any way that you might get somewhere quickly so on that level the idea of working at been worshipping really closely embedded in Hebrews the same word they're the exact same word correct but you would know that there's two different meanings but you would also know that they're so they're very intimately connected as as kind of this one story on one level they are working that is in a garden like as far as but on another level they are also depicted as Royal priests and so they're working in the garden is there liturgy it is their active doing ritual worship which in the temple courts bonded to working with the sacrifices lighting incense and singing in choir is endearing allow these okay so one of the one of the acts of work or their jobs was to create beautiful sounds correct and direct them towards
 they're icy and you're right we could discuss that much more in-depth than perhaps we should one day as one of their one of their one of their work is sound generation on generation of God as creator of all things
 now there's another element of the Priestly duties that we actually wrote Into The Script little bit was his idea of giving blessings Yes actually had thought about including it but it wasn't important important yeah so I'm just going to add it to my house I love that you thought about it it's a blessing in Genesis one blessing is about God building into creation the potential to multiply and become more abundant as a Divine gift and then the blessing is about realizing the abundance and potential that is built into creation but that's what the word is referring to in Genesis 1 and so with the priest do as they become mediators with a family of Abraham is a hole supposed to be a-coming mediator that blessing bread to the nation's and then one family in particular in the family of Abraham the Priestly line is Topeka
 I'm the mediator of that blessing in the blessing of Aaron and number 6 made the Lord bless you and keep you cuz his face to shine upon you so you favor me the wordless is countless to you and give you so long and the priests were to raise their hands towards the people and in that moment become representatives of God than got to show in Genesis one God blesses each day He blesses the creature Sunday 5 and He blesses the humans on day 6 and you're saying that is saying there is a lot of potential be fruitful and multiply here and he blessed them saying before the X so discover and kind of experience experience multiplication and abundance abundance yeah for sure we need to do a words day and blessing yes fact you know we were doing that season outline you wanted to do apocalyptic I wanted to ask you about that,
 we did a video on how to read apocalyptic but the idea of doing a word study of just a short little compact it's about your eyes being open to a moment or place we're having dinner there one I like they're consolidating it into a short little words study how do I get to but I feel like we kind of got into the territory text you I'm with you but yes I worship you like both of us would be really good it's good John so what we're doing right now cuz we just talked about two things 1 the ideal of what the garden represent in the place we're having another one the Royal priest of Adam and Eve and the priests throughout the Bible are people in whom heaven on Earth Divine and human are one and what do those people do in that place they worship they represent God to people in people to God they intercede when there's something of concern and they
 the mediators of God's blessing I think if we could paint that quick portrait essentially what we set it up to do is step two of the video when our conversation that's what Jesus is doing right now as the cosmic priest who is exalted innocent session that's what the Heavenly Body of Jesus is doing right now and the Earthly body of Jesus that's its vocation that's one way to imagine it's vocation calling and there's a number of New Testament passages that depict followers of Jesus as either temples or priests or sacrifices during their worship through good works and serving the needs and concerns of others so I think it could be at 1 to 3
 ideal Cosmic Heavenly Jesus the Earthly body of Jesus to his followers but all three of them were doing these activities that's I think the flow for this video
so already in the series we talked about who Jesus was presented in the gospels as a royal priesthood overlapping with the member the priesthood and the temple are two ways of talking about the same thing you're doing a lot to have an interest so it shouldn't surprise us that alongside stories where Jesus is presented as a real priest there also stories where Jesus is presented as a temple not just a person who represents God to people and people God but actually has the place we're having dinner with me and is going to help us cuz there are a number of text in the New Testament where Jesus followers are called both temples and priests in the same paragraph and it's because I think for a connection with in the garden and then Jesus so just real quick there's the story in John chapter to where Jesus storms the temple shuts down this sale sacrificial animals and uniquely and John's account of that he features this
 happening between himself and the leaders of the temple and what they asked him is what sign do you do or will you do to show us your authority to shut down the sacrificial animal sales give me some credentials I mean he's acting like he owns the place that's a pretty generous response in some ways if you think about it just be arrested if we're like extra kicked out there like Okay show us actually can do this who do you think you are so yeah your credentials and then as always in the Gospel of John especially the answers with a cryptic riddle destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up it took years to build the temple they respond to him in 3 days and then John 2:21 the story stops and the narrator like
 side of the story in Whispers And the readers are he was speaking about the Temple of his body and when he was raised from the dead is disciples later remember that he had said this thing then they believed in the scriptures and the word that she's upset and then the storm picks up it keeps going so great it's one of the disciples were just left hanging with this cryptic riddle for a while and then it like all this and that's what you are so very clearly the whole temple theme in the Gospel of John Lewis Ford in a temple video so that's very clear one where Jesus presents himself as the reality to which the temple as a symbol that doesn't mean he thinks the Temple's bad there again this seems like a curve ball is there anywhere in the story the kind of leads you to come I guess I see how he got there the temple is a person is a temple
 well I think it leads us back to that tight Connection in the Garden of Eden the idea is that a place and a people in whom Heaven and Earth are one and will progressively happens in the Hebrew Bible is that the Tabernacle and the temple with their respective priesthoods are diminished graded abused and what it all points towards is a a more perfect union of Heaven in Earth realized not just in a place but in a place that is a person so there's also a little saying of Jesus in The Gospel of Matthew that I think has a lot of Temple connotations you sit there and Matthew 18:20 gathered together in my name I am there in the middle of them often when you have a little small group
 little red Bible study and you're like yes yes it doesn't matter if the 303 but for Jesus to talk about it when a group of my people are together and I am there in the middle in the middle of them that's activating how the holy of holies was in the middle of the temple complex and then remembered in the Garden of Eden they're active very specifically locate the tree of life in the middle and so this is for sure it's another one of these dents sayings of Jesus where he uses Temple and Eaton topography to talk about himself when you gather together remember that you're Gathering me and I am the temple I am the tree of life I am in the middle I'm in the middle of you which means that my people are gathering as it kind of Temple as well
 he doesn't talk about any buildings here it's just whenever my followers get together and I am in the middle you got a Temple You've Got the reality to which the temple was pointing their other other passages but I just wanted to tell you that same about Jesus as the temple as the one in him having dinner there one so that goes alongside the portrait of Jesus as the royal priesthood we explored earlier in the series what's important is how those things come together in the story of Jesus Ascension and you know I was thinking about this and all of our discussions we've actually usually bundled together the events of Jesus's crucifixion resurrection and Ascension for the Heavenly Realms or we don't really talk about this or the Ascension just gets under played so let me just quit plug of a book I recently read a short book by friend New Testament scholar Patrick trainer
 the Ascension of Christ in a little serious just called short studies in biblical theology he both addresses why kind of short survey of church history why the Ascension tends to be neglected in non-liturgical Tradition to Christianity in any traditions of all the church calendar it's like built into the annual calendar Sunday but non-liturgical tradition don't really yeah. Kind of under under played it and it's actually a really significant pivot moment in the New Testament as we're going to see right here cuz it's the moment where Jesus's mission goes to its next stage from launching the kingdom of God on earth that is it as it is in heaven but then taking his seat at the right hand as the cosmic high priest in the spiritual realm to do their things that corresponds what the priest would do
The Acts chapter one key passage here at selected as the sections of it maybe I'll I'll let you read it one through tonight dies he also presented himself alive is Jesus alive after his suffering any convincing proofs appearing to them over a. Of 40 days speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God he said to them it's not for you to know times or Epoch switch the father has fixed by his own authority but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be my witness eyewitnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even the remotest parts of the earth and after he said these things he was lifted up while they were looking on and a cloud received him out of their sight you know what if one of the reasons why it was under played in non-liturgical Traditions like mine
 was it's kind of ridiculous in a way you mean if you try and think about these are humans floating up into the sky and where's it going totally you're going to like you can hit the atmosphere and then what so what makes it feel that way to you is that you're adapting it to your own modern cosmology I write Yeah Yeah from the point of view of like the the God is a throne in the heavens and there's that the sky represents this middle space in between for Jesus to flowed up there does Pierre would make sense either send it to get the Divine space this is similar to how do you know modern debates about the flood often happen because we're trying to translate the flood into a modern cosmological picture about we can save the Earth which changes the meaning entirely of the story because the floods
 within a conception where there's the waters above in the water where you at the waters come down and then from below the collapse of the cost of Genesis one so similar to hear these keywords he was lifted up and a cloud received him these are glowing hyperlinks that makes sense to do within the difficult cosmology of the Skies as the realm of gods Transcendent Thrones are not separate from Earth but above it and overlap with it through the temple cuz he could have just like like a fog could have come over so he could have it standing on the ground and then you like look over you look back uses gone I think here we're at this place where Luke has purposefully chosen the wording based on the scriptural imagery the hyperlink to and so I think we have to become a little more humble to say what he's trying to communicate is less what you would see if a video camera was there but the meaning of a
 what happened is the Jesus disappeared when we don't know how many maybe Jesus did do it on purpose but I'm just saying on the basic level Jesus was here in person yes over a period of forty days and then out of their sight then he was gone they didn't see him anymore and the two images used to describe here transitioning to not here are lifted up and a cloud receiving him this is Daniel 7 to being the being lifted up his bottom page 41 is the key motifs read through the book of Isaiah where when Isaiah the temple Vision he's wakes up and he sees Yahweh sitting on the throne lift it up and exalted and then there's high and low motifs are big Matisse throughout the Book of Isaiah has a hole and it culminates in the suffering servant Pond the same as suffering servant Pawn begin 53 was God saying
 look my servant will prosper he will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted and then it goes on and says is Isaiah fifty two verse 13 of the following will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted and just as many were astonished at you my people so his appearance was marred more than any man has four more than the sons of man and in this way he will sprinkle many nations the futoma alluding to the sprinkling of Blood on the atonement LED cover and so Kings will shut their mouths on account of him for what they had not been told they will see so this is about through his suffering the servant is exalted to a place of divine royalty and status and this is the same imagery of being with it up on the cross to exactly so in a way the cross is one part of his enthronement yeah the resurrection is also part of his enthronement and the Ascension is another
 I spect they'll work together they're like bundled images going through my video, but the Ascension is clearly get the culminating a crucifixion Resurrection Ascension so that's for sure we're Luke's getting Jesus was lifted up and then the cloud received him you're right totally it is Daniel 7 we're in verse 13 the day of 7 he saw with the Clouds Of Heaven one like a son of man coming up to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him and then he's giving a kingdom dominion over all the peoples and length people of every language so the Ascension of Jesus here in X2 is about his ultimate exaltation to the Heavenly throne room which is Temple a Sacred Space videos we talked about the Heavenly throne
 room at all don't think we have what we say is that Eden is a place we're having dinner there one near the same Eden is the Heavenly Throne Room correct and then we don't talk about how even eaten now there is the Heavenly throne room that's not on Earth we mention it in in the mostest video where he goes up I'm out right now is that and he sees the temple okay and he might have to punch that up there he sees someone sitting on a throne and Saint yeah so that's the Ascension is about Jesus's exultation to become Cosmic Royal priest on the heavens side of the equation of logic is that heaven and earth the gods rain over everything is this idea of Eden we're having dinner there together Heaven being God's domain or He reigns yes and Earth being our domain where we rain there's a Unity their Unity
 play sand person yeah unified in as in a place but then also unified and he's got humans images of images of God and the problem is that the humans don't want to participate in that calling or don't know how to do it or want to do it their own way so this idea that God still Reigns but that is no longer on Earth in a mixed with human rating at least at least in their Exile yeah so now when you talk about God's Reign you don't talk about it as on the earth to talk about it as in the sky correct so he's in throned in the end I haven't eaten but he didn't see the place on Earth where this happen and it is also heaven heaven and it's heaven on Earth but when Heaven is just in heaven that's the nice like the Divine Throne remember something different than Eden
 I know the whole point is that it's the Heathen is heaven on Earth exactly what happens in heaven separated from Earth you were still call it even Jesus does really it's what he says to the the guy dying next to him on the cross so paradise I'll see you in. I will look into this when this is over we're going to be in the garden together LOL paradise and that's trippy that's why I that's what Moses he's when he goes to the top of Mount Sinai he's on Earth but he's seeing and experiencing Heaven saying and the fact that Moses encounters the Garden on top of Mount Sinai doesn't mean that was the Garden of Eden was on Sinai it's weird being counters the guard he encounters what does encounter encounters the Heavenly presence of God overlapping with Earth on the top of Mount Sinai and what does he see I mean give me the blueprints but yeah he's something he sees God on his throne he sees a Pavement
 are any See's God from the undersides as it were and these Heavenly being and that you would have called that Eden that's what she says about lift so I get the point being yours at the narrative Logic the point is there's a place we're having dinner there one that's eaten in my in my imagination and eat and I want to create this category of there's a place where Heaven is just Heaven outside of Earth where like God Reigns still that's right but he's let humans kind of rain on Earth and so Jesus is ascending to that place where God Reigns yes and ultimately he still Reigns Earth even though we kind of lets and I think it's a lot of songs are about like you still are control of all this but he's allowed this moment in creation we're we're kind of running around raining it around here
 other Wills right may your will be done here on Earth as it is in heaven so God has allowed other Wills to have a certain Independence Daniel 7 is about this human who will be trampled by the pieces in the Corky he's exhausted from the realm of the realm of the beer on the vinyl piece up on a cloud and he sits at God's right hand in the Heavenly Eden and so when we see and Luke Luke's and then Acts were Luke talks about Jesus being a Send It On A Cloud he is activating that whole idea so here's the human who now sits at God's right hand ruling from the Heavenly Temple which still has a connection to Earth and there always has been a connection has been the connections through Abraham's family called to be that the bus inclination
 the connection from Moses and the levitical priesthood and the Tabernacle and then David and in the temple is always been this connection then now it's Jesus saying I am the temple and I am the Royal priest I am that connection not only that connection but now the connection is gone up into the sky God's right hand yeah or it's yeah it's gone in the sense that they can't see it but it is actually about they're about to realize it's still fully present but in a way that is surprising to them
so there are two new testament authors who explore what Jesus is doing as the exalted Cosmic Royal priest right now this is a major theme in the letter to the Hebrews which distance I just recently listen to an audiobook by Ben witherington New Testament scholar call Priscilla so awesome if you want to just imagine sivley think about and learn about the first generation of Messianic Jews on what it was like as the movement spread from Jerusalem around listen or read Priscilla Priscilla at the end of her life recounting how she became a follower of Jesus that made a considerable friction historical fiction but it's all based on Research long life and career a new testament studies and it's so interesting to learn son but she and her husband Aquila had a close relationship with
 a guy named Apollo's who was in that first generation he's mentioned in the book of Acts and anyway the letter to the Hebrews from Apollo has the church and round in the opening paragraph of the letter to the Hebrews is pretty remarkable I'm just going to read it cuz it fits in with what we're talkin about here so long ago and many times and it many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets but in these final days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed as the inheritor the air of all things and through whom he also created the world that is the sun is the radiance of the glory of God he is the exact imprint of God's nature upholding the universe by the word
 power after making purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high that's all it does actually but I remember that's all one sense in grief elegant who knows he contrasts God's been speaking a long-term spoke to the prophets but there is a culminating Act of divine speech that happened through the sun the sun is the one who will inherit all things at the end and he's the one through whom all things were created the way of saying he's the Alpha and the Omega and inheriting I'm sure that's activating a whole oh yeah it's kind of ideas he becomes the one who possesses and becomes the steward and Lord of all creation like a child inherits to I think of her parents and it becomes their own to be responsible for which is what Humanity was supposed to be exactly right which is what it goes on to say then he talks about him as he's talking about the Incarnation
 the as the image of God when he goes on to say he's the radiance of the glory of God so member the high priest shines like the glory of God but Jesus is not doesn't just have shiny clothes he actually is that shining Brilliance become human hey we are we are images he's the exact imprint cool he uses the Greek words the Greek word product are so we get the Greenwood character but it means them stamp like when you have a stamp in their day would be on wax is most likely then the impression that is Left Behind from the stamp if I stamp on a stamp I'm actually there's a moment where the actual shape of the physical stamp is hidden from me right but once it goes into the wax and I lift it up what I see you left over is the product are the imprint imagining you up
 stamped and Jesus as the character in front and I look at the imprint to see what I can't see which is the actual stamp money is not a cool metaphor yeah it is that just another way of saying image of God or is that like a bum or is it saying he's more of an image then humans by saying he is the imprint of the divine nature and it again this is imported parallelism he is the radiance article or he's got he's like the sun beams that come from the Sun in the sensor indistinguishable from the Sun but at the same time they are stinks so you know he's doing his best explain the Trinity images so in the last line is after he made a sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand at Psalm 110 and Daniel 7 to come by and get together so
 the author of Hebrews goes on specially in chapter 7 and 8 to talk about what's he doing up there now so you already represented Us by offering a sacrifice to cover for sins but we do know in chapter 7 makes us long argument about how you know the priest that would live and I have to offer sacrifices for themselves and for their own failures and then for the people that Jesus sister's is a permanent Eternal priest and so his sacrifice was once and for all and his sacrifice wasn't us something else to sacrifice was himself think Abraham and Isaac Moses and David have such a high priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the Throne of majesty in the skies he is present tense a minister in the sanctuary and in the actual Tabernacle the Heavenly throne
 yeah which which the Lord pitched not humans and he goes on to say that the Earthly Tabernacle is a copy and Shadow of the Heavenly things just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the Tabernacle look and make sure that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain with bring that logic together here where reflection symbols of the ultimate the reality of God's throne in heaven which was supposed to be overlapped with earth that is not currently that's right so what we are to imagine then is Jesus in his resurrected body which is a trans physical
 body spray cuz it can have it having dinner at the same time is currently inhabiting this is a new creation the heavenly side of the new creation I guess and he's up there having a sacrifice himself but laws are Hebrew says in chapter 75 he always lives to make intercession for people so he is still up there advocating on behalf of humanity that image is not done but not as if Humanity Humanity still need someone to advocate for them and bring their concerns before the father and that's how we are to imagine the cosmic real priest right now it's a huge Motif in the whole letter that's interesting so I mean it's very clear to me in my upbringing what it means that he was the purification and that was a time in human history it happened it's done although we could talk about
 what Paul means when he says that he's completing whatever but but then this idea of continued intercession in another capacity other than purifying your sins that to me I actually don't really have any category category for throughout the letter this that the priest represents humans in their weakness in their suffering in their hardship early in the letters y says you know we have a high priest who knows exactly a hardship and suffering because he himself experienced it so it's someone who is Advocate on behalf of his suffering hurting people that he represents and representing their concerns and their cares before God in the same way the prophets and the Easter thing so it's not about atonement it's about representation which was one of those things yeah it is recession intercession in representation
 okay let's form of the intercession that we talked about which was if you don't need intersection because of a moral failure but you still need intercession in that yeah just life is hard or maybe just don't know what to do yeah yeah there's confusion there's Roblox these things yeah so what this image of Jesus as the cosmic Royal priest interceding on behalf is what it means to believe in the Christian God is to believe that God has included within God's Own Self a representative of the human plight and the are lack of wisdom or inability to know what to do or paying these aren't external to God I guess that's the point of this
 God doesn't hear the cries of suffering Humanity has something to external the God's Own Self they are themselves a part of God's Own being in the person of the Risen Jesus who is making intercession on behalf of confused hurting humans in this present moment I think that's what this guy was in God's Own being is his ability to not only hear the intercessions but to understand them in an experiential way that you're saying or what Christians mean by the word god includes a human represents the concerns of humanity within the very being of God himself God has internalized the hardship and suffering of his creation into God's Own Self in the person of Jesus
 that's what it means to believe that Jesus is denied and that he exercises of intercession roll right now I'm on the house of creation the kind of speaks again to the relentlessness of God and that it creates Humanity I'm going to I Want You To Rule with me crazy idea it's not working and then for him to actually make it so that his nature now that what I hear you saying is now his nature is I don't know how to say it without sounding kind of radical but there's a human does humanist to to what it is to be God now that if Jesus Is God and Jesus is human and and God
 is interesting within himself the plight of humanity then the reason he's doing that is in order to have this relationship of this Union with humanity and it's right that actually like affected his nature is his commitment to us so strong that it changed who said that that's where sounds radical. Doesn't change but there's something about him that but there's something again we're we're back to the limits of what our language and categories can offer us a but I think this is part of what John is saying when he says that God is agape the God is love or earlier in the letter first Johnny talks about how Jesus is our Advocate before the father same idea and he's talking about a Divine being who doesn't just respond to the concerns of creation as a creature but I've actually internalized made creation apart
 cuz I'm being in it and it's rude Jesus has backing away from this phrase it got changed himself but if God incarnated is human and then that human transform into this this physical creature that now is both you know that change has been made is that human is part of what it means to be God now see that the right here yeah there has been a change there has been a change in that yeah God became God became we are tapping into now we're tapping into conversation is very ancient that gets us to the Trinity this is what everybody was trying to work out in the second third fourth all the way up centuries about wrapping our minds around implications of incarnation and this theme is royal priesthood brings you into the heart of it cuz what do priests do they are representations overlapping of Heaven in Earth
 in the Christian claim is the ascott the cosmic real priest God has become the human representative within Cuts himself
 I think I believe this you think you understand it or you think you believe I don't understand it this is the unique view of God that emerged out of the events surrounding Jesus it is very unique and I'm not like a expert and world religions by any means but it seems like a very unique yeah yeah so we're going to go from here talkin then so we talk about God seated at the right hand interceding on our behalf there's a sense of well what about us down here correct so one way to say it is we begin this conversation talking about the ideal role of the images of God in the heavens and earth Place Jesus is now according to the theme of the Ascension in the New Testament his Heavenly Resurrection body is in the Heavenly realm sitting as the Royal priest representing interceding that's on but the New Testament
 makes claims that Jesus has not left us he has an Earthly body through which he is doing all of those same activities here on Earth that correspond of what his resurrected bodies do in heaven and that body is called the body of Christ that is a temple and a priesthood empowered and in twelve by the spirit so that's what we will talk about next thank you everybody for joining us today on this episode of The Bible project podcast we've got one more episode that's going to come out in this series and we're going to go over some of the ideas elsewhere in the New Testament the talk about Jesus's followers as a royal priesthood or temples or even the body of Christ this is all Priestly vocabulary and offers this really amazing window into the Priestly world and themes in the story of the Bible if you want to submit a question for upcoming a question in response episode on
