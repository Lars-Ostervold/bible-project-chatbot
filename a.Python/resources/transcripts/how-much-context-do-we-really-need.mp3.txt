alright hello everybody Welcome to the Bible project podcast this is Tim and I'm here today not with John but with another member podcast team Chris Akron hello how are you today how about you were looking at each other on screen sitting in completely different places in quarantine for a while ones in June are resting and vacationing with his family doing what he should do as good dad and husband and so we get the opportunity to talk about these questions that people have stents in based on this long series we've been doing on how to read the New Testament letters so they know I'm excited talk about this with you caressa we talk about the stuff actually often but this is my first time having you on a Cuban our yeah yeah I'm really excited about it actually because it feels like I'm not
 just in conversation with you we're actually in conversation with our audience members which just seems really fun vacation so just a quick background for listeners Chris's been on Bible project team for about a year-and-a-half and you're a Biblical scholar on our team you are also in Hebrew Bible awesomeness
 and let's see you and that you've written and recorded one video and you got some more lined up witness last year and then this coming fall will have a bunch coming out on Exodus 34 character of God so some podcasts and some videos on that too but for now this is our final episode in the how to read the letters of the New Testament and we got a lot of great questions as always coming in from you are wonderful audience so that we start yeah let's do it okay let's start with the question from Timpson in Australia from Coalinga in Australia interpretation involves an understanding what the letters of trying to say is there still a role for devotional reading in our lives can I pick up my Bible and just read a few veces and meditate on them in prayer.
 and get value out of that without having to do a really intense Bible study was look up, trees and expert opinions and cultural stuff practical questions yeah I thought it'd be good to start with us because we have done a lot of really focused work on method and putting on kind of are are learning and study hats so to speak and I'm going to be read the letters so I think it is good to back up and to say that study intense study mode is of course not the only way to engage Bible I think it's an important way that it's important that we grow and but it's it's not the only way and I shall always appreciate this question even though I'm a Bible nerd I'm guessing you do to krissa because our our temperament is already given to the wanting to study the Bible into really intense way but it's important to say out loud that that's not the only way
 really like about this question is that it emphasizes integrating scripture into our lives in a devotional way so I think yeah maybe some people tend to much to study and not in a gratien but I think that like devoted study and devoted response to scripture have to go hand in hand so I do like that a lot about this question that emphasizes that maybe the Holy Spirit could be working through multiple ways as we read scripture about not seeing the Bible or the New Testament letters as a grab bag you know lots of inspirational one-liners I was not trying to say that you shouldn't look for amazing sentences and paragraphs and and memorize them in the letters I think that's actually really great idea I do it myself but the point is is when we are do it when we are reading and studying and not mowed to the neglect of reading a whole letter as a whole or at least trying to do some more reading which
 looking for the situational background that the letters written to I think then that's sorta like the car it's driving the horse what I want to get out of the letter is this not a charitable way to say it but it's my desires are what's driving the agenda for the letter as opposed to letting the author's agenda and what they're trying to say let let that drive how I read and engage with it so both modes are important that's what you're saying and I really found that too but yeah like being aware of the whole literary context and knowing that to really understand communication the more context we have the better this way it's just like a natural principle of cavitation if it's ancient communication then that requires a little more work I understand what you say says we have to figure out some other ways to get contact gas tank I want to know the genealogy of the word devotional as a way to describe a way of reading the Bible a devote devotional
 timer devotional reading yeah that is interesting people use it before and I think it refers to a certain way of reading the Bible that has developed I think in Europe in the West after the printing press named Liz sitting by yourself in the morning reading the Bible not in study mode but just in listening for something personal from God in about 10 to 20 minute chunks in the morning with a good side of that that may be is rooted in the word of the word devote like we're devoting our whole selves to God but I don't know if that's where that comes from it it really is that reflective listening but I think the dangerous side of that is that sometimes if we're doing devotional reading we're just really quick to jump to response or application without asking what
 was happening in the original letter or what what the context was that all you have to replace one mode of studying the Bible with another way of reading like what we're saying is we need a balance and as you balance a more contextual reading of the letters with a more of a personal or integrated you said earlier devotional reading what I think what you find is your own personal takeaways or the one liners that you do get you know from the New Testament letters they don't become less meaningful they become more meaningful because you actually know the the context of the paragraph of where verse occurs that I can think so let's see let's hear a question from Andrew who lives in Mexico hate image on my name is Andrew from Oaxaca Mexico and a past episode you mentioned that we shouldn't read the New Testament as a grab bag of inspirational verse
 so I was wondering if you could speak to the issue that on the surface it might appear too many people that the apostles themselves are doing that with the Old Testament I'm thinking of examples like oh death where is your sting and how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news I love you guys and appreciate all you do thanks so much
 yeah yeah speaking of a grab bag of inspirational one likes its related question there have been throughout history and there are even some new testament Scholars who when they look at how the apostles quote from their scriptures what we call what Christians call the Old Testament that they are often the collecting the original context just taking the words out and making them apply and say and do two things and it's not hard to actually see how people might draw that conclusion inspired by God to produce new writings some people think that gives them the authority to do that got me into understanding the history of the Bible because I know I still remember being a new Christian reading the New Testament and some somebody told me that yeah you know when they quote
 the first three quarters of the Bible he should pause which if you're reading a new testament letter and go look up the source of the quotation and so I just was like okay and it just made everything way more confusing but was cuz I think this is to your point Andrew I didn't understand off and how the context of in the Old Testament context how it related at all to something that Paul Peter where Jesus was saying but then also the wording was often different so the wording of the of the original quotation in its Old Testament contacts was often different than the wording at the Paul or Peter was quoting from it so it's just that fact that disconnect I didn't know what to do and next thing I knew it I was signing up for Greek and trying to figure out what the Septuagint is anyway this was this question has been driving a lot of my interest in biblical studies for a long time then I don't know. Do you have a
 history with this question Kristin I just think the New Testament he is of the old or even the ReUse of text in scripture with in scripture is a really really interesting and it's a huge field of study that Scholars devote all of their attention to so in my research on the Psalms and in my PhD I think one thing that came out of that that that kind of applies here it's not like an interpretive issue but just a really kind of fruitful rereading is that first line of Psalm 22 that Jesus says on the cross he says my God my God why have you forsaken me and he's quoting from Psalm 22 this limits on them and so for me when I read that I want to go back to Psalms 22 and read the whole thing and see what's going on in that solemn in what what Jesus means when he's saying that on the cross is he simply saying God has abandoned me or I feel abandoned
 are you saying something else then I think when we go back and read that whole song we see that some even occurs in a larger context where it's this Proclamation that the king the human King is going to suffer and he's going to be delivered and then God's kingdom is going to to start it's going to be inaugurated and all the nations are going to participate I Think Jesus is making an announcement in the moment but the only way that you see that is if you go back and you read read the whole song even even broader than the whole song so I think it can be super fruitful to go back and look at what's happening also really confusing because there are a lot of differences so I think we both when we go back way we look for what the meeting was in the broader context but also I think we see how the author might be using that text in a different way because maybe the author is like quoting from something that was really well known that they wanted use
 got to say something different yeah that's another fruitful way to study and this is true even when modern communicators are preachers quote from the Bible sometimes they do it with an a desire to unpack and help further understand what the meaning and purpose of the original in a passage was in the Bible but sometimes we also quote the Bible and it is we are quoting it as a a one-liner or quoting it to do something with it that's not necessarily contradictory to the original context but it's different we have a different goal may be quoting quoting something that's well-known to almost like acknowledge that point and then move it in another direction or add to it or yes I didn't pay no attention to both of the contacts and the difference can be really helpful I've come to the same conclusion nine times out of ten looking at how Paul or Peter or James quotes you know from the Old Testament if it does
 make sense or if I'm like how does they get that from this I have learned to just question myself and I understanding first not question their and in other words these were people who grew up steeped in these texts and they understand their hyperlinked nature and they understand the design patterns that work in the Bible in a far greater and more native way the others they grew up with in the tradition was most of us are what kind of pretty late to the game on how to understand the Old Testament and so you don't answer you brought up Paul's quote from Hosea 13 at the end of 1st Corinthians 15 oh death where is your sting you also mentioned Paul's quotation of sa-52 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news but man if you go and look at what each of those texts is doing and its larger cam position location in the whole scroll that it's in and in the hyperlinks of that passage of the context to other design patterns often times what the apostles are doing is there
 thinking of a whole hyperlinked set of tax or design patterns that goes throughout the whole Hebrew Bible and they are quoting from one of those in a way but drawing upon the significance of the whole hyperlink design pattern that's a good point yeah and so what we see is out of context and they're mine was just like you were saying the opening line of Psalm 22 on Jesus's lips is a trigger meant to evoke the entire poem and so when I'm making is just sometimes what's being activated is not just one passage but a whole network of passages so a great place to go that it's even titled in a way that is kind of similar to a question Andrew I think it's the edited volume by the New Testament scholar GK Beal on it's called the right Doctrine from the wrong text? The title studies on the New Testament or the old and so it's a whole collection of essays on different passages in the New Testament the quote from the Old Testament and surprising ways and the whole goal of the
 time is to say I actually the apostles know exactly what they're saying if I don't get what they're doing the problem is more likely with me than with them when I don't know there's this trust in the Brilliance of the biblical authors that they're leaving this literary Masterpiece and I'm going to try to figure it out I probably won't or may not succeed in my lifetime but they're just yeah literary Jenny says okay I kind of relates to another question that we got from Kaylee and South Africa so let's hear from her page on Anthem this is Katie from South Africa do you think that the gene tell Bonitas of the early church would have had any prior knowledge of Israel type of a Messiah before hearing the message of Jesus and how did they pick up the subtle references to the Hebrew Bible when they heard the latest being way too loud since I didn't grow up and burst in the scriptures thanks I'll let you guys do
 yeah I thought that was such an interesting question one level of the question is the apostles grew up in most in the scriptures of Israel and Hebrew or Greek sometimes both and so they often we've the language of the scriptures into their letters sometimes explicitly like you were talking about Andrew when they quote directly but other times we talked about this in the series will just leave in a phrase from Joe rephrase from the Psalms and not even mentioned that they're doing it they just aren't so the question is what did they expect of their audiences for the first time they read the letter they didn't read it but I heard it and so what would be people be expected to notice and then second what about non Israelites non-jews in the earliest movements of Jesus house churches what was their context for understanding the Old Testament and all that kind of stuff is a great question the apostles who are writing the way that they stink and talk even subconscious
 is influenced by this whole Hebrew scripture Paradigm in world view so it's coming out even when they don't mean to instruct people in that way just I think even that they will use as a phrase from scripture and they haven't explicitly marked it as being a quotation and so in that case it creates kind of a multiple layered experience where you might hear it and not notice but if you put in the time and really pay close attention and reread re-listen you will notice it and then you'll see it like I do it's like a little Easter egg that's been hidden there and we do this weather videos often where will word something in a way that you might just kind of here at and on the first hearing. That's interesting but I we craft every sentence of these video script write and try and bury a lot of layers into the meaning of the words so that people if they'd go back again and I
 settled allusions to the Old Testament work but this question of what did especially not in this Reliance Gentile Believers would they have had any prior knowledge of the hope for a messiah level is just how into Judaism where they there were a lot of converts to Judaism from non-israelite ethnic groups in the ancient past and then in Jesus and Paul but then they were also lots of what we just called god-fearers their present in the book of Acts where these would be just a you know a Greek or Macedonian and they're just really attracted to Judaism and its way of life in their communal life and so they go to synagogue in the hangout in the oratory observant as much as they can be and so there's probably a whole Spectrum but you know that's actually true in every church I've ever been a part of to the whole spectrum of people and their knowledge of the Bible or if Jesus teachings it's just very diverse and so
 he stands up and read from the Bible people are going to be hearing it at all different levels based on the different background a lot of people who wouldn't have picked up these references right away but maybe noticed that other people around them are getting it or saying oh yeah that's that's good and maybe those people would seek out some other people to talk to you or to or they will just continue their learning this question for me also brought up the idea of the original audience and what what we expect them to have understood and why that matters so I think for me I started thinking about how the original audience and how they understood and responded that's not where the meaning is found they were learning and growing just like we cannot contact so yeah we might have to work a little harder because we're also have a different cultural context but they weren't perfect interpreters either and that's good to remember
 1 * reading the Bible an historical context this phrase a couple different ways that might be phrase in terms of the author what did the author mean to communicate and they're contacting but I've also heard it stated what did the original audience understand you got to hold that you know kind of in the Mind's Eye it's part of the communication process so I guess that's helpful. Yeah that's right but we know from the Corinthian letters that even the original recipients often misunderstood what I was trying to say so their understanding understanding of the audience I can't shouldn't limit what the author was trying to do based on what we're reading and yeah I found this true of actually really great communicators that they can communicate too many audiences simultaneously so actually you know what Pixar movies work like this to kids adult movies
 my kids we had a Toy Story movie marathon in our house one weekend and they're so brilliant because the dialogue is all scripted pretty much for adults likes all of the cultural references and jokes but the language is also simple enough that kids can track with the basics of the plot line and so my seven-year-old my nine-year-old and I would be laughing you know it's multi-layered communication and I think good communicators know how to communicate to many audiences at once and I think that's how the apostles were trying to write okay let's speaking of residences and cultural context let's hear question from Toby in California hello Tim and John this is Toby from San Luis Obispo California have a question about knowing the cultural context of the letters so this is very helpful in understanding what the writers of the New Testament or saying and I really appreciate you guys going into it
 but I remember hearing that some hold of you that putting too much stock into historical context can taint your reputation their point was that knowing the cultural context is helpful but if a reader and say Papa New Guinea has everything they need to understand the Bible without the resources of cultural context then don't we also have everything we need to understand the letters this Viewpoint has challenged me for a long time and I wanted to get your take on it I enjoy your podcast so much thank you for all you do with this question actually I feel like historical reconstruction is so hypothetical sometimes it is more hypothetical then having a text in front of me with words that are concrete leave there to me it feels it feels more hypothetical or maybe there are a lot of options for understanding what was going on in the ancient world so I think I resonate also with the idea of
 understanding the Bible as a story and then the letter as a whole as being the number one thing that gives us the most may be the most payoff for understanding and interpretation not that that's the only the only contact we should pay attention to but there's a lot of payoff if we understand if we like immerse ourselves in the whole story so I think I resonate with that idea from this question I really do too and I'm actually familiar Toby with that view in fact that you and I were both really influenced one of our first kind of scholarly mentors Ray Lubeck but then also his professor John still have a Bible scholar had a really nuanced variation of that this vehicle that you're mentioning Toby that the primary context of meaning is the words in the text so I remember it was actually however as time went on that my understanding of the New Testament letters forced me to broaden my view on that matter
 and it was mostly because there were just so many details in the letters that are so puzzling are odd but then the moment you learned a bit about here's the role of women in 1st Century Ephesus or Roman culture or slavery in the first century world or how people down at the Pagan temples were also speaking in tongues and all of this it's like it turned my reading of the New Testament letters in particular into the 3D experience so to speak and so I think I just gained so much inside in the letters learning about cultural background in a way that's different than how I use cultural background information in reading the narratives of the reading the New Testament maybe bring need out a little bit more than reading the story of the Hebrew Bible maybe even just because we don't have a ton of other sources from that time. Like we do from the second
 people. And following yours will be my reasoning behind why it's a little bit different went with the New Testament Letters by definition are mail and correspondence and they're only one side of the correspondence and Soul by Nature that kind that genre of communication beg some background it forces you to at least recognize there's some background here but when you're thinking about the Big Stretch of narrative from Genesis to 2nd Kings 4 example that Big Stretch is primarily through repetition and literary Design & Design patterns that the meaning is communicated in a way that you could know nothing about ancient Babylonian whatever and just Regenesis to Kings for your lifetime free to someone and really really get what's going on yeah you could pick up on some of the conventions and the way that this ancient narrative works for the letters
 the letters on the biggest level of context that's why we start we had two videos on these letters in the first level of context is where are we in the story of the Bible
 and I think that's the primary the first and primary contact for the letters is how they fit into the early Christian Mission described an X and then how acts and the letters fit into the overall biblical story some people call that the canonical approach using the word biblical cannon cannon is an adjectives but it's just the biblical story context so I'm with you so you brought up you know they say there's a brand new Mission launched in a part of Papua New Guinea and they just got their brand new translation for the first time after the missionaries do the work do they have what they need to understand the Bible and so in that sense they do they have the scriptures in the scriptures provide the wrong context however there was another part of your question told me that they kind of got me thinking this is the way that you asked to do they have what they need to understand the Bible so sink from the earliest lot of the Jesus movement I think the Great Commission at the end of the Gospel of Matthew where Jesus sent out the apostles and says go to make
 Disciples of all Nations baptizing them and teaching them everything I have commanded and I'm with you to the empty yet so another words ideally in the in the apostles in the Bible goes along with the church as it goes out into the world so that it's a non ideal situation if people are encountering the Bible apart from a local church or a local community that you need the community to make sense of what's in the truck and you need to book to make sense of why this community is doing what it's doing in the apostles Vision every local church like a seasons for should have a Bible note in a few things for the Apostle evangelist Pastor everybody has to be a healthy local church will have somebody in it it's it's fully equipped to do with the spirit needs a church to do still have some Bible notes and so in theory a local community of Jesus should always have Within
 self some resource to help people read the Bible better I think on ideal vision and so in that sense I do think I hope somebody in Papua New Guinea has everything they need to read the letters cuz I do you know whoever planted planted that church should have on their minds like we need to bring it raise up some Bible notes here to help people I don't know just one thing that occurred to me I don't know if I like that and I think it's this idea to this having everything we need to understand that is challenging me right now maybe even the way that I think about reading and studying scripture sometimes I get into this mindset of Mastery of like okay I'm going to understand it. I'm going to know it at some point you know and I know it's it's just such a long process of meditation of reflection of learning all of the different layers of context of practice of reading with the tradition
 the Traditions that have gone before everything with the church and understanding all of that so I just think you're understanding is a long process that takes a lot of resources and we shouldn't be discouraged by that but I mean we should dive in but just be on the path toward toward understanding through meditation and through study and Community interpretation for the rest of our lives is not something here in America even where were may be spiritually fat and resource by everything we've access to like do I have everything I need to understand the scriptures I don't know I don't know if I have the mental capacity to understand you know it's an interesting question that's challenging me a little bit and also the you that is doing the understanding is also changing and growing over time and so the you the you that did your dissertation on the 2nd of Psalms 15 to 24 is a different you than the you sitting here today so you could go read and study the songs now
 and I'm certain you would notice a new thing I know the light of every the rest of your understanding that's why it's hard to publish things cuz you don't want to understanding is a lifelong Dynamic process and our understanding of the scriptures is ever deepening and also based on our resources who around us and what we know of the culture you know study and all of that so yeah that's a good question different domain from San Jose is fascinating to hear Kim Jong talk about how the letters were produced I'm just wondering has written several letters from prison how can he carry out such an elaborate process from prison thank you
 and I'll just say you know I rather a small stack of books to kind of learn more in preparation for these conversations in the videos about one passage they gave me a little window into this or someone's like I think it was from Murphy O'Connor's book that we I quoted from a few episodes ago at the end of 2nd Timothy which is the last correspondence from Paul and he's in prison and in the letter he makes clear he's pretty certain he's he's not going to survive the imprisonment that he's going to be executed in some way but in chapter 4 he starts you doesn't he normally doesn't last paragraphs which is kind of old traveled communication details to and from the steam button 2nd Timothy 4 verse 9 he says to Timothy I'll make every effort to come to me soon because Dimas loves this present world and he abandoned me he went to thessalonica and Crescent has gone to galatia Titus to Dalmatia only Luke is here with me so pick up John Mark and bring it with you
 helpful for me oh yeah and took a kiss I sent to Ephesus this is saying I'm I'm lonely here and if I only have Luke for company but notice what he saying bring all these people with you and then he says when you do come bring the cloak I left at 3 last night which makes do we don't know what time of year he's writing but some people infer from this that it's winter and there was no HVAC heating and air conditioning in Rome in prisons and bring the Scrolls especially the parchments so here's Paul sitting in a prison but he's fully interacting with his Network people coming and going and also resource is coming and going and also booked a letter writing materials coming and going Scrolls and parchments so we should not infer what we know about high-security prisons from our cultural setting to this and there's a whole spectrum of Roman imprisonment and people do their dissertations on this but Paul was often under different levels and
 present moment and food services and most Roman prisons another words people were fed by their friends remember so it doesn't seem like his imprisonment would completely stopped his letter writing activity so what he has been working with a scribe then during that time too so he mentions Luke is with him and the same Luke connected to the authorship of Luke acts so obviously it looks pretty literate so Paul was never alone and he always worked with a large constantly moving Network and they were resources moving around and so there were the means for him to be writing and composing letters with scribes and with his co-workers even while he was imprisoned it's interesting what you just read that John Mark is he calls him
 I spoke to him he wants to continue doing his ministry and he's found John Mark to be super helpful in that so you have Paul's Paul's definitely doing stuff from prison how to make sense then why he's so thankful for the support of the church communities during this time in prison because he can keep doing what he feels like he's called to do just that you got a gift from them and that's what's supporting him if he's in prison he mentions at the end of Ephesians he mentions I'm going to send tychicus to you yeah exactly that's what the whole point times in prison didn't limit his activity is missionary activity his delegation or his letter writing if you're interested in this some more just again that the two books I mention by Jerome murphy-o'connor and Randolph Richards I learned so much if you really want to no doubt just follow their footnotes in their books and out the whole world the first century letter writing won't open up before you
 oh yeah well you just actually list out the Epistles Paul wrote from prison because there's this whole section called the prison Epistles he wrote quite a few oh that's right within the letter of Paul talks about being in prison or Ephesians Philippians Colossians and Philemon is really close relationship cuz they're sent to the same house churches in class A so that have those are those are the ones we were talking about 4:00 and then second Timothy so Thais nicely into Ruben's question from England and John I'm Raven and I'm a listen to from London England I've left the series on the episodes especially episode 8 on how the lettuce Romaine my question is do you think that the stylistic contribution of the country might go a long way to explaining the differences that leads Scholars to think that some of Alice's are not authentic report on such as Ephesians and Colossians thanks
 previous episodes you talked about how when Paul or anybody wrote Epistles they had a scribe or a group of scribes that was riding with them or a group of co-authors of Silas or Timothy goes even beyond the describes the other co-authors and scribes or the team the production team even though it's written in Paul's voice and it has his he's responsible for it he names these other people as part of the production team for the Letter's content such as we should expect them that the letters do sound a little bit different because essentially we have different human authors are multiple human authors and of the question is you know some Scholars think some of the letters are not authentically from from Paul and so that's true actually going back into a little earlier than the 18th century but not much
 satin strands of European biblical scholarship people began number of Scholars began to kind of make judgment calls that certain letters didn't actually come from Paul but maybe from a second generation of his disciples but written as if it were from him it's on that list are usually Ephesians in Colossians sometimes 2nd Thessalonians and then the Pastoral letters usually First Timothy and Titus and then sometimes also 2nd Timothy have all been putting the question some point and it's a super complicated that I have tried to follow and understand and then I kind of became uninterested once I learned about this other Paradigm cuz I think you're right and intuiting it Ruben I think you're right Chris has the idea that just because a letter sounds different uses different vocabulary and is making different points or written a different sounding voice that is not a sufficient
 Nation for saying therefore it can't possibly be by Paul so an in actually I've heard explanations for Ephesians Ben witherington a scholar who has really does sound different for example the tone a lot of vocabulary in town from you no say collations or something but he was just reading something recently Ephesians more than any of his letter says he's a complicated run on sentences and Greek and there's a certain style of writing and it's called Asiatic Greek it was a form of oratory was a form of speech giving it was very, in certain subjects altars in the Roman Empire and Paul's writing to that part of the Roman Empire and so who you think's Paul's writing in that mode there's lots of reasons for why the letters can have different tones and seems to them also the age that he's writing a like his letter when when he's younger versus older those are probably going to sound different
 your first paper you wrote in college or if he's writing a personal letter like pastoral or correct there are so many reasons you're right so I'm with you I think the idea of secretaries and scribes co-authors go a long way to explaining the diverse sounding voices of the letters either either between the two letters for Peter I would really different sounding Town between them and the Twin Falls post different letters a lot of the history for why certain letters were pointed out to subpoena being potentially not from Paul it was sometimes about vocabulary and style differences but it was often about see a logical differences when the most famous ones was it in Romans Paul's hope for the resurrection in Romans chapter 8 is Tudor creation is Longing To Be redeemed the freedom of the sons of God in the glory and so on but if you read Ephesians and Colossians he talks about Resurrection
 in the past tense you all have been raised up and seeded with the Messiah in the Heavenly Realms and so there were some Scholars who said that view of Resurrection is so disconnected and different it can't have come from the same mind and there's a lot of Scholars now who see that is so ridiculous because what we're doing is we're saying oh we are the ones with the complete picture of what Paul thought about things as opposed to saying we'll maybe our understanding of resurrection and Paul is wrong like maybe he has different ways of expressing one idea or it's correct maybe he has a view of the Resurrection that it is future but there's also a present reality to it I mean it seems like that idea of future or a present res Resurrection comes up even in the letter to the Romans in in chapter 6 step count yourselves now dad to send but alive and resurrected with Jesus you actually are so alive that you can live a new life so
 yeah that's what you're saying so I become a skeptic of the skepticism about the authorship of Pauline letters I I think it's far more likely that Paul is actually behind the letters attached to his name but that doesn't mean he sat down and put the ancient quill to the school if they aren't authentically Pauline does that mean that they're not authentic as scripture or are there are also other options there if we're saying the holy spirit is only allowed to work through one person the Apostle by the mode of directly putting the quill to the paper or dictating to one scribe who does it all at one go and then it sent off that's the only way the Holy Spirit can work and there I just want to let you know we asked like why are we limited how the spirit
 work through the apostles to generate these texts to give instruction to Jesus followers the letters themselves give evidence that there was a more diverse process than that that's really all we're saying so if anything it's I want to question my assumptions about why the holy spirit is limited to certain means of text production rather than other otherwise interesting it is super interesting about how we appropriate the teaching of the Apostles in the letters in our contact you today let's let's hear from Elizabeth in Georgia Atlanta Georgia you mentioned that the New Testament letters are not written to us but have they given for us with the context that Romans was written regarding the social unrest surrounding the Gentile Christians and the Jewish Christian how can we best apply the lessons Paul writes the Roman to the social unrest and injust
 it has permeated our culture today
 yeah really thoughtful question yeah yeah really good question I forget what episode in the series that was where we talked about the situation in context of Romans so just to see that up real quick both from clues in the letter and then also Clues from the book of Acts and then also from Roman cultural historical context what we know is using general were expelled from wrong but the Roman historian suetonius says it's because of Jews connected to unrest civil unrest related to a certain Christus what he says it's almost certainly about social tensions maybe even riots that often surrounded Paul in there the Christians that were happening in Rome related to the controversy of the Jesus in the message about him caused in synagogues and so once you have a Messianic Jews expelled from Rome with Luke even though
 that happened by Emperor Claudius and I need Luke chapter 18 so they come back after a decade or so and then come back to these house churches that have been entirely Gentile I mean they're having ham sandwiches you know nobody circumcised and will be pick up from Romans is that even these churches are now divided along racial lines cuz they're a lot of the names that he listened Romans 16 so that the house churches are split up into Greek and Latin and Jewish so another words Paul wrote the letter and crafted his argument about the gospel precisely to address as you put it Elizabeth social unrest in division between two different ethnic groups in the body of Christ how can we apply the lessons from Romans to today how can we not apply the essence of romance I mean my goodness yeah I think it starts by asking that question of where do we experience
 it's that kind of division or fragmentation today and that definitely accursed a&i variety of areas race gender power status economic status values yeah I mean important step forward for me and I mentioned in Romans chapter 14 and 15 where he really starts addressed the whole books message to the situation contacts he uses different vocabulary to describe these groups at odds with each other in chapter 14 NIV uses the phrase he calls those who have faith and then he talks about those who are a week or we can Faith but then in chapter 15 he uses different vocabulary he uses the Greek words I do notice a nod to Natomas the powerful and the non powerful they're often translated as the strong and the non strong but their social status
 is talking about people who have a privileged powerful social status and a people who have a minority underprivileged status with maybe language we would you do even that the face description that's a status description there whether someone believes that faithfulness and bleeding allegiance to Jesus is the only criteria for being a part of the family of Abraham or if they also believe that circumcision or keeping kosher salad is what qualifies you and he's made it earlier in the letter his views on that issue clear but what is noting is that what a lot of non-jewish followers of Jesus are doing is what he says showing contempt for their Jewish brothers and sisters who have a low social status and they're dividing the church so I think the way that we let Paul's letter before us is to begin to adopt an imagination
 play where do I see the body of Christ do I see churches that won't talk to each other or even more churches were some people who have a higher Social Status and have certain Privileges and then churches of a different ethnic groups who have lower social status and not only are they at odds but the people with higher Social Status are actually creating the problem we're adding to the problem or going on blithely as if there is no problem right that's the tissue he's dressing and you're like oh my goodness I can't think of a more accurate description of the church in America than that description right there and it has to do with race has to do with socioeconomic class it seems to me at maps on pretty powerful a people divided nowadays it's not really surprising to me I'm going to bring up Scott McKnight's other book blue parakeet and his description of the story of scripture is one that moves from one
 nest and mutuality between God and Humanity among humanity and then it moves to other nsor fragmentation and then back to Oneness that's the aim everything's again being unified as a hole through Jesus and so it's not surprising to me that in almost all the letters and our current Day Contacts one of the biggest problems around us is this the other nicer fragmentation that we're dealing with its like the main goal of what God wants to bring about in his and his family and so it is it's like the issue it's not it's not just one I guess what's interesting is Paul calls upon what he calls the powerful he calls them to make the first move and to the humble themselves and what he says is to receive but non powerful on their own terms and to respect them on their terms
 another word Paul doesn't just say well just be unified and it's it's not to the Erasure It's Not By ignoring these social differences it's actually by the powerful recognizing that they are privileged and that they should humble themselves and try to elevate their brothers and sisters who don't have that same status so that they can together discover what it means to be a community that unified in Jesus unlike all of the those same groups divided out outside of the church really get the division of how radical the social implications were of the unity in Christ of the Paul was so passionate about and but for some reason I don't know Paul's letters haven't been understood or read in that way at least very often in the history of Europe and America well I am just thinking about what you said yeah so it's not just putting on this purse this New Perspective that
 sometimes it's this is the way collations 328 is sometimes read that there actually isn't any difference between ethnicity or gender is or anything anymore but it's it's doing something about the inequalities between different groups so yeah I like this question by Elizabeth a lot because she's saying we need to do something and we do so I think in this cultural moment it's really apparent that there is a lot of social unrest and Injustice and I don't know I think trying to figure out what to do is more question that we figure out in our own context with the people around us we asked like how can we create Unity as individuals within our personal relationships in our smaller community and in our world who are the vulnerable around us the power list how can we listen to them and respond
 Caspian many churches throughout the the Portland area but there is an organization Luis Palau organization and then it's kind of Kevin Palau it's been a real encouragement and support for the Bible project for a lot of years and he's kind of a convenor of church leaders in Portland when it comes to kind of issues that affects the church Portland and their organization did something really cool they what they gathered was a panel of almost entirely African-American pastors here in the city a webinar there are a lot of people at the webinar it was just like a two-hour block to just listen for a predominantly white pastures in Portland to just listen to their brothers and sisters who are also in ministry here in Portland and just hear what the last few months have been like for them their families and their communities and what I saw came out of that is an ongoing all these other little groups that are spinning off where these different pastors Ministry leaders on that panel
 are now kind of meeting regularly with these other new groups of predominantly white pastures to just help them keep learning about what it means to for the church to be a part of healing and providing grounds for healing in our community so I thought it was really cool application it seems to me that's the kind of thing that a contextual reading of the letter to the Romans should Inspire we should look for parallel scenarios to Galatians or Philippians 4 Romans in our culture and then let the spirit lead us into doing in our setting what Paul and the apostles were trying to do in there next time and place by this is part of why is all the way back at the beginning of the series that the New Testament letters even though their proportionately not a huge part of the Bible they have disproportionate influence because of who the written by and the we live in the same moment of the story as the apostles do but in a different
 crocheting and so how you navigate that difference to church has been trying to figure that out for a long time under the guidance of the spirit in the years-long podcast series on how to read the Bible and this was the final how to read video how to read the letters and that was only buying for well yeah but three years the conversations on the podcast and the videos were going to give John a high-five building sand castles with his kids all around for you listeners you hung in there with us or you joined us somewhere along the Journey of start unless you could actually just go to our website if you just Google like Bible project and how to read the Bible you might get her videos but if you go to a website buy a project, you can look up the whole series we have all kind
