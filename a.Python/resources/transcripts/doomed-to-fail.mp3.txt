the story of the burning bush it's famous in the Bible is where Moses meets the god of Abraham he learns God's name Yahweh and then he's commissioned to rescue the family of Abraham from slavery in Egypt this story has another contribution to the biblical narrative that's often overlooked and that is the introduction of Aaron brother of Moses the first priest of Israel and his introduction it's really a concession so I do work through the story God essentially makes this Mission tells him to go confront pharaoh and Lead Israel out of Egypt and Moses objects 5 * Moses doesn't want to go and he keeps telling God that he doesn't want to do it with all these excuses and finally got had enough and he introduces a solution let's give Moses a sidekick his brother Aaron the levite why is he called a levite in the fur
 time Aaron is mentions right here this is Moses's brother certainly what's happening here we're naming his tribe because this is the tribe that will play the role of the priesthood God tells Moses and Aaron to go get the Elders of Israel and for all of them together to go before Pharaoh but as we read on that's not what happened instead they go on their own not obeying God's command The Narrative is designed an interesting way Aaron gets introduced and then the first thing Erin does of the character just go with Moses before Pharaoh which is not what God Said and what results more suffering for the Israelites so that's it that's the entrance of Aaron the first priest of Israel into the story and as the story continues things don't get any better in fact it's Aaron who's responsible for building the golden calf the Epic story of Israel's failure the narrator wants us to see this is origin story of the priesthood and you just have to stop and be like
 glamorous beginning and this is going to just keep continuing it seriously the Hebrew Bible could not be more critical of Israel's priesthood from its moment of Origins and every step through I'm John Collins the Bible project podcast we're in the third episode in the series on priests in the Bible and today we look at the origins of Israel's Priestly line thanks for joining us.
we're talking about the theme of a type of role of vocation would you call it yeah it's a type of role that humans are called to be the beginning of the Bible story but after the human failure and Folly only Some Humans end up playing part of this role throughout the biblical story The Priestly role in the Bruce Leroy call is a human who stands at the bridge of Heaven and Earth and canned bring another human in a bouncer of sorts
 bouncer keeps you out yet it's somebody who represents you a partial in LG would do something like an elected representative like a senator you know where a region or state elect a representative and they go on behalf of the many to go before the ultimate seat of authority in decision-making and they do that in a specific Place presents yes they are the role that they play is bound up with a Sacred Space that is set apart as a little model of Eden of Heaven on Earth being the Tabernacle or the temple so this is what I learned from a conversation so far he has a role we call the image of God which is that we reflect God's nature and we actually are to be his representative ruling on his behalf in
 though the language of image which is the same word use for idle statues is more than just our concept of represent for the biblical authors there's a alert meaning of embodiment of the physical embodiment of the one that they let us the category we don't have right I mean I don't have that category are either image or child like the Son of God the sun being the image of the father that's an analogy worked out in Genesis 5 where the sun Steph is the image of his parents in the opening verses of Genesis chapter 5 so Seth is the image of Adam and Adam and Eve are the image of God in that Seth has the same DNA it's not just like one person is just appointed as a representative but they are actually
 issue from an are an embodiment of the very being I don't think of my kids as an embodiment of me that's what they are. They are literally an embodiment of what from you and your wife that's
 okay so they are my image according to Genesis 5 verses 1 to 3 and so that's what I'm supposed to be thinking about in terms of humans divine nature there's something passed down to us there's something that we are and are called to do what does it mean for an Elohim for being to make a human in his likeness then the image image which is the real statue in bodies and represent and then the narrative image be given in the Eden story is of a dirt creature that is animated by Divine breath the image means a marriage of Heaven on Earth so what set apart the human in the Eagan store is the breathing in the the Breath of God so in Genesis 2 you're saying we're supposed to get this picture of
 humans being a real hybrid creature correct of heaven and heaven and left and it's part of it's bound up in the role the job descriptions let them Rule and have responsibility for but being called an appointed as the image is what sets in Genesis 1 humans apart from the other creatures what be on the roll though is there I mean this has been the million-dollar question throughout the history of interpretation like what the biblical authors are interested in this not unpacking the image as a concept but for them the image is what humans are which means that all of these Priestly figures that I meet in the Hebrew Bible are all part of a mosaic set of characters who at go back to that ideal Genesis one but then also fail at it and all these ways that we're going to look at those we start looking at Moses and Aaron we looked at how Adam and Eve the vocabulary
 of them in Genesis two is connected to this Priestly roll twerking keeps Garden or to set the wards and then we looked at and we look at the hell Adam and Eve and the garden is all described as this Proto Temple anticipating the later architecture vice-versa architecture of the temple re-creates the geography of you actually the way I feel is the micro eaten or a symbolic eating okay that's a couple becomes the correct ball at Camp Eden sacramental yes right of the humans from eaten since sets up a major narrative tension of but eating is where the good stuff is so somehow we got to find a way to either get the good stuff of Eatin out to people or get the people
 back into access of the eaten so enter screen write is Abram who God says I'm going to give the Eden blessing to you and your family yes and then you're going to bring the Eden blessing to the whole world and for those who pronounce God's blessing upon you Abram I'm going to hook up that person then they're going to get the blessing come back at them is that detail important to this theme it is for understanding why milk is attack is so significant later in the Bible he is the place one roll yeah but it's that little line of The Blessing of Abraham in Genesis 12 those who bless you God says I will give the blessing to and then two chapters later we're introduced to somebody who's the first character in the Bible who blesses the line of Abraham and it's a priest-king of Canaanite Jerusalem who worships God
 by the by the title El elyon The God Who is the most high God the creator of skies in the land who is a whole mystery there yeah how did this guy come from how do you learn about Yahweh I want to do my homework but there is a whole story people filled in all kinds of details hear some people think that it's sham a sham for Noah son is quite a long time I forget how many years it's a lot of years and some people think it's sham by another name for the milk is attacked learned of the Creator God by being a disciple of Shem and his Rabbi school but the point is is no kids attack just comes out of the gates and he's a worshipper of the stains out of a zey from and so and then the streak app that really quick Abraham gets caught up in this bag
 yes please like five Kings against four other kings in order to save his nephew and he does and then he's got all the Splendor and then we got story of two kings that come to him the king of Sodom Sodom and then the king of Shalem who is Melchizedek and Abraham is just so taken aback he gives milk is a deck 10% yeah and because of that is described as a priest to priest a priest king of Yahweh or El elyon and then you get the story right after that the king of Sodom trying to like negotiate some plunder from Abraham and as well and again that story is important why we lock in that story away is the first figure named a priest in the Bible and he combines these roll
 balls that are going to be mostly separate they're going to be separate than Israel and we have a royal priest king of Jerusalem bringing out eating blessing and feast to the one that God has blessed and it raises the question well God said I'm going to bless those who bless you this Royal priest Melchizedek just blessed Abraham I wonder how God's going to bless me cuz that I wonder when that blessing is going to come to fruition at some point in the biblical story and this whole narrative is planted here as an anticipation of something that's going to come way later up in the story of David colon here on purpose the two narratives where Abraham Abraham comes into the vicinity of Jerusalem than the other one is where all right on called Abraham Abraham and Isaac and their Abram plays with the Priestly roll and that he's the one doing the sacrifice he goes up to the hilltop is to offer up the life of his son at the test of his faithfulness
 and he does it and then got it in the last moment provide the substitute on that Hilltop and then the narrator speaks up and says hey dear Israelite reader you know at the temple that down the mountain of Yahweh where substitutes are offered for Israel sins everyday that's all got started here at that moment the story right here and then the nearest pick up again that's right and so did land for me or talk about that these two narratives together create a really cool portrait we're looking forward to a place that in that place there's going to be this king and a priest who will generate blessing and also there's got to be some sort of form of obedience and sacrifice to get back to the Eden blessing and extreme type of surrender I mean this Narrative of Abraham
 surrendering his son is the most extreme sweater you can imagine correct me misses his lineage this is his hope for that the way that they achieved that sun for themselves yes was through a whole set of schemes that hurt other people is it actually the same thing with the tree of knowing good and bath right God wants humans to have this knowledge they're going to rule the world the question is how did they go about getting it and that's the question before then we leave the Abraham story thinking we want I get back to Eden of Royal priest was our most recent kind of like a narrative image of somebody who can give the goodies of eating out here even when were exiled and somehow our sins the sins of this family are going to need to be covered for that eaten blessing to be given to All Nations so let's keep reading and see who we meet along the way
 so we move forward and we just have to unfortunately for this theme mostly skip story of Jacob and Joseph and his brothers not cuz they're not relevant but cuz I want to get us to Moses and Aaron going to Moses instead of Moses and Aaron
 let's set up the steam a family of Jacob has become 70 people that went down to Egypt at the end of the book of Genesis and they're living with Joseph that whole generation dies these rights are fruitful and multiply and then Pharaoh a new Pharaoh king of Egypt arises and he does not bless the people he treats them as cursed he wants to enslave them and kill them and so we remember the promise to Abraham those who bless you will be blessed like milk is a deck but those who curse you treat you as cursed like pharaohs doing now God's will give the same treatment and so stepek Story the third attempt the Pharaoh makes to destroy this family is to throw their baby boys into the water and it's precisely that tactic that is his downfall because the one of those baby boys floats ride into his house so Moses grows up and we're going to start the story in Exodus chapter 3 where he
 fled from Egypt and he's out in the wilderness shepherding the flock of his new father-in-law who is the priest Jethro called the priest of Midian is what is called is actually at the end of Exodus chapter 2 Moses fled Egypt and he went to a well and he sees seven women they're all sisters drawing water and there's some bad Shepherds who want to come do something to these women and Moses rescue them and runs off the Bad Shepherds and their dad is so stoked his name is Jethro and you were told he was the priest of the midianites where would they live their living kind of in that region between the Dead Sea and Egypt which is kind of what we would call the southern desert of Israel and the upper part of the Sinai Peninsula and the midianites are part of the family of Abraham they come from Abraham
 wife third wife after Sarah died has commenced Keppra Shepherds what does it mean to be a priest yeah the Gateway between the Divine and human but there was no like I mean he didn't have a tabernacle or did he or a temple of God okay now he'll come up again in the story again cuz in chapter 18 after the accident happened and he hears about it he comes to confess Yahweh as the one true God and so the priest of Midian becomes the priests of Yahweh before is even the Israelite priesthood exist and you sweet now he's got to non-israelite priests who are legit before we sew an Exodus chapter 3 and 4 Moses is now married into the family of Jethro the priest of Midian and this is where the burning bush scene so I do work through the story
 God essentially makes this commission that tells him to go confront pharaoh and Lead Israel out of Egypt and Moses objects 5 x 5 Jackson and God answers each of those objections in a row four of them using the phrase I will be which this is the story where God Reveals His name am I am I will be where I am what I am really cool how the story work so you don't want me to do this job. God says I will be with you I'll be with you who am I I will be with you that's what matters is that you are one that I went second one is what's your name so that's the revelation of the Divine name I will be
 I will be here and then served as what what if they don't believe me listen to me these multiple signs of like the staff that turns into a snake and this third of Jackson doesn't have a I will be no objections are arranged in the school symmetrical pattern here because I'm heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue but God says is I will be with your mouth his fifth objection need to straight up says send somebody else
 the real motivator is that Moses to straight up doesn't want to do this he doesn't want to do it I need to try to think of all the reasons the Djinn another for the anger this is the first time that God gets angry in the Bible was the first narrative or God is described as angry if you read from Genesis ones where God gets angry at somebody so good next page this is crucially important because it's this moment that introduces the priesthood into Israel so it starts in Exodus 4 verse 13 Moses said Lord send the message by whoever else you will send somebody else and the anger of Yahweh burned against Moses and he said isn't there your brother Aaron the levite he speaks well
 moreover he's coming to meet you right now and when he sees you he'll be happy so you speak to him and put words in his mouth and I will be with your mouth and now with his I'll teach you what you were to do that he will speak for you to the people so this could have been a moment of great honor for Moses Moses could be the one directly communicating God's will to Farah a human could embody and what that human speaks is this story may be in the image of God explained to me I think while you're getting a here which is Moses could have been the one who directly talked to God now Erin is one on Moses his behalf
 is a priest yes I'm Moses and Aaron happens to be a levite which is the tribe of that will come here the first time does the first time Aaron is mentioned her son of Levi Levi but this is Moses's brother like Moses doesn't need to know what tribe belongs to brother Moses is a certainly what's happening here we're naming his tribe because this is the tribe that will play the role of the priesthood yeah that's what I'm saying it's a narrative strategy by calling him Aaron the levite is the narrator wants to draw attention to this is the foundation of the levite category of the priesthood this is like an origin story of sorts The Narrative wants us to see this is the origin story of the priesthood and you just have to stop and be like man this is not a very
 I just keep continuing seriously the Hebrew Bible could not be more critical of Israel's priesthood from its moment of Origins and every step through a confession out of his anger that's right and what I'm saying is this critical portrait is going to continue with Aaron's failure of the golden calf with the failure of his sons the moment they set up the 10th or the kiss they blow it and then we're going to meet a descendant of Aaron down the line a guy named Eli who allows his to corrupt Priestly Sons to steal people's offerings and they're having sex with women like in the courtyards at Berne a call this is the depiction of the Israelite priesthood in Heber 5 so somebody's got an agenda here to tell us that the ideal that the priests of the supposed to represent is good but that the institution of Israel's priesthood from its origin moment never fully attend to that it was a compromised project from its beginning
 The Scholar Joshua Matthews the first put this on my radar and you have a book called milk alternative Priestly order for the whole chapter just on the depiction of the priesthood of the Levites in the Old Testament is Aaron's first introduction into The Narrative of the pentateuch comes in conjunction with you always Burning Anger as a concession from Moses's faithless resistance do you always instructions Moses is punished for his unwillingness to accept his commission and is likewise denied the honor that would have come with it the glory of fulfilling the task no longer belong to Moses alone but we shared in part by his brother Aaron the author is portraying the scenario as gradually deviating from what Yahweh and nationally and visit or what the ideal scenario might have been had Moses not responded with such resistance which is similar to a Genesis
 to their daddy Ryan and so the fact that this very conversation with god is happening on a sacred high mountain by a tree burning with the light and life of God's presence this is a replay of the garden this is his first test which is to trust God this is messed up things get even more complicated with Erin is you read on into chapters 3 through 5 what God tells is on page 18 in chapter 3 God says to Moses he says you go and gather the Elders of Israel and then you with Elders of Israel go to the king of Egypt and say Yahweh the god of the Hebrews met with us let us go to worship Our God so what's this thing with Aaron happens what Moses actually does is he gets the Elders of Israel together but then he leaves them behind and
 is he and Aaron go before Pharaoh that makes sense he doesn't obey the command he doesn't do what God told him to do God said go to the king of Egypt with the elders he leave the others behind and just he and Aaron go and what happens is that Pharaoh gets ticked off and angry and says like who are you you're lazy your people are lazy and so he imposes its the whole thing of life more bricks less draw higher quotas less raw materials and this meeting where Moses didn't do what God said he goes with Aaron and stuff actually creates more conflict and more suffering for the Israelites The Narrative is designed an interesting way and then the first thing Erin does the character is go was Moses before pharaoh who does not what God Said and what results more suffering for the Israelites does that make sense so you've already seen like okay Aaron's a concession yes
 then you're like well great we got Aaron yes and then God says okay Aaron Moses take the elders go confront pharaoh and then we watch Aaron our New Hope like not follow the directions correct and that God says take the elders and go and then it just says and Moses and Aaron went not look outside and then as a result is Pharaoh that's right and so when they meet the elders again is when they leave Pharaoh's court and the elders have just gotten their new instructions about more bricks last straw and so then there's a conflict that was just get mad and they're angry at Moses the first Priestly Israelite Priestly characters are in the Levites is not it's not starting out there's more details to it but that's just
 so Aaron continues to play this kind of odd roll through the store here we're all here. Certain moments but it's always the weirdness like this it just keeps continuing and so fast forward through the Exodus ten plagues super exciting. Bring a hammer Moses was put into the waters to die by fairouz order but God rescues them as a baby handsome final conflict between God and Pharaoh is Pharaoh dies in the waters while the Israelites a rescued led by Moses a rescue through the waters big poetic pattern if the story is ended the way it began that goes through the Wilderness and Moses and the Israelites and they go to the same Mountain where God Moses at the burning bush and the way God shows up now before the people is not in the tree if it's on fire it's just the top of the mountain is on tired I was just thunder lightning clouds fire
 summarizing Moses is called up and you kind of drink Brokers this Covenant partnership ceremony the God wants to get married to these people and the first thing God says that the people is rescue to out of Egypt and if you listen to my voice and keep the Covenant I will make ya'll a kingdom of priests both roles together a set of Royal priests and it's come as a collective of kings and queens who stand at the Gateway Between Heaven and Earth between y'all in the nation
 a lot of responsibility in all your neighboring people groups the priests they all priests write a message in normal because we all have their ideas of who God is and how to worship God and there's this General human sentiment that we need one person to do that on their behalf and so that category exists and God saying that category that's going to be your role as an entire people group not just for yourself actually for everyone even the other priests who think they're doing in there at the foot of the Sacred Mountain you know that the life with the power and presence of God so this is very much a it in the narrative flow this is a whole group of people being invited
 it always pays to ya in a three dogs buy new Eden type of opportunity to become the faithful image of God to the Nations that all Humanity was made to be best for the high point so at the end of chapter 24 of Exodus some page 19 Moses goes up onto the mountain and the cloud is covering the mountain the glory of Yahweh rested on Sinai the cloud covered it for 6 days thank Genesis 16 days and then on the 7th Day Moses goes up into those clouds he's ascending into heaven Moses is going to happen metaphorically and literally in terms of the lord of the sky the scene yeah that's right and the eyes to the eyes of the sons of Israel the appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like the burning bush to fire consuming on the Mountaintop and so Moses goes up into the cloud on the mountain and he was there 40 days and 40 nights which 48 days of 49
 is connected to wandering right is actually this is one of the first times that appears okay it's often a period of waiting or testing waiting for testing in this case it's going to be a period where Israel have to trust and they said they failed us right here and what follows now is a long Divine speech from the 57 chapters of all the Tabernacle instructions were priests will work the exact is divided up into seven speech act another where's the phrase and God said if your seven times has chapters and the whole of these Tabernacle instructions are elaborately crafted in these beautiful symmetrical patterns and they what they do is highlight comparisons and connections between the different parts of my point here is at the center of the Tabernacle instructions is a whole chapter
 dedicated to describing the clothing of the priests it's not thrilling reading though most people give up reading the Bible right around here so important so it describes everything from this robe that's to be made actually it is an introduction and the closing of the Priestly garment description in Exodus 28 tells you that these are holy clothes holy garments so the garments that are only to be worn when this person is playing the role of the Adam and Eve were all in the little micro eaten that is the Tabernacle these are there Adam and Eve close free fall
 so to speak because you're putting on it's like a it's costume that yes it's symbolic sacramental garments their holy holy face the God has chosen to take up residence here to the meeting place of Heaven in Earth and these are the clothes that the figure is to wear when they're in the Heaven and Earth place and the holy clothes are for Glory and Beauty so glory is about at least it's a physical manifestation of God's power and waiting list and significance but they're for beauty the first times beauty is associated with an object in the Bible is the Tabernacle art art as a gateway to the Transcendence and then when this is made later it's an artist it's an artist who makes it is filled with the spirit of God
 are you crazy
 essentially you read the description here's what the speaker looks like they're wearing all-white brilliant shining white clothes all white linen and then they're covered with gold and jewels and then blue and purple wichard signs and colors of royalty in other words if you saw the high priest walking around they would look like a glowing shimmering shining figure and they are wearing clothes that reflect glory and Beauty than the divine presence there's loads of little details here like the some of the stones the precious jewels are exactly the precious jewels that were named in the Garden of Eden in Genesis to the Onyx Stone and there's one more and they only appear in the whole Bible in the eating their self and on the Priestly clothing is the Revelation that referred to write yes that's right through the Septuagint
 that the Tabernacle is a little micro eaten and this is the the new Adam the new human who will go in and out of the Eden space through prayer and worship and sacrificial coverings for Israel sins this we're doing the thing that we were hoping for from Genesis of Royal priest figure someone's getting back in somebody's getting back in that's right that's right Adam and Eve were out everyone's been out how do they get back into this blessing or they are guarding it flaming sword that dangerous how do you get back in here we're giving a vocation of a priest and they are symbolically taking on the role and not merely symbolic way they're doing it and doing it I think I've heard some scholar talk about play-acting butt or something this terminology of like it's like you're doing a play but like you're actually do anything
 yeah that's right are Catholic and Orthodox Brothers big are just shaking their heads at you and I write you guys this is the church has been doing it for 2000 years right but neither Bible it's very it's all the symbolism Salisbury supposed to be clear we have at least one person on behalf of the others going back into the Eden space again remember this is all what Moses is seeing and hearing as he is up in heaven on top of the mountain the blueprints The Narrative action is standing still weirdest in this 40-day period when the narrative picks up in Exodus 32 we meet the person who supposed to be wearing those clothes we are get mad. This is the irony so just like Moses had his kind of failure I'm outside earlier when he resisted God's call
 Aaron's failure at the same mountains and it's sort of like Darren doesn't know that he's being given the job of a lifetime up on the mountain he just could have waited for 40 days he would have gotten the job of a lifetime he did get the job but for you the reader you're like this guy yeah he doesn't deserve this job right he shouldn't be doing this job and that's when you jump back to the narrative Nexus 32 you're at the foot of the mountain while God's showing them the all the stuff on top and Erin at the store you referring to is Aaron create a meeting and idle the golden calf during the forty days will Moses up in the heavens getting the blueprints for the Tabernacle in the Priestly garments Aaron the priest the first leave the first Israel priest is creating an idol out of you always
 don't think I'm just have to back up and say it's the Hebrew Bible is meant to be giving you a pro Priestly point of view of a more opposite story to tell this story is telling you the institution of Israel's priesthood was a failed project from the beginning flight at the heart of the ideal that is supposed to represent is good and that's what those clothes are all about by recalling the atom that Adam and Eve returning to Eden but as soon as you get out of the sky Towing I had the idea of it into the real world us immediately compromised, and these clothes put on the priesthood gets ordained and inaugurated in The Book of Leviticus and his sons on the first day just have the guys who died this isn't the Book of Leviticus chapter 10
 Aaron's two sons ndaba Navajo and the temple gets last and set up the priesthood is the first day on the job and his two sons bring an offering for some kind of the bring incense this cryptic right it's cryptic but the narrative is clear he says they brought in what God had not commanded them he did what God had not commanded them to do visit pattern now priests not doing good for the purification of the Holy space they got roasted by divinefire in the tent and so now they're dead bodies are defiling the holy space and so they got like dragon with a rope their cousins come and get them and this is a larger point from the beginning just like the eaten there to have it tells you hear what humans are made to be or here's what the idea that they could be and here's what humans actually are however when Moses goes to intercede on
 half of his brother Aaron who failed in the golden calf Moses goes up the mountain Center seating with God and he's offering himself he offers himself to tell me his brother and he also acts as a profit where he brings the need of the people before God and then he's going to speak God's word to the people and will were told in the narrative is that Moses start signing his face is shining. It's closing but actually him it says if Moses even though he forfeited the priesthood or forfeited that rule the all the way back to the beginning of the year when Aaron got brought in the mix here it says if Moses can't help but be the same God called him to be he ends up being that shining Priestly intercessor in the in the heavens is a real high point for Moses but it's in contrast to the failure of the person who was supposed to fill that role so just his brother the high priest
 yeah it is a lot of complexity in a lot of yeah it is really good complex storytelling of just all these twists of expectation is an inversion since on so we could do a lot more but you get the basic point I think we could tell if we think this is a part that should be in the video I think you could tell that a creative way cuz it's the narrative is dramatic yeah but these shining Priestly garments and then Moses becomes that shining human up in the Heaven and Earth space before God this is so important for the story of Jesus being transformed on the mountain gospel and he starts shining and this whole network of stories here at Mount Sinai is a shining is a Priestly thing well I think it's an image of God thing but it's unpacked first here in this in this exactly
 that's Paul timer resurrected new bodies shining like stars in other words the rulers above the hosts of heaven and then you have the rulers below humans here but what if you can have a dirt creature who is exalted up to the heavens and begins to image God and rule over Earth and Heaven shining would be a great way to describe such a person there taking on after abuse of the Divine glory and that's what the ideal priest is supposed to do with his clothes then that's what Moses ends up doing here on this very Mountain po so I'm wondering how much shining will come into maybe our video because if it's connected more the image of God not merely just being a priest and might be a little too in the weeds for just a priest video however it is shining element seems
 deeply connected to the kind of the Priestly part of our Lord than diagram of prophet priest king cuz David space doesn't shine and profits are gritty oh yeah 30. John the Baptist was not glowing and Shining Priestly figures are a reflection back on what the visual way of thinking about what humans are called to be in at the image in Genesis wanted to so that's essentially the negative portrait of the priesthood of Eren and Levi in contrast to Moses as this image of God and with that we can kind of work to keep reading for it again just like we did after me okay that I can be like if we're ever going to find a solution that's going to have to be a glowing Prophet priest type of Moses figure not like the failed Aaron project that didn't work well with
 kind of makes you think it it won't come from the priests yes institution if it'll be something surprising that the Jason to it that's right this is the conclusion that the author of the Hebrews in the New Testament drawers as a little nerdy detail this is not taking that idea and reading it back into the Old Testament I'm saying The Logical any thoughtful reader shouldn't come to the conclusion of read it after reading the Torah that the promised one who will restore the blessing of Eden won't be from the Priestly line of Levi or Aaron that's what the Hebrew Bible is trying to tell us it seems to me but it's going to come from some other place and it'll be someone like a milk is attacking like a Moses figure I wonder who's going to be I'll keep on reading so there you go we're going to ask for it now to how the story of David Gets introduced and we're going to find that he fits the bill and some really cool
 thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast next week we'll continue in our series on priests in the Bible so you walk into the book of Samuel and you're immediately introduced to a priest from the line of Aaron Eli and he's got two sons who actually liked run the sacrificial system and there's a whole narrative dedicated for Samuel 1 and 2 the how he lies really this neglectful absent-minded leader his sons are stealing sacrificial offering is from the people were accepting questions for upcoming question response episode that will have at the end of the series so as you get questions about priests in the Bible we'd love to hear from you record yourself asking the question let us know your name where you're from try to keep it to 20 or 30 seconds and email it to info at bible project, and if you could in your email also write out your question for us if they suspect ton of time as we compiled
