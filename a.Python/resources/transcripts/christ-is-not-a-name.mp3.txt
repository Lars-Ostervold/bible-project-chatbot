today on the podcast we begin a brand new theme study all about the practice of anointing people with a whale sound a little skewer but we picked this theme because it's the title applied the most to Jesus in the New Testament Jesus the Christ meaning Jesus the anointed one it's the Greek word Carrillo which when you talk about a person who has been poured or smeared with oil the title of that figure is creased us which is the title and that is a Jewish Greek way of describing ancient Israelite practice of pouring oil on certain people and places and the Hebrew word for that his Masha and what you call someone who's had oil smeared report over them is my shock from which we get to work messiah in Hebrew Bible to people Anointed with oil were priests prophets and Kings be the anointed one means you've had this ritual we've got the oil placed on your head and it marks of personal
 place as a portal Between Heaven on Earth and with the king's the priest in the profits you get this image of a portal of gods rule for the King Ford of God's presence through the priests portal for God's word and purpose through the prophet all those heavenly realities are brought to Earth so to speak through this one who is marked by the oil will be Anointed with water or wine or something else what makes oil so special will if you been listening to the podcast for any amount of time it won't surprise you that oil has to do with the Garden of Eden that's all about the Garden of Eden and the garden plants and oil becomes a symbol of the Abundant restorative Heavenly life of God the infinite inexhaustible life and power of God in the heavens that can touch down here on Earth through these representative people who get the oil poured on them the oil become itself the symbol
 but those liquid life of God that touches down here on Earth today and I dive into the theme of the anointed of John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us
 hey Tim hey John hello hey we are starting a new set of conversations or anything other than normal we're not going to be as thorough with this theme in our conversations but we're going to dive in deep when we want to and the theme is the theme for the series of conversations is controlled by the time they've gotten to this part of the part of the name of what you click on but I'm still so much to spend the anointed the anointed one for anointing the anointed one thing we are going to meditate on his moments in the biblical story where someone gets oil poured on their head or when an object gets oil poured on top of that
 yeah it's a very specific thing to care about maybe we need to take a few moments to make a case for why this is a worthy of being categorized as a Biblical theme because over the years and what we have tried to do in our theme videos let the biblical authors that the agenda so it's good to come to scripture with our questions in our felt needs and try and see what you know the depositors have to say that might overlap with that but we're trying to do in this project is listen how to hear the biblical fathers on their own terms but they care about their time and culture and why you're telling me that you haven't been a situation in your life where you were trying to put oil on you and you're like you know I kind of figure out if I'm doing this the way the Bible wants me to do it well you know what's interesting is unless you grow up in a church communi
 that's your Traditions do soil in the power in the community so I did grab my parents follow Jesus and they did they hadn't been following Jesus very long before I was born but when I was 67 years old I got this really rare virus that attacked my spinal cord yeah it was like an autoimmune thing really really rare thing and my little growing spinal cord started
 eating itself like you know my immune system was attacking it and I couldn't walk for about 4 or 5 months little boy and I have just a few Vivid memories of that experience one was going to the doctor and getting a spinal tap. I've had those that's a vivid memory another memory I have is after I don't know how months are to my parents brought me to church my dad would just like carry me around and our families apart of the church at that time and so I remember everybody coming around me to pray for me that this one Gathering and somebody had a little bowl of oil and they like dip their finger in the oil and made the cross my forehead and they prayed for me and what's really astounding is that my pediatrician they said my mom I don't remember a lot of
 he tells my mom tells the story of the pediatrician said it could be like a year if things go well before I'm able to have full use of my legs again and I think by Within months before I was able to start walking again and that was maybe a month or so after that prayer meeting and then by month 6 I was it's like it never happened and the pediatrician was this stuff down to so anyway so that was your experience at oil that was my first thought about that for a really long time but somehow when you just said that that's an early member I have and it's involves getting anointed and then prayed for that the healing power of God would give my spinal cord and I had a remarkably rapid healing let's surprise all the doctors involved is anointing with oil
 also a Catholic church thing I mean it's an ancient Christian thing for Crest mentioned even in the apostolic writings and so it's a practice that has spread and all branches of the Christian tradition Orthodox Catholic prayer prayer prayer praying for people and anointing them smearing a little oil on their never want four heads really I remember actually worked for a Christian bookstore when I was a senior in high school I think it's the first time I encountered like anointing oil cuz they sold at the Christian book that cuz they still do piles of it and I just just like you with this
 they probably had some corny logo on it so these are modern reverberations of this practice right now in current Christian practice and in the Christian tradition has roots and stories and poems ever going to look at God in the Hebrew Bible but in the New Testament actually think if you follow through this will be the last time that the actual practice is mentioned it's in the letter of James that's why I was surprised to your church didn't do it cuz in the Bible. Bible. Bible Church which room is present means the New Testament Bible Church and maybe a happen without me being aware but I never encountered it check this out James 5:14
 is anyone among you sick you should call for the Elders of the church they should pray over him anointing him I mean smearing or wiping him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer offered in trust will restore the one to the sick cool this is embedded in a paragraph that's a lot more nuanced than that sounds just ripping it off contest but my point is this is a practice rooted in early Christianity of praying prayer and anointing to ask for the healing love of God to come and meet his suffering hurting people and so this practice has different variations in almost all strands of Christianity that I'm aware of that make sense of why you came across in the bookstore my parents
 I won't ask you to pray for me it's completely so we're at the end of the chain here yes why would you do this besides the fact that the Bible is telling you this is a thing you do what does it mean where did the practice come from yep so that's one way into this question and what you find if you go from here and James and start going backwards and you'll find all the trails lead you back to particular word for anointing or smear with oil it's a Greek word Creo which when you talk about a person who has been poured or smeared with oil the title of that figure is creased us which is the name Christ receive me the title Christ and that is a Jewish Greek way of describing in ancient Israelite practice of pouring oil on certain people and places and the Hebrew word for that is my shot
 and what you call someone who's had oil smeared report over them is Marsha from which we get the word Messiah will it start with Hebrew I was going backwards so you're going back to James we've been using the word to anoint Creo he actually uses synonym of it Alexa but it means the same as means to put a thick dense Will Liquid I'm someone okay so to put oil on someone there's a word in Greek there's a couple with a couple words and green one is Creo and then if you are someone who has had this done to you you're a Cristos yeah and that's where we get the word Christ Jesus Christ is say Jesus the one who's been Anointed with oil correct Jesus the anointed Jesus the anointed one anointed one I don't have a lot of categories for
 but when you say Messiah that's another very familiar term and you're saying that and Hebrew the same idea has the Hebrew word meshiaak which we get the word Messiah so to be the anointed one and Hebrews to be the machine and anointed one in Greek is to be the Cristos either way it's the same idea I might be a different vocabulary different vocabulary the one anointed and be anointed would be the anointed one means I'm someone who had oil poured on me
 physically my head right but I'm imagining for very specific purpose loaded with tons of symbolism yeah which we'll talk about yeah would you I mean like if you were like walking down the street someone spilled some oil on you on accident.
 that's a good question yeah I see if it would probably use the word poor or spill they're so Creole and Meshach these verbs Greek moussaka Hebrew is referring to a ritual so this is a sacred ritual so which is like what happened to me you know that church Gathering or what the oil is being sold for in your Christian bookstore it's for a special ritual it's not just for like I could use it to put on someone's head or I could use it to buy fry up some meshiaak your fries good specific oil use for a sacred ritual purpose for things that are connected to the presence of God in some way or I'm is very general has way more specific symbolism that we're going to explore
 so we are going to release a video exploring the steam storyline of the Bible and we've actually already written the script for that video and real-time that's we're talking right now it's in production and so what we're doing now that we've written the script it's kind of taking what we learned and then some of the notes that I put together and come in session in our way through them that's the mission so one way to start this conversation business to start with the unique and odd practice when she stepped back and think of it pouring oil on someone's head as something that's like cosmically full of meaning you know what that for another way to get it this is to notice that the name of Jesus the name that he's typically known her called bye actually has that this word anointed one built in
 and it's a title none of them will exactly exactly so Jesus Christ Jesus the Christ Jesus Christ so I'm just saying the way people normally at his name is Jesus Christ's only when you're cussing what no I follow Jesus Christ Jesus Christ feel like I only hear the phone ring but is that what you hear when you read the New Testament Ono 1st Corinthians 1:1 called as an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God do you hear the cuss words no know so when you reading in the Bible it doesn't feel like the cuss word for it but you're just saying in normal speech if you say I followed Jesus if I say I follow Jesus Christ that does sound a little odd cuz I'm mostly here
 I follow Jesus yeah but when you just say Jesus Christ have a thing to meditate on right there so what's interesting about the phrase Jesus Christ is the way that it sounds an English is as the way that the English or western culture we structure personal names which is your given name and then your family name and usually we don't include the middle name I call you Joan Collins and you call me Tim Mackie X I call you John if I'm talking to someone else about you I'll clarify that our calling so what's interesting is that I think in run-of-the-mill American culture and because this name is become a cuss word or phrase
 but it's widely assumed that Christ is just like Jesus's last name like his family name. Born to Joseph Christ. Merry Merry Christ Jesus Christ and I think most people after they follow Jesus awhile to figure out that that's not the case I don't know when that became particularly clear to me but it was connected with me coming understand the fact that Christ was not a name that it's a title that's just that's the main point of this whole last 10 minutes of Christ is not a name title title connected to an inch of practice yes boil and someone for very specific meaning got it so what's interesting is here we'll just sample the way the phrase gets used in the New Testament so just turned the gospel of Mark chapter 1
 read the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ the son of God
 so it's the Greek words Jesus Jesus name a Greek and crystals Jesus Messiah so what's interesting is in the New Testament predominantly phrase Jesus Christ is use the words eyes not put in front of Christ Jesus the Christ it happens occasionally but because of the lack of the word za it's very easy to feel like they're using it as a family name but you get other instances like later on to Mark where Jesus asked his disciples I could people say that I am and they said Subway say John the Baptist Was Elijah and Jesus says boo to you all say that I am in Peter answers you are the Christ and they're in English reflecting the fact that they are in Greek the words eyes in front of its very clearly a title so essentially why I think what we need to do in our minds
 is Supply that words are mentally every time you see the word because you always retained its Nuance of meaning as a title NADA family name interesting example in John chapter 1 Jesus is cruising around Galloway and he's starting to recruit his crew discipleship crew and when you get to Andrew he goes and finds his brother Simon and says we have found the Messiah and then John interrupts story and he whispers in your ear the narrator speaks in your ear and says translated into Greek it means Christos so what's the word to use for you so when you quote Simon speech he spells the Hebrew word meshuga with Greek letters
 into Greek letters Macias and then John was the biblical authors have not forgotten that this is a title and I guess that's maybe that's not that big of a deal to make the point. Mentally from me I just started saying Jesus Messiah too because in English it just sounds like a last name way it works Christ does yeah and so I've gotten into the habit of just when I see is the phrase Jesus Christ or Jesus Christos just say yes is Macias Jesus Messiah so what does that mean and it reminds you of what it means yeah what does that mean to be at the Messiah
 what does it mean so first we're going to explore its meaning in multiple steps of the conversation but maybe let's get at it this way let's do a quick survey of who or what gets oil poured on the Emirate in the storyline of the Bible and it's actually a fairly limited number of people and places and just working through that list itself can I think get us closer let's take an inductive approach before we dial in or give it to Canary definition let's just see if we can begin to track with the meaning based on who or what gets anointed so now a little tour of people with oil poured on their head in the toilet in the Bible
you probably know the first one cuz it's fairly common if you're an average follower of Jesus you gone to church Gatherings for a while and heard the Bible thought you probably know of one main category of people
 oh priest oh oh interesting yes yes yes the priests of people in the Bible the first group of people in the Bible I know I said that while our priests the most numerous group of people who get oil port and I had the Bible for the Kings Kings yep that's right and then maybe one time a profit so let's start with priest since they come first or so in when Moses is up on Mount Sinai in the midst of the lightning storm seeing the Heavenly Temple and getting the blueprints for the Tabernacle there's a hole to Hole chapters about the humans and the dress that they're going to have who are going to work in and around this sacred Tabernacle when it's finally bill
 the land down below and by humans give me the price the price exactly right the people were going to work in the Tabernacle and how they're supposed to dress that's part of the vision that Moses is getting you got a dip so Exodus chapter 29 is all about the special clothes the shiny glimmering brilliant colorful clothes that parents going to where Moses brother and he gets a special like garment golden chest piece with all these jewels and shoulder pieces and tassels and robes men 29:6 you will set a turban on his head and put holy crown on the turbine and you shall take the oil of anointing and you shall pour it out on his head and anoint him notice the pouring and the anointing or separate the sheep or
 and then if you pour there's like a smearing Aura your waving your hand at me if I poured oil from my vantage point I'm pouring oil on you and then I'm in a rubbing it at kind of wiping it on your forehead okay and then you should bring his sons and their robes and do the same to them so this is the first I figure in the Bible who gets called that and then when the ritual actually happens is in Leviticus chapter 8 when does all of this interesting leaky sprinkles the oil on seven times and the Knights the altar we'll talk about that in a minute and then he put some of that oil on Ariens head so he's the first one in after that point he's called the Messiah
 Ernest and anointed one call by two titles with the priest wears a high priest I'll go hang out the door the great priest or the anointed one but the priests next are Kings and the priests come first in the storyline of this realm and then it's only much later in the story Joshua lead them into the land of Canaan establish themselves they are constantly getting feed by the nation hostile Nations around them and so God raises up delivers for them by empowering them with the spirit but it's after many cycles of this that eventually the people come to their prophetic leader at the time Samuel and say listen we've we want to King and so the first king that is real chooses his guy name saw and what we're told is that Samuel the prophet
 actually hear what street the story
 so one day before Sol's arriving the Lord has revealed to Samuel this thing about this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin and you shall Michelle him to become a leader in the American Standard has Prince
 whenever I see the word prints anywhere I just think of medieval princesses wearing those like to fees sleeve type shirts in the be like feathers in their what's the why is it drizzly Prince here and it is well it's it's the word for Chieftain or L English Standard Version yeah or would it be king I mean this is so becoming King yeah yeah and he will after that undergoes this but the Hebrew word and id'd which is a more General title in American Standard
 anoint him as ruler that then IV yeah it's interesting interesting word Chief leader but you're right the word prints for specifically means son of the king at least for us is English in English yeah and that's not what this word means in Hebrew that's why it's a bit misleading here so you can deposit on that word it's so annoying him to become a leader Over My People Israel and he will deliver so here it's God setting aside one out of the money and marking them is that deliver a coronation yeah so Samuel does he gets a flask of oil out the next day and he pours it on his head he kissed him and said hasn't Yahweh anointed you to be a ruler over his inheritance but song
 after solve blows his chance of being his real leader that's the whole story David is the next Kings anointed and what's interesting about the story of David is when he gets anointed and additional thing happens so in 1st Samuel 16 verse 13 Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed David in the middle of his brothers who they thought they were going to get oil poured on their heads one of them is the youngest of all that and when the oil gets poured on the spirit of Yahweh rushed mightily upon him from that day onward so that's very significant connection as we're going to stay for the meaning of this ritual the connection of oil and spirit oil and spirit liquid in spirit is clearly a symbol of
 and what is it a symbol of and here in the story of David its Associated some way in the coming down of the oil on his head is associated with the coming upon him by the spirit the other king who's mentioned who gets anointed before they become king official King named Jay who is the king of the northern tribes we've never talked about Jason ever I think in the history of the project jehu Jay-Z's Saul David anointed before they publicly become king there are three kings that get anointed by prophets at there like an odd girl ceremonies that Solomon then to Kings from line of David later on joash and Jehovah has in book of 2nd Kings and what's interesting is all three of the kings that God anointed
 or they become king publicly it's all by prophets who were specifically instructed by Yahweh in to go do it so it's like a secret at night time or a little maybe a private anointing before the public one which is more of the coronation exactly so we can put together somehow this anointing is God's way of setting apart or marking someone and what priests do is they represent the presence of God to people and they represent people to God so they're like mediating figures between the Divine and the human
 and kings are also portrayed in a similar role in the Bible we might think of Kings just mainly as rulers but in the biblical story there very much mediators between God and the people but not in the Sacred Space but more out in the day-to-day Affairs of leading people so God will hold the king's accountable for what the people do and the people often hold the king accountable for what he's doing in relationship to God so there's a commonality we begin to isolate the profile the commonality being that anointing someone is setting them apart as a leader to
 where is the representative of some kind they represent the people in a leadership capacity as moral leader than a priest is that why it is this a good time to L and kind of leader the kind of the high priest is a leader in the Tabernacle at Temple later but the reason why their leadership role matters and it's not just like a operations raw is there some representative function they play is there's other elders and you know tribal Chieftain through whatever that's right but the priest and the King represent all of the people to God in a unique way represent represent what do you mean by the word represent represent so there's a group of people
 Covenant relationship with the storyline of the Bible and all of those people stand in the Covenant obligation and they said yes to the terms of the Covenant is with the laws of the Torah and so on but the primary mediator representative figure of the people in the life and function of Israel in the story of the Bible is to key figures and then afterwards we'll talk about it second and one of them is a king so God will hold the king accountable for what the king allows or doesn't allow the people to do God will hold the priests accountable as a representative of all of the people in this is explored in the Torah where they're in Numbers chapter 18 and 19 where if the people defile the land or do something terrible or break the terms of the Covenant God will hold the high priest accountable and his household representative accountability
 there's also a almost like a a delegation of like instead of God talking to everyone he can just go directly to that person and God will address the king or the priest when he wants to address the people so representative role
 so does the third category of people that's associated with annoying thing but it's not very common enough profits so there's actually only one time that a prophet is supposed to be anointed to Mark the beginning of his career as a prophet when Elijah is about to retire do not fully but he's going to appoint a successor God tells him go find this young guy Elijah
 and anoint him and it's not clear that he ever did that he does go meet Elijah but never said whether he poor soil and said or not but I just decided to complete that list priest-kings and profits and all of these figures are figures who represent some part of Yahweh to the people whether the Priestess got the presents the king represents God's Authority and rules and Prophets represent God's purpose and word they speak the word of God to the people so all of them are in this role to be an anointed one is to be somebody who brings
 what is from God and His Heavenly realm and mediating it to people here on the land and then vice versa that and anointed one is somebody who represents the people on the land before God and His Heavenly realm in some way so we're at so far that feel fairly clear into the bridge a bridge but it's a person virgin together the Divine and human or another way to say that they are bridges Between Heaven and Earth or or a gate the gate Between Heaven and Earth and where this really began to take on significance for me I feel like my lightbulb moment after the number of years ago when I paid attention to the handful of places that get anointed with oil in the Bible is typically when you think of the anointed one
 first person to really get the meaning of what anointing means you have to look at these places the first practice of anointing in the Bible happens not to a person but to a pile of rocks are actually two big rock you know who among some of the rocks and this is the story of Jacob who was fleeing from his brother and his father in The Book of Genesis chapter 28 Sebastian Aiden fascinating story to read it
 Genesis 28 verse 10 and yaakov sorry my translation I try and stall the names the way they're pronounced in Hebrew so yaakov Jacob went out from a Shiva and he went to her on and he encountered the place the place and he stayed the night there because the sun had got down and so he took some stones of the place and he set his head rest and he laid down in that place so normal thing he's a stone sleep on ancient Egyptian headdress a man they there this little pillar and then it's a big UPS to Big u-shaped thing and it's exactly sized so that if you're so
 be on your side your head doesn't go down doesn't go up straight and yeah I've actually seen some Modern pillow makers trying to recreate versions of this cuz I think it actually is really good for you. I feel like you just need a little cushion there I like the idea of the structure but it's a stone for the headrest is also symbolic importance for the cuz the stones about to get anointed his State of Consciousness has made more vulnerable to receiving other dimensions of reality and so he has a dream and behold there was a ramp on the land sometimes translated ladder
 or their way most accurately a r a Stairway for the stair stair ramp from driveways are like this you know like it has the ramp for the tires but in the middle of stairs stairs to walk imagine these things of his proper stairway or a ramp it amounts to the same thing now its head was in the skies the head of this ramp on the land was up in the skies that's not the first time you've heard about something with his head up in the skies before talking about Genesis 11 the Tower of Babel Tower of Babylon yeah they built
 the structure and its head wound in the sky filled the city with the tower to make a name for themselves with his head in the skies this is exact same price so what the people of Babylon we're striving to build which was a gateway to have the gateway to heaven and in fact the word bable or Babylon and its medical language and Acadian means the Gate of the Gods Bob Bob Means gate of the Gods and Acadian yeah which is a cousin language systematically language into the copy of the Gate of the Gods in the world so what Jacob sees is a ramp going up into the skies set on the land but its head is up in the skies and look messengers of Elohim
 we're going up and going down upon it the traffic between Heaven and Earth on this ramp and look Yahweh was standing on it and then why has this long speech where he says to Jacob repeating the promises that he made to Abraham and then to Isaac his father saying the land that you were lying on I will give it to you until your descendants and your descendants will be like the dust of the land you're going to break out to the West the East the north to south and in you all the families of the ground are going to find blessing and also in your seat classic promise to Abraham I am going to go with you I'll keep you wherever you go I'll return you back to this ground I will not abandon you until I've done what I've spoken to you bring you back to this spot bring you back to this ground
 a round yeah oh no no no Jacob he's about to leave his home land for land of his family and so technically it it yep he's on the border yeah I see he's running North away from his brother so Jacob woke up from his sleep and he said Shirley Yahweh is in this place and I had no clue this place I did know at this place and Jacob was afraid and he said how terrifying is this place this is none other than the house of Elohim this is the Gate of the Skies you found the secret Temple yes it where it's found him so the phrase House of Elohim is Elohim he's going to call the name of this place they tell or Bethel Bethel
 all the shorts are out of him so House of God
 so he gets up in the morning and you took that stone that he use for headrest and he said it up right now at the pillar and he poured olive oil on its head and he called its name Beth House of Al and formerly the name of the place in the beginning was almond tree loose and then he makes a valve saying if God will protect me then I'mma come back here and the stone that I have placed at the pillar it will become the house of Elohim and I will give to God the 10th of anything he gets to me that's the story loser City yeah apparently is in proximity to a city called lose a walled enclosure called lose touch means almond tree
 so everything's in the stories about the place the place it's a place he doesn't recognize what is true significance is and it's only when he falls asleep that he's open to see what's there and what he sees is it the portal Between Heaven and Earth and so his response is to Port Royal to Anointed with oil so surely this story is actually foundational for helping us understand the meaning of the simple the spiritual practice yeah well we could deduce is that the Port Royal on an object that's marking a place to say this place is a bridge between having a nurse is a connection here between heaven and Krista to anointed is to signify that place is connection to the Divine got two places and in some way meeting and there's a stairway so like
 yeah Angelic beings got himself this access yep so in some sense the place is a mediator of the Divine and specifically he took a stone from the place he used it as his head rest then he has a dream about a ramp being stepped on the land with its head up in the skies so his head is now on the ground and he's dreaming of a ramp right there on that rock is this heads on the Rock then the Brock becomes a Stairway leading up a rock becomes the stairway well he had a dream his head is on this rock. And then getting his head he's all of a sudden seeing a dream there some connection between the rock his head the ramp and its head up in the sky and then when he says I'm going to take the Rock
 that I use for headrest and set it up as a pillar something on which his head rested he turns up right pointing up to the sky and this was a common play the Hebrew word as monthly box where the pillar and these ritual Stone pillars were very common in fact there are many that still exists today from the. Of ancient Israel Israel and go see ancient temples and will be these matters about her I might save our lives not even that talks maybe like 60 and 18 inches tall I like a rock and Austin archaeologists will find rocks like this tipped over but usually do have some sort of little ritual circle of rocks placed around it and let's say a wall collapsed and it got buried and then they pick it up in there like all my things so the rock that becomes the headrest becomes the
 ramp with its head in the skies becomes symbolized by the rock for the headrest the deterrence upright into a pillar and you poor thing is this stairway is what you're saying can I call the olive oil on its head on the head of the stairway on the head of the stone which is the symbol of the stairway yeah yeah it was in the skies is there an idea then that the role of a king or a priest in the profit is for their head to be in the sky was it just in this story things being on the ground or things being low and things being hot here heaven and interest high and low to Beulah mediate Between Heaven and her feet are on the ground but in some way your mind needs to be connected to the Divine so if pouring oil on a place
 it as a portal with its feet on the ground or in this case his head on the ground its head up in the sky that becomes this really powerful narrative image of what is the Messiah what is a person who was anointed they must in some way play a similar role since this stone or this ramp that they are a person set aside in ritual spaces to be portals Between Heaven and Earth and we go back to get us think about the king mediates God's Heavenly rule here on Earth that's how humans are presented in page 1 of Genesis as images of God so God's rules in the heavens above and he installs Earthly rulers on the land below
 now we're not told well the next turn signal go to the Garden of Eden story cuz the I do think there's nothing there that if you have eyes to see it it's all over just the word is not used in the car to feed store but humans are portrayed as the archetypal anointed ones Earthly representatives of God's Heavenly Rule and Priests are presented in the same way in the Sacred Space and then profits are a portal for the word of God to come to Earth who's very connected to the idea of being the image of God yeah the image of God is a related idea for talking about someone as a representation of the Divine yeah
 are they like adjacent ideas or they like pretty much synonyms well be the anointed one means you had this ritual we've got the oil placed on your head and that doesn't happen with Adam and Eve
 I was right about the story is that it shows us the meaning of this practice that it marks a person or a place as a portal between haven't Unearthed and with the Kings priests in the prophets you get this image of a portal of gods ruled for the king a portal of God's presence through the priests of portal for God's word and purpose through the prophet all those heavenly realities are brought to Earth so to speak through this one who's marked by the oil in the same way that this place and this rock becomes a portal Between Heaven and Earth and that's what this whole story is about was Jacob so that raises all these other questions about like what is what does that mean to be a portal to heaven or like less
 I really mean I don't know if that's a question that comes to you yeah I've been we talked a lot about being the image of God and so I guess I'm just assuming it means that but instead of saying cuz when generally when we say in the image of God were talking about everyone everyone's role in representing to be the anointed one is more of a specific task of representing everyone set apart like the high priest you know on the kings are set apart from the many
 the question that lingers in my mind
 is how is this connected to a James's telling Church to do you experience yeah yeah yeah and you were sick like that had nothing to do with making you some sort of Representative on behalf of them it was because you were sick and they wanted God's healing the threat so there's got to be some sort of connection there and I don't fully appreciate the next conversation is about the symbolism of oil specifically and the soil of annoying thing and there's a recipe for it in the book of Exodus and the recipe itself has all kinds of important hyperlinks to the Garden of Eden and it's all about the Garden of Eden and the garden plants and oil becomes a symbol of the Abundant restorative Heavenly life of
 infinite inexhaustible life and power of God in the heavens that can touch down here on Earth through these representative people to get the oil poured on them and so somehow the oil becomes itself the symbol of the liquid life liquid life of God the touchdown here on Earth to Isabel Explorer in the next steps the conversation but just to let the cat out of the bag notice how loyal and prayer are connected in that passage in James that we looked at it so what is prayer prayer is asking for the release of God's Heavenly purpose and power and life here on Earth and specific people in moments and so it's it's just the oil and the prayer for healing or the got the power for healing
 are linked symbols of each other so not that I think it is connected you know those people around me were praying that God's healing power would
