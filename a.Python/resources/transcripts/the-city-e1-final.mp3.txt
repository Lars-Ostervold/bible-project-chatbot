we're starting a new theme study today it's the theme of the city cities are where most humans in the world work and play we raise our families be built business is the Bible cares a lot about the city because cities are where loads and loads of human images of God are centralized if you've been following this project you know we've done a lot of things about a lot of ideas in the Bible but it's not often we do a theme study on a setting but this setting the city is Creer they become little microcosms in the technical sense of that word little mini universes what's on display in the city is usually a barometer her what's happening in creation of are the ideal setting in the Bible on the first page is not City it's a garden and when cities get introduced their entirely negative
 and they remain mostly negative throughout the biblical story but the story of the Bible has a surprise in store for us as a relates to the city by the time you reach the last page the fact that God's Heavenly realm with going to merge with her to be the new creation is depicted as a city I think it surprised there this is surprising because the city is introduced in the Bible as a tragic result of human violence and it's in cities that violence grows and Humanity becomes monstrous but it isn't done away with in the ideal incorporated into the restoration and redeemed today and I start exploring the theme of the city of John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us do.
play John hello hello it's good that it's a great day because of what we're doing right now in this moment I love these moments I do too I love doing this this is my favorite part of the job it is exhausting for me mentally mentally after one or two. Tired totally well do you feel that way I have uses feel really energized and happy how many could you do if you're my friend a ride I have this job maybe I could go we usually for those of you listen to podcast regularly we usually record two at a time to time and might be news for a minute and we try to block close together in two groups days record maybe four or six sometimes we belong together but that's why it seems like I'm really good at remembering things but then other times like really not good
 like maybe 3 weeks since the last conversation we had a very forgetful person we've also tried to do three in a row in one day we have in that did not work. Usually you're really quiet by the third one and I feel tired so I guess so I guess I do get tired and crabby anyhow part of why I'm energized is because we are starting in a new series a new series of conversations about a new theme video and we have yet to even think about the script like we're starting script development by having these conversations which is how we've traditionally have done it yep that's right until more recently the thread where things got ahead of us and we got to write a script so yeah I'm excited I'm I'm coming in fresh this is a new theme I think we'll get us into some new territory and and tell me about what the statement that this is going to be a theme video
 and discussion about the city in the Bible the city from the name of the place the theme is about a kind of place that's right we've made some videos about like the Tree of Life The Water of Life but those are about as her about things things that happened but the temple the temples of place it's a place to get there I have to do be an important relationship has become on between temples and cities and we did a theme on Heaven and Earth which are two makeup places in the Bible what makes it qualify as a theme you may ask John what is so usually what we're shooting for is an idea in this case the place that appears in the earliest chapters of Genesis as some really downed a tional part of the beginning of this is biblical story and then just
 strategically and repeatedly throughout the biblical story that somehow reaches a climactic moment in the story of Jesus and then reappears or comes to like complete fulfillment in the final pages of the Bible and the city checked all those marks the city the city so first of all let's just noticed that probably is most people think of the most well known Bible stories they know a whole bunch of them take place in a very small number of cities where in relationship to a small number of cities we got Jerusalem has an important city hell yeah both pretty much once for Abraham so it's called Salem and then once the story of David kicks in it's just through slumps almost the central focus and most biblical books through the rest of the Hebrew Bible for Jesus the story comes to its
 in Jerusalem that starts in another city yeah that's why I am exactly right yeah well as we're going to see these terms are relatives from Language sign language but sorry I'm going to head that way I'm here to my little list okay thanks John just helping you feel like a nut sack cities in the Hebrew Bible that are significant are like Babylon the big bad Nevada capital city of the Assyrian Empire when the story of Egypt comes into play in The Exodus scrolled Israelites are building cities but it doesn't ever say where
 what city the whole drama is happening and it just says in the land of Egypt
 which is interesting way of Moses and the ten plagues and all the times of Moses goes into the palace I was in Goshen so the Israelites live in a region or land called Goshen Burger but the actual Showdown with pharaoh and all those narratives are just there not specifically Egypt City in the land of Egypt but the land of Egypt and area it's a big area and then when Moses goes to Pharaoh it just says in Moses went to Pharaoh whether it was in the city or what it was is a region because Babylon and Nineveh a very specific cities they were Empires and regions with Egypt is a region that he had a city as a capital and Egypt doesn't have a central city that that are named focus and other cities you know that featured prominently in the biblical imagination Sodom and Gomorrah as cities that were particularly corrupt
 and we're you know destroyed in this really catastrophic why in the new actually the story of Esther is the only store that takes place and it's City but Nestor is pretty popular biblical story take place in a Susa
 the capital of the Persian Empire in the New Testament yeah of Jerusalem but then you also have when the Jesus movement get centralized up in Antioch the big deal in the book of Acts and then it goes to Rome by the end of the black singer from Jerusalem to Antioch around in three cities the biblical story concludes by describing the new creation as a city the New Jerusalem a city coming down from the skies holy city coming down from the sky but the whole world is not a city at that point new creation is in a city well new creation is about God's Heavenly realm descending to become one with her scene but the thing that is descending that is out of the new creation to come merge
 God's Heavenly realm coming to merge with Earth to result in the new creation thanks for the clarification and the thing that comes down is the holy city that's also called a bride coming to get married look at which is important or at the super important that connection between the city and the bride's but get there a main venue for the significant events in the Bible not the only actually there's an important binary because actually the most formative events in the life of the main characters the Bible all take place many of them take place outside of cities and purposefully so yeah so we're going to anticipate and explore a bit of a rivalry between the city Folk in the country folk do I think it's a little bit different we're going to find out you going to find out City versus country
 what we mean by that and yeah the opposition will certainly mean different things to different people depending on your social location right before we dive into the story let's just Orient ourselves to the meaning of the word City first in the Hebrew Bible and then kind of paint a picture for what is it a qualifies as a city in the Bible cuz it is different than for sure you and Me growing up in 21st Century West Coast America and that will kind of help Orient test but maybe just you know this is a fairly short introduction it's only taken us two minutes before we get in the Hebrew but what we're really talking about is cities are where like loads and loads of human images of God are centralized and since humans as images of God and how they
 build a life together for good or for ill or both I mean less really it at the center of the biblical drama the kind of world do humans build and cities are where all of that building after it gets you know focused and centralized until they become a little microcosms in the technical sense of that word micro Cosmos in Cosmo little many universes what's on display in the city is usually a barometer for what's happening in creation of large maybe about 15 years ago I heard this lecture by Timothy Keller on a defense for raising your kids in the city Pastor in New York City New York City Manhattan Road a lot about both thinking about the city from a Biblical and a Christian perspective but also a practical in terms of the mission of Jesus followers in the world
 maybe kind of where we will end specifically he was trying to convince people that it's okay to raise our kids in the city it's scary for some parents to think about how corrupting City life because there's so many potential levels around every corner I suppose so he's got this it was a whole hour long lecture and he talked about how well one thing that stuck with me was he talked about the survey that was taken at like I use conference where they asked all the kids this whole list of questions about why they have or have not adopted their parents face and the common denominator was not well it's not any of the things you might expect the common denominator was if kids felt like their parents understood the real world and understood their world so his whole thing with that was like Hey the real world is happening in the city
 like it or not I got to ask where culture is being shaped and that's where things are happening and when your kids are in their adolescence you actually want them to be around that and you want them to have a vision of especially if they're around that place around Christians who are in that vision of like I can live a real life being the Craftsman or the whatever with my vacation is in the city as a follower of Jesus seeing that at work cuz I got super powerful and then to be have all this access to culture like it's super important and so he like bring your kids especially in the way we call the back half the back nine of raising your kids like bringing the city so interesting is that I remember hearing that talk to. I think is before I even had like a
 cell phone or smartphone to MP3 player okay means I would find things on the internet download them onto a little tiny thing is loaded with certain things. So I think even though I was living in Wisconsin at the time going to grad school we were still in you no contact with each other during those years but we didn't see each other very often and what's funny is that teaching made its way to both of us cuz I remember hearing that too I remember what I was doing cuz we just bought a dumpy Little House a fixer-upper and I was spent months like remodeling it myself with Jessica and my friends will never do that again but I was little I was had an industrial floor sander sanding all these old hardwood floors and then was going to refinish them myself and I listen to that while I had this huge industrial sander or o n e
 I know they have really good headphones yeah yeah I put big ones on that one but what is significance mean we didn't have kids yet before we had our first son and I remember being really inspired by that he painted a picture to say that City life has both strengths and weaknesses use the image from the Book of Jonah. That was very clever which was at the end of The Book of John and I got says should not care about the city that has 120,000 people who don't know the right hand from their left and a lot of cows and cows and was just cities have the highest density of images of God so I heard you use that phrase the other times they would be I think I just use it a few minutes ago cuz it's true and God cares about it just seems so that's going to have a special kind of focus for attention paid to these high density image bearing areas but then also about that the complexity of life in the city
 forces parents who really want to follow Jesus and help their kids see what it will really look like to follow Jesus that it forces you to have conversation earlier that you might be able to put off a few years if you were living outside City and so cuz they're just going to be off altogether together yeah but you're going to be forced to move towards the hard ethical moral issues economic political issues all the different religious all of it cuz they're just exposed to it as you walk around your neighborhood and so I try to remind myself of that cuz we live near pretty dad's kind of Hub in Portland and so just walk into the grocery store with my son's you know all kinds of crazy stuff the Sparks great conversations and some of them are hard and some of them on like she's I thought I had a year we were going to have to talk about that so
 as we're talking right now and being reminded that this is why we chose to leave work
 yeah cities are complex things in life and reality and they play that same role in the story The Bible affected really interesting so this particular theme has a tweak to it that I don't know if we've ever quite done anything like this in a conversation with some video and essentially here's the big picture the ideal for human existence in Pay just want to do the Bible is the garden the opposite of City yeah well I mean there's only a couple people eventually like it they're going to deliver eaten for a while so short shorts are okay so in terms of the people in from their perspective Adam and Eve from the author's perspective who's living wait later who knows about cities and countries like the fact that the garden ideal is still revered as the ideal and not the city and the thoughts somehow an image of God's I deal with his people least at the beginning that's
 if and when cities get introduced their entirely negative and they remain mostly negative throughout the biblical story so that by the time you reach the last pay yeah the fact that God's Heavenly realm that's going to merge with her to be the new creation is depicted as a city I think it's surprising adopted surprised us so it has a different kind of Arc than most teams which usually begin with the Water of Life or the tree of life and it's like there's the beautiful thing right there where I can never get back to it and then work is lost in some way and then Jesus somehow flips it a redeems that heals it and then that's New Creation this theme is not like that different police have to clear my mind is that makes sense because yeah yeah
 so the ideal is difference Garden cities are introduced to something not good and then somehow they go through some transformation because it's the ideal in the end
 I think a fascinating it is fascinating but it is also a Heavenly City see it comes from the skies and it's a very merged with Garden imagery the city yeah I was first it's a city that is also at the Garden of Eden differently cover okay so let's shift lets first learned about the Hebrew word for City and kind of the we're trying to stock our mental encyclopedia with all the meaning and associations that cities would have for the biblical office that's what you got to do every time you tackle a new ID in the Bible and then when we have that filled out I think we'll turn to just what I would call the puzzle of the city in the Bible for this first conversation
so weird City in the Bible does the new Hebrew word Johnna we've never talked about it for interior you are retaining Hebrew vocabulary as we go on in the project that's really fun to see learning Hebrew word yeah well it's been years I should for I should know way more and then have it done it yeah well I could be way more head than I do but thank you unlock in the Bible is the word e r it sounds like the English word for any of the thing on the side of our heads here
 the way in a Great Grandpa Moses would have said it was on you know how it's spelled with 3 letters i n Yoder Ash ear and eye in is one of two letters in Hebrew that begin and kind of modern pronunciation kind of a silent letters another words that iron isn't it's a consonant in Hebrew but he was like how do you say that this letter you close your throat when you push out the first vowel and that closing of the throat is Blaze the letter so think of how to do it just now thinking how we say the word Orange in English orange orange pay attention to your throat muscles first or the orange pants your throat and then it closes for you to push out the orange so that we are that closing of the throat and the pushing out is the letter the letter i
 if you hear people who grew up speaking Hebrew not even modern Hebrew you can hear a little like a little click in the back your throat I am I on I heard it when you in this is super nerdy like Semitic phonology but that Hebrew has a cousin language Aramaic and they're very close kind of like French and Spanish an often words in Hebrew that begin with i n r paralleled in Aramaic with the letter cuff which is a sentence like a heart are closing in the trash harder closing of the throat but in your throat exactly so in transliteration choking myself yeah in technical transliteration font the letter i in is represented by a g with a. Under a beer
 that's why that apostrophe is right before the IRS today so yeah and non-technical transliteration you think by this letter I end with an apostrophe I got a little lessons in smithwick's in order to get there we're on alert Hebrew I'ma Do It one letter at a time okay so the word e r h 1092 times in the Hebrew Bible a lot it's a big word yeah yeah. It's definitely one of the ones you if you are in the top like a hundred or two hundred words said one of them so I'm reading from the entry in the new international dictionary of Old Testament Theology and exegesis it's like a it's not just a dictionary of Old Testament Hebrew words it's a long commentary entry on hundreds and hundreds of Hebrew words everything you could ever want to know and probably more than you want to know
 this word has a parallel and other Semitic languages Phoenicians and hookah Reddick in Arabic Old South Arabic the parallel for this word e r means Castle I know it's going to be important to see where is another romantic language is just need city or town so reading from the entry in the ancient near East that year was almost always fortified that is that wallet and lost and had its own ruler 1% charge was often called King for example milk is a deck king of Salem Sodom have a king and Abraham meets us Kings in Genesis chapter 14 in fact a couple Kings the called Kings but then their mission to King have it and it names the city so I would imagine a king would have a pretty big Kingdom but when I think I'm just a fortified city of the way were describing it doesn't sound like a big place he'd exactly nothing like
 size of in scope of way we think of cities because they had walls around them was a walled enclosure here and also I could Jericho kind of in the origin you know during the time of Abraham Isaac Jacob and city-states were like the most common form of political organization so not necessarily tribes but organized around a little Urban Hub the were surrounded by a wall in each of those was a little kingdom and then we have a network of unwalled towns around them and then with the king of the city also rule the little like towns around them that were fortified in fact and Hebrew those little towns are called daughters daughters daughters it called the daughter as well they can be called what they're not called Ian is the central thing as a wall around it and then the networks are called daughters then there's the next step
 love like then you have like a Nebuchadnezzar something and he's not like the king of an a year he's like the king of like an Empire of many Autumn size 8 in plural of many many cities is basically just what Babylon is and Assyria is one Mega year and all of the other cities are like what the little daughter Villages were mom smaller-scale yeah so the Central City would be the Hub primarily for will be the temple in the shrine is and then primarily where you know like the Army is and where all the money in Commerce close in and out of but the actual production of goods is all happening out in the towns and so the ear is the center of protection help Deliverance all comes out of City out to rescue the daughter towns that's how I saw love her
 the ancient near East and either refers to that walled enclosed fortified City at the center of a network of how big would they be typically yeah you know thousands hundreds to thousands and so like maybe maybe maybe above 10,000 you know I didn't I should have maybe look to stop but it would really very but the thousands what is a detail with the story of Jericho they walk around the city how quickly it was yesterday's weather in the point is that huge that's a big city 120,000 and then you. Maybe less so but the point is and whether that means going around the perimeter of the city or like getting through all the like neighborhood of the city I think about what it means the three-day walk
 to go through the city but in Jonah so there a Syria which was like the capital city of the biggest world Empire at the time is 120 thousand and that's an obvious as the route number even though. You at the end of Jonah the most cities yeah we're talking about thousands of people and then you know the network of a baby had a few thousand more in the daughter Villages around the point is that what constitutes something as a city in the ancient near East and in Biblical Hebrew is not the size of the population it's about whether there's a wall around it and whether it's kind of the source of economic cultural and religious life of the hub for the towns around it the difference between town and city is about the wall and about the Hub like nature interesting cuz that's different
 listen to We Don't wall or cities is it amazing how many more people are around today I've been back then it's true I got in the 20,000 that's a big city yeah yeah yeah yeah not trusting there are billions of humans on the planet now and there were not then no like not even close to that not even close is pretty wild to imagine so what are we what are the biggest cities right now on the planet oh man Mexico City Tokyo let's see. The ones you would totally expect is 22 million Vision 22 Shanghai 25 shanghai's 25 Mi Mexico City to Tokyo 14 New York City 8 this is not in descending order go to that with ph South Paulo yeah where's that at
 that is remarkable is Dan Bull yeah that's 16 million 10 million 2 million less in China what is that a municipality at the Confluence of the Yangtze and jailing of those Rivers Southwest Southwest China it's a largest city by population using the city proper definition which is the area under administrative boundaries of the local government if that's the criteria meaning it's pretty sprawled yeah but what it says is current population in the urban core is 15 so I guess it depends on your definition
 will a big cities man there was nothing like this time the Bibles written in terms of scale not even in the ballpark doesn't mean that this team has nothing to say to people to do live in these modern cities I really think it does but that we are living in a different type moment in the human story but human nature being what it is it's likely that the Dynamics that a city of ten or Twenty million faces right now it's just a really scaled-up version of with always been happening so that's City in the Bible what it means what it doesn't mean let's move now to what you just call the puzzle of the city in the Bible
some of the most beautiful expressions of Hope and faith in God in the Bible center around images of a Divine City particularly at the vine city of God that provides and just noticed thinking about the definition of what city is in the Bible the primary emphasis is about security refuge in a place of order and life in the midst of a world that's like crazy out there so if these are just too kind of at random but they're ones that popped in my imagination of some of my favorite expressions of this in the Bible Psalm 46 which is actually kind of familiar song it gets featured in a lot of contemporary worship songs
 God is our refuge and our strength a very present help in times of trouble there for we won't be afraid even though the land should shift and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea would be creation actually right even though the waters Roar and foam in the mountains Quake at the swelling Pride of the waters so yeah I mean you can even see it right here this is like Genesis 1 imagery of the dry land and the chaos Waters yeah but in Reverse God takes away the land now becomes a stable place for humanities left are all creatures and yes life right and here the land is now ya Slippin cracking apart and being submerged under the cat's water even the highest parts of the land right
 Athens go down another word Cosmic decreation so flood like proportions through the whole snow globe the three tier Cosmos with the others take for granted the waters above in the sky the land here and then the waters below the land but notice how it began around the land around the land correct so notice that the pounding begin with that though the pond again saying God is the Refuge and strength not the land even if the land itself because Moss as we know it collapses in on itself there is still solid Refuge
 that transcends the land and that is God is God the author of all of it and so God is a place of Refuge cuz the first one down to restore continuing there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God the holy Dwelling Places of the most high God is in the middle of her and she is a city which is now woman she will not be moved God will help her when the Sun rises morning the nations are making an uproar the Kingdom's totter and fall
 he raises his voice in the land melts he got Yahweh of armies
 the Lord of hosts is with us
 the Elohim of Jacob is our stronghold exactly one word stanza to the Palm below it but this is enough to press to meditate on here there is a river whose streams make glad the city of Elohim there's a river and the river has streams meeting currents like the way it smooth streams maybe it breaks into stream stream the river branches out I mean this is connected to I imagine the River of Life the the river that flows from Eden that breaks into four rivers that water the whole world totally for sure that's what's on the brain here so there's a river up there this is Dee River Heavenly River haven't even eaten River that's bringing life to all creation and a branch is out so it's streams it streams make glad
 joy to and what you expected the garden Joy to the people who experience water oh yeah the inhabitants of said whatever place the water's going to go get rings enjoy cuz it sustains their life so glad the city city of God God City Garden City city because the River of Life flowing out of a garden into all the world there's no cities well or at Flo's Flo's out and water the garden and then yeah flows out and Waters other lands and other places but the point is that on page one and two of the Bible the river that God provides and grows a garden in the guardhouse The Refuge in the place something else of city of God and knows what the city is called the holy Dwelling Places of the one way up high the most
 highest of the High Heavens of the heavens so this is a Heavenly City cuz it's God's Dwelling Place in the highest of the ice that you don't pick sure the I don't know the Jericho type city where it's like it's out there is a wall around it this is where the rivers are going but like up on the mountain the garden place to like Temple Place this is what we're supposed to be picture in here yeah that's right it's all of the imagery that fits the Garden of Eatin of centralized River a holy dwelling place next line God is in the middle of her. I like the tree of life in the middle of the garden you know but it's called very clearly not the Garden today. They're all so this was how they thought of Jerusalem the right high on the mountain God was in the middle of it yeah totally but Jerusalem is also on the land Jerusalem's on
 high mountain that would slip into the heart of the sea so we're not talking about an Earthly City okay cuz that would you know if all in one of those crevasses that opened up when the land melts his whole thing is that he wrote down on the sand like all the other cities will slip into the sea but our city will know the mountains slip into the heart of the sea and everything not with a thought that I Cosmic decreation that you're right you put your finger on this about Rick Cosmic collapse even if there's Cosmic collapse
 there's still one place that safe so we're talking about something kind of metaphysical at this point and I didn't notice how the beginning God is our refuge a very present help in trouble what kind of trouble did Congressman Mike Coffman collapse like the ultimate trouble so how is it that God can be our refuge if the whole are all reality collapses will because there's a a river all of the river I mean what does that mean whose streams make bring joy to God city that is up on the height of the heights of the heights died last night so what are you going to miss the dwelling place of the most high one who are with the word most high isn't just rhetorical flourish it means the one who dwells in the heavens of the heaven 7th Heaven the most high as high up as you can think that's where the most high has the city of the sky it's too Heavenly city is God City
 and God is in the midst of her to the cities of her so the Gods in the midst of her and she does that is being swept into the sea will help will bring help at the word help that there's two times here and then we're going to not see in this conversation but the next one that's so important the word help this is the same one from the garden you'll see you'll fall asleep just gold mine right here will help her when the Sun rises when the light comes when the light enters into the dark chaos New Creation that's God's help
 God will help and then look help her the city so the city why doesn't he need help let's see well this is the biggest the city of this is the Heavenly City and yeah probably is doing okay yeah well I guess okay all right so here I might go back cuz I said the you know the Heavenly City and start talking about a Sky City but I think maybe the more the emphasis is like Eden which is a place where the land on the sky are the same place and isn't that kind of how they thought about you while we're going to have that debate is it go on in this conversation or whether it is really thought of Jerusalem as that place whether they thought of it as potentially being that place or providing symbolic imagery to describe it so yeah well won't have that out so figure out if this is taken for granted that there is some City so I'm going to be by as what I said earlier in light of where you're pushing it. That's why I love talking to you so
 the concept of Eden and the way the afterlife of Eden Cosmic Mountain imagery in the rest of the Bible is that there a place where God is firmly in the middle is a place that can be Heaven and Earth at once and so if there is a city that is heaven on Earth at the same time then heaven on Earth City is not what you say is not in danger even if the cosmos collapses like I guess that's the point here and that's why they eat in images Chi and also the Heavenly high up the reason why I'm asking to as you get to the last 19 exactly yes and you get this the Lord of hosts is with us you get the sense of like okay we're in our city all these nations want to come and take us out in verse 3 of the poem the waters are roaring and foaming surrounding the mountains right testicle
 the elapsed and then in verse 6 the nations are roaring you and the kingdoms are tottering so now it's the chaos Waters you have become Imperial Army Army invading armies surrounding the Mountain City trying to invade it and they taught her and the land melts when y'all get addresses them but the city is not harmed if the city remains safe and how can you read that as an Israelite not think like that sausage Jerusalem question is stay fixated on it the actual police something not Beyond something bigger and more ideal like I haven't I haven't used the language of the last chapter chapters of the Christian Bible
 sup notice also the what do you say the interchangeability of God and the city so it begins God is our refuge but then God's in the middle of the city so now the city can be your Refuge right cuz if you're in the city you're protected so there's a cyst on both God is the Refuge and then the city where God dwells is there protecting in the last line of the stanza the god of Jacob is the stronghold back to God being that the goddess but Gods depicted as a city God is God is like the city the city of God where do you get that the city is God so God is our refuge and our strength for her so there is a river whose streams make glad the city of God or gods in the middle of her she won't be moved
 God is our stronghold so if you're in the middle of the city with God the city won't be moved and who or what is the city what's the city and it's got cuz God is our stronghold there's a lot of connection here between God and the city that use in the middle of yes that's a her but I don't know if it's strong enough to say God is the city it's almost like but they are there's a relationship there that is very thank you connected the point is is if you're in this space with God in the middle you are protected in that space. Got there and it's where he lives just one place Yeah Yeahs on all this Garden of Eden early chapters of Genesis but in the place of the garden is the city so we're back to that puzzle cuz like we're okay so when does the city become a part of the equation that right to be practical about it
 are now living in cities I mean so yeah that's her lived experience yeah that's right this is a poem found in a collection of Scrolls who's ideal beginning for all humanity is a garden could have had an idea of like look who we need to get rid of the city and is go back to being Garden people take down the Walls like plant Gardens and here you can go to many other places in the Hebrew Bible where the profits for example look forward to and a restoration for Israel for example Ezekiel chapter 36 I'm going to bring you back to your land and then verse 30 I will multiply the fruit of the tree the produce of the field you won't be disgraced by salmon among the Nations
 you will all cause okay yes it is here I'll cause cities to be inhabited and the waste places to be rebuilt so I guess there's a city there but the desolate land will be cultivated the emphasis is more on the farming around the city like the fruit tree farming the desolate land will become like the Garden of Eden and the Wasteland will be fortified fortified and inhabited both are like for some reason that's the way it is ruined and Ezekiel saying they're going to become totally truthful and a half so once we get here to Psalm 46 in the profits when we envision the new creation and the new garden now cities are in the equation for but they're not as The Story begins now I guess maybe that's just the puzzle I'm not saying this is a huge puzzle that you can't solve I'm just saying it's interesting that once cities are introduced into
 history they are but how else could they have begun in a city like what was God created a city and then he's like I said earlier there's only a couple of them because there's only two of them I mean like yeah well that's a good point I guess maybe my puzzles. It's maybe like a child's puzzle I don't know I mean there's probably I'm just trying to understand a hustle color it does there is something significant about crashing from garden to City yeah that's right okay so let's take let me just pass there and just take the story of the battle begins with a garden by the time you get later in the biblical story when God's Heavenly presence touching down on Earth or the future healing of the land and of the universe is all depicted as
 City and garden together
 and that is curious to me because as I said earlier cities are almost entirely negative when they get introduced into the biblical story that seems like the puzzle that's cuz you can have the thought experiment of Adam and Eve stayed in the city or in Eden and built their huts and homes around the tree of life you can kind of imagine what you would end up getting is what you see coming down from heaven and Revelation in a way I could have maybe become the thing that they created but they don't have any chance I mean they got they leave and then when cities are introduced there like a problem that's right and because remember the nature of the city is walls and the only reason you need walls if you live in a world that's dangerous, which means you're living outside of eating so maybe that's it it's that city is by definition
 this culture are about walls that protect you from things that can kill and destroy your people here which means you're living very much in a non ideal setting so the fact that tool developed by humans to protect themselves from each other is incorporated into the new creation I think it's really fascinating but before we get there let's just quick paint a portrait of the negative introduction of City
the first city is the one that came builds after he murdered his brother and is exiled from the land the second and third cities that are built a few chapters later in Genesis by nimra to build Babylon and Nineveh a capital of Assyria the forest city named really focused on the Bible is that Sodom and Gomorrah and her daughters and their daughters and really those cities become the archetypes of the human City of Violence oppression and evil so just real quick here so Ezekiel 16 this was the guilt of Sodom they were arrogant they had abundance of food and careless he's and they didn't help the poor in the meeting
 they were arrogant the commit Abominations before me so I removed them
 Ezekiel 16 verse 48 following the city and what happens in City's wealth is concentrated right in the hands of a few who live way more extravagantly that they need to and this economic inequity and saw a bunch of people suffer and nobody seems to care that's the life of the city Cena in the book of Isaiah Babylon is singled out as Babylon the beauty of all kingdoms the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans Chaldean has their ancient kind of tribal name of the people that the best one they will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah one bad City now compared to another Pet City it'll never be inhabited we lived in from generation to generation
 The Babylon is compared to Sodom and Gomorrah and it's even worse not cuz it's fundamentally different but just the scale is even bigger now than Empire so just right there is a quick sketch play these are the primary cities in the Bible and the first city in the Bible so the fact that God can still Envision a future for the Human family and that it doesn't just erase the city but finds a way and incorporates it into its vision of New Creation that's for me the puzzle and what if I'm standing I think that yeah I buy the screaming has a puzzle makes me maybe overthink it it's but it is a surprise the surprise of the city of surprise of the city
 because yeah alright I'm with you thank you give me a second time I didn't want to know I'm here to help you but the puzzles I feel like fairly simple only put a finger already is like the only cities that were introduced to our created outside of Eden and there are created in human with human violence and arrogance nature and inclination towards violence outside so the response to that you and that's sad that isn't even necessary but then they become engines yeah that and because the only other thing we have to say well what was better was when there was no City then all the imagery we get to describe a state that we won't go back to is Garden imagery yeah yeah yeah so it makes you feel
 Garden good City bat that seems obvious is like actually like human civilization had to form and it can form a different way and it will still be a condensed group of people living together creating culture doing stuff but it can be fundamentally different and Villa City totally yes that's right it's still a city so there are different ways that the biblical authors and taking care of a really cool poem or not a palm it's a prophetic Vision in Zechariah and we've never talked about that cry on the podcast it's so so rad and Zechariah Chapter 2 and 3 there's a parallel Visions describing the future restoration of the Israelites from exile
 and I'm in chapter 2
 verse 10 the Israelites are called to sing for joy and be glad o Daughter of Zion Zion another name of true son and daughter is dying it's an important way of the city is referred to as we'll talk about that in the next conversation look I am coming to dwell in your midst in the middle of you many nations are going to join themselves to Yahweh in that day and the Nations will become my people suck the time of the promise to Abraham then I'll dwell in the middle of you and you will know that I am Yahweh such a chapter to sew in Decorah to the prophet speaking he's living after the return from exile to Babylon and he has all these portraits of Hope for the future of the New Jerusalem the restore Jerusalem that they're hoping to build and be a part of and so he has this Vision a heavenly vision and he speaking to these Heavenly beings and the Heavenly beings run and say to Zakaria
 Jerusalem will be inhabited again one day without walls because of all the multitude of humans and animals in it I said Yahweh will be a wall of fire around her and the glory in the middle of her you know what made me so I had this thought I was like okay so you didn't have walls but it did have a flaming sword well they're okay to patrol our original it doesn't say that there are the exiled out of money through the gate through the door but you're right it does beg the question of where the bouncers always there and so he himself is functioning is okay at your like oh well of course it doesn't need stone walls it's going to have a fire law intended
 but then later down in the vision Zacharias told that the daughter of Zion which is a way of describing Jerusalem and it's a woman has a daughter rejoice and be glad for look I am coming to dwell in the middle of you and many nations will join themselves to Yahweh in that day and will become my people then I will do well probably going to get to the firewall exactly apparently the wall isn't to keep out the nation cuz the nations were actually all going to become one with got the people in the New Jerusalem so the function of the walls changes here in the walls become an emblem of the fiery Glory of Yahweh dwelling in our midst like there's the signal and they still seem protective in some way yeah. No way that's keeping people out that's right because the whole point is there are any more people to harm you because everybody
 is the harm you if it's not going to join themselves to my people and we're all going to be one of many nations is idea is no one's going to hurt me anymore yeah so this is zechariah's version of what Isaiah season Isaiah chapter 2 which is about the mountain of the House of Yahweh being established as the chief the head of all mountains all the nations will say come let us go up learntorah no more war you know we talked about this Revelation City this guy coming down and you've got the I think isn't that the images that the gates are open oceans come in actually the walls are a big focus of the vision that he has here of the New Jerusalem coming down specifically that the walls are surrounding City and that they have Gates and then he goes and talks about the 12 gates
 Pearl's that and Gates made of a single Pearl and so on so it's the city with Gates but then the the surprise there is in Revelation 21:25 there will be no night there and the gates will never be shut the perpetually open so what's the point of a wall need a while now it's just a big Jewel yeah and Yahweh is the fiery light that lights up the whole city and makes the city of Beacon the light the city on him like and they will be with the next verse and they will bring the glory and honor of the Nations will come into it
 and this is this is why they are saying there's a stream up and they're going to hang out doutora so notice we're still on this Assumption of what makes the city walls and the central Hub of religious economic and cultural life that's exactly the picture here so maybe this is about what really makes the surprise of the city is that something that's introduced into biblical story that's both the tragic result of human violence and then becomes like a hub of even greater human violence it isn't done away with in the ideal restoration it's incorporated into the restoration and redeemed and I guess that's the surprise the surprise of the thank you for that it's not a puzzle surprised that something that you humans meant for evil God turned it into a simple way of using Joseph's words in the end of Genesis that's my surprise surprise
 is that God doesn't say look we're going to go back to being Garden people and when the simplify and the problem is the city he said he's like the city is going to become a good thing yes and you can just flowing with the last chapter of the Bible here after the city and all its walls and gates are described and you hear there's a river Water of Life flowing out from the Throne of God and the lamb
 so now you've got that River that's going to make glad the city flowing out and the tree of life is there during 12 kinds of fruit and there is no longer any curse and you got humans all the nations who are ruling and serving in the Royal City it's the garden the Garden City we have a friend who wrote a book John Mark Comer go to book called Garden City in this biblical theme and then practically what does it mean to be inspired by this hope and vision as we live in our actual cities really creative exploration of the theme but that's the surprise of the city so what I would like to do is then take our many conversations this will last the kind of walk through that progression but just going to mean meditating on the relationship of the garden and the first City Kansas City cuz it's something super important there that the friend showed me once and that just like whoa
 so eliminating and then you can track through the founding of all these terrible cities cities of blood and on end of the story of Israel that's called to be a new Garden but it becomes a new city of blood and what God then does is enters into the city of blood personally and allows the city of man to kill and that becomes the drama The Dresden to the story of Jesus in the New Testament but there you go that's the that's the map that's there go to map and I think the big questions on my mind and I met other people's minds are and what does that mean for us now to live in the city because practically there's many different or how how to find the Heavenly city are we just to wait around till it shows up from the sky are we to actively kind of try to create it going to take over the cities and and make it happen is it something in between
 like what ya got to be something between do nothing or take it over
 hey Dakota saw you painting the extreme right of the end of possibilities sure what's interesting is you know that's going to be relative from City to city like how we process that living where we do will be different than our brothers and sisters living in Mexico City or Shanghai you know or on Tokyo or South Paulo
 but that's the adventure that we're on and we have this theme to really steal our imaginations and to this can become a I think of vehicles and spirit can use to provide wisdom to God's people but that begins with us meditating on the surprise of the city in the story The Bible way this is Dan going with podcast and I'm back with another bottle project introduction and I'm really excited to introduce you guys because I just met you so do you want to do some projects German that is awesome for people who aren't familiar with the German Bible project like what's an overview subscribers 660k subscribers at the moment or two to three thousand views for a video we have released all of the scripture book
