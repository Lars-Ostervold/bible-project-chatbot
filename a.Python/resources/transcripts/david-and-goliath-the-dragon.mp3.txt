we live in a world of chaos and disorder and the authors of the Bible use a common ancient image to depict this reality the sea dragon in story The Bible humans are often deceived and aligned themselves with the power of chaos and Dad and when they do they become themselves seadragons snaky monster on today's podcast we're going to look at one such monster a giant in the Bible that we know of as Goliath he has a no-ship helmet on his head negotiate the word for bronze but this spelled with the root letters of the word snake he was closed with armor of scales it's the same word to describe the scales of sea creatures and what he comes to do is publicly denounced the armies of Israel and their God he's a creature bent on destruction and then there's David a young Shepherd kid
 like that it's Nikki giant is the fame in yahweh's name and David says listen, Shepherd I have Flex based off of bear and the lion those Wilderness creatures of the land of chaos all due to this Philistine what I did to the line the bear David strikes down Goliath with a slingshot and then cuts off do I have to add with his own sword there's this huge emphasis on Goliath head which is echoing back to Genesis 3 15 does stomping on the head of the snake today to talk about the name of the chaos Monster and the story of David and Goliath I'm John Collins new listing the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hi John hello hello OK Google middle of a series of conversations we're having about the snake in the sea dragon in the storyline of the Bible rights which is a way to reflect on these powerful creatures that symbolize and actually kind of enact the creation chaos and become a way to think about what does it mean for creation itself to like fight against itself and want to pull itself back into destruction and chaos and to do that we start looking at the imagery of dragons dragons that mean yeah in the cultural narratives mythology and poetry of all of the Nations around Israel the dragon-slaying motif
 dragons represent chaos destruction disorder this is widespread this is one of the most dominant cultural stories and images around the biblical authors so no surprise that the biblical authors take up these images but then they also have refashioned them to use the symbols and make them work according to their unique convictions about the God of Israel and his purpose in the world and what creation even is in the first place it if the dark abyss the chaotic Waters is the the enemy against the order realm of humanity that God created then that there's a creature within their this just Beast that in this Mythic imagination of their neighbors and bodies the chaos Waters and becomes this just raging monster that will wants to destroy and see life and swallow up life
 and so in the biblical author's imagination this creature yes exists is in the chaos Waters that God separated from the land but actually part of God's creation and it's good yep and it's not necessarily evil and it's not really a rival of God and in the sense that it is a rival against creation then God will have to deal with that but and no way that truly like arrival to God nor is it essentially or in its nature evil cuz it can be depicted as God's rubber ducky like in Psalm 104 I can be depicted as something God is even proud of but B has a choice like the humans have a choice and what we see in Genesis 3 is the image of the snake Dragon like snake using its wisdom and status to introduce deception into
 world and to lure God's image Bears into death Embrace their own destruction that's how we traced the role of the snake in the Garden of Eden story and then in the story after that of can we introduce another twist which is humans who listen to the voice of the snake can become agents of the snake there for agents of disorder death and decreation and then man is supposed humans that are agents of the snake listening to this voice go and build cities that become Empires a nation's man you've got a recipe for the world that looks just like ours and that's essentially what we've been tracing throughout the biblical story in the story of the Pharaoh in Egypt in the store is out of the Canaanite kingdoms around is real
 as their stories are told in Exodus or judges they are depicted as human agents of the Dragon so we're going to go into the story of David can give in yet I were before we do that I asked a meta question always so there's three different ways into thinking about the same idea and we can think about them is like the three Realms of the three chaos Realms the dark abyss and Genesis 1 and then you've got the timing belt procedure that lives in the water then you got the dry Wilderness of Genesis to which is also a weighted to think of the same idea of nothingness no creation no life and the creature there is the snake snake also because it goes into holes in the ground it's kind of associated with the underworld
 run around the book that all right I should not be forgotten so they feel like completely opposite images are some connections are reptilian kind of animals but they're two different domains and in those two ways into it really get blurred to the point where like sometimes you're talkin about a snake but then it's referred to as a Sea Dragon Ball Z Dragon that is referred to as a snake and so does that the third round which we talked about it at length yeah which is the Darkness Darkness yes and not is another way a third way to think about nothing this and. Orders the darkness by saying let there be light and then he puts creatures the host of Heaven in the sky the great light for the day the Lesser life for the night and all of the stars and the stars are these creatures of the night and then so now when we talked about the creature showing up it could be a snake but it could also then be this
 sky and some way to and all of those can be depicted as good or bad yeah yeah that's right when the snake ever depicted as good a good point I need to praise God and can be used by Moses as poetry he can Envision the new creation hot with her harmless as an era of peace between humans and snag of a toddler's plan was to cover 3 Rounds 3 Rounds three three different three creatures we got hers but then it just the way that I think I just want to maybe understand like so they can all be okay here's the question if it gets Blended together then it makes me think oh okay well these are three ways to talk about some other thing and so then I wonder what is that what is that Siri thing that these are three ways in to think about
 like a creature in the domain of nothingness who then decide I'm going to drag creation back into nothing like what are we talking about what are we talking about let me just clear the waters with mud perhaps the fact so just want you to know this you identified this three rooms the sky the dark and then Sky realtors the chaos Waters and the dragon and then the desolate Wilderness and then the snake so what I'm trying to do also is do a reverse genealogy often from later books in the Bible or second temple Jewish literature for how did they get to the imagery their user so one place where we end our last conversation here is the scene in Revelation chapter 12
 where John sees a sign in the heavens of a huge great red dragon on fire with seven heads and ten horns and then on the seven heads are seven like crowns
 is tail sweeps away a third of the Stars sweeps into the Earth then he's going to go stand in front of this woman who John saw her earlier she's about to give birth to a male seed who's going to rule the Nations and he wants to eat it but then she escapes the child is snatched away and she dwells in the wilderness for three and a half years and then there's a war in the skies and the dragon is now up there with his fist Stars Angels now fighting are you guys get the imagery here
 well I don't know if you get the imagery then the dragons thrown down to the land who is the ancient serpent called the slanderer the Diablos for the opposer that's tan and he deceives the whole world
 so let's just stop like how do you make sense I guess and so I'm trying to do like that reverse engineering and all of the imagery is right there in the first chapters of Genesis but here they're all being brought together into something yes and what is that I think when I read this and maybe from just my background I think that thing is spiritual Darkness or talking about is or what we've called before spiritual evil where we were when we did the same to Demons stuff like we just started calling it
 yeah they're creatures they are creatures of the Divine realm like humans have are these the demons that Jesus encounters to like it's just that yes I mean there are certainly related where those come from there's kind of multiple explanations in ancient Judaism all of them with roots in the Bible but they have different kinds of bodies cuz their Heavenly Bodies so fundamentally different types of bodies than we do when you say heavenly bodies they're just they are when you say body to you just mean physically made up that way that's different than they have bodies and the physical out there's actually think that those bodies are a spiritual we don't mean disembodied know what I mean is their bodies this is the biblical language for they exist the real with all other ground is just take this for granted what is the favorite second for granted here it's a realm
 intelligent beings image gods in a way that's different than you and I am in Scott here on the land and they have bodies but their bodies are of the fundamentally different mode then our animal-like bodies here on the land and they actually take for granted that that realm is actually more substantial in real then you and I are here living outside leading we are the ones living in the shadow realm through the difficult we are like in the sub reality or in the simulation yes yes yeah and Angelica Are Spiritual Beings are a step closer to Ultimate Reality interesting however because they're being so we can do is take for granted because they're beings that image God of gods in mind they have intelligence will and volition and degree of Independence and they can choose fall
 Rebellion against the wisdom of God just like we can and I think that's what is being described in Genesis Chapter 3 The Twin Fall of powers and have none Earth and that's certainly how Jesus in the apostles viewed reality and the biblical story
 and what's interesting is when you ask like the what is the actual thing and the biblical authors give us these images you okay and then the other puzzle for me would you have to solve now is in what sense is their domain the darkness and the abyss and the like the nothing state which God created out of what does it mean their inhabitants of that yeah if your realm that you associate with is kind of like Defiance who you are or what you're asked her what year were going for right then these are creatures who have chosen the darkness and I got puts the stars in the darkness on neene and that's right you put someone in a cage they become a monster the create but I don't think that's the idea here I think the idea is that totally does the stars are in the darkness shining as signs you out there called sign of God's light to be
 representatives of God's light are opposed to the dark but they are in the realm that got separated so that life could flush the darkness in the cast 10K there's something there I need to understand more looks like done more but I'm okay what is important though cuz we have been using this word myth throughout our conversation the dragon-slaying myth it's important that the biblical authors are using the language of a cultural mythology miliar to them to describe something that for them is very much not a myth in the way we use the word Mariah mean like baseball or service dish in the really is something that keeps deceiving every single generation of humans in our own self ruin on a corporate and individual level and how do you explain that and there's lots of ways you could explain it one of the ways to be glasses do is to talk about
 this twin parallel Realms that are influencing each other so what is interesting is that the authors of the Hebrew Bible keep that spiritual parallelogram mostly in the background and they foreground the human drama on the land and then occasionally give little Peaks and windows into the spiritual drama but usually they linked them together through hyperlinking and wordplay and imagery last discussion was you know we have the story of a battle between a corrupt King was enslaving Israel and Israel and then when a poet reflects back on it he's like all the stars were actually at War yeah it wasn't just this King it was like yeah and the flood are the powers of the castle water so yeah so we're going to see and we're going to look at today the story of David and Goliath
 can be the same type of thing except the story is really focused on the one God has raised up to crush the head of the snake but then what we're going to do again similarly is go look at poetic retelling of the story of David and we're going to find there once again the chaos monsters at work in the behind the people that David faced so we have reflected on and read the story of David and Goliath couple times now you're too just recently in the firstborn series movie firstborn series and in the anointed read through the introduction to Goliath point out a few details some of which we talked about for some of which we have it and then focus on the victory but then really I want to get to David's poetic retelling.
 Which is awesome so to the David and Goliath story we go
so please relax now been in the land this after judges from our last conversation they've chosen the king for themselves King saw that didn't go very well and so now God has actually is raising up David and he was privately appointed as King in God's eyes in the previous story 1st Samuel 16 that's gone Samuel and Son in seven brothers who are not chosen and then this is the next story after that so it's solid still currently King David is just the shepherd kid and he's nothing special to anybody except the prophet Samuel
 sub-story just Begins the Philistines gather their camps for battle and they were gathered at the thornbush which belongs to do that
 the Philistines are the bad guys in the story and they're gathering for battle against Israel out of town called Soco which is the word thornbush eating at us right off the bat Minecraft We're battling near the thorn bush near the Wilderness and this is related to the image of when Adam and Eve were exiled from Eden they go to live and work the land and died in the land of thorns and thistles so anytime you mentioned Thorn bushes and from that point forward you know you're in the sea that much or an x-ray and it's Island so they can't between thornbush Soca and has a car with the first to soil that's been broken up like toiled so yeah yeah so they could have filled out here in the wilderness near fs-de meme which means no bloodshed
 there's a lot of blood about to be sick now saw and the men of Israel were gathered and encamped at the valley of a lie and it is that a really nice kind of terebinth tree she's a beautiful tree. It's a nice tree that can grow out in desolate areas and give you a nice shade tree in the wilderness so here we are in Busch and broken soil and no Bloodshed but saw in the men of Israel well they've got the nice Terror B tree hanging by now they formed ranks to meet the Philistines and battle the Philistines were standing on one side the army of Israel standing on the other side with a valley in between
 she's got like the nice little tree over here then you've got broken so I love it there but you can just see it where we going
 then a man of in-between went out from the camps of the Philistines this word is translated the phrase you should be nyam that literally means man of the in-between translated champion and Oliver English translation Champion interesting on the man of the in-between yeah yeah we talked about this before and then that work between that's the wisdom word right but they're beIN our being here it's you got eaten on one side and on the other in the no-man's-land like where the fate of Eden or Exile be determined but it's going to happen in between and who's this guy who's the creature so there was a guy whose name was goliat you say his name is his name
 a likely is not have Semitic Origins but it's spelled with the root letters of the word Exile interesting between a capital city now his height. I mean is what glass is most famous for it depends on what ancient version of a manuscript manuscript you have your reading if you reading the medieval Hebrew manuscripts that most of our English translations are based on is 6 cubits and a span which is around 9 foot 9 in your the tallest man alive is right now I think he's like to so that's called the masoretic text tradition what's interesting is that in the second temple. So that was a plus years before earlier
 turn the master addict extradition Jewish Scholars who spoke Greek translating the Hebrew Bible in the creek called the Septuagint and they used Hebrew manuscripts to translate into Greek in the Septuagint translation and also in ancient Jewish historian from the time of Jesus name Josephus and also Hebrew manuscripts of Samuel found in the Dead Sea Scrolls all read 4 cubits and a span namely that he's seven foot 9 in which is still play for the only know through finding bones of dead people from long ago like we were shorter back then like in general except being sick I've been sick for your six but like it's that's just kind of not sure their genetic Trends and patterns
 like 5 foot was a kind of tall person maybe 5:00 5:30 at the good country has the question among Scholars you know the sort out these kinds of things is it more likely that the Goliath got shorter or which one is the original that got changed or adapted in the other manuscript traditions and seems more likely that he would get bigger over time and a shorter is relative 7 foot 9 inches is not you know either way he's huge and this itself is a hyperlink back to the theme of the Giants in the storyline for a nonprofit the gabora Mighty Warriors
 hybrid mutant offspring of the sons of God in the daughters of Adam and you've got figures like Nimrod and Gilgamesh Giant Warrior Kings this is a Trope in the motif of mutant Offspring on the land the illicit Union of Heaven on Earth in the production of human ruler or Champion the man of the in-between he's not my son is reading for Samuel right now and we meet on Fridays for lunch we talked about what is red in the last week so we are talking about the story is literally the last Friday so I will talk about all kinds of stuff and he's asking about the armor and all of this and so he put his question is the end
 was like so will God show Mercy on Goliath
 I thought it was such a good question cuz I took it as a backwards compliment that like okay I think I've been talking about Jesus enough to my kids and how he helped Jesus taught his followers to treat their enemies that I think he's he's wrestling with that tension of like will even if Goliath is an anime like their love for him to under the guidance of the valley even with your head cut off anyway but the point is is his humanness is clearly being be emphasized in his monstrous qualities are being brought to the fore he has a no-ship helmet on his head a sneaky helmet and Natasha the word for bronze but it's spelled with the the root letters of the word snake and that words confuse for X to describe Goliath he was closed with armor of scales
 Kayleigh armer not all the translations have the word scales in there but it's the same word to describe specifically the scales of sea creatures in the impurities food list and also in the Book of Ezekiel there's a big sea dragon with the same scale as was pulled out of the Nile with all the fishing at Scales I got his body armor with five thousand shekels he had no horseshit Grieves on his legs and Associates Scimitar slung between your shoulders and then I have severe than the shaft of the spear like a Weaver's beam alright well let's stay out of the valley and what he comes to do is publicly denounced the armies of Israel and their God so he's a creature bent on destruction
 and not just on destruction but on defamation of the name of God so of course David is you know raised up and he comes to give his brother some food and he's like this guy can't talk about Israel in the god of Israel that way and so Saul hears about this Punk kid who's liked mouthing off from the ranks about the Giant and so he's he brings David into his tent and Lisa punk rock here and saw says to David your kid and David says listen you know I'm a Shepherd I have Flex paste off a bear and the lion out in the wilderness before and you know when I saw them I attacked and killed them
 and all due to this Philistine what I did to the line the bear so does wilderness creatures of the land of chaos Croucher the crouchers yeah I've taken care of that before so this guy will be like them she's comparing glass us specifically so then in the victory scene when David comes to do his thing the Goliath there's this huge emphasis on Goliath head which is going back to Genesis 3 15 out of stomping on the head of the snake so we're told that he took a sling Stone from his bag he struck the Philistine on his forehead the stone sank pharaoh and his armies thank into the chaos Waters like a stone now here is a stone sinking into his forehead not good that's for sure a hyperlink then he fell with his face on the ground
 that is his mouth in the dust interesting the snake will eat dust yes yes David ran over and stood over the Philistine took his own so he took the instrument of death from the monster and he killed him and cut off his head with it David then took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem when David return from striking the Philistine Abner took him to solve the head of the Philistine in his hand so there's a huge focus on the head of the monster you're saying that the board because the idea Genesis 3 is that the seed of the woman will come and strike the head of the snake you got it yep that's so if you're interested in pursuing snake imagery in Samuel more and just so you know that I'm not crazy there's a scholar Brian Verrett who did a whole study on this just called the serpent in Samuel A Messianic Motif and what he shows
 how there's many human characters that are David's opponents throughout the narrative that are described using snake imagery or language but just happens the glass is the first one in David story
 so as has been our practice last few episodes there's a narrative but then what I want to do is go look at poetic retellings of a narrative to see what kind of imagery they use to retile the tile in that case we have another version at the end of David's life or near the end in 2nd Samuel chapter 22 and atlases died then I got to see how it works
 so begins David spoke to Yahweh the words of the song on the day y'all way to liberate him from the hand of all his enemies including glass and also from the hand of Saul and he said Yahweh is my rock my Fortress and my deliverer I take refuge in God my rock and my shield the strength of my salvation my stronghold my refuge o my Saviour you will save me from violence I call upon Yahweh he's worthy of praise and I am saved by those who hate me he's clearly calling up many times Goliath was just the first of which
 unless you count the bear in the line of God where are there some danger threat and he was rescued so what you expect us maybe a retelling of one of those for breaker waves of death engulfed me to the chaotic ocean imagery currents of chaos the ropes of the Grave to all entangled me the snares of death confronted me about this simulation is conversation a snake you can go down a little hole in it goes down there under the land and this is also like it's under the ground It's associated with the chaos Waters that are under the ground to correct yeah that's right so right at the moment you think he's going to tell a story about encountering some nasty humans what do you describe storm Waters and these
 chords coming up from the ground and dragging him into the gray of horror movie image run into these before in the Bible that's like McCords do you like this isn't the only place the ropes is she older than what what is that what it what is that in the yasso Eden humans begin by emerging out of the dirt yeah called forth by God's word and hands and his breath and then they stand up so to come up from the dust because of God's creative act but to return to the dust it's like getting pulled back in the back in what are the antwoord's dragging yeah it's like it's inevitable it's like a trap and then you can't at the snares of death you can't escape it we're all everyday like everyday you
 you look around and then you could just see a hand popping up out of the ground trying to get you back in something like that so in my distressed I called upon your way
 oh my God I called and he heard my voice from his Temple this is Jonas prayer yes or you can say Jonah's prayer is following a keto promote we talks about that he heard me from this heavenly Temple and being entangled and then she all and then he's like and then I called out to Yahweh the earth and the foundations of the Skies trembled and heaved because of his anger smoke went up from his nostrils fire came out from his mouth burning coals devoured they burn from him this is the cosmic Firestorm dad's coming what's going to follow is a description of Yahweh that sounds just like the descriptions of bail
 where's marduke for the different storm Gods depicted in the classic dragon-slaying best smoke and fire meaning clouds and lightning he bowed the heavens and he came down about the meaning of like clouds peeling off and swirling down because Michelle got sick clouds under his feet as he rode upon a cherub and flew he was seeing on the wings of the wind he made Darkness a canopy around him a collection of stick rain clouds storm God showing up wow okay I'll wait here so what happens when the storm God comes
 well usually it means a battle against the monster sea monster
 from the brightness before him flamed burning coals of fire yahweh's thundered from heaven the most high altered his voice he sent arrows this is what my dick against his turning so again in the Babylonian version of the dragon-slaying mess and very famous epic poem called in noumea leash Market Patron God of Babylon two seats the cows Waters by blowing wind down a big monsters throat and then sending arrows down her throat and her name is Tim at which is the same Semitic warm water salt water and it's the same Semitic word underneath the Hebrew word to home
 which is the abyss Abyss water Soaker so now here and he scattered them lightning and he directed them
 no not work on time by David enemies again then the channels of water of the sea were exposed foundations of the world exposed at the rebuke of Yahweh from the blast of the breath of his nostrils is this the idea of the separating land from water again yeah he's got you always blowing so much air out of his nose and that it's like pushes back the sea in 3/8 of a realm on which you can found the dry land in ss15 and that it's the windows nostrils right yes that blows the sea yes open so it's fascinating is
 a good example of the biblical authors adopt the language of Norm God but then always adapting and tweaking it towards their unique exceptions and claims about the goddess realm so right at the moment where you expect to see the dragon it's just the waters okay but that's not completely out of touch because the dragon is the waters pretend it's in the water is this associated with yep but also is the embodiment of the waters and the language of Deliverance and rescue is about part splitting the waters to create dry land and that's not out of scope either in terms of the storm. He's like filets open sore like Sea Dragon those particular images the volume is turned up on them I think because of the unique the Israelite way of talking about you always power over chaos
 was shaped by the historical experience with what happened at the Sea of reeds and also I think influence the ways of talking about creation splitting the waters to drive by and can emerge those are ideas already out there but they're uniquely a sized in biblical literature
 so what happens then is Yahweh sent from a high position and took me he drew me up out of the waters and he actually this phrase drew me this verb is in the same verb used to describe what Pharaoh's daughter did to Moshe she says I named him mush at cuz I must be tee him up out of the water and today was describing himself like Moses being taken up out of the water he delivered me from my enemies before they just been waves chords of death he delivered me from those who hate me from those more Mighty than me but y'all way with my support he brought me to a spacious place he saved me because of his Delight
 so we're retelling all of these stories every time David got saved from an enemy were reflecting back on something meta like the cosmic is a story that was happening over and over and over again is really an image of some bigger drama at work in the world and hear the focus is on the deliverance and victory of God's chosen one over the girls water is a monster most difficulty the waters glass was the first of these enemies so the character described as like a snake is not here described as the chaos Waters that need to be blasted by always nostrils most of David's enemies afterwards or just kind of his family and like those real son that's right it's all in his
 that's all and it seems like the psalm is is thinking about everyone who's David's been like countering his enemies but you're saying let's keep Goliath in the Forefront of my mind cuz he was the first enemy that they've had the sleigh and he was very clearly depicted as a snake of the in-between Manza the cast creature and in this poem when David's encountering an enemy it's very clearly yeah chaos Waters yeah a force of chaos both from the waters and from the underworld trying to drag him down into the land
 so yeah this poem takes the particulars of like one story or set of stories in David's life and wants to see some bigger drama being played out in them which is that Yahweh
 will deliver his chosen one from Death itself in order to overcome the forces of death and chaos and deliver his Chosen One into a nice little spacious High Rock it's a delightful Place presumably so that he can do through that one something good on behalf of many others but that is how the story will continue to unfold
 but the symbolic imagination at work here that's inviting us to see greater forces at work in the day-to-day experiences that we have some greater drama greater forces at work okay and this is where we began what are we talkin about what are these greater forces at work because it can feel like oh I'm fighting against my brother I'm fighting against who I just think is my enemy but there's this story underneath or might even say above which is now you're actually the real and counter here is something else yeah you know here's where my mind goes Jesus
 mine was shaped imagination was shaped by these columns in these stories you know the lot the night that he was betrayed he's sitting at a table with his followers and he's talking about how I'm one of you is going to betray me and Peter speaks up he's like I'm with you in Jesus and this isn't Luke's account Luke 22 verse 31 Jesus says to him Simon Simon you know what the Satan has made a request to sift you like wheat brother I've been praying for you that your faithfulness will not fail
 so he's anticipating the Peters going to have some moment where space is going to be tested as stressed as allegiance to Jesus, Joe kind of thing yeah and you know what can I get my way with this guy because I have a second with Peter yeah yeah let's see on Facebook. But imagining here's a moment of choice do I have the weather Hill would be loyal to his Rabbi and friend and that choice wait aren't you the man who was with him right in the courtyard by the fire when he has an opportunity to say yes I am allied with Jesus yeah he says I don't know the man that is accepted that moment is the cosmic mirror that about that is being tested like job before God
 and then later when Jesus is arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane when he sees the soldiers coming what he says to them and these are Jewish soldiers coming from the temp saying what you coming at me like I'm a criminal like a bandit here Robinhood kind of figure I've been with you in the temple every day and you didn't stretch out your hands against me and he says but this hour belongs to you and to the power of Darkness the Jesus he's a monster coming at him in the form of Jewish temple guards like his brothers
 so I think something like this is what it means to see the world in these Cosmic terms there's a bigger story and then of course what Paul says is your enemy is not not flesh and blood not flesh and blood but what did you say it is it's the what's the word he uses since he was as a whole bunch of points against the rulers authorities world powers of this Darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the skies in the armor of the Messiah so yeah this is this is a foreign way to view the world for many people who talk about the dragon is to talk about
 a reality
 that underneath the evil that we experience or even can participate in is a deep menacing dark power
 that we can be ruled by and they can do damage and it can kind of sewing body people and cultures it's hard to distinguish between yes yeah they gave that is that my brother hating me or is that something else underneath and then internally like within Peter when I try to hit my brother or sister it's like is that me or is that some other thing working in and threw me to lead to disorder and Chaos in this relationship or in my community
 it's like nobody's innocent here we're all caught in the web as it were
 goodnight that's the portrait of The Human Condition and then the story of David you know is really a sizing this theme of but what if there was one who really knew how to handle the snake across its head and liberate us out of the chaos Waters in The Realm of the snares of the Grave take us up and set our feet on a high place of the light I would be cool if somebody was able to do that and I think that's what the stories of David are designed to just keep tantalizing that longing and drive the story forward further into the writings of the prophets and that's where we're going next
