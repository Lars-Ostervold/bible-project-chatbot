when a Jewish synagogue finishes reading the Torah together they end by throwing a big party it's called simchat Torah the podcast Tim and I want to have a little celebration of our own because together with all of you we've read the Torah we want to reflect on this reading Journey we've had and we want to look forward and talk about how to continue to read the Hebrew Bible to the prophets and the writings and the way that we've read it together so today on the podcast our own simchat Torah there might even be dancing thanks for joining us here we go
 hey John it's the end of the year yes it is and we are coming back to having finished reading through the tour this whole year 2022 has been dedicated to a podcast Series going through the five school start in January we've got a week-by-week movement by movement through the Torah doing question response at the end a double question response yet last week and so there's a few weeks left in the air and one of the things we wanted to do was just celebrate stop and celebrate yes we did it yeah and I we we mean all of you who have been listening to the podcast we all did it and then a whole bunch of you listen to podcast have also been doing the Torah reading experience the
 I created in our app throughout this year by project ab and so has been a guided reading experience through the first five books of the Hebrew Bible is a way to go if you have listened and or read through the Torah it's a significant investment of time and mental energy depending on you and so way to go it's at its very significant if only there were some way to celebrate having accomplished something like this getting read through the door okay well John let me tell you a story I mentioned on then that Jessica and I was many years ago before we had kids went to go live in Jerusalem for a year apart of graduate school Swiss the 2006-2007 school year and we had a small apartment did you have a smartphone
 who was that was like the year that came out you know what we got two little Nokia phones I was a super little tiny ones are phones we didn't have them we got them for the year we were there the bricks till it was Tiny and felt like it's the size of my Toyota like key fob for my car all the boys to text you cuz every every button was three potential letters I had to click through anyway I had a Nokia that's how we will cuz when we got back when we moved back to the States you start seeing we didn't have them anymore and we were like oh man we we got to do that now so then we signed up for something anyway I don't go through your first cell phones. We got cell phones to live in Jerusalem in them
 wow to keep it landline okay yeah I was old fashioned thinking like I feel like the iPhone came out with your dumb phone okay yes so we had a little apartment in West Jerusalem and I forget the time of year was in the winter so is like you know how dark can a cooler and I grew up in Jerusalem snowed one time so I forget what we were doing we're doing something in our apartment making dinner or something and you know how when you hear a car drive by that has someone to put thousands of dollars into the sound system in the car approaching with heavy heavy bass is going on and we lived on a little side street Celtic what's really weird why would a car be coming through and so we looked at our way
 and we were not kind of a roof unit was so with slanted walls and so it was like an angled Skylight roofs and so we looked at our Skylight roof and all I could see was like colored light turning on the street below so we ran downstairs and there were just a few dozen felt like a hundred this is packing the street people like dancing and singing and all jostling around to this loud Bassy music surrounding a van and the van and had huge mounted speakers on it facing out so it was actually that's why it sounded so loud it was they were inside the car they were mounted on the sides of the van and then I had this
 disco ball type spinning with lighting of the street on the top of the van but not mirror pieces but it was just dozens of colored lights being lit up from within the spinning around and there's all these people jostling around and so it's just like house music but like kind of in a Jewish style house music and all the women were where I had head coverings and we're wearing like dark dresses and then all the men had these Eastern European style robes many of them had the long you know what kind of hair locks on the side and we're wearing. Hat and they were all dancing and then if you became very clear they were all circling around this one guy in the front who's carrying this huge scroll scroll with the big silver crown on the top
 and they were just dancing Just Dance on the street so I went down and ask one person like what is going on and this woman said that they were it was simchat Torah the phrase simchat Torah and SIM card building its Joy of Torah so many synagogues are such a kind of like in the Christian tradition there's develop with called the lectionary cycle were in the Sunday Gatherings those readings read from often it's the prophet Torah prophets and gospels of something and so in many synagogue Traditions they operate on a 1-year or a three-year Torah reading cycle
 in the Shabbat Gathering something is it to the Jewish calendar year Gatherings and it's tied off of actually in the last chapters of Deuteronomy Moshe Moses talk about reading every seven years gather and read the Torah beginning to end everybody so it's not developed into like a lectionary tradition and then every time they finish a synagogue finishes the Torah they do is simchat Torah celebration and so they had begun from their synagogue they were looping all around the neighborhood and then would end back at their synagogue and then just have a huge puddle big feast and it was so amazing so if we had a thought this through we could have organized the big dance party a dance party right now we could say we're talking about it. State only so I feel like we can up the game at least a little bit some of the people on a podcast team thought wouldn't it be fun to just take a moment
 have our own Bible project version of simchat Torah to celebrate celebrate finishing a meditation year through the Torah so yeah I kind of have this idea where I feel like we're not altogether having a dance party but I guess wherever you are we're going to play we're going to play some simchat Torah more music yet and you can dance yes if you did this with us and you want to dance grab your Torah and it's going to be in your Bible on your phone so I guess you can grab it wherever he up and dance around and celebrate our journey to the joy of torai under 1 and 2 and a 1/2
 8 Ball Pool
I really hope somebody just like parked their car
 thank God I have the tightest Dancing Yeah Yeah Yeah I had a cool dance party moment with your family on your own and if some people listened podcast what they wash dishes maybe just they're in the kitchen just dance party yeah so we thought in this end of your episode and simchat Torah celebration episode we would also named a fact that we are not going to be continuing on doing reading Journeys in the podcast Journeys through the prophets going into the year 2023 and we've heard from many of you listen up I guess you would love us to do that and that would be really fun to do like we could we could just keep going to start in Joshua next year and Joshua we would do the same thing
 does movement skip is literary units we could trace themes we can see how it all connects to the bigger story yet and it would be bad but it would be rash and probably one day we will do something for many people they're going to be hearing about this right now okay for the first for the first time do we need to tread lightly
 yeah I mean I think I would have noticed a few people I have told kind of disappointed about it and I said that they were sad and so two things one is going to be okay we'll get to it also we got some really cool conversations coming on Sunday themed videos and then also yeah there will be a time to do it secondly though you can continue to read through the Bible you won't have I guess this is a dialogue partner as you go but Tim you're going to show us how the thing that we've been doing does it end here and how this stuff that happened in the Torah is going to get picked right up and Joshua and through those stories all the way through the whole shape of the Hebrew Bible so this conversation we're just going to do like an overview of how the core themes of the Torah
 watch into the prophets and then into the writings to the two main subsections the rest of the Tanakh and by that we meditate on a few paragraphs write at the transition between the Torah and the prophets and then the transition between the prophets and the writings and these are insights that were pointed out to me long like at the beginning of me going down the rabbit hole biblical studies so many people have drawn attention to these seams were transitions between the macro parts of the Tanakh but lo and behold it's the language in the vocabulary all dialed in to what's been happening in the Torah with just dialed in what's happening in the Garden of Eden so we want to at least give you some inspiration to keep on reading through the Torah and Prophets and we will catch up and join you in the podcast one day in the future over this year about how the Torah is a designed well-designed hole and that Genesis Deuteronomy form the
 balanced book and see if you've been following along you've heard us talk about this many times I d i x yeah 5 Scrolls 1 ml are in it and it's a three-part Mega thing with Genesis do my screen three parts Genesis Deuteronomy or parts 3 + 11 + 33 without a frame and then in the center is as big complex thing called Exodus Leviticus Numbers which is so awesome how it solve wire together but significant for what we're doing is how Genesis 12 11 which is first movement of the Genesis scroll and then Deuteronomy basically 27 through 34 are the two places in the Torah where the language of blessing and curse and the themes of Exile being inside or outside of a garden land are like really prominent
 but in different ways so in Genesis 12 11 God puts his human Partners in a garden land blesses them they forfeit that blessing through Folly bring curse upon the land and our exiled from eating until God's on this mission to keep choosing one of the future descendants to restore that Ethan blessing when you come to the conclusion of Deuteronomy it's a bunch of people poised on the edge of a garden land about to go back into it cuz they've been in exile for a long time
 and Moses warns them of the disastrous curse consequences if they are faithful to their Covenant with Yahweh but also of the Eden blessings that will pour out on them if they do and so it's as if the people of Israel was Moses at their lead at the end of the Torah and I was like poised about to return to the promised land but it's all going to hinge on how they respond to the command in the voice of Yahweh interesting as book ends you've got the Story begins with Humanity in the garden land with a Torah which is eat of every tree except for the street and get a bad and trust me for that and then
 they're exiled from the garden land and then that so that's how that's the first yes look and you go to the end and it's there now poised outside the garden garden land and they've been given a new Torah to then we'll allow them to prosper as a go back in but it's inverted inverted yeah which is kind of payment can makes it feel like a mirror right of each other school so yeah there's real beautiful symmetry there for how the Torah begins and ends and also recalled the way back and on the Genesis and there was a promise that that Exile would be somehow addressed undone resolved in some way through a future seed a descendant of the woman's lineage and the Torah has been following like intensely through all the genealogies keeping a particular lineage
 in front of you from Adam to Noah from Noah's Abraham Abraham to Isaac Jacob and then that's kind of a showdown between Joseph and Judah but Jacob's 12 sons two of which are Joseph and Judith and then becomes the kingly line that's right which we aren't to the stories of the Kings yet but yeah he becomes like a a royal leader of the tribes and the seed of the woman promised gets attached to his his lineage so you keep reading becomes important because well he's important as of rival brother of Judah and what God does with Joseph
 is at the poem at the end of Genesis applied as an image of what God will do with a future see it from the Lion of Judah so Joseph becomes a narrative image of that future see it coming from Judas wine so this is going to come from Judaism line but Joseph is a going to do Joseph like stuff just to buy stuff and then of course we then get into Exodus Leviticus Numbers were introduced to the Levites who become specifically descendants of Levi Moses and Aaron and then of those two is the most important front of us as one with power over the snake turns into a snake and God gives him power to grab it and math drill bit Yeah through Moses god brings down the biggest baddest snake in the story so far too great a king Pharaoh yep destroy them in the waters and then Moses becomes
 this heaven on Earth mediator who can Ascend into heaven and see God's back and no God face to face Moses Getting access to the Garden Space Mountain Garden Mountain god of the cosmic Mountain Garden zactly heaven on Earth that appears on Mount Sinai but then that heaven on Earth Garden present shifts from the top of the mountain to hovering over the sacred 10th and Moses is the primary mediator even though there is a high priest in the mix high priest is my daughter his brother in the golden calf store and so Moses ends up being the powerful narrative image of the seed of the woman with power over the snake but then Moses has his own failures in the wilderness Exile and so by the time we reach the end of Deuteronomy he's saying goodbye to them
 and so is it actually perfect segue then gets his many speeches to the Israelites and then here is the last last paragraph and this is important but we're eating is not just the last paragraph of Deuteronomy it's the last paragraph of the Torah we did go through this already in the podcast yeah so he gets taken up on the high mountain he sees the land that the Israelites again inherit and then he dies outside the land and seems like God bury him and nobody knows where is Barry to this day
 but there's nine this is Kate Joshua the son of moon was full of the spirit of wisdom because Moses placed his hands on him
 nothing important symbolic ritual of appointing someone as your representative we talked about that last week and actually you can see the effect of it it says it's an end Israelites listen to do Joshua
 and they did just as Yahweh commanded Moses so now listening to Joshua is like listening to Moses Joshua's this new representative yet the Moses who is the representative of humanity forgot our Israel so Joshua is the new Moses is the New Haven it's going to lead them back into the Cardinal and see your likes okay maybe this is the guy because Moses has been talking about like a servant who's going to come through we think maybe this is bad guy well I mean what he is Moses anticipated in his poems was there would be a long history of Israel Covenant betrayal that would lead to destruction Doom but that God there would be a group in Israel that would make me faithfulness called the servants the servants so with that forecast in our minds Joshua up years and you like uh maybe this is going to be the leader of Faithful Servants and we're just have to read his story and see what happens now
 what was funny. So after you see up Joshua Bright Hopes for the future then you get first 10 which tells you you know but there has never again Arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses you know the one who knew y'all a face-to-face and all the signs and wonders and mighty Deeds like what he did in Egypt all that stuff yeah that person's never come to kind of like so maybe Joshua wasn't sore as I thought he was going to be kind of deflates these hopes attached to Joshua 1 verse 9 and the stores in continual Joshua but we know Siri was not not the one he was up he didn't do better than Moses write and Moses is the closest we got up to the snake rushing
 the seed of the woman so the fact that Joshua is described as a new Moses cuz he's his replacement and the people now listen to Joshua that's the way that they listen to Yahweh like they did three Moses so it's very clearly portrays Joshua the new Moses and there's never been anybody like most childlike you taking over but I think it's part of the strategy for how the Hebrew Bible Works which is okay so now you're set up to see the Book of Joshua which comes next set up not to see Joshua as like he's the Messiah but he is like a Joseph figure in fact he's from the line of Joseph and he becomes a narrative image of the new Humanities victory over the snake and going into the garden land but it tells you from the beginning that it wasn't the final deal is it was just a partial realization
 so that's how the tour ends anticipating a future Moses like profit and Moses had a tall man he was like a profit but he was losing charge yeah he was a a ruler and leader among the people so he was soupy was like he was recovering the Adam and Eve Royal Priestly calling the with that we closed the Torah scroll and we open up a next call which is Joshua in both the Hebrew Bible and Christian Bibles stop there for a second because it's this will still be new to a lot of people there's a different ordering of Scrolls or the X yeah yeah your English Old Testament and in the Hebrew Bible Tanakh arrival not different Scrolls same same scroll sames Crow laws different arrangement
 and we have a video that walks through that but let's quickly tag at like what is the shape of a Hebrew Bible so the Torah is 3rd and then come the middle section which is split into two parts but it's just the prophets and sewed the Tanakh member of the acronym Torah and then never what's the word for prophets and then kept of him just the word for writings and then you put a little a in between the the profits are split into two there's four works then called the former prophets nuts Joshua Judges Samuel and kings and it's confusing to think of these as prophetic books because I think a prophetic books I think of the what what you're calling the ladder profits which are clearly like here's a bunch of apocalyptic poetry and crazy prophets doing crazy thing right
 right where Joshua Judges Samuel Kings The Narrative account historical narrative stories of Israel's entry into the land
 that's how it begins with Joshua and then in the last paragraphs of Kings it's about the Exile of Israel and their defeat by Babylon in their Exile out of the land who are they called considered prophetic books yet so it's retelling the story of Israel's time in the promised land told from the perspective of the prophets so anytime you tell a story from an angle a certain perspective and so there are many ways that you could tell the story of Israel's history in the land and the prophets tell that story of one of consistent Covenant betrayal and failure leading them to go right back out of the land from where they came in history of failure with the number of bright spots of different Cycles in generations of key leaders throughout the story is if it's hand-in-glove with the second half of the profits which is another for Scrolls of the prophet
 Isaiah Jeremiah is he Keel and the scroll of the twelve and not surprised if it's 8 Scrolls 80 the prophets in your English Bible that's going to be there split apart well they're not together so they're not all contained in one area correct and it's not eat books it's actually yeah totally cuz the 12 minor Prophet all get their own the car all counted as separate books and then hurricanes and Samuel are split into because they're just big Scrolls correct so what are you got Samuel Samuel splitting the first Samuel so you want to you got six 6 + 1512 + 321 on the quick so my 21 books in my English Bible that are they start here where Joshua starts but then
 at one point they turn over towards the writings and then it ends with the latter prophets correct where in the Hebrew Bible you go straight from the former prophets which I think of is a historical books and what you're saying the written from the point of view the prophets and arguably so is the Torah and then and then so and the latter prophets all begin with little like heading little narrative introductions so division of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke in the days of the middle name a bunch of times and Kings it's on and all that's just a big glowing hyperlink back to the former profit so the profits are all bound together telling you a story from one end to another and then going back and presenting for Scrolls giving you the words and poetry and and writings of key figures during those times that
 hyperlink back to different moments within the history that you just read that it's bound together real tightly reflects this perspective that one is real was unfaithful to the Covenant but God didn't abandon Israel in the land is relax them stage to go in the lands they're going to go in the land and instead of becoming the image of God in the garden land like feeling this Covenant promise with God they abandon it. So that's what they banned and so God can keep handing them over to decreation and ruin and Covenant cursed and so on and they just consistently don't get the cliff Israelites don't and so it comes about in the old leads up to the ultimate we're not dogging on the Israelites this is like wow this is the story of humanity exactly where meditating on human nature
 and Humanities Exile from heaven on Earth by retelling how all these Generations the character yes are themselves forfeiting eaten over and over and over and over again throughout the history leading to the ultimate loss of Eden which is Israel's Exile from the garden land and then the prophets come along and reflect on that and say yeah here's why happened and then they also said but you always purpose for creation and first coven of people transcends even their own failure and he's going to create a new covenant family through home he's going to restore the blessing to the world and send to that snake crushing seed and so the ladder prophets really 68 cool so here's what I thought we'd do we looked at the book ends of the Torah
 what if we just looked at the two bookends of the profits which is the opening of Joshua opening of Joshua and then the last paragraph of Malachi which is the last prophet in the end just like there's all this electricity between the beginning and end of the Torah there's a lot of electricity between the beginning and end of the prophets and those beginnings and endings of the prophets have all this electricity with the beginning and ending of the Torah it's all Super Hyper link together so let's do that right now but the transition to reading the beginning and ending.
okay Joshua chapter 1 2 1 let's just dive in and it came about after the death of Moses the servant of y'all remember him then you always said to Joshua son of nun the assistant of Moses saying my servant Moses is dead already knew that and no rise up cross the Jordan you and all the people in the land that I'm giving to them the Israelites every place the soles of your feet will tread I've given it to you just like I said to Moses from the Wilderness in this Lebanon up to the great river Euphrates the land of the Hittites up to the great sea in the west that's really far north this will be your territory superpharm the big territory here this is a bigger territory than Israel ever like possessed and this is a whole puzzle
 we talked about this number this came up earlier this year there's two sets of descriptions of the promised land in the Torah one of them is fantastically huge and this isn't an example and then one of them is a little more realistic that actually describes the lands the tribes actually come to possess in this book so what's interesting is the fantastically huge borders when they're described their described in Genesis 15 what's the numbers I think Deuteronomy and then right here usually there are Eden hyperlinks or vocabulary in it in the fantastically huge descriptions and there's one staring at his right here the mention of the river Euphrates that's one of the four rivers of Eden of Eden that's right or the one river goes out of Eden turns into four turns into 4
 so you're going to cross the river and possess this land the boundaries of which was one of the connection points for the shape of the land of Eden when you get these fantastically huge list of the borders of the promised land I think it's the narrator portraying the promised land as an Eden Garden land and this is a good example of no one will stand before you all the days of your life just as I was with Moses so I will be with you in other words it's very clear you're like the next Moses like one for the moment you are like Moses I won't fail you and I won't forsake you be strong and courageous you'll give the people the land as an inheritance just like I swore to give them okay so then are you thinking okay so we're going to go in and there's going to be some conflict there's people there they're going
 try and stand against you and every where you tread I'm going to give you the land but you know you're going to have to work for it or you getting that it says no one will stand before you owe no one well okay but that's in anticipation of the fact that there's going to be lots of people who resist them but none of them are going to win it all going to lose at least promise here so so be strong across the whole thing is get ready the whole book of Joshua has the flavor of a military campaign to it
 so what is the instruction that Yahweh gives to Captain planning a military campaign for 7 to be strong and courageous to keep to do the whole Torah the Moses my servant commanded you to keep to do the whole Torah to do that's right to make and that word keep is one of the words of the job description of Adam and Eve in in the barkeep and work the garden to work it and to keep it and then God gives them a command Joshua to keep to do the whole Torah that Moses my servant commanded you again this is the language of going into eating and living by God's command and by God's instruction do not turn aside from it to the right or to the left
 don't you care to talk about just just you but you do the word do the word so that you may have success wherever you go this Scroll of the Torah will not depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night but we usually associate the phrase meditate on the tour day and night with someone that we talked about that and there's an important relationship but it appears first quietly out loud to yourself as you read and memorize something
 and what's the purpose of that quiet meditation so that you may keep to do all the threads in it then you will prosper in the way you go and you will have success didn't I command you be strong and courageous Don't Be Afraid yeah is with you wherever you go the instruction given to this guy is about to lead a military campaign is to become a scholar become a student of the Torah become a student and meditate on the Torah that's the instruction and to do it boldly that's right so there's something going on here we're so we're presuming there's a whole bunch of stuff in the tour that I guess they're going to be helpful and there are going to be all the stuff we talked about in Deuteronomy about portraying the Canaanite seven Canaanite tribes
 like Nikki people that need to be exiled from the land and that's what Josh was going to lead the people to do but there's a whole lot of other stuff in our version of the Torah, what's Josh are we going to do with all that you know but it's apparently going to shape him into the kind of person who just knows how to live by the well if y'all way so what's interesting is here's our first post Moses figure and he's portrayed as being called to this ideal leadership role to lead the people into the land and the most prominent thing about this character in this job description is that he is to be at meditator on godson written instruction so there's this is for Joshua is a character with the story but we're also
 I think it being given a portrait here by the final framers of the whole Tanakh of what the ideal posture is of God's people as we are still waiting for our entry into the garden land and its to pick up a Joshua like to be strong and courageous and to keep and do the Altura in other words Joshua being told to do this but we have this feeling that he's a model for the reader as something for the apostrophe for the reader to adopt as we have the reader ways to go into the garden with the opening paragraph of the offense with hold all that in mind and let's go to the final paragraph of the profits and we just talked about the prophet sir Joshua chapter Samuel Kings
 Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and then the 12th just means going to the very end of Malachi but think through what is in all of that and then history that I'm going to how many centuries are we talking about well depends on when you date events at the Book of Joshua so some people debate it's 11:46 Century so it's bad in the middle the castes around the 12:00 and then it Narrows down to the exiled to Babylon which happened 586 South about a sick little over six hundred years stretch but then somewhere in there was King David and then there's three prophets at the end of the 12 prophets haggai Zechariah Malachi and there are all located
 after the people first returned to the land from Babylon oh yeah as in the days of attorney and that's part of the writing's the book The Story of Us her name is in the writing the three prophets who were did their thing in those days are in the end of the prophets of the van that takes you another hundred years forward into the light 504 Anna so it's like you know a long many many centuries ago so we're going to go to the last paragraph of Malachi fast for like a hundred years is standing in the day when Israel has some of Israelites have returned back to the land and they staked out a life in Jerusalem Israel call the second temple. Because they rebuild you rebuild the Temple to Temple and Malachi is convinced that what's happening in the temple is just totally offensive DIY
 this new Temple the new priesthood is offensive to Yahweh that some things don't change something yeah that people and the way they worship Yahweh they allow Injustice in the land and so Malachi says you know what that thing that happened was Babylon that was just the lead-up to like the bigger even more bigger badder decreation that Yahweh is coming and he calls it the day of the Lord Malachi 3:6 says you know there were some who fear Yahweh
 some just some not everybody so we're not all this real is Israel that's a phrase in Hebrew to describe the person who instead of choosing good and bad on their own terms like yep goes to Yahweh and says give me wisdom give me with done and I will see are you in the best way possible and do what you say so there's a crew Malachi's describing a crew with in Israel that are the ones who fear Yahweh and they get together and then when they talked together you always listens and Pierce them
 and so a scroll of remembrance was written before him before you about those who fear Yahweh and who love to meditate on his name up under his name is a different word here cuz it's not a guy hold it for front of your attention so there's a screw with in Israel who fear Yahweh and these are the servants I think so yeah yeah and what they love to do is to ponder The Scroll of remembrance which is I think the reference to Wells were going to see it to the to the Torah to the store just wait for it then what we're told is a little quote from Yahweh is what Yahweh of host says they would be mine they are my treasured possession
 I will have compassion on them as a man as compassion on his son who is this servant so there's a day coming you always going to do something on the day and this crew that actually fears him they will become the treasured possession not the big glowing hyperlink to the Torah House of Israel to Mount Sinai and says keep my Covenant with make a covenant I brought you out of all the nations to be my people keep my Covenant and if you do you will be for me a kingdom of priests and holy nation and a treasured possession of so in other words all of Israel has proven themselves unfaithful to the Covenant but there's this crew of those who fear Yahweh in love to meditate on his name and they love to hear the scroll read before them and those are yahweh's Covenant people
 3 like a subset within this realm so on that day when you always does this what we're told is you will see a distinction between the righteous and the wicked you'll see a distinction between the one who serves God and one who does not serve God because look the day is not who's the you hear who is Malachi talking to his God still talk cuz it's mentioning God in the third person so it seems like it's Malachi again talking to those who fear the lord and on the day of the Lord that's coming there's going to be this distinction is a separation between the righteous and the Wicked the Servants of God and those who don't actually serve God or the day is coming burning like an oven and all the arrogant and everyone who does wickedness will become stubble like chaff that the wind like
 Jesus without this I've heard Jesus you hear Jesus talked a lot about separating the wheat from the chaff from the sheep and the goats sheep in the and reading Malachi here in light of what we talked about what Moses predicted this is very centered in Israel story Jesus was coming and say what there's going to be a group of people going to stay faithful and they I'm finding them I'm getting that crew yeah yeah and they just makes what Jesus was saying like so much clearer could totally write the fact that there's this crew than Israel the calls themselves the god-fearers who love to meditate on the name and their the righteous these are the people from whom the Tanakh comes yeah this is The Minority Report krew yaaa within Israel
 this is the profit this is the Krewe of Covenant faithful Israelites that was a minority throughout most of his real history that's what we're meditating on and that you always going to bring about a day at the Foxfire will separate consumables from the things that can endure the great test totally right just keep reading so the coming day will consume the wicked and will not leave behind for them root or Branch but for you who fear my name that burning fire is like the sun of righteousness Rising like they want of Genesis like the sunrise with healing in its wings and you will go out and leap like that in the Cavs sleep like which of the compliment.
 yeah gets the gate opened and it's just like the round go for it but yeah so it's so funny like there's a fire coming and depending on how you relate to the fire it can either keep you warm and bring you Joy like the sunrise or it can consume you and you've got a truck just like the fire that guy that came on Mount Sinai the people were convinced it would consume them so they didn't go out but then when Moses in the elders go up and not consumed. Let them enjoy his presents and have a meal in the Press - more intense so you who fear my name who experienced my fire is like a sunrise that he loves you you will trample down the wicked and they will be like Ash and underneath the soles of your feet on the day that I'm going to act now the wicked here these are the ones that aren't Feer in God's name and I'm I going to think of just
 is malachite just entering in on a distinction between Israelites who fear don't fear God or really just like the screw that fears God in like the whole rest of creating it seems centered on Israel the whole book seems centered on Israel Israel exist as a you know Mike were some of all of all Humanity store is what you always doing with his real is an image of what he's doing with all Humanity so there's a day coming will separate those who are faithful to Yahweh and those who are not Inspire imagery why would that be we get all the sounds really nice like healing in the wings the sun of righteousness kind of figure out when you get to trample the weekend so well okay so I think this is the cap to the prophets prophets begin with Israel
 called to go crush the seed of the snake living in the land in the garden land which in the narrative is you know like the Giants and they're Nephilim and all of their snakes eat in the in the land of Canaan I think that's the image here but it's a troubling image for us and we named this before it's for me and it is probable that there's also a visceral call like destroy your enemies thing that happens for cattle it's kind of like those people in the way they are the enemies we got to get them and it doesn't you know square with the teachings of Jesus Apostles totally right so you get to these places where it's like I get it like when people cause evil it's like you're just kind of like everything so you just like I hope they get what they deserve it but you read this with Jesus lives in your life it seems like Jesus would take a phrase like this and he's he
 saw himself with orders to let his enemies trampled him right now and he said that's how the kingdom of God is going to come so you can't read Malachi is a part of You Inside Story Lisa Jesus means you can't just rip this passage out of context and it making me and whatever you want it to mean but I think in the context of what it in the context this is written among persecuted religious minority within a people that is a persecuted minority living in an occupied territory under a centuries of a rock a no pressure so I don't know what it's like to do you have enemies and to have experiences like that generation after generation and I think that the part of what
 the vision of a world set right is a world where the tables get turned in the Mighty Fall from their Thrones and the poor are elevated and I think that's the kind of visceral feeling that's coming out in the Moment Like This of trampling the wicked go to the soles of your feet but we have to figure out what does that actually mean to trample the wicked of the soles of feet when the length of Jesus it's not what you would expect it's the opposite sensitivity physical interpretation so that's all about the day of Yahweh we are meditating on the spittle crew within his realm then there's the day they coming little separate that crew from the wicked
 last paragraph of Malachi last paragraph of the prophets remember the Torah of my servant Moses
 that I commanded him at Mount Horeb to all Israel you know the statutes in the judgments and I go yeah yeah I remember that cuz well you know I read that Scroll of remembrance but those who fear the Lord says it book ending this chapter in a way yeah so this this whole last paragraph is designed as a symmetry with the tortoise crawls at the beginning of the year so remember there's there's a day of Yahweh coming that will separate the righteous and the wicked so let's think more about that I'm going to send you Elijah Prophet before the coming of the day of your way that is great and fear-inspiring
 oh yeah couple things Elijah one is great we're going another Prophet this is kind of feel like it's where were used to hand off two new Prophet Prophet but what's weird here is Elijah he already came and went about four hundred years ago so that's odd of Moses and Elijah so with interesting Elijah the narratives about Elijah that are in the middle of the Kings scroll are also hyperlink and patterned after the Moses story culminating in the fact that Elijah goes to Mount Sinai looking to meet Yahweh and he said there's an appearance the fire Cloud storm and he talks with Yahweh on top of the mountain so he's clearly portray it as a prophet like you gets fed in the wilderness
 so he's portrayed as a new Moses a prophet like Moses and when Jesus goes up to the mountain and yet transfigures into this figure shows up with them yet Moses and Elijah exactly what Moses is to the Torah Elijah is to the narratives of the profit he becomes kind of like an icon of the heaven on Earth mediator who ultimately fails but he was pretty awesome so you can read this and say oh Elijah's getting resurrected and coming back or you can say oh just like we're getting someone like Moses but better get someone like Elijah the better the deathly right okay yeah so notice then what's just happened is that's really feels like similar to the end of Deuteronomy right where Moses have been like score of the Torah be faithful to the Covenant yeah there's a separation happening within Israel basilar called the servants you feel Vindicated them
 and in the meanwhile wait for the coming Prophet who will restore and do all the stuff that Moses and now that a lie to death so both the Torah and the prophets conclude with hyperlinked conclusions can you forward to a great seed of the woman who's going to come bring restoration and defeat evil the prophet prophet and a day of the Lord and I think it's intensified I suppose and did you know every scroll the language of day the Lord isn't that right well not me 34 anticipated in Moses the song was it after that it's all going to hit the fan at one point yeah but Malachi turns Up the Volume just calling it The Coming day so that's how the prophets begins and ends with Joshua Malachi in the arrangement of the Tanakh then the next and final third collection called the cats of game begins with the foam scroll
 and if you do look at what is in the Tanakh the next literary unit after what we just ran in Malachi in the Hebrew Bible it's someone we read many times so I just want to scan it real quick because we're going to see all the same themes coming up again yeah maybe you know what maybe we don't have time to read through this whole song we are going to put out a whole video on the song of the year in 2023 and the reason why is because it talks about the kind of person who meditates on the Torah as a tree of life and now you're situating this whole idea have the person who meditates on the Torah in the largest contacts possible on the tonight and this now you're talking about as it seems so we're going from the seam of the prophets now into the last third of the Hebrew
 I will the right which is Psalms and then there is Proverbs and Esther and all of its own songs and Song Chronicles Daniel to all the good stuff I feels like kind of like the extras and it's interesting because every one of them is hyperlink like mad in the back of the Torah and Prophets it is often referred to as the writings or the songs you just calls it the heads of this is the way Jesus taught at the seam there and you're saying as we read the first literary unit at the seam moving into this last third what are the ideas that we're going to meditate on LOL yep and it just happens to be so they just it doesn't take that long I'm not going to read Psalm 100 K-pop
oh the good life black oh yeah oh how bless so how blessed is the man is the man you say the good life the good life of the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked there it is okay go the weekend we were this a lot and now the wicked just like that's just I just learned a lot about the wicked in the story the prophets here and then in the last paragraph amount doesn't stand in the path of Sinners doesn't sit in the seat of mockers rather his Delight is in the Torah of Yahweh the instruction of you and on you always instruction he meditate day and night you're saying instruction that's just a way to translate por la is the typical English translation in our Bibles so there's this guy who doesn't associate with the wicked yeah he doesn't walk stand or sit with them threat his Delight is in yahweh's instruction Torah and on the
 Surah e meditates day and night meditates and that's what Moses said to do Joshua was when the military compared to meditate it's verbatim copy and pasted of sudden someone is linked to the end of Malachi distinction of rights as wicked and it's super hyperlinked to Joshua chapter 1 is what this guy's doing is what Joshua was told to do you will become like a tree planted by streams of water which gives its fruit in its time its Leaf never Withers and everything he does he's successful success and that's in Malachi and in Joshua yes and that word success is filled with the same letters as the word wisdom
 which arm would have skill but it's what the woman star when she looked at the tree that it was desirable to make Husky and that's a different word yep the synonym for wisdom okay so this person the Joshua like figure becomes like the Tree of Life planted by the river with Perpetual fright leaves and fruit and in doing so they become the thing that woman water thing the woman wanted to grab for the tree so this is hyperlink to Genesis 1 through 31 wrote it as a synthesis of the beginning and ending of the Torah and the beginning and the ending of the Brilliance of a Mozart or you know where they just have so many things happening but if they can just pull from all of these
 the musical motifs and bring them together in new ways and in ways it just bring you a sense of awe and I can kind of wondering like how did someone's mind do this LOL yeah this is just the first half of someone and get Sweden together language words imagery from the beginning of Genesis the end of Deuteronomy the beginning of Joshua the and Malachi we're not even done yet not so the wicked there like chaff that the wind drives away oh yeah I said it will become consumed in the flame there for the wicked won't stand in the Judgment of the sound like Malachi North centers in the Assembly of the righteous and assembly of the righteous and what time are the crew crew the Spheres us to ponder his name because Yahweh knows the path of the righteous memory cuz he said that crew is my special possession
 the path of the Wicked Will perish so all of a sudden the whole Psalm scroll is introduced by upholding this model human
 who is like Joshua
 and like Adam and Eve and like Moses who is this embodiment of the instruction and tour of Yahweh and they become like the tree of life that provides life to everyone around them and you always he's got his eye on that person and in the coming separation between the righteous and the wicked that one will flourish like the Garden of Eden that's the imagery hair
 so whatever the Torah is about is also what the prophets are about is also what the writings are about you cuz the beginnings and endings of all been coordinated so if you've ever been confused about what the Bible the Hebrew Old Testament about welcome to the club but whoever organized it together has given us clues in these matching mirror beginnings and endings as to what the big ideas are and so that's at least if you're going to read on to Joshua after this year of Torah and go on in the profits at least kind of let these passages be your guide post for what to pay attention to and when you say what the stories about what you're saying is if I could try to recap please story is about Humanity
 given the opportunity to be God's people have gotten got damaged and they're given a Torah Academy for giving it to her and they are meant to fear God and live in abundance in an abundant land with God where God and creation are one heaven in Earth or 1/4 wealth God God's presence is in the middle of creation that's God in creation Are One. Ok Google of creation and Heaven and Earth are one and so that isn't where humanity is that obviously something went wrong we've taken of the tree of knowing good and bad and the whole story was about God saying I'm going to fix this through some sort of cumin seed of the woman whose
 to defeat evil make things right and as we trace and find this person we know this person is going to keep God's instructions Torah and we were given a story of a people were given an opportunity to reboot a covenant relationship with new Torah which now is in a simple little like one command command and it's a it's a whole cabinet code which we have portions of in the Torah and so Moses at the very end as they're going to go back into the land this image of the garden is he saying do what Humanity has never been able to do anything this is what you got to do you got to keep the Torah and for them it was a it was a covenant command but for us reading the Torah it's we don't have that like Covenant lock code but we have is
 Scrolls that tell a story with some of the lock code and that in itself becomes God's instruction for us now we are hearing Moses say this to ancient Israel and we realized oh that's us to we are we're about ready to
 every say that the US are you talk about you and me sitting right here but also at the prophets who formed this election hundred years in the future right telling me stories they're talking about them we have this opportunity Yeah Yeah from the perspective of the people to put the Tanakh together that has the crew sitting back in the land after the return from Exile but like the day of Yahweh and the new Eden is not come and we're waiting for it yet so that's what it's the whole things about and it's so there's so many more stories It Go but what's frame the stories of Joshua and I'm moving forward it's all about will you like keep this Covenant fear God and walk with him and find a place we're having dinner tonight now that we fast forward and has been a great Exile and it's time to come back to the land and try again like and we're still not figuring it out will you be
 that people and when someone starts it's just this call like look how beautiful the life is to actually be that kind of person I bang what it would have been like if Adam and Eve before Moses or Joshua or David had actually done the will of God consistently in from the heart they would have become like trees of life to everyone around them so someone begins collection yeah the song scroll that the whole meditation on all these themes to the form of poetry but then you get the wisdom Scrolls and Proverbs Begins by saying like every one of us is an Adam and Eve sitting up the tree and take the tree of life it is with trust me a live by God's wisdom you get portraits of Daniel who doesn't live by God's wisdom and he suffers miserably wrong with the people
 and is moments of exaltation of Babylon become images of a son of man's exaltation through suffering over the nation's that's Daniel chapter 7 so I can work in the themes in the writings you're just all the creative ways of work in the core themes over but that's basically it so the tonight comes of conclusion with us sitting in the same position Israelites were with Moses waiting to go into the garden last begging you to be part of the crew that decides to meditate on God's instruction and to be that kind of person because the be that kind of person means that you could be the place we're having dinner Sunday night and that God can mend unite having her through you and the crew with also this vision of when that happens it's going to be intense because it's going to be a reordering of you have everything going to be another decreation Recreation like the flood like
 Sodom and Gomorrah like that style but it'll be a re-creation and there were back to the cycles of this Ematic cycle her Melody throughout the Hebrew Bible over and over and over again and it's draining all of us to see our lives as a cycle in the drama for every one of us has the potential to become a conduit for God's eating blessing out to others if we will align ourselves with the will of God and to his Jesus fulfillment the god actually became
 the human partner that we've all failed to be on our behalf so that he could become the channel of Eternal eating blessing for all the nations so they even when I fail if I'm attached to the one that my failure has no chance of overcoming God's Own faithfulness that's demonstrated in the coming of the Messiah the snake Crusher has so much comes together and so many interesting ways I guess it makes me think you know Jesus does, and talked a lot about the language of Malachi of the separating the chaff and he creates a crew a faithful yeah like but I'm just going and being like Torres students like you know they become like students of teachings of Jesus yeah and you know you get a few stories of Jesus going to like synagogue in like reading the Torah but it's not like a massive motif
 amounts of pain at all cuz Jesus defines tour observance as faithfulness to his vision of what it means to live by the Torah yeah he famously says like I've come to fulfill the job I haven't come to cancel the Torah and Prophets the opposite I've come to fulfill them which will lead to a greater righteousness that I gave you righteousness that the film is this word can give you greater its way to righteousness and then we're on Into The Sermon on the Mount so in a way he was about to observe its but the Torah observant dreamed of by Jeremiah or Ezekiel we're God's spirit would write God's will on the heart so that
 you don't just observe commands but just your very core saturated with this will and desire of y'all way so that you know how to live in the line went back to what kind of literature is this this is lit this is wisdom Messianic wisdom and his poems these ideas are supposed to bring us to a place where our will and God's will align our vision for what it means to have a good life what righteousness is that that becomes
 not something that we have to like even learn anymore or discern that like this is like relationship with God and develops and will we get in Jesus and the apostles the reason I suppose is talking about Jesus in his Unity with Jesus and the gift of the spirit and then we still have these writings to meditate on yep and all that kind of work together to help us reclaim this thing of being a God that's right because you know we are brought into the story through Jesus Messiah it's precisely through his story is example and what he accomplished for Humanity is that Community could do it by itself that all like creates a whole new cycle of the pattern
 that we are brought into and that's what's so great about Jesus that portrayed as like the new human because when I associate myself with him through trust what's true him becomes true with me or is Paul will say the Messiah is my life and it's not even fully me who's living anymore it's me but Messiah living in and through me and that's the me that I really want to be
 I just arrived and I didn't even mean to
 I could go on a coffee mug with the Messiah is the me who I really want to be but that's true that's like that's what it means to live in the Messianic fulfillment version of the store so Lord have mercy on us all so let's keep reading on into the prophets and the writings and for those of you who do keeps going to feel free to reach out and tell us what you're learning what you're studying and discovering and like I said in some future time John and I will join you and we'll do our journey through the profits as well
