hey John I love hello we're coming back to do one final question response we've read through the Torah the five books at the beginning of the Bible and we've been all year yes we've been doing this conversation and wonderful we've been chasing one theme through each week all movements of each scroll and so it's and so five Scrolls what yeah it was a 16-2 movement that 18 I forget a lot a lot a lot we didn't read every part of the Torah but we read lots of it we then at the end of every Torah scroll we stopped and we had a q in our and we didn't get to every question but as a way to cut a recap the whole journey let's answer some questions from
 the whole Torah in the hole from this question from the whole year the whole year and throughout the whole year so we can start with a question from been in California who has a question about kind of the the the method of reading and making hyperlinks between stories hi my name is Ben and I'm from San Jose California you've been talking a lot about biblical Connections in the Genesis scroll how do you decipher between biblical connections the author's intended to make versus connections we fabricate or force that weren't intended to be made yeah the very practical question is a very practical question
 yeah when do you know that you're
 natively reading the tax the way it was designed and finding something others intended and when have you gone too far and you know it's also interesting I've noticed this with like a certain creatives artists or writers or something they'll do make something maybe a movie and then someone will ask like a like I saw this character in The Naked this thing and they whatever it was that like part of this theme of this thing and the directors thinking we'll know but I kind of wasn't I mean that's beautiful yeah yes yes so like there's also something about like at what point does the Beautiful Mind that's designed the Bible like has seen like all the other things that could be saying I totally understand what it's a great question it's a question that I've been asking myself for a long time almost it's beginning to read the Bible
 when I paid attention to how Jesus and the apostles quote from and reflect on and get meaning out of the Old Testament and especially when they would say or make a collision Jack what so a long journey to understand inner biblical interpretation later biblical authors quote from and use then I eventually developed his conviction that they grew up with in the native tradition from which these texts emerged in the first place and so if anybody's qualified to understand them it's more than likely going to be them and not me and that's kind of been a Guiding Light for me throughout throughout the years so we're it's led me isn't this whole world of biblical studies especially among Jewish and Israeli Scholars who are really trying to preserve and recover
 how ancient Israelites and how Jewish Israeli communities in the second temple. Read and understood these texts as they were being brought into their final shape and so a lot of it has to do with this language we've developed in our resources called hyperlinking narrative patterning design patterns the melody which is often the biblical authors will set up an analogy or comparison in a story or a poem that wants is meant to send your mind like a hyperlink on a website or web page back to an earlier part 3 key repeat the words or ideas so that you pull them up and begin to compare and contrast so how do you know when an author is giving you the clues to do that versus is that really the connection mermaids making out with us for what's the criteria there was some sort of textbook or something well I wish there was a textbook that did all of the things
 that I learn how to do a different ways from w a different books that were all in one button in a way classroom classes or an exercise in giving you that tool that specially the introduction to Hebrew Bible class but the most basic to all the bill go out there's is repetition of words cuz that's the medium of these texts words but creative repetition is the name of the game so sometimes it'll be one word sometimes will be the repetition of a constellation of words are in network of words sometimes it'll be a repetition of words but with the letters swapped around or walk through word player through puns so tense that it's way deeper than we tend to appreciate for sure the amount of way someone else is happening yeah can you think of an example where
 you have thought you saw something that wasn't may be there or someone came to use something in your like actually no I don't think that's in the story of the birth and the rescue of Moses when he's a baby in the same as his mom has him and puts him in the Reed Basket in the water so Exodus chapter two so there's an interesting turn of phrase where she Moses his mom has him and she sees that he was good and she took him so that's exactly the language from the woman at the tree in Eden in Genesis chapter 3 she saw that it was good and she took but I've been training that is a negative thing where she saw and desired something that she shouldn't have the wrong thing with it but they're in Moses's
 it's a good thing she sees anema good she takes him and what she does this say this is life it's over longest time I was puzzled black is that a connection cuz the outcomes are different just because it's two words show up maybe it isn't always had a liking to it that was my question I think for a long time yeah but then what I started to
 notice was in the in-between from Genesis 32 The Exodus you can tally up all of these moments where somebody sees makes an evaluation about going to bed takes our gifts and so in the biblical authors don't always mean it negatively sometimes when they make a hyperlink it's the inversion of it so they see and they take and it's it produces life instead of death and I think that's what's Happening Here is an inversion moment because dude in the opening chapters of Exodus chapters 1 & 2 there are seven women who save the world wow cool to Hebrew midwives take a book title with the 7-Eleven today do they save the cosmos so it begins with the two Hebrew midwives then
 number 3 then you have me really want to put some of the art she put them in the ark and you have Moses sister at Pharaoh's daughter my dad go to the river to wash then Pharaoh's daughter sends her female slave down to go pick up the basket and then you have his Midian Mickey and Minnie and nights wife Moses's wife supporter who saves his life circumcision thing so I can access chapters 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 OK and all of all of them have little verbal hyperlinks or word-plays connecting them to he's so I think what's happening so you're just a bad rap well yeah she becomes an archetype of human
 loaded desire but here are seven women who are being attended as redeemed if another words they are women who see what the deceiver is doing Barrow and in all these different ways they countered deceive deceive the deceiver that results in the preservation of life and not the destruction of life so that's a good example of I've been staring the two chapters for decades and it's taking me a long time to see what's there but now you can see what there and it's like oh my gosh and sometimes the clues for any of these individual you know stories about these seven women will just be one or two little words that are similar to The Eagan store in your iCloud can you hang that much on those but a lot of times it's done it's about the whole picture that emerges overtime
 and if you see a bigger picture and a section of literary units and you like there's no way that that's coincidental that's for sure on purpose and that's kind of what I found Ben is sometimes it's one or two little details that let create a link in your car that's in the maybe status in my mind but as you meditate on it more sometimes you find more connections could you put something in a maybe status and often times or sometimes does end up becoming something that's actually there it kind of most beginners maybes and then they just kind of build in my notes over time as you reread message and and then sometimes it just passes like there's just no there's like seven keyword lengths here and two of them are just there's no way that's unintentional and then sometimes I'll be reading later in the Torah or the prophets and they'll be links back
 to both earlier links will you can see like your own feelings get linked in your life is making a connection between Hagar and Passover and the sacrifice of Isaac on in Genesis 22 and all three of those are being linked to in one place and judges and you are well there's somebody who saw the guy for likes between those are other stories so I'm not crazy for seeing them myself so they're goben that's not a clean answer that I didn't know but it's I think it's the answer that tends to emerge that I am finding for other people to sit read through this is the classic like are you ask Jesus to Jesus kind of thing like am I pulling out something that's internal to actually what this text is doing my inserting my ideas on to them and while we're applying
 I must be specific methodology that we're saying is native to the way that's Texas designed Ben's wondering at what point are you like over ramping that methodology and moments like breaking at finding its limits its right and what I'm hearing you say is it doesn't happen that much and your experience and when it does you just go out maybe it's hold it lightly and then just kind of see how it pops as you continue to read but that's no different just busy can be really nerdy that's no different than how any other hypothesis verification process works in hit in historical research in the oven in The Sciences yeah I know if anything is real this is how we do it so yep yep philosophy you know I rest my hat in the ring of critical realism which is that reality can be known but
 all of our approaches to at are partial and subjective in ways that we can't fully always observe and so you know you put out a hypothesis I think I see it is going on you gather data an account for counter data until your Paradigm breaks and you're like I got to rethink this cuz the data points all are pointing in this direction and you constantly revised and that's how you accumulate knowledge and that is also I think how reading the Torah and the prophets and writings and New Testaments work and it's just the nature of human knowledge I didn't mean to put out to be the biggest can of worms ever I just I thought we could talk about that it contained way but I sprawled all over sorry but we have another good question from Christine in Connecticut Hartford Connecticut my question is about blood
 makes us
 somebody speaks a blessing who gave the Patriarchs the ability to give out blessings and why was Isaac constrained from taking back the blessing he gave to Jacob and giving it to ihsan said thanks so much guys bye
 this was a repeated question as we talked through the stories about Abraham Isaac and Jacob the nature of blessing and the way that the characters seem to use a nuby is the blessing God gets them as they pass it on and what are we to make them all that writes we get into this even more as we're going to get into a muse theme yes next year Cup theme of the firstborn a lot of it is actually this year of the podcast series will release in 2020 video of all releases videos can I assume that there's like this blessing that is like the Eden blessing or it's also the blessing of God going to reverse confront evil destroy evil through Humanity to bring us back to eat in and there's that blessing
 it's also just the blessing of like hey you're the patriarch can you get the hand down yeah your inheritance to your first born child and all of those are offshoots of the core concept that I think really wear this first unfolds in the 7-Day Christian narrative is humans as an image of The God Who blesses and gives life so humans are enlisted as real partners with God and bringing his life and blessing and Rule to the world and that you know that the risky business to go into partnership with somebody especially if you know they're going to make foolish decisions so just in the same way the Adam and Eve in Canaan Abel and Abraham and all of them make good and bad decisions with the blessing that God gives them I think part of that good and bad is expressed with how they pass
 to the different Generations so the question is what makes the Patriarchs have the ability to bless people and so on one since they are the family that God chose to make the conduit I was eating blessing and that is why did God choose that family they were to the theme of the firstborn like you're saying and two Gods to miss everyone will get into it I think this question a lot more interest points series we will that one thing you did teach me about blessing that was really helpful was it shows up as in Genesis one God create the birds and the fish and He blesses get the first blessing that's the very first blessing the Bible and it's a very specific blessing that's right it's X fruitful and multiply its abundance of blessing is experience Abundant Life life that begets life because there's just enough and so blessing is this idea of theirs there's enough and life can multiply to life
 and so any cuz I worry because very vague to me like what is a blessing and that's the first question here is what makes something a blessing and it's a it's connecting to the source of all life if you're telling someone and acting that I want you to be connected to the source of all life to find abundance and you're acting a blessing that's right the words don't have some kind of magical power it's the words that name a reality or wish reality on someone may the source of all life and abundance may his face shine upon you yeah it's the exactly that's exactly right and then God invested that image bearing power to bless to one particular family the both uses and abuses that that responsibility and Knotts these are the trials and errors
 the family of Abraham in the story so I think that's what's underneath the story of Isaac and Esau and Jacob is that he is misusing the blessing of sortie that God's given him in that story cuz he's willing to trade it for his oldest son for both food and that's not what God has planned but there does seem to be some in a narrative logic play I can't give it away again yeah that's right in terms of because the narrative is all about God keep selecting one through whom the promise of abundance and the promise of a future seed who will crush the snake and that promised a blessing can only come through one lineage cuz it's tracing and ask this question a little bit though is like doesn't get to decide that why the Patriarchs I was like yes oh I get oops I gave it to this Sunday I totally yeah yeah yeah yeah I think that's where we're back to God delegating to real partners
 which is a risky business but apparently God thinks that risk is worse than the greater end and here were too much bigger questions you know I appreciate that you're asking it Christian cuz it is a question that comes up a lot for lots of people and they read Genesis and I think what we're rubbing up against is why does God unless anybody has an actual partner and delegate responsibility to them and that is a great question that I think you have to wrestle with with the Biblical Portrait of God feels like a mistake I understand that and that's why so many of us feel like the setup even in Eden was like with that the without the right way to go about it but that's what I hear we are leather rabbit but here we are each morning waking up with a decision if we want to become a vehicle a blessing or curse in the lives of the people around us and whatever God
 here I am today and this moment with a decision in front of me and that's what the biblical authors want us to really think about to thank you Christine, you got a question you're from Wisconsin what's your question my friends Carl from Middleton Wisconsin here I have two questions in the creation account in the Genesis scroll no Covenant is ever explicitly made between God and humans why then when the humans eat from the Tree of Good and Evil is there a curse for the more why is it the ground that has to Bear the curse and not Humanity itself thanks
 okay yeah to good interrelated questions about the opposite of Christine's question when she was about blessing this one's about curse see if if the whole set up to the story of Adam and Eve God in the garden is about all Humanity in God and the first Covenant relationship why is the word covenant not use a question that actually is a whole rabbit hole because whenever God engages a human as a partner after the Garden of Eden the word and formalize relationship of the Covenant was always focused his first used in the story of Noah or after the flood that makes it cabinet because of what Noah has done he makes a covenant with Noah and his family at all creation
 never send flight again then there's a common with Abraham that gets deep end with and repeated with Isaac Jacob and done with the Israelites Mount Sinai it on so but but the Covenant is about formalizing drawing up the terms I see a relationship and so the question is what was there a formal term eat of all the trees and enjoy them just not this one was just taking goodbye me on Tuesday to Eden relationship between God and humans has all of the elements of what will appear later in Covenant relationship that has the word covenant is not used in the question is is it just take it for granted where's there a reason that it's not used and this is much longer conversation Bible East for a couple years now I've become persuaded that it's intentional intentionally withheld not intentionally withheld because I believe it the fact of the Covenant is introduced after
 flood is trying to communicate that form of formalized relationship where you sign on the dotted line and agree to with Benefits kind of thing that it's a tree I just got triage first one was hang out with me in the garden and just listen to my work last night with them let's go for walks together and we don't have to formalize this thing and I think that is what Jeremiah Jeremiah is referring to when he talks about the New Covenant and you won't need anybody to teach you because the gods instruction will be written on the heart so he uses the word covenant describe that new set up but then when he describes it he describes about something that's informal the deeply intimate you don't need somebody to remind you of the Covenant curses of the Torah to motivate you where I got swell cuz you'll just want to do it so I think it's intentional
 that's the reason why that's relevant to the curse then is that blessing and curse is brought in for Covenant language later but the blessing is not contingent on human obedience what are the shows up in humans get to enjoy the blessing precedes human obedience and so it's not about if you obey the Divine word then you get blessing it's because of the device are you are enjoy the blessing and your continued enjoyment out of it is in your hands and so their blessing and Chris take on more Cosmic terms we're living by the Divine will means that I continue to enjoy eating blessing and if I choose to Forfeit it then I what I will bring upon myself is the opposite of blessing which is curse and so does interesting you're right Karla that the man and woman are not cursed it's a snake in the ground that accursed it's only after the first
 murder without a nice children right Kane Kane is the first human this cursed from the ground and then he's exiled to the east so there's something about blessing and curse that get what you made that get turned Cosmic as images of life and death blessing and curse good and bad which is Moses makes all this connection at the end of Deuteronomy so if they're not Covenant Ali contingent in the Eden narrative you get the blessing in life and good cuz God loves to get good gifts but you can forfeit it in which case you will bring on yourself the opposite of all those things and once that happens then what God does a start arranging Covenant relationships with all of that as conditional consequences blessing or curse which you know is that I can repair mechanism but it's not the ideal to a triage like that now
 humans aren't cursed into that the land is cursed snake is cursed but then you said that in the story of Cain he's cursed cursed and I don't remember that first are you from the ground up Pinterest so why is it escalate like that why does it not start with a curse for Humanity I would make sense I mean oh yeah they broke the door, I think it's a sign of Mercy because it is at worried cursed Adam and Eve then they would be bound to whole project founded the whole project over but because Kane is curious cuz he took a life I think with him being cursed sets his lineage on a path in the flood and then it all leads to the flood where is Adam and Eve's flying through Seth leads to the continued life of the snake Crusher which God says that's what actually he says about the man and woman is that you'll have seeds
 who gave birth to the snake Crusher so I think it's the nearest Academy of Art cursed Humanity would just be yeah I'll be over game over but when we get to Cain and Abel Cain well that well then becomes Kane and Seth Kane chooses the curse path but but there's still a lot of humanity that doesn't end in the ground is cursed and not Adam and Eve remember there's a close relationship because the ground is Audemars Hebrew and human is a dumb and not Adam comes from the Altima so whatever happens on the bottom of her life being Incorrect and is blessing was abundance of multiplication then curse is all about scarcity and salmon and scarcity is you know what the curse on the ground is about yeah so it's a curse that affects the humans but it's not a curse on the humans as such at least not right then
 look up this is you're going to have children which is a sign of + multiplication + one of those children will be just a crasher let's go to question from Melissa from Arizona Phoenix Arizona one at night Yahweh in the form of smoke and fire pass through the animal have to demonstrate his Covenant with Abram there are similar and inverted language and images that connected to passages however what is the significance of the people passing through the death Waters versus jelly passing through the dead animals thank you that's interesting provocative yes it's a good example of backup to Ben's first question yeah how do you know you are here
 so let's some pay attention the two stores one is Genesis 15 where what Abraham is saying actually still Abram just you promised me a big family so I moved out this new new part of the country and still don't have a big family so in a way what are you looking at me like I'm old so he's looking at is coming death and yes is nice man named Eliezer who will inherit the estate but like that's why I was kidding that's not you said I'd have children so now it says I'm going to give you a big family and Abraham trust that promise God says I'm going to give you those this land for that family and Abraham like really I'm not sure and so then God says to do this Covenant ceremony so Abraham splits these animals in half. A bloody aiel like you do and then you always shows up for the first time in fire
 smoke weed for the first time in the biblical story so he showed up in the Wind of the day and eaten with Adam and Eve ate from The Forbidden tree but this is the first time you always shows up and there's this Cosmic appearance of fire and smoke hookah and what you all he does is Abraham passes out and he's silent asleep on on the side and Yahweh goes through the bloody Isle of the severed halves of animal and what he says is you're going to have that fan of that family and that family is going to leave the land and become enslaved to another people group a long time but I will bring Justice and deliver them in the future
 who is X products and anticipates the accident or so when you get fuel all the way forward to the Exodus story and the Israelites have escaped Egypt after pass over there at the shore of the sea and it's night time so I put Abraham and Yahweh through Moses split the waters it's the culmination of the thing that you always predicted when he passed through the the bloody halves and so the people go through and lo and behold who had what is leading them you have fire this fiery pillar of cloud and smoking the same thing except what's passing through is Yahweh with his people going to the mill people are passed out this time they're marching through inside the symbolism of Yahweh passing through the bloody animals
 the meaning of the symbolism doesn't actually get unpacked until interesting little corner of the Jeremiah scroll which talks about that same ceremony and as a way of symbolically it was a covenant ceremony where the two partners would walk down the aisles and reference the fact of his either of us breaks this agreement May Our Fate be like these animals is he walks you make it you make a covenant with someone you walk through the dead animals that are severed on either side of you here like this is how animals are like death death on one side and on the other side and we walk down the middle together now here comes a thought of a different way to do this is really that poor ox I know straight up severed in half that is a good I mean to really think about what that involved like Abraham was
 Bloody by the end of like setting up that little ceremony yeah so gnarly so no wonder he passed out
 I've never thought of that anyhow so death on either side she's so when you get to the walls of water on either side Stephanie decide but the question is what do the bloody animals have to do with the walls of water like it should I join those in my mind like that's a weird so you have that you have to just put a maybe on the table Malaysia will start with a maybe there is connection so how many stories do you have where y'all way up here is in a pillar of fire cloud and smoke leading them through some narrow place in between something to smoke weeding them through the Wilderness on the ground through a narrow place like in a mile
 and you got to do that's interesting so then usually if there's a really potent image like that then usually that's the author's way of inviting you to meditate on this to store isn't find other connections they both take place at night they both take place when God's chosen one is in a helpless State at the end of them said yes yeah God sends a deep sleep on Abraham he tells Israelites to stand by and be silent little Echoes like that so that's what I mean like this is actually great example and remember what God Said would happen to his family Jeff. Joseph Abraham he predicts what then happens with Israel in the exodus yes I'm going through the waters is the culmination of the events of Yahweh predicted when he passed through the aisle so I think that the narrator really does want us to see these two passages through death
 maybe with also significant is a difference that God himself and Only God went through the bloody animals and he made his Covenant partner pass out so do I spare him where as he leads he goes with the people through the waters and delivers them from the certain death that they put his experience if he wasn't with them
 so this also set up a motif on in through the Torah and Prophets of yahweh's saving or delivering people in the narrow place or in the in-between place the number of biblical stories David and Goliath Valley he's in this Valley and there's all these narrative details to pick thing on like on the one side and on the other side as this and it's a it's the same language as the wall of water on the one side the wall of water on the other side so I think it becomes a motif of Salvation in the narrow place
 that actually begins all the way back with Abraham so cool
 okay what's another one let's keep going okay questions from this is Corey from Washington d.c. Washington d.c. reading exit is the numbers this year I noticed that God requires the firstborn be redeemed saying they belong to him ever since the tenth plague this is described in Exodus 13 11 to 16 the Levites in particular also seem to get caught up in this whole thing in numbers 3 what happened during the tenth plague that made this ongoing Redemption necessary and honestly when every other instance of the word redeem seems like a rescue how am I supposed to think about people being redeemed from God
 do we talk about this in all this word but it's a great question that's why it's so another words the night of passover 10th play all the times but one when y'all would describe what's going to happen he says I'm going to pass through the land and I will strike the first born
 but one of those one-time Exodus 12 23:24 you always says I am going to pass out over the door and I won't allow the Destroyer go right to enter in and strike the first born and that Hebrew word PESA gets translate in English translations of Passover which raises its you did you think about what is the meaning of the word pacifier because it seems to mean the opposite of Passover passed through cuz what he says is all do this activity over the door that will protect that house and won't allow a striking to take place and it also it's the one time where it seems like there's some death force that has a actual thing that strikes and yahweh's relationship to that death Force
 is whether he will stand in the way to defend that house or not in the house is that he will protect or defend or the ones with the blood of the Lamb on them so that's the picture of Passover so when you always says I will strike that's a way of describing whether or not Yahweh will hand that house over to a force of Destruction on the night of passover and you don't make sense right inside of actively striking but not standing in the Gap totally it sort of like when when y'all is actively bringing his life-sustaining presents of abundance and blessing you get blessing but if y'all way were to withdraw took his hand off the wheel a wheel the creation goes back to the dark disorder and Chaos from which it emerged in Genesis 1 verse 2 the dark formless and void and there's some sort of
 force that does that the dark yellow mustard Force is with fascinating and I will get to question but this is all important set up to it when you always described the Passover as allowing the Destroyer to enter in and strike the firstborn that word Destroyer much teeth is the same exact word used to describe the Waters of the flood in the flood story are called of the waters that bring destruction or the destroy and the flood is actually said on the analogy in my all these parallels between the ark which is the word house backwards and then the house for Passover I'll buy it at exactly the same letters to switch drowned in both are marked with a sign for no it's the rainbow After the flood for the Passover house it's the blood over the door both are places where
 sacrificial animal is offered
 no offers his outside the door of the Ark when he gets off the boat there's all these parallels between the ark was this little Refuge of life when the destroying Waters that strike all life it's the words destroyed and strike the Passover is depicted as a flat and what we know about the flood the flood was very similar of humans release so Much Death into the land Yahweh allowed the cosmos to implode on itself but he sticks out a little place of Refuge in life similarly the Passover is depicted as this Cosmic handing over of Egypt two forces of death but anyhow that's marked with the blood Yahweh will Tessa defends that house and not allowed to death in Turin so if that's true then what that means in the story is that every firstborn of that generation what was their lives to Yahweh
 standing in front of the door and blocking the death for us from entering and so that's the whole thing about the Redemption of the firstborn so every generation of Israel after that exists because of that first generation of redemption meeting first born was destined for death yes but God stood in the Gap and he acted that first born son theme to purchase a slaves Freedom with the word literally means slavery becomes an image for me to death than slavery to death which is literally what it is for Les Paul later seized this on a cosmic level does why he uses X's language to describe the new creation
 so Redemption means to be purchased so that you are transitioned out of a state of enslavement to death into a a realm of Life Freedom so the first born is redeemed from Death on the night of passover but if that's true then every generation that follows owes its life to that first Redemption sure it's a Passover was a meal where you retell the story but the Redemption of every firstborn of every family throughout their history going on from here is also another way of saying our people as their logo their lives to the spelling of the firstborn so will you ask Ari was so are the firstborn being rescued from God rights or are they being rescued from the darkness Force correct so this actually really relates to Modern discussions about atonement in the meaning of Jesus's death and God's Wrath and all of that and so when the baby
 Arthur's use Redemption language what we are rescued from is not from God we are rescued from Death God rescues from death and I think the complexity for us but the reason why they're enslaved to death is because God has handed over Egypt to the death forces got handy Christian over to the flood and so in that sense it's y'all doing it but it's Yahweh hand and creation over to death but he is simultaneously offering for any who want to take refuge in the house or in the ark what to be redeemed at and so the way the biblical author see that is what Paul says like in Romans 8 when he thinks of the cosmic rescue in light of Jesus what he says is creation is in slavery not to God it's in slavery to death and decay in futility and what God provides is Redemption on to life and so creation
 will be liberated from its bondage to Decay and that's how the apostles see God's raw not being rescued from God but God has The Rescuer death so I think that's how the apostles understand all this imagery of redemption and Passover in Exodus and numbers about the first part that makes sense she says every generation needs to be rescued seems like there's there's an active continual participation in the story of saying I won't be part of this Legacy of God rescuing that we still stand between life and death with a choice to opt in or out till like have God stand in the gap for us or not and yeah that's the sense of continuing to be redeemed but the Redemption of every firstborn was about
 and then Jesus of course timed his death to take place during Passover which is what transformed and developed into the Eucharist and we taking the bread in a cup of it so that it is also I meant Mark and the house yet the Messianic Passover participation about Allowing God to redeem me renewing my commitment to being Redeemed by God from this slavery enforces of death by Genesis we had some of Exodus that carried in the Leviticus to the degree that and we can talk about this in a question though was the whole discussion of the Levites being swapped out correct in saying there now which is Dad's at the dentist can idea that all of Israel or the firstborn were now to be
 decide but Israel becomes that are not deemed firstborn sons from that generation were swapped out for the Levites yeah and so the Levites become the representative representative of all of Israel whose lives exists only because of y'all's way and so that's who gets selected got to work in and around the Tabernacle which means that these are the people whose lives exist only because of you always act of Passover on Passover night and so when they when that crew robelf in the wilderness wandering here just like every every life is due to God constantly standing in the gap for us so what this is saying is that's true in a general sense it gets but in a deeper or in a more
 and even a more meaningful sense not more meaningful bit more if it's symbolic representation in the Levites represent all the tribes in the high priest from the monkey represent the Levites and all the tribes which represent all humanity and all the way down okay I think I have time for one more question from Naomi is really cool long but it's about two ways of viewing sacrificial animals and when she saw different way it just transformed prove you that I was rice okay so I'll just a question from Naomi I was asking about the meaning of sacrifices sacrificial animals in the Book of Leviticus when there was the description of the laying on of hands on to the blameless lamb or cow and it was that transference
 between the Israelite who is offering the sacrifice and the the lamb and what I just wanted clarification on was is it that the lamb representative which was faultless and blameless then at my sin is transferred onto that land and then that gets burned up on the offering or was it that it enables me to be in relationship with God because and I have gone before God spotless and blameless in place of how is that makes sense so was it that I am transferring my sin and giving that over to God on the altar or is it that I'm coming before God as the Spotless Lamb on the Altar and that would really help if you could clarify that for me thank you
 but you're right that's a big difference resent the difference for me okay so that route Naomi's what you're asking is what does it mean this repeated ritual lamp and of laying of hands on an animal and then it is offered up to Yahweh and smoke the smoke in this blameless animal Rises up into the sky is the idea that my C is transferred onto the animal and so it's being punished right and dying on my behalf right or is it a transfer of representation identity coming to me yeah so that it becomes me and my and I become it and it's righteous blamelessness can now go up into the heavens in the form of smoke and appeal to God form on my behalf is it the death right that transferred symbolically or is it life and righteousness and Purity that's transfer symbolically that's the difference and
 pretty big difference it is and I feel like the sunday-school answer was always I'm putting my sin on Jesus and then he is paying the consequences of this end so before we go to the Jesus symbolism let's just stick with in Leviticus and we actually did talk about this but I think it's so I membered this witness shifted for me it was a game-changer so if you look within Leviticus the laying on of hands happens with these atonement sacrifices of atonement Pearson's and without blemish know it it doesn't say in Leviticus 127 with the meaning of the hand transfer the righteous we called it the hand press it with the double hand press knows the single hand on the day of atonement there are two goats right selected and and this one feels like it becomes clear that one go actually gets up the send put on it one go get sad
 go and press do I burn the priest confess the sins of Israel and places them on the goat doesn't get sacrificed that go yes goes out into the Wilderness exactly the exiled so that will settle details is so important the other said details that's so important is that the hand pressing ritual is also use not for animals but for people the same phrase used for when Moses puts his hands on Joshua or when Paul says he laid his hands on Timothy if it's about appointing a representative so if that's what's happening in other words that's what's happening then the logic of the hand pressing on the animal is about a transfer of identity and representation but there's two different ways that identity can be transferred my sinful identity and transferred out of the animal that's the scapegoat yet or my identity that
 I want to give me being a blameless person who can never rise up to God is another way that could be so seems like what the hand transfer is the hand placing is doing is saying that I'm appointing this one is my representative Moses to Joshua Paul to Timothy the worshipper to the animal now does as me is one unique thing about the animal that is just tell me which is the Hebrew word for without any blemish or has referred to as humans would be immoral immoral blamelessness that's right and so remember also in Leviticus is the blood is life the blood is the life principle and that's why symbolically the blood is you know sprinkled about the blood brought in to the holy of holies and so when the animal was transferred up via smoke up into the heavens
 it goes before God's Heavenly Temple throne and it's blamelessness speaks for me and God says that it's a like a wonderful fragrance and it smells what when there is a righteous blameless one who surrenders everything in an act of total surrender then that's what that what's all this is okay so this is then is that animal being punished on your behalf or is the symbol being about how you're going to have to go through death and how's it going to go down and this animal is going through death up into the God's throne and it's pleasing Aroma to God and it gets access to God's throne and so you're celebrating is somehow I'm going to get access to God's Throne yeah that's right and the way that that happens this through my actual surrender of something valuable and then that something valuable surrenders its life in place of me
 but remember the way back in the Eden which is where that animal is going through the smoke is up into the Heavenly Temple it's a sending the Holy Hill and there's a serious-looking bouncers at the door with carrying a sword that's on fire on fire on the altar okay and how are you going to how you going to pass through the fire so it's all it's all about powerful not just symbol the symbol pointing to a reality that my mortal body is on its way to giving out and I will pass through pass by the fiery sword at some point and what is my posture towards the one that is giving me life and if it's one of surrender that I have enacted through the offering of of this one then it can appeal to God on my behalf I think that's what this is about so it death is Not absent from the story but it doesn't have
 this active role of punishing the animal and killing it but there is a slight sacrifice yes surrender of a render surrender of life and that the righteous one of the servants like what does it mean to be a truly righteous person that serves it's a surrendered life and the climactic surrendered servant is going to surrender to the point of death and that's in one sense tragic because death is tragic but because the person is a truly blame is person they can transcend through death to the throne of God be transformed that's right so what Leviticus in its presentation of these atoning sacrifice this is doing is setting up the need because what animals do is they can create the symbolic experience where the worshipper can posture themselves but
 for God but what we know about the narratives on both sides of Mount Sinai is the people who are making all these offerings before and after a really screwed-up and foolish and rebellious like Adam and Eve and so what is animals so I'm 40 like what if animals can't actually six the core problem what you need is like Psalm 40 somebody who says behold it is written about me in the scroll I Delight in doing your will doing God's desire and that one's will come and surrender surrender themselves holy over to God's suffering servant now so Jesus is the ultimate suffering servant who is Ultimate blameless human Yahoo ultimately Rose to ascend to God through his suffering and that we can be connected to Jesus like as our representative representative
 yes so that we too can I send this beautiful now there's so much language Around Jesus dying for my sins that phrase is makes just as so connected this idea of Jesus punished for my sins like help me rearrange the phrase where that phrase come from yeah and like where the phrase comes from is exactly the ritual but we've been scrapping the ritual we just described is in Leviticus what it means to die for the sins of another cuz animal dies it's death is it sits at intercessor its surrender standring on behalf of the surrender of life and what did Adam and Eve not do they didn't surrender what their version of life was they rather took because they saw that it was good to take a version of life that was good in their own eyes and so if I'm willing to surrender a life
 then y'all we can work with such a person with the problem is none of us want to surrender our lives right so I think I mean for a righteous man someone my ya ya dare to die but God demonstrates his own love for us in this is so yeah did Jesus died for our sins and that is the reference to this ritual we've been describing know what we haven't talked about is on the day of atonement there's that one animal that does get the sins transferred onto a scapegoat it would be a contradiction of the whole meaning of the situation for that one to go up to God that's the best place to live in Exile Into the Wilderness right and Jesus is set on analogy to both animals and in the letter to the Hebrews okay he is the one the righteous representative who is Sans up in here tones and Hebrews he atone for our sins when he presents his wife before God and I have my temple as a pleasing aroma
 death and he bruises that that's his surrender so that he can make a tournament by entering the Heavenly Temple the resurrection and atonement happens in the Heavenly temple in Hebrews look up the judge but then at the end of Hebrews the author of the Lycans Jesus also to the one who was exiled outside the city and died outside the city and there is also a trained Jesus as the goat that was exiled out of the camp so Jesus is both he's supposed to go but the function of death has it it's not the death is absent I'm not trying to erase death as a consequence of sin bright but I'm just trying to understand the role that death plays and the emphasis that it plays in the way the biblical authors construct the scenario and it's slightly different and it's so easy to be misunderstood that it's usually described in the short hand of God's perfect you're not yet
 kill somebody kill kill the substitute instead of killing you and it's just like me I'm not that's a that's the way that I was introduced with that kind of summary to the good news about Jesus and looks like the out all those elements were there in Leviticus and that's how the Apostle Leviticus but it's sort of like the way the store has put together and things that are being a size did not retelling I think don't reflect Faithfully what Leviticus with the apostles are trying to turn our attention to when Paul says this is the gospel that the Messiah died for our sins according to the scripture according to scripture means go to Leviticus meditate on what it means for one to die for the sins of another
 well then yes I will just figure that all out yet. I will text Naomi that it was good to refocus on that that's a good place to stop and brought us to Jesus and brought us to the what I mean what all this littered with this is doing is we didn't get to experience that as ancient Israelites going into the Tabernacle doing this but we get to buy proxy through these stories through these laws get to experience it and then reflect on it as something that points to Jesus and what a great way to stop okay yeah we are man weirdest round in the corner to the end of this year and what we wanted to do was one final celebratory episode to Mark The End Of The Journey to the Torah that's right that's a little special conversation that we're going to have next about some the way that Torah transition
