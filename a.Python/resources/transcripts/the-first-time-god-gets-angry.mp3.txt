welcome to the Bible project podcast on John and we're in the middle of a series discussing five extra Buttes of God five characteristics that God assigns to himself in a conversation with the most we've already looked at the first two attributes what God says that he's compassionate and gracious and last week we began on the 3rd at reviews for God describe himself as being slow to anger that yes God gets angry at Injustice and evil but he's slow to get angry we can continue this conversation on God's anger and one story where you would imagine God being described as angry is the flood story you know the story where he's so fed up with Humanity that he wipes everyone out is that the sledges it's really so very sobering portrait of God's justice God is never said once to be angry enough story what the introduction says in chapter 6 is this the Lord was sorry that he made humans on the land
 and he was pain he felt a pain in his heart you see in Genesis one God is shown as separated chaotic Waters from each other so that land can emerge and hearing the flood Story the opposite happens in the flood God allows the waters above in the waters below to collapse back in on the land God's judgment is to relax his ordering power and to give humans over to where they came from and where they're going to which is back to the dust and it's to remove his ordering power from the cosmos and allow creations of collapsing in on itself again the way that God judges to hand people over to the outcome of their decisions and so today we're going to continue our conversation on the wrath of God thanks for joining us here we go
 We are continuing our conversation on attributes of God specifically. Is long of double nostril slow to anger to help us through this conversation is to Bible scholars temeka hate him hello and Carissa Quinn how you doing we left the last conversation you know you're trying to make the point I mean that you were making the point that we don't want some deity who doesn't have any emotions or at least the deity in the Bible the Creator God above all is a very emotional God and he responds and relates to humans in that way and so we shouldn't be surprised at anger and if we frame anger as something that that is good in that it protects us and others from wrongs then we should be happy that we have a God who gets angry and we
 did that conversation and I still just kind of felt like I still would just rather God not get angry something that really left an impression on me after years in pastoral Ministry preaching leading Bible study is in the Bible and if you are a Bible teacher in any Church community for very long it's going to come up and what I learned was not everybody has a hangout with God's anger in the Bible some people do and patterns of what I noticed in people who do in those conversations are one that often had to do was preloaded assumptions about anger and general the mostly cuz we talked about earlier is that anger has this dual kind of Association we can think of is as positive as it expresses value this important to you or I can be synonymous with abuse and losing your control of your temper that coming if you want an iced to be weaponized and so anybody who has
 they default suspicion of God's character who thinks on a more default level that God is ticked off volatile doesn't like me doesn't like humans or what about has experienced Christians or churches that are pretty angry or has been abused by religious people or buy it just an angry person or persons usually people with that kind of history that fine God's anger in the Bible more difficult than something somebody else and so what I was after what you're trying to summarize John I'll try and make it even more succinct I should have done this in the last conversation is God's anger in the Bible is a hang up for me I should ask myself the question is my problem really with God's anger as such would I want a God who has no emotional connection whatsoever to Creation do I really want a God who has no real
 National investment in creation that would move him to feel something about it whether it's Compassion or anger is that what I really want so that's one question to ask second would be what I want to be in an intimate relationship with somebody who never expresses their anger is that really something I would want in a relationship I kind of want that that sounds nice do you really do you really
 you will it play it out okay well here's the thing is you can you can still communicate what you like and don't like without anger so you can still get to know someone's values and preferences without the anger but I suppose we're would really hit you hard that maybe this isn't what I don't want is when the person you're with is watching suffering dispassionately or watching you suffer dispassionately and it doesn't affect them at all that feels weird yeah that's true or thinking about if I'm trying to like access my deepest anger it's if I imagine somebody hurting my two-year-old daughter I think about that and maybe a person I'm in relationship with not responding to that
 our response to hurting your child or their child being hurt so I guess that's my only point is I think what we really have a suspicion of his well what are the reasons for God getting angry really what's underneath the suspicion of God's anger I wonder is if it's more a suspicion of the reasons for which gods gets angry expression so if even if they're good reason does he weigh over the top and his expression or is it just I guess you guys have an experience where you encountered someone who was really angry and you felt like man this is healthy and good right now this is right in the moment we like whenever someone's angry uncomfortable I do too I have an allergic reaction I appreciate anger I can't think of any experiences to share but I I can think of that opposite experience a lot of times like
 when I wish somebody would Express their anger that's what I mean like I do have an okay time if somebody tells me hey I'm really mad at you this was wrong what you did just really hurt me and I'm just really mad about it to me that feels good it's like okay yeah you're right you're right that wasn't that wasn't right and I can I can tell that I hurt you I know there's something that feels reconciling about that moment it sucks the goal I guess and maybe sometimes it's not the gold anger it's to hurt the other person and that's where we go wrong but it seems like when God gets mad at Moses and I know you're going to talk about this but the first time God gets gets angry at Moses and uses that word he doesn't express it he pretty much just says hey I'm mad and then he helps them this is perfect segue let's move towards what we're really after here are for what reasons does got to get angry and then what way is just God Express his anger that's really what we want to know at least I'm going to prep
 this anger Divine anger is a hangout for people it's really not about anger is divine anger is sets about the reasons for which God gets angry and do I think they're legitimate so let's let's see what we find
I'll just call this some surprising facts about God's anger in the Bible because I was genuinely surprised when I
 discovering these texts invite your friends over and have a Bible trivia night you know make some popcorn right have party and someone drives the car at who is the first person that God ever gets angry at in the Bible Crystal just told us
 Tim loves these what's the first time in the Bible ever since I realized that the sequence of the biblical narrative is strategic and important and always intentional whenever something happens if first time it's usually significant Tim what's the first time the Bible someone had a stomach ache
 a stomach ache he heard he got stabbed in the stomach trying to think there's a little boy the shunammite son who has a headache but a stomach ache not registering it doesn't feel good does it Tim first time of the Bible God gets angry and that's pretty far into the story of the Bible Moses so we read the story The Moment let me just reflect 54 chapters in The Bible before God is angry not Adam and Eve not the flood went out boys not described as angry and judgment on human evil but not out of anger this is really important actually the more of the surprising fact has sunk in for me but I also don't want to be misunderstood I'm not saying that
 doesn't bring severe acts of judgment he does what I'm after is what narratives do and do not connect God severe acts of judgment with anger and are they always connected and you're saying no they're not know many narratives about God bringing severe Justice and there's no description of divine anger anywhere and the opposite their narratives where God gets angry and he doesn't do anything severe you just as angry another words there's not a necessary and constant association between God's anger and violence in the Bible we might feel like there is because there's that handful of stories where they were they are but there are many other stories where if that's not the case it was happening in Exodus Exodus so God appear to Moses and the burning tree Bush on Mount Sinai I've seen my people suffering the outcry has risen.
 God says and so Moses you I'm sending you to the pharaoh go confront pharoah go meet with the Elders of Israel I'm going to set my people free the outcry of the oppressed yep has risen and God is moved by it at the end of Exodus to God hears and sees the groaning of the oppressive ways of Egypt and he's he's moved to act we already have a passionate got here so Moses first response has no no I'm not going to do that what if the people ask me what God is sending me what am I what am I going to say so God says I'm stuck out of your ancestors Moses weld know what if they ask me your name I don't know your name I can't go until some is named no I'm not going to do it I am not eloquent I can't speak for him five times and on the fifth and final of objection Moses just says please my Lord
 send someone else I'm not going to do it then Exodus 4 verse 14 then the Lord knows burned hot against Moses and he said what about your brother Aaron the levite you can speak well
 in fact he's already on his way to meet you will be glad when he says you you speak to him and put words in his mouth and then I'll help both of you speak and teach you what to do that's interesting keep Burns hot and you kind of expect this like Oh No Moses in trouble and then he just kind of like becomes a problem solver and he's like oh okay well I'm a here's a way through yes totally slow to anger and then restrained her so slow because I give my kids like three channels and then I get along and nostril gets angry it's after five times and even then what he does is make a concession to Moses his fear and stubbornness I think this is so significant
 yeah the first time that God gets angry know it doesn't mean that he will do this every time but it's the first portrait of God's God's anger in the story for burns with anger and he says yeah okay we're going to first one we can look tomorrow and this one 10 so the question that we started this off with was what does God get angry about so here it's maybe this lack of trust in him that Moses is displaying God is saying I'll go with you I've given you everything I'll make you speak I'll turn the I'm going to rescue the people I've already told you that with the staff has given him those so that the people will believe in you thank you when people persistently resist him and don't believe that he's reliable
 I'm trustworthy and good set a relational context here again he's he's revealed himself to Moses there's this trusting relationship that he's building this would be similar to somebody that you are building trust with and are really being generous with and they just continue to assume the worst of you and I don't trust you and that I think that would make anybody angry least frustrated frustrated is a good translation because it seems to pass
 Kansas the first one second time God's anger is mentioned is in the story of The Parting of the Red Sea actually in the poetic retelling of it so there's a narrative in Exodus 14 The Waters part and the waters come back down on pharaoh and his armies and then in the poem that Miriam and Moses thing is Exodus 15 verse four and following Pharaoh's chariots in his army he cast into the sea the choice officers drowned in the sea the deeps cover them they went down like a stone and number seven in the greatness of Your Excellence you overthrow those who rise up against you you send forth your heat your hot anger it consumes them like chaff you send the wind of your nostrils and the waters were piled up flowing Waters stood up like a heat deeps were concealed in the heart of the sea so God's Act of essentially destroying pharaoh and his army
 the Waters of the sea is both an active Justice and we're told here and expression of God's hot Banker so it's back up and Ponder what is it that Pharaoh has been doing that generates this response of hot Anger from God
 play quiz pop quiz
 Pharaoh is what he's been slaving the Hebrew people he committed genocide of some sort on on them to kind of keep the population under control baby boys in the river and he actually made it at one point as a native he's just making it harder for them to even do the work that he wants them to do just he's at this caricature of a really cruel all-powerful bad dude who was given not just five chances but ten chances to act differently because you think that that's related to the five Moses five resistances before God gets angry a level of themes in the book that there's two people that God gives multiple chances to one is first of all Moses he gets angry on the 5th time I was goddess the tenth time that aroused
 the banker was Pharaoh so if we're trying to build a portrait of things that God gets angry at here it's evil and oppression murder violence inspired by yeah Imperial oppression stuff like that so last time God gets angry in the book of Exodus and it's our story Exodus 34:6 the story of the golden calf what's interesting here is this is a portrait where God has heavily invested in myself in these people well-being you rescued them from Egypt provided for them Manna in the wilderness LED them to the mountain showed up personally for them and ask them to give him their allegiance and to know whether God and the first thing they do is make an idol representation of him and he's so that they are
 his Representatives on Earth if he's invited them to be his Representatives that's right you got it is now tied to this nation and how they act and what are they worship him or don't the same reason that somebody that you have been married to when they let you down that generates a bigger emotional response then somebody you know that you're in the grocery store iOS and they like you know cut you off or something like that cuz their car in front of yours still hurts but it hurts less and less that's the trigger of you holding in a lot of anger and then you let it all out at that poor that poor woman in the grocery aisle just didn't see you so we can read the story in previous podcast Series so this is Exit 32 right after the people make the golden calf this is what God says to Moses who's up on the
 he says the Moses give me rest uses know his name as a verb give me some rest so that my anger may burn against the people I'm going to finish them off I'm going to bring it into them and I'll start over with you and make you into a great nation hey do you think those words rest and to finish those are really big like creation worse. Just saying I am going to recreate something new when the flood design pattern is being activated the word to rest and finish are often accused that we're in that somatic part of the cycle so the question is does God does Moses actually give God Rest it's usually translated into English leave me alone and you kind of missed the word play the gives me rest now you could give God Rest by
 okay I'll I'll like leaving or he could give God rest and some other way he chooses some other way so Moses then sought the favor of Yahweh why does your nose burn up against the people that you brought out of Egypt with great power and the mighty hand you know do you really want the Egyptians saying evil purposes bring them out and kill them in the mountains what you want from your hot anger and relent which is where do Elsa rhymes with Noah's name FM don't bring disaster on your people also remember you made a promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and you swore an oath
 and got responses then the Lord has armed he relented and didn't bring on his people the disaster that he said so these three stories about anger and I must give you the whole Biblical Portrait in a nutshell first time it's with Moses it's somebody who's really intimately connected himself to constant to distrust won't work with me and he gets angry but she doesn't do anything terrible he's just angry is like a normal person would be a normal being with me because I don't know what's normal for God said in the second one with the Red Sea it's God respond his anger is aroused by Justice
 or Injustice being done against the vulnerable in the oppressed and then this last time that Mount Sinai it's about when people that God soup not just when he's in Covenant relationship the people to whom he's married and who he's named as his representative is when those people betray his trust that's when he gets the most angry this is really important the golden calf story is giving us this fundamental portrait of God's anger towards Israel and it's it's about Covenant betrayal by the people that God has invested the most in out of all the families of the Earth the most Angry God ever gets in the Bible it's always at covenant betrayal by the specific group of people okay that's kind of scary yeah, but it doesn't make sense it's just the people that you're most invested in emotionally in relationally
 will arouse the greatest emotions in you. I think anger makes the most sense to us inside of like a a partnership for a relationship or a lot of times anger is the emotional response and there's a happy trail or something like that but why did you say scary John just that that intensity is is greater and you actually have a portrait that shows God being slow to anger when you get to Moses and the burning bush he gets angry or he said to be angry but then he doesn't act out of anger so you're interesting and then with pharaoh and his intention ansuz it isn't like the biggest baddest dude in the Bible so far
 it isn't ten chances and so that's that's a pretty long suffering and then and then here now we've got this story so maybe we shouldn't be surprised when God the center attribute that he describes himself is slow to anger you've seen it on display and then he's willing to turn away from his anger and not act upon it his son why is Moses is there so we talked about the story so much and we have a really important story and it's never and it never feels locked in like in a way of like I get it it always feels like every time I read you read and Moses's like you know defense attorney speech and it's weird it's like why you know he's reminding God of things and he's uncomfortable to think that God's first reaction was yeah I'm done like I'm just going to
 Royce Troy everyone to start back with you Moses even that still feels uncomfortable voice that especially if like someone's listening in this first time in the story like there's a lot of really fascinating a strange things going on in this Narrative of his doing heavy duty theological reflection on issues of divine sovereignty and human well partnership with human partnership with humans what does it mean to say that God genuinely partners with humans and here is a picture he listens to their yeah their desires Our advice is God in Covenant and the fact the problem is that gods and coming up with all these people but right now only only one of them is really being faithful actually Joshua to do the Heat in the background but yeah it's really so God what can't will also turn from his anger if there is a righteous intercessor who will stand in the gap
 half of corrupt humans is another important factor in in God's anger these are the three first stories of God's anger in the Bible sorry you when you said righteous intercessor because there's a moment and is in and what we just read what is a moment where Moses just says why don't you take it out on why don't you just destroy me offered his own life in the place of the sinful people and at that point God has passed his anger and she says that won't be necessary these people will get what's coming to them in due time essentially is God's response then so these three moment of anger only one of them results in a severe active Justice that's on Pharaoh at the at the sea the first one got doesn't do anything severe with Moses and then this last one God wants to do something severe but the righteous intercessor turns him from his anchor so God's anger has a complex
 play some shipped to his acts of bringing judgment on human evil be with me that it's not it's not predictable or formulaic is that what you're saying and there are sometimes where God will just bury his anger but not responding to severe way but sometimes God will respond in it and it's severe way and all three of those are ways that God is angry in the Bible we have such a complex relationship with anger wheel of anger when it is against Injustice like we love the Jack Reacher stories I love Jack Reacher stories that you know these stories it just like the guy comes in he just was like I'm going to be the judge and jury and I'm I'm just taking down there something about God it with Pharaoh in the Red Sea kind of get that feeling like you have finally this justice but then when we get to this story in Exodus
 32 34 when God gets angry at his people I still feel uncomfortable for the consequence of idolatry to be I'm going to finish them I'm going to finish that it just feels like you dodged a bullet there like now let's not let's tiptoe around God now like let me out with that Divine anger and we need to go back and actually become to understand God's judgment
 when God asks severely towards human evil is there a pattern for how God works and the answer is yes I've discovered and filling out this portrait of God's anger now we need to correspond with it a more nuanced Biblical Portrait of how God responds to human evil released human-like stubbornness and lack of trust and then once we join those together I think we're better equipped to understand there is where God is angry and then hands people over to severe severe judgments that make any sense stuff that we're going in here so we got two things now we got to go but now we have these stories about God's justice and judgment and how did those two go together
so understand God's judgment we first have to do the little culture translation of getting ourselves back into the biblical cosmology so I won't rehearse this cuz we've done it so many times
 heavens above the land where the humans are put with the animals and the chaotic Waters to write running a thing that's right within that three-tiered Cosmos the land is where the humans belong and out of their God the land emerges out of the waters that God had to split cuz when they were just undulating and chaotic wild and waste their so God splits the waters and then the dry land but God doesn't do away with the waters in Genesis 1 just like he doesn't do away with the darkness
 he contains them and orders them so they're still there the waters are still out there around the Dryland Genesis one but he's brought up set the dry land on pillars you learn the Psalms the depiction of Creation in Genesis one is that God is sustaining the safe order dry land for us but the waters are below it the waters are around it there's actually Waters up above to and that any moment it could all collapse and go back to the pre-creation state that's the flow and that's the flood everything goes dark and the waters claps back in on themselves so that basic idea of Genesis 1 order and disorder Dryland versus the waters is really important for us to get in got judgment in the pipe hole like stuff like so important
 OK Google list past weather so Genesis one dry land and its really good I'm glad we're on it step 1 Step 2 let's look at it from another angle Genesis to the Garden of Eden hear the story to Texas as if we're looking from an aerial angle down on the dry land and it's just will it to Rocky Barren Wilderness but God bring some water up from the ground plants a garden makes a human and he moves the human he creates the human outside the garden Genesis 2 and he forms a human breathe into at the breath of life and then he takes the human and out of the Wilderness Rocky land and moves them moves the human into the garden and plant that's the story of Genesis to so to be in the garden is to be in the realm of protected ordered life on the dry land
 but to be outside of the Garden in that Rocky Wilderness desolate land that's the realm of danger and disorder and and death so on this way of seeing the world you've got the ordered central place that's protective and life and you have the waters out there you have the Wilderness and on this model of the world being exiled out of the ordered space is the worst thing that can happen to you
 and for the waters to come rushing up or down upon the dry land that's the other worst thing and both of those things are what happens to humans in the next couple Pages after they rebelled and so when is that God's judgment in the Bible is actually undoing it's an undoing of the things that God has done to create order and bring life but it's also as it were abandoning his creation and letting things collapse back in on themselves or letting humans go back to the place where they started which was outside outside the garden so just just letting creation be is the same thing as judgment in this scenario because God is sustaining he sustaining the rakia the sky dumb he's the sustaining the dry land on the pillars that's the assumption but when he stops do
 all those protective spaces just collapse in the creation just be we don't even have language to talk about this because on this world model creation and existence is the result of God bringing his sustaining order there is no creation without God's sustaining order so Saudi creation the creation of the phrase that the profits are going to use the Apostle Paul really gloms onto it's about God and creation over to its own natural processes of decreation disintegration then and disorder and you mean handing over or handing humans are a nation over over to The Logical end of the choices that they're making
 for example when God invites the people into the garden he gives them everything they need however is so not going to trust him the day that you eat of it you will die what's interesting is when the people eat from the forbidden fruit. Doesn't get angry and he also doesn't kill them as such but he does exiled them from the garden into the place where they started which was in the land of Rocky Wilderness death in the same way when the outcry of the blood of Abel and all of the innocent Rises up to God and the land is full of violence in Genesis 6 what God does he says he tells me he says in end is coming the end is here it's like the sandwich board on him the end is near but what story isn't just about a lot of heavy rain from our point of view its undoing Genesis one it's the collapse of the water is back in to
 to consume the dry land and so it's just a different way of thinking about Cosmos and a different way of thinking about human responsibility and human choices that was in this world you God's judgment is to relax his ordering power and to give humans over to where they came from and where they're going to which is back to the dust and it's to remove his ordering power from the cosmos and allow creations of to collapse in on itself again that's what the Exile from Eden and the flood story which of the two first judgment stories in the Bible that's what they're trying to tell us about the way that God judges to hand people over to the outcome of their decisions so I got a picture that of of God at Sinai with his people and you know I was telling you just feel so uncomfortable forgot to say I'm done you guys I'm going to destroy you or not but I just got this picture
 you know what's the difference between that and God saying like okay have fun in the desert like I'm out like I'm going to leave because they're out I mean they're not going to survive out there but what I hear you saying is there's a sense of if we don't want to live with in God's ordered protective like the way that he keeps things we are outside of what's good and that's where you'll find that God will give us what we want and if you think about that they were other options they actually wanted it a different God we want a different kind of God different kind of God and so if he if I'll give you over to what you want yeah let's go back to the flood though cuz actually the flood story is an important design pattern being activated in the golden calf story The First Time God is depicted as feeling any emotion in
 Bible it's not anger it's grief and sorrow
the flood story if anybody thinks about how catastrophic you know it actually isn't story rotting corpses floating in the water everywhere so here's the thing is that the sledges it's really so bring the sobering portrait of God's justice God is never said once to be angry in that story with the introduction says in chapter 6 is this the Lord was sorry that he made humans on the land and he was pained he felt pain in his heart we read on man this is so crucial this is scholar Daniel Hawk first pointed this out to me this is the introduction to the flood and this is verse 11 of Genesis 6 it says the land was ruined before God and the land was filled with violence like what happened to Cain and Abel went viral lots of blood crying out so God saw the land and look it was ruined
 for All Flesh has caused the ruin of its way upon the land was very clear here the land is being ruined and that humans are the one causing the ruin on the land are clearly the point here verse 13 so God said to Noah the end of All Flesh has come up before me because the land is filled with violence because of them and look I am going to cause their ruin with the land and then it goes on to talk about the flood
 this is really important for Understanding God's judgment is that humans are ruining the land through Bloodshed and violence and God sees that humans are ruining the land and then what he says is I am going to cause they're ruined with the land to see how it's parallel yeah look a little disappointing when I realized it but are English translations don't help us get this connection near the point is that God's decision to bring the flood is actually connected with the disaster that humans are bringing upon themselves already so God's decision isn't it being imposed of some abstract or alien thing from the outside it's actually prompted by what humans are doing and then accelerating it or giving them over to it for example that it's already ruined and inevitable
 yeah they're in self-destruction mode and they're destroying creation and God says let me just make this happen right away like let's just that's right super drive this and creation will ruin you completely now so that God says the end of All Flesh has come up before me as literally as in English as you can do what the Hebrew says but look at what are English translations do their New International Version God said to Noah I am going to put an end to all people
 really different yeah the ESV has I have determined to make an End of All Flesh and again the Hebrew reads the end of All Flesh has come up before me because the land is filled with violence so you tell me what the difference that you're perceiving their is what you can see is there's already a slow motion flood in the making humanly caused blood through Neil and they're ruining Creation in the flood is the is the creation and so is very different than saying you guys are disappointing me and you're not you're not what I wanted so I'm just going to destroy you all yeah that's different than you guys are destroying creation yordy creating what I've made which includes each other and and so I'm going to turn you over to that and we're going to just make this happen right away we're not going to not going to let this be prolonged this is what you want boom
 Yep this is this is what we're going to get yeah yeah and I almost got us just realizing when it says the end of all flashes come before me realizing what what the inevitable outcome is going to want to read Romans 1 now again we will we will let later in this conversation maybe not for a few more on this episode of your instincts were right the other words to Portrait of the first to Portrait of divine judgment Exile from Eden and the flood Story show God accelerating or handing people over to the cause-effect sequence that they have put into motion through their choices were God's anger has always read a response it's not endemic to his nature it's a response to people ruining each other or the land so when Paul and Roman 1 in Romans 1
 3 * / said God's Wrath is revealed how that paragraph opens in Romans one and three times over he says and God handed them over and it's so idolatry is too sexual misbehavior and just violent people in general and it's completely consistent with this this portrait I can I quote from The Scholar who first pointed this out to me just cuz it's so good it's from Daniel Hawk who has an excellent book called the violence of the biblical God that he says this introduction to the flood story suggests that God has seen where the ruination of creation is headed and he's decided to accelerate the process to its completion the plain sense of the Hebrew text conveys something very different from most English translations which are perhaps influenced by the view of an angry punitive deity was an ancient symbol of Destruction and disorder and so is a city
 medium for the dissolution of creation as it overwhelms every boundary returns creation to the primordial undifferentiated that existed for Yahweh spoke boundaries into being he's a good writer this is good we are left with the sense that God is not so much sending the flood to punish the world as much as facilitating through the flood the inevitable descent into chaos caused by human destructiveness and violence and already ruined creation and in so doing creates conditions for a reordering and renewal to take place
 the floods the collapse of Genesis 1 and so the this is why the recession of the waters in Genesis 8 is all activating language from Genesis one cuz it's a new creation but man when I began to go back and read stories about God's judgment in the rest of the Bible and it really new things I began to notice new things in and say so that's what your kind of beginning to reach for their John was Exodus 32 trying to see if from within this framework is real there is in self-destruction mode saying where do this our own way we're going to make God in an image we can handle and what God can see is like okay you decided to destroy yourself let me just do it now for you and I can start over with Moses that feels a little more palatable I suppose but yeah there's a sense of handing over to that that's what you want like I agree
 in the story of the that the flood but he gives people what they want are the picture of honoring people's choices but I think the uncomfortable thing for me still with the flood story and later stories is the most like the plan a plan B plan C like the way that God is portrayed as so responsive
 I got this didn't work I'm going to start over like this and then this didn't work I'm going to faint that's you know what the story and we're learning the point of the story is to understand who got isn't understand who humans are and how he relates and I think we're getting that either way but yeah dealing with the change in plans it's kind of uncomfortable about God's purposes and his relationship time, but I think that's a hard it's a hard framework to get out of and to just read the story as it is and maybe that's all I'm acknowledging everyone was really violent and it was ruined yet like and if that's true like it that he's gotten that bad then yeah let's like
 it's like the whole thing is going to collapse in on itself that's right and when Noah gets off the boat the first thing that God says to himself is you know what humans are no different humans are exactly the same going to happen again and if I'm going to use this flood strategy every time humans do that there's going to be no more creation and that's your point Carissa which is like what didn't got no doubt this place with a story but it's almost like every further step of wickedness humans take got further binds himself to them to create something new which is a further binding words that every step that humans The Human Condition is explored is even more hopeless what God does actually is leaning more and invest
 himself more in relationship to his creation I think that they can this is how the Torah is torta which means instruction it's it's teaching us about the core portrait of God's relationship to the world another layer of this is that the logic of God's judgment is to accelerate or work through the cause-effect sequence that's already been begun by people in to carry it through and so in in Jewish tradition but they called this a mess God's measure for measure response it's very typical in biblical narratives were God's response Oregon judging is to bring about the thing that somebody was trying to do but back on them the man who digs a pit will fall in Pharaoh kill the firstborn of Israel God will take the life of the firstborn of Pharaoh Pharaoh throws people in the waters God destroys Pharaoh in the waters
 people were ruining the land through violence God will accelerate that by ruining the land with the flood is if this inner logic of human evil and God's justice in this measure for measure relationship and it's crucial like without it once I got this the way that biblical narratives about God's judgment communicate started to make so so much more sense and armed with these two perspectives I think we can start to go into some stories about God's anger and judgment and gain some new insight
what we talked about. I think ER in the last episode and that anger isn't a negative thing on its face it can its anger is an immoral emotion and when used properly and to protect what is good it's a wonderful emotion or something we should we should want and others but then how do you act out of anger and one one way that people use your anger is is as energy to then fight Injustice and I think the scary thing is that that can go wrong really quickly if someone's really angry and then using that energy to try to right a wrong they can go too far and then the anger could actually caused them to overreacting and cause more problems than they're solving and so how do you use anger to to right a wrong
 or to make things that are being destroyed whole again and this is the language of Judgment of how do I how do I make this how to make this get back to the way it's supposed to be and so then we've been talking about God's judgment and what you're saying Tim is God's judgement is I heard two things one is judgement handing over it isn't of like it isn't this vindictive like oh you hurt me so much hurt you it's this is the choice you've made and I'm going to allow it and in fact I'm in the like I'm going to just get it over with because you know I don't want to see all the destruction was asked to have it done with and and then the second thing you were saying it seems like you're saying there's this appropriateness to it which is like there's this sense of
 God responds and kind this is where we get to like the the eye for an eye kind of thing though and so can you speak to that really quick like what's rain in the tradition I grew up in spiritual you like the iPhone I was a negative thing and you know if I accidentally likes my ex had you know flies off and hits your eye I'm really glad we have the eye for eye rule when you come to chop off my head in response right yeah just take my eye that's all I took you for more likely you know a monetary fine that's equal to the value of my eye and how that actually worked on cracked it okay for measure that the way that God responds to evil has an intrinsic connection to the evil that's being perpetrate
 and often to hand people over to the outcome of the decisions that they're already making cuz human evil to create disorder and death and only God can create order out of disorder and search for God to relax his staying power is to have people over to the consequences that I'm hearing you say is that there's this interconnectedness between a lot of a lot of different things so humans and creation and animals Humanity's role is to care for creation and so when they're ruining it creation folds in on them that's it's almost like it's an appropriate that that's what they're doing already there's like an interconnectedness that I think it's hard for us maybe in our modern world used to understand and then the connection between doing something and experiencing the consequence of that thing the natural consequence of that thing being a a judgment
 Rebel Son and that when the sun comes to the father in the story which represents God and says I want the inheritance I'm out God says okay the father doesn't get angry the father gives him what he wants it gives him what he wants and then what he wants actually leads to his destruction would be able to buy that story is that he turns back and God and then God doesn't hold it against him that he had made that decision that's right and that hasn't come up in the story so far but there are a lot of examples of judgment or consequence leading to Salvation or the purpose of those things being sell their sick like I said nice or is it does come up a little bit that the purpose is a greater purpose of re-creation or New Life or forgot to work out his purposes for all Humanity the flood is the most extreme Act of judgment in the Bible cuz if it's about the end of the D creation of undoing of Genesis 1 so everything after that even though it seems extreme.
 Is meant to seeing as be seen as like paling in comparison and God or Gods theoretically has recourse to the flood option but the fact that he doesn't is what can motivate the poet of I think it's on 103 he doesn't treat us as our sins deserve
 Again part of this is adjusting ourselves to a lot of things in the Bible to really be able to hear the stories about God's judgment on their own terms and then the next step that will take then the stories we looked at just now none of them mention God's anger if they do mention God's emotion they mention is sorrow the flood doesn't is a Act of Sorrow is he hands creation over to chaos so what about stories where God is angry and the X in judgment we haven't talked about any of those quite yet and there's a lot of them so that's what we should begin to explore now I think
 thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast we're going to continue this conversation on God's anger wrath of God judgement and actually continue for a few more episodes because it's pretty complex and heavy topic will continue that next week most intensely expressed against the people that he is married to so that they can become his representatives to Nations and when those people not to fail him when they betrayed him this generates the most intense expressions of God's anchor God's anger expresses itself through God hiding his face metaphorically concretely by handing Israel over so that their conquered by their enemies and that's the pattern of God's anger purpose for one is justice that sense of right I gave you people this and this is what you do to me
 okay I will give you the consequences of your of your decision but what I think was supposed to strike us is that those consequences are never permanent when it comes to Ultimate long-term strategy which is to install humans as his partner silver have another that promise won't even let his anger overshadow it show was crucified and Uncle so nuts by Camden McAfee and the theme music is by the band tense Bible project is a non-profit we exist to experience the Bible as a unified the way that leads to Jesus everything we make is already been paid for by a generous patrons people like you who have supported this project and so everything's free and you can find it on our website Bible project.com thanks for being a part of this with us
