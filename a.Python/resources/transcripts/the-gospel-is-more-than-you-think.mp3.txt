hey this is John at the Bible project you've been around Christians or you are one yourself chances are you've heard the word the gospel like do you believe the gospel so what does gospel mean the gospel is a Greek word that means good news and that raises the question good news about what Jesus goes on the public scene announcing that God's kingdom has come near has arrived and that he is it's anointed Harold the good news is that God's kingdom has come near and Jesus is bringing it but here's the thing many of us have grown up and Christian culture and we're taught that the gospel with something more specific than that the gospel was about how I personally become safe that is how to make sure I go to heaven when I die in the mid-twentieth century the word gospel because of some really influential and positive movement I think the word
 kind of got narrowed down to refer specifically to the moment of the Cross as a substitution Airy death for my sins so that I can go to heaven that became gospel help them understand that they are a sinner they need Jesus to die for them so that they can go to heaven after they died that was what the word gospel means to me when I first became a follower of Jesus in my twenties and just stopped in to say what a strange thing but that word came to mean that when we're reading a new testament that has this word and it refers always to the story of Jesus watching the kingdom of God dying being raised bring the kingdom of God that's what the word gospel means in the New Testament the good news is about the reign of a new king and this has implications for us but first we have to understand who this king is why he thinks he's King and that's what the first four books of the New Testament are all about ancient biographies of Jesus the historic way
 has talked about these four texts is to use one singular noun to describe all of them these four works are together the gospel they are about the gospel and then each one is The Gospel According to so it's one basic claim being announced hear from four different points of view so what does this mean that the kingdom of God is near that's ahead on Today Show thanks for joining us.
 we are having a conversation beginning conversation right now here we are about a new video you have the Bible project we are into the New Testament in the how to read the Bible series it's been ongoing series does Ben 14 videos we've been talking about how to read biblical narrative the setting characters the plot design pattern sewing pattern how to read a poetry to use of metaphor and symbolism how he proposed she works there a book that like that's how to read certain collections in the sections many sections within the Bible book and Bucks blah blah get out
 and then the prophets the profits than the books of Solomon oh yeah we are moving on to we're going to have five videos about different sections and literary genres in the New Testament and New Testament at how to read the gospels and the letters how to read the letters don't know how to read The Parables with parents are so famous yeah they're big part of just teaching and they have puzzled readers for a long time it's an acquired skill learning how to read them then how to read the letters and then the last will be how to read apocalyptic literature how good is that going to be just looking at Revelation are you going to be going to pull in will pull in the earliest Messianic Jewish followers of Jesus they had already grown up in an environment with Julie apocalyptic literature literature written that sounds and reads like the book of
 play some bread for the Book of Revelation was written assuming that readers know how to follow the signals and make sense of the symbols so it'll be about the presidents of that in the Hebrew Bible and second temple Judaism and then over three years in The Great Library videos 20 right in total 19 Matthew Mark Luke and John John at ports of Jesus's life and death and resurrection of our friends have been referred to throughout the history of the Jesus movement as gospel the gospel the gospel the oldest titles for these works
 go back to manuscripts from the 3rd and 2nd Century he is actually the phrase according to Matthew according to according to Luke according to John just just that right there according to accept that's a strange way the title of book do you write resumes will according to English but it makes sense once you understand the idea historic way to church has talked about these four texts is to use one singular noun to describe all of them these four works are together the gospel they are about the gospel and then each one is The Gospel According to so it's one basic claim being announced hear from four different points of view that's what the title means the gospel
 cording to Matthew Gospel According to mark but there's no way to refer to all four and not put an S on the further away well the gospel The Gospel according to Matthew the Gospel according to Matthew but how would you refer to the collection the gospel collection alarm clock for Full Gospel I don't know but we should recognize that most ancient perception of these for works is that they are a unified statement from four different points of view the same narrative basic Narrative of a figure named Jesus of Nazareth from his arrival on to the public seen what he did up in Galilee is going to Jerusalem for a mega confrontation with the power Brokers there is a
 do you send them to him in the resurrection for that's the basic outline and that is called The Gospel who is it okay if we talk a little bit about the the setting of like second temple when this all takes place when we spend so much time going through the storyline of nice to just sit you a our minds where we're at as that story has been unfolding got it well when Jesus appears on the scene the people of Israel live in a Melting Pot of provinces that have all them sliced up by Roman power Brokers so Caesar Augustus is on the throne and he appointed for how long has Rome been in charge this point and he missed since the fourth wall of Jerusalem been around for a while but they took
 lemon 40 BC $40 BC yeah it's so complex take me years to sort all this out you got Babylon Babylon takes out Jerusalem is backing up right now right so Israel has its own kingdom monarchy yeah split Kingdoms in the north and in the South by a Seer and a 700cc southern kingdom in Jerusalem called you that they get another hundred plus years and then Babylon takes them out and a blonde takes a Siri out to Babylon for a number of different reasons Babylon to give me a Seria crumbles as a world power in the Babylons right there though and I'm in the mid 500 the medes and the Persians join forces and a guy named Cyrus storms ancient world and he steps
 into the shoes of Babylon in the Persians are on the scene for a couple centuries five hundred to four hundred students like asterisk War story of Esther takes place Xerxes artaxerxes smallest and then Alexander the Great storms the ancient world in the mid-late 300 BC spreading the good news of Greek culture language and religion right I mean he went from Greece is famous storm love is like a real March all the way to India at 3. So that's in the 300 and then he dies at at that time the Hebrew scriptures were most were formed their being formed in the final fitting for the electron question yeah that's right and those still writing during this time of other of the other works right like this is Jewish culture is a flourishing and producing a lot of the literature that is now called the Apocrypha are soon to pick a fat butt
 the works at the center of the heat will we call the Hebrew Bible where like the man but they were the main focus here and source of inspiration and hope so hopefully it is through the people living in Jerusalem just one Howard after another one imperial oppressor after another change of leadership you got lots of juices that are like I'll do the Greek thing that sounds awesome gymnasium and all the men hang out naked that's what that means in Mike do Sports in the bath and talking about Plato and politics and so on and so you know men are naked in public square a lot in Greek culture circumcision becomes an embarrassment if you want to be like the in The In Crowd Judaism becomes a diverse mean
 met with diverse responses to the cultural change like any religious movement so once once Alexander the Great dies his massive Empire from Greece to all the way to India can divide it up dozens of smaller blocks and then that begins about a century-and-a-half of this human nature it's just everyone trying to carve out their totally yeah our Niche and it becomes a back and forth between the rulers over the land of Egypt after Alexander and the rulers over the land of Syria North of Israel Palestine they're constantly traveling up and down through the land of Israel Palestine taking israel-palestine back from each other many times
 King named Antiochus epiphanes comes into Jerusalem after being humiliated and unable to defeat the Egyptians and he takes it out on the Jews in Jerusalem that famous ya see the little horn he is a primary figure in the portrait of the little horn here but the whole point actually is you're referring to the Book of Daniel The Book of Daniel portrays the actions of Antiochus by mapping them on to the actions of Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the kings of Assyria they all becomes meta yeah it's just it's just foreign rulers who are power hungry and oppressive and violence comes in know so then you have the successful Jewish Revolt of Maccabees and in the 150s and they fell
 the First Independent Jewish State since I came to town for a hundred and they found a renewed rededicate the temple and you've got Jewish priests Kings in their own land for the last about Century until the 50s BC and that Century just a descent into madness you can read the main account is comes to us from Jessie Jessica this is Jewish historian from from later time. But and it's just a one assassination blood bath after another people are buying the high priesthood selling it to the highest bidder okay so that Jewish state becomes so internally divided and weak that when ripe for the picking this right and then the next day after then then run Rises to power over the ancient world and rom-coms and easily Scoops up this province and incorporates
 vampire here and then they appoint a semi Jewish Royal figure over the land and his name is Herod the Great so here it is he's part Jewish and he's appointed by Rome G Ceaser the first in the late forties BC and so he is decades into his Reign when Jesus was born okay so this is the hair that we meet in the birth stories of Jesus in Matthew and Luke so he's decades into his rain it's really wealthy stream Lee corrupt is assassinated his own family members because he suspected them of treason and there have been by the time Jesus is born we have had multiple revolts in rebellions and dealing with all these Jewish rebellions in the time. We're Daniel the the seven times
 90 years yeah it should be coming on until the restoration and Daniel chapter 9 we're in the century the basic you know people debated exactly so if you were counting that down as like this is when we get our freedom again correct your like it's something's going to happen is going to happen in the air and civilians in the air that's right and so you can you can mark it like right around the time. That tent of readers of the scriptures would be expecting Daniels prayer of the restoration of Jerusalem to come about you start to see in the historical record all these Rebel movements pop up and some of them are mentioned in the book of Acts wait are you that option do a few thousand people out of here today so it's I think it's imagine ourselves I am living on my ancestral Homeland we have not been able to rule ourselves except for a blip of a century that you turned in
 infighting bloodbath to the scriptures tell me that the Glory Days of David and Solomon are going to come again and that we are going to as a whole people become a light to the nation's by being faithful to our God as you know as God wanted from the beginning I live in a militarized sewn occupied by Roman legionaries the marching through their are if let's say I just grew up in the same. Jesus did I would have seen Roman soldiers marching through I probably would have seen multiple crucifixions mass crucifixions as a jerk from rebellious need my cousin he said the wrong thing or he excited as a guerrilla War group up in the Hills of Galilee
 yeah what are they perform rage down on the Romans and what was the term again for people who lived out in the Hills later on there were many others the sicarii for this car I which is the word for dagger I'm thinking of the word where one of the disciples or robber right but it's it's it's Rebel one of the people on the Hills inciting Rebellion correct Jesus is crucified between two refers to these great Jewish Guerrilla groups that we're resisting yeah Roman occupation right so just try to imagine living there lots of people right now who live in militarize knows who lives under the foreign occupier imagine just imagine yeah I was trying to get in there and it's into that setting that the Jesus story
 how to care for setting know there's a lot of potential problems of I mean it's as helpful and when you start thinking about things that Jesus said and did like you have to be really careful yeah just going to get killed right away yeah yeah ever-present thing from your earliest memory
 okay so that's just the political Stand Down in Jerusalem is the temple but the priests who works there are in full you know they're they're friends with the Roman Governor at least they have an uneasy Alliance yeah they're the ones who understand why they can still do their priesthood because of the Tempest the courtyards and so the Sadducees by the powerbrokers their car and they said you cease this is the Greek translation of the Hebrew word is Otto Keith from the priests of zadok who's one of the grandsons of Aaron so the words out of which was the lineage of Priests of the temples now really controversial place cuz of the people who run it some people think they're compromised and defiled
 and they're doing it all wrong it's just I just used it run it and so they their controversial group people want to be at the temple and often go worship the god of Israel there but also some are fine with it some begrudgingly there's a bunch of really extremist who went out to the Dead Sea because I think Jerusalem is just corrupt as like a big bag of seafood the Dead Sea Scrolls thinks that Jerusalem is an utterly defiled place now so they was Drew out there to the same region that that's John the Baptist withdrew his Juvenile and yet each other so it's just it's a very turbulent time in into which Jesus is born Jesus is born outside of Jerusalem so we went about Jerusalem but there's there's a other regions that are predominantly Jewish
 Avatar Palestine at this point is melt Melting Pot ancestral Homeland but ever since the Babylonian exile people did moving to and fro right shipped out brought back by the people they're designed to look like rum up in Galway and Jerusalem is under construction during Jesus life making it look like that's the basic yes into this setting a Messianic movement begins out of the ministry of John the Baptist was a certain figure named Jesus was from Nazareth with the Nazarene what is a Messianic movement yeah that's a good point will the word Messianic mean anointed one so the reason I say that is Jesus goes on to the public scene announcing that God's Kingdom
 has come near has arrived and that he is it's anointed Herald he's a Messianic Harold and their account now route Off to the Races to say that and not setting a very dangerous thing to say to very dangerous thing to say that's right you guys the priesthood and the Roman power structure all of that like I'm the rightful heir to this this place and from here God is going to bring blessing to the whole world through my rule that's right that's what people would hear when you say there are other people who have a similar message on the surface they crawl up in the hills and hide in the caves and perform Reds on in terms of bringing the rain of God restoring God's Reign Over Israel by destroying the pagans
 getting them out of our land that's those are also kingdom of God movements but Jesus is kingdom of God movement differ very different and it's this movement and message that the four gospel accounts are rendering for us but something happened in the story of this man that isn't just of historical interest or of interest for one people group in one place and time the reason these four gospel accounts exist is because of the conviction that what happened with Jesus matters for all humanity and for the future of the cosmos itself and its really Grand and all of this is packed into this word gospel so first I just want to have a point of conversation about that word and why are these four Works called the gospel because it's way more fascinating topics and
 realized
gospel Evangelion English for you it comes from the old English word good spell good spell good spell. Spell but it's the word good just as one of the good good spell Good Tidings a spell is a tithing spell spell spell mean story or message is the word gospel comes from the s a compound word spelled good story good store in message should message that precisely maps onto the Greek word that is derived from which is you on gallion and you on Gillian is a compound word on Galliano
 his message and you which means good suppose words mean good message oh good good news, good news is great translation actually have come to prefer to the word gospel good news good news comes from the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible that comes from that turbulent period before Jesus called the Septuagint and so you on Gillian is rendering a Hebrew word Basalt becasa RSI in transliterating Basalt which means that to Harold's goodness so here's what's fascinating if you go to marks after 1 when Jesus is introduced to you says mark 1:14 this is Jesus went in the Galilee proclaiming the you on Gillian of God
 sang the time has come the kingdom of God has come near repent and believe the young Gilliam so Jesus is marked as he's coming proclaiming the you and Gillian noticed that the only thing to describe it is that it's about what is the good news of the kingdom of God has come to the Sims that you would assume is good news his first announcement is about the gospel the good news if you go up to the opening sentence of The Gospel According to Mark the opening sentence is the beginning of the Yuan gallion about Jesus the Messiah the Son of God the first sentence of Mark it says the beginning of the young Ellie on about Jesus but then you start reading a story he says it's a job that says Jesus proclaimed the Yuan gallion of
 add sang God's kingdom has come here so somehow the message that Jesus announced about the kingdom of God has been put together in a book and now that book can be called the good news about Jesus come here but it's just important that the word good news first in the Jesus movement refers to Jesus message about the kingdom of God yeah and it's only a second stage that the good news can refer to not just Jesus as announcement about the kingdom of God himself the story about Jesus himself is now and you can see this in the use of the word gospel in the New Testament example hear us a great favor by into passages in his letters unpacking what he means by the word you want to go in on one is in
 when is chapter 1 verses 2 through 4 for you says that you won't get Leon he says I've been appointed as a Herald to 5001 regarding God son who descended from David and his physical lineage and Who was appointed by the Holy Spirit to be the Son of God in power through his resurrection from the dead Jesus the Messiah our Lord is really interesting what's running in my mind in the background right now is yeah we often get asked to make a video about the gospel just summarize the gospel and typically I think what people mean is like the Salvation code or like the show like how do you make sure you're going to Heaven Can you summarize that but that becomes what we mean when we say the gods yes here when he comes summarizes the gospel it's kind of a cool summary it's a great summary yeah it's about the Son of God who he was a human
 why did David Israel Messiah and his appointed by the Holy Spirit to be nice on that God and power power through his resurrection he added that the good news is that the crucified well he doesn't mention the point is he doesn't draw attention to the death of Jesus's death here right he assumes it by mentioning the resurrection defines what he means by the word you won't get away so we just read it there's one other passage where he explicitly defines what he means by the word Ian de Leon Swift look at that first Corinthians 15 I make known to you my brothers and sisters he's riding to the followers of Jesus in Corinth cuz I make known to you all that you want jelly on which I preached to you which you also received in which you stand and by which you are saved that is if you hold fast to the word that I preached to you unless you believe
 for I delivered to you as a first importance what I received that's what my father says listen he's about to go into a whole thing about the resurrection cuz there's a whole bunch of people in Corinth don't believe in the resurrection of Jesus or anybody for that matter so he's wants to make a crystal clear he was a good news and he says I pass it on to you but I didn't make this up he says it was passed down to me I received it and then I pass it on to you here is what I received this isn't my unique deal this is like the Jesus movement that's what I can do here is Paul's explanation of the Evangelion he says that the Messiah died for our sins according to the scriptures he was buried he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures then he appeared and goes on to a long list of appearances he appeared to K Faust's Peter then to the 12 after that he appeared to 500 of Brothers at once many
 alive like right now you go talk to him some of died then he appeared to James then to all the apostles and then last of all to me so notice here he defines you on Gillian as the Messiah dying for our sins according to scripture is buried raised on the third day according to scripture is just the sheer fact that the two times and I'll Paul's letters were he actually has a couple others his point is to explain the meaning of the word you on gallion and they're not identical it doesn't have like his stock crazy he's just pulling out he he will focus Hill shape the good news differently in different contexts for different audiences but notice in both cases what it does include Jesus and the resurrection assumes his death but notice in Rome has one he doesn't explicitly mentioned
 room is one he doesn't talk about any sort of atoning sacrifice and my point isn't that these exclude each other one is just simply this that there's some sort of core underlying story but that can be molded and differently represented by the apostles for different audiences in different contexts for which should make us wary of thinking that there must be one specific way of hear the good news in Devon jelly on the year you're going to have to decide what to put in and leave out not only is it the story about a person which obviously you can't tell story about a human being really tightly but it's connected to all of the Hebrew scriptures in the hopes and and
 it's not just somebody dying for another person talk connected to this somebody dying for another person sends you know like what the whole story of the Hebrew Bible's about so what I'm when I say Messiah died for sins what I mean is interpreting that to a storyline of the he provided when I say that he raised again yesterday interpret that through storyline of the entire Bible and so yes how do you do that tightly and that's kind of been a continual gospel right yeah you can do it from different angles and different ways emphasizing different things depending on the audience in the focus yes but at its base it's a story about Jesus about the kingdom of God about his life death and Resurrection watching the kingdom of God in the context of the whole storyline of the Bible and if
 you have that skeleton outline you were telling me the gospel which all of a sudden it makes sense that why these four works are called The Gospel I think we're into a bit of a shift maybe in some many forms of Western protestantism I don't know like you said in the mid-twentieth century the word gospel because of some really influential and positive movements I think we're gospel count got narrowed down to refer specifically to the moment of the Cross as a substitution Airy death for my sins so that I can go to heaven that became a gospel help them understand that they are a sinner they need Jesus to die for them so that they can go to heaven after they died that was what the word gospel means to me when I first became a follower of Jesus in my twenties and
 what a strange thing that that word came to mean that when we're reading a new testament that has this word over a hundred times and it refers always to the story of Jesus watching the kingdom of God dying being raised to bring the kingdom of God that's what the word gospel means in the New Testament right but somehow a very narrow abstracted definition became common usage in the 20th century. The gospel is yes that Jesus death wasn't atoning sacrifice that it was yes it was for you can look through the story of Jesus to the lens of atoning sacrifice and see that part 2 Shimmer it is a part is part it is a part in a really really bad which I became the most critical are in in the Stream of twentieth-century Evangelical
 was introduced to the face and then now we should just stop and say and then the second part so you can go to heaven when you die that is less ya ya might not even once but the atoning sacrifice thing says our sins according to the scriptures it's also the one dying on behalf of the many are suffering so that they may escape death this is a is from Genesis 3 15 to the whole view Revival in like one of its core main ideas. So it is very very core but Paul goes on to talk about the burial and the resurrection and then when we unpacked gospel in Romans 1 it's about the exaltation of the resurrected one to become lord of the world yes and is in the kingdom of God critically important to and that is that is also as important to the
 the word gospel as the atoning desperate thoughts were saying the word gospel is unpacked with a larger definition than what you and I were first introduced yeah
I guess kind of depending on who you're talkin to it's wise to step back and think okay I've got the whole yet let's say you have the whole of the Hebrew scriptures in your mind and the life death resurrection of Jesus and how that's if the filament of the story and you've got a few minutes till I communicate that to someone how are you going to do that and it really depends on who you're talking to and their circumstances what they know and you have to make a decision to how do I tenderize the gospel is easy to get have to leave stuff out you're going to have to focus on certain things I mean even when like a gnat and stores of Acts in the book of Acts when when their sermons essentially where is it Peter gets up and you can just see things it's like he tells of the Gospel but in a very specific way for the Pacific route
 being a new followers of Jesus reading through the speeches and acts and the one that's really the most for lunch if I was just speech to the Philosopher's in Athens and acts 17:30 kind of he's retelling kind of the story of creation about like you know you look around you know God's given us all of these great gifts we live and move and have our being in him out of his butt when he gets to the Jesus part of the story all he says is and that God has appointed the lord of the World by raising him from the dead but the Jesus part and then that's when you know that many people bought him because of the Resurrection but he doesn't mention the atoning death right at least not enough speech what dimensions is he's appointed a lord of the World by raising him from the dead now she's raised from the dead that means you got killed yeah but the point is this the other day he was even a context where Paul didn't focus on the atoning death right what he's focused on is Jesus's exaltation to Lorde h o
 yeah so we're not saying is Jesus's death isn't part of the Gospel we're saying is the gospel is it a larger it's the story of the gospels the four gospels are they like the story that I just tell should be about Jesus about something to do with how we brought the the realm of heaven or God's kingdom here and that he launched it through his death and resurrection of the day is now the lord of the world and all of that only makes sense when yes you understand what Paul means according to the scriptures Direct that's right it will be a story that's fitting culmination of a longer pre story that will help you understand the Jesus store that's right so there you go that's what the four gospels are trying to do so in this video what I'm hoping is we can introduce people to maybe I mean many people when they're
 first learning to read the Bible the first following Jesus or their whole lives I hope our reading rereading the four gospels yeah some of the easiest part of the bible to read a narrative amazing incredible stuff that he says I think I get this part yeah I don't know why I said that thing about a fig tree for you at or cursing a fig tree or some weird stuff like why do you have to be so mean to that guy call that woman a dog and compare her to a dog and why do you have to heal that guy's eyes to tie twice Mike to get him full heal than others to do you know why there was talking about son of man figuring all this but those Oddities don't
 rashada just the sheer beauty of who he is and how he treats Outsiders and his wisdom and his insight into the human heart that's what anybody can walk away and then you get his his teachings and his Parables and yes those are equally intriguing and perplexing as the stories about him that's right but I'm hoping the video can do is take the viewer to kind of the next level of seeing alcohol there's more going on here than I realized and I could begin to read these texts with even more understanding and a little more wisdom if I put a couple that we can ask him a few questions and noticing a few things, the next level level reader s like a s pass assume that the viewers can basically know what the gospels are and they tried to read them right and I
 I want to do is make them aware that there's a multiple more layers of depth here that make it worth picking up the gospels another time
 okay thanks sorry we've talked about the word gospel what it meant for Jesus was the arrival of God's kingdom, he meant by the word good news and he meant by that the arrival of the thing that the prophets of the Hebrew Bible primarily comes from the book of Isaiah when Paul and Jesus are using it they're tapping into the announcement of the profits of God's kingdom arriving heralded by a priest-king prophet figure and a New Covenant Community to be born
 so that Isaiah will talk more about that but what are these four gospel accounts are is accounts about Jesus's announcement of the Gospel but now that account itself is a message of the Gospel to use the reader so Jesus announcing the arrival of God's kingdom to people in Galilee and Jerusalem has become the gospel to people of all Nations roof and that's what these are so I've got
 I don't know how boring paragraph I don't know I think it's exciting. Here's a here's a rough estimation of a definition of gospel the gospels are carefully designed theological biographies of Jesus of Nazareth they focus on his announcement of the young Gilliam they are not merely a historical records trying to make a claim about things that happened in history but they're not merely trying to tell me about something interesting that happened they are designed to advance a claim that will challenge the readers thinking and behavior so the reason these texts exist is because their authors believe every person needs to reckon with what happened new in the story of Jesus and you were going to be forced to make a decision about him after reading this book is the neutral know book not a neutral but it's it's gone
 agenda in the second to last chapter of the Gospel of John he straight-up tells you he says I could have written many many more stories about Jesus he says I selected these so that I could persuade you the reader to believe that Jesus is the Messiah Son of God so the keys they have an agenda they're trying to persuade you by means of these stories about Jesus but he was mine definition they want to challenge Advance a claim that will challenge you here's the claim that the crucified risen Jesus of Nazareth crucified and risen Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah of Israel and the true lord of the world actually balancing to Galls think as an author I'm trying to Faithfully represent a story of that I that happened but at the same time I'm trying to persuade you the reader to start following Jesus
 and the gospels are always doing both of us things at the same time right yeah we're like we think of writing history like if you were going to be a pure his story and you come without an agenda right which arguably is impossible only reason you create an account of something in the past is because you think it's worth killing for the present for a press right I'll learn something from it though some reason and you have an assumption of what that thing is that they should learn and what and why it's important and what it means which is why you would want to tell anybody about you that's why you chose to tell this story but not tell that story or emphasized of this detail and I'm says that detail direct yeah yeah that's right which is again at the end of John he could have picked all kinds of things of the stories are teachings of Jesus I picked these in order to persuade you so yeah when I say that the illogical biographies
 man turning into a really cool conversation in West 30-40 years of New Testament scholarship scholarship to significant names are Richard Burr Ridge then a woman named loveday Alexander and what they did was go read all of the narrative biography is from the Greek and Rome era create a profile of like this is how we need to buy a key works and then they created these big comparative accounts and analyses and people still appeal to these works today they're going to have it when did they do the time in the 80s 70s 80s and it's been filled out and you know and so on but on the whole it's the way the scholars will talk about it is the Greek word is by us and just like we use the word by us
 it refers to a certain kind of narrative that the narrative wear a key historical figure it's a narrative that is trying to represent the essence and meaning of their life and contribution in other words it's not archival interest it's saying this figure matters and everything is designed around telling you why they matter their persuasive documents they put forward figures that are worth emulating were following and what bridge and Alexander come to the conclusion is that actually is the element that the god both turn up the volume on the most in comparison of persuasiveness yes and which makes sense you know an ancient bios of Aristotle you know or a Play-Doh their Noble figures and they're still philosophers who you know the author wants them to respect their works and learn from them and so on
 but Jesus is someone that if you come across the story of Jesus it's a one of his followers telling you and they want you to join his community the community of his followers here and take his way of life and live as if the stories really true so they turn up the persuasion more than your average ancient Greek biography it's really interesting to think about cuz it's like I you know listen to Plato like learned from him yeah but if you end up like not spending a lot of your life think about Play-Doh yeah oh well you're missing out but the world has a ruler the world's changed it has a new king and you have to make a decision of whether you're going to acknowledge the Risen King Jesus cuz he is your lord whether you acknowledge it or not but these texts day so there's they have a
 vested interest in forcing you to meet to educating unit Crossroads bring you to a Crossroads to so that if you read it you at least you can't remain neutral and you have to say is bologna no thank you or there's something here that I've never thought to think before and take it seriously so that's Catherine ancient form of a biography I don't think we need to talk about this video but I really recommend that works also recommend one other worked since we kind of an interim mode a very helpful introduction to the next level.
