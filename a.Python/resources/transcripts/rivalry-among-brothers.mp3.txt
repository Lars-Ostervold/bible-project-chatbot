Adam and Eve had two sons and a table they both bring offerings before God and although Kane is the firstborn God turns his face for table any shows able favor so Kane gets angry about this and you can imagine him thinking not what's wrong with my offering and aren't I the firstborn don't I deserve your favor God's response to pain is essentially you're assuming that there's no exaltation for you to just cuz I went to the lowest one first and so now you got a choice whether you will do good or not do good based on this moment and be careful cuz there's an animal at the door moral failure is like an animal but just like I called your parents to rule over the animals and they didn't they let an animal rule them you have a chance to rule this inner animal and what you going to do we know how the story ends pain lets the Croucher with
 and take over he murders his brother in Cold Blood and in spite of this God surprisingly show some mercy just like God didn't enforce the death penalty in the moment on his parents cuz he said in the day you either but you'll die and then the day that you have it there exiled to the realm of death but they don't die so in the same way God comes to the murderer which in the rest of the Torah Capital crime and God not only forgives can but also testifying on him that seven times over he will protect game life from anybody who might want to kill him cane story is Humanity story when we don't think we get what we deserve lots and we take it for ourselves even at the expense of others and so we can stop and we can empathize with Kane I mean it's hard to be a place where God's face doesn't seem to be shining on you it's hard to see others succeed when you fail especially when it seems
 I've done nothing wrong and some of us out there have really bad I mean everyday is hard and God's face seemed so far away but Jesus walked around and said things like blasts are the poor blessed are the meek blessed are those who hunger and thirst for things to be put right if you know my father and what he's up to in the world you know but that is the Most Blessed Fortune a place you could ever find yourself in God's generosity can meet you either they're very counterintuitive
 today to Mackey and I continued on the theme of the firstborn on John Collins in your listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
I guess we're doing first born and we're going to talk about the generations of families in Genesis 4 in following and how it really shook mean by I've had some time since we've had the first few conversations and maybe kind of summarize and reflect the tiny bit right I love it when you some rest and reflect and a good thanks well I think the main thing is when we were finishing our conversation on the serpent and humans and the connection of the firstborn there which if I could summarize is that God created the host of Heaven in the rulers of the rulers above first they were created first day for day four and they rule the skies and then you got these creatures that are land creatures that are even created after the animals and the Beast
 5 is Sky flyers in the water is warmer has a 6 land animals and at least up to the punchline where God says that humans are His Image both male and female and they get to rule the land and the Sea and the creatures that you can go right up to the right all the creatures all the creatures in these other rooms too and so then we get to the serpent who is this creature at the beast but it's not quite just a beast and we looked at a lot of the literature and second temple. What people are examining the motives of the snake and and we also looked at later Reflections on the character of the snake
 and the profits they also see malevolent spiritual reality at work there right pacifically and Isaiah and is he Keel and so true meditation literature form as you think about this story you realize that there was something going on with the firstborn thing which is the ones who came first who actually should have more Authority exer more can a glorious beings have to deal with these like latecomers who they don't deserve to rule as much as they get to rule these land creatures and so there's this envy and there's this rivalry so one of the things that stuck with me and I think I mentioned at the very end and I just want to tag it again if there's something more there which is one of the great mysteries in life is the problem of evil why is there evil and what is it
 what is evil yes yeah yeah if God is good and he created a good world he ordered it he created creatures to rule on his behalf in His image
 the humans in His image the host of Heaven in his the word is an image but it's a sign or symbol of him then where does evil come in and so this is an answer the question but it's an interesting like way into the question I've never gone this route before which is to say this creature who introduces Miss trusting God and introduces evil essentially knocked out in the goodness of God down the goodness of God and introduces Disobedience the possibility of asserting one's own
 identity even though all creation is depended every millisecond on the generous power of God there's a Temptation for rational image bearing creatures that have a sense of self-identity to begin to imagine themselves as staking out some realm of Independence acting independently of the will of God and it's no coincidence that in the garden story it's all about truth and deception you know where is even when you're deceived you're acting and on what you think is true this is interesting meditation that goes all the way back both the classical theorist Traditions Christian Jewish and evening later Islam the evil isn't a thing like goodness is a reality of God's Own nature and being but rather evil is the deprivation or the
 action of ultimate goodness yeah it's interesting so it's an absence ceaselessly famously said it's a truly parasitic reality that had out of it has no true existence unto itself except that is a real live experience of peeling off of God's goodness and doing what's good in your own eyes I think that's the imagery of the storm is what is evil I'm kind of interested in what this theme is telling us about why is evil because the motive here is envy and the reason for the Envy is because God elevated a lowly creature that's right and gave them power yet and so here's my question as we continue on in the same we're going to continue to see God elevating the lowly and given the power yes and if it's something about the nature of God and it seems like if we would have to believe that if God is good then this impulse to do that
 good impulse to give good gifts to those of high and low status to the Elohim above and then he also gives it to these creatures and so Dodge generosity towards it's like the Powerball and Matthew all the sudden realize that many of The Parables of Jesus care about this yeah yeah we're the same no matter when they started working that's right like there's that one it doesn't feel right I just read that story to my kids and I meet you there like that's not right. Fair the guy who showed up in the last hour at work he gets the same amount of God that strikes in us than like wait a second that's not fair is there something there around the Y of evil that like
 we can't handle God's generosity and this kind of just frustrates us and it makes it flusters us and makes us envious and it just then our reaction to generosity creates yeah yeah I mean that's what happened with that's why he's there all the repetition and developments of the rivalries that are rooted in Envy over the one God has elevated it's not the one that socially off to be elevated if you read those patterns and reflect on the garden narrative in light of that that's exactly all these details top there and I think that's how the Hebrew Bible Works which is why all these second temple Jewish writers saw the snake as a displaced firstborn so to speak who's your ticked about it
 so that's a great meditation so I'm going to understand what that heartbeat is for you this inside is that the saying that disrupt the Peace of the firstborn figure is that God is overly generous to those who you think shouldn't deserve a better to someone who has status and his glorious and some sentence which is good. Crazy that way that's good yes but he also created creatures and people who don't have that I was just driving my boys back from soccer practice do a part of town that's so that you know a little more run down and there was a guy just hunched over big is when you know that you know that kind of where it's just like your body just gave out and you completely like gravity's it's slamming you down and he's willing this thing and you just the shovel than I think of myself that could be my body but that's his Linda
 that's his body likely will be your potty and God wants to induction Raza T he wants to find a way to like Elevate everyone and there's a sense of like this immediate thought of like while I'm better than that guy and is there something to meditate on which is like that impulse and them not being able to deal with how generous got is to all people no matter their status yeah. Just we just can't handle it and because we can't handle it then the turf wars begin the deceptions begin the violence begins this isn't the complete answer to evil bassist interesting like way into it then I just never contemplated it's definitely one of the biblical stories main like
 diagnosis of what's wrong with us is we'll see as we dive into the Cain and Abel story in this conversation that's exactly what's at the center of it and you're right I remember I don't have very many memories of preschool and kindergarten but I never one of them is really Vivid where there was a kid in my class and we came we are fond of each other and became friends and then I remember there was another kid in the class and he had a Star Wars action figure from The Empire Strikes Back the snow monster called the Wampa and he brought it to school and I had one too and so then it was this kind of special connection with this kid to and I remember coming home that day talking with my mom in memory saying like I don't know what to do because I like someone so and we've been playing at recess but now someone so brought is Wampa and I want to
 play with him and I there's not enough friendship for 2 cuz like I'm telling my mom my mom is remind me of this through the year you don't have time to be friends of both sometimes my mind it was like a it was what do you say a limited limited resource you have the ability to care about someone to care about somebody and what I don't remember was conversation with my mom or what happened I just remember that crisis what felt like a crisis and what my mom is recounted to me was it was that first moment or you're trying to bring your kids into the reality of that a generous spirit that hosts and cares for people in your life it is a finite resource but you've got to weigh more than you could possibly imagine you can be friends with more than one person and that's maybe a silly memory fast but it is this truth
 that it's possible when it comes to love and generosity there's this inexhaustible Leti to it when it's done in the spirit of love where you just like there's more there's more and that's for finite creatures because we run out of actual time on a calendar is the calories in a body ya till a motion hold on to it and all of that so imagine what it means to talk about it Infinite Source of generous love is the host of all reality but what that will mean is that I might perceive how God play the generous host to another creature as creative and the question
 this is the question of the Cain and Abel story what perfectly up but it is also the question put to the sky rulers in the land rulers is the Blackwell is it true that if God you know raises up the love that he does not also put on high the high and he's generous to them too I think that's kind of the question is can it be both and can there be two you know exalted ones at the same time and I guess human psychology finds a really difficult to think that everybody can win me about that memory the other day so that's why it's in my mind I think that's kind of question is that the great reflection let's take that inside and I think it will really eliminate the Dynamics of this what we're going to call it the second cycle of the inversion of the firstborn pattern even though it's the Cain and Abel story is the first time it actually is about siblings and a first one sibling
 but that's I think that's exactly what the narrator wants us to focus on that question what happens when God is too generous and it starts to make some first born it sounds angry
 closest dive in to the story of Cain and Abel Genesis chapter 4 verse 1 the human means it interesting that a dumb dumb dumb knew his wife, or he's the human knew his wife life and she conceived and she gave birth to Kyan Kyan Kyan Kyan left I'm so deep of rabbit hole so cool believe we really don't have time to his name is spelled with the letters that are similar to the word like metalsmithing metalsmith most interesting but also he does represent the city boy right yeah it's going to build the first city and then he's going to have to sentence who are the first metalsmith
 I forget if it's the Avo you've all are too long can what you want and then what life says when she gives birth to Cayenne is she doesn't reply on his name was she says I have created a man with Yahweh and what that means and what she means by create so rad and the word create there is spelled with the letters of Kinds name which is another aspect of the word play but whether her words are neutral or if there's something funky or even arrogant going on there that's the rabbit hole that's super interesting but the point for our conversation is kind of the first born
 and then she gave birth to his brother have a good if you want to chase down the rabbit hole you go down it in your class Adam to Noah class classroom to classroom you teach this story in the course I don't know why and you go down there at home and leave me when you said I have created a man a man with y'all if y'all way because you look compare different English translations and you'll find a wide variety of renderings which is always just a good radar signal like this point is Just Two Brothers Guns first ones the second and means metalsmith Heather
 Abel is translate a table into English but it's the same Hebrew word used for Vapor wind in Ecclesiastes because yeah he's here is one literally one sentence I think he's going to be dead in about three sentences so that means several means like a vapor it's here one second I'm next so however was a shepherd of animals so you got one part of his dad's job from eating which is like to care of animals start using the traditional station worker of the ground so that's the other part of the pepper. Barbara Adam and Eve were doing both in the garden now they're split between the two can we said Kansas City boy but in the ancient world the cities were built around farmland
 correct so to be a farmer is The Beautiful People yeah that's right to separate his to be the shepherds are out in the way Hills are there more girls farmers are at the city is not built cuz they're all just living right outside the Gate of Eden as we'll see about at the end of some amount of days however many of the narrator doesn't say that Cain brought from the fruit of the ground in offering to Yahweh you know his parents so you know wrong Yahweh disobey the word of God they were exiled from the garden though it will learn not from eating the land of Eden they're still there in this story but then apparently sitting outside or near the Gate of Eden and you know you bring your offering to pay homage give honor to the Creator so they're doing this thing and you're like rat Noble Act of surrender surrender with valuable honor the Creator who gave it and we're supposed to also be reflecting on if
 are outside of the gates of Eden there's this I'm in Israelite I've got a ritual where I go outside the gates of the Holy place that's right and I bring sacrifices the altar in the courtyard of the Tabernacle at the temple is right by the door going into the holy of holies holy place in the hallways of the Sacred Space which is decorated like a garden like a guard to be kept so he brings his offering and it's the food offering which is a legitimate offering in ancient culture and in the Leviticus chapter two is all about it it's like awesome so that's Kane firstborn offers is offering them for sport no able he also brought from the firstborn of this flock and from their sassy portions so he comes next he also
 but it's clear the cans firstborn offers first and story a legitimate and good offering a bull comes and of course the farmer Fable brings in offering from you know his area of responsibility which of the animals but what he brings is from the firstborn Dustin the flock first born of his flock new yep so the first oldest first to reach maturity of the flock and to bring the first one of your flock is the most valuable offering you can bring and then there's this little detail and from the fat portions which is it's like Abel's read Leviticus cuz he's bringing the prime most honorable precious forms of offering which is our first born and including the fat portions which so uniquely you always in the later history so it was
 funny thing is we're not giving any insight into the motives of the characters they both bring good offerings but just on objective level has been legitimate offerings we setting up the scent of like but one was like more Primo absolutely and you get that from reading the rest of the Hebrew Bible especially the Torah that the first born in the fat or like the the most precious offerings it's not the Kansas bad it's the tables is more valuable and those are the only details given in the text that could point in the direction of why Yahweh does what he does next cuz next line is and Yahweh
 gazed or looked for his attention what is the tension on a table and his offering but upon Cain and his offering me to that guy's so we talked about how this is about got the generosity and it's enough for everyone here feels like God actually limits his attention to one and not the other so why why would I do that answers that question unfortunately it depends on how it gets translated whether or not you'd see the answer very clearly you're not so next Cannes response there was hot anger to Kane heated up with anger I've been there exactly right and his face fell which is a unique
 figure of speech in the Hebrew Bible you can kind of feel that if your face is slow going to sadness sadness frown but that's an interesting turn of phrase space fell and then you always said the cane why is there hot anger in you why has your face Fallen question is you do good won't there be exaltation and if you don't do good at the door send is a Croucher in his desire is for you but you can rule it
 and that he never says anything just the story moves on to the murder after this and then it's kind of riddle liar verse 7 I got a response to the riddle if you do good won't there be exultation stop there because that's what we're talking about yeah he did something good good offer it's right he was accosted by God didn't even pay leave my first I see it's about there's a puzzle hear of like wood God eventually days upon came to the question I had of so if God exalts my little brother is there any exaltation for me too but that's the test is why is God
 it's actually the it's if I give my attention to my new friend my new Star Wars buddy is there going to be enough to have an exclusive limit and What God Says is lesson I gave my attention to the offering of your younger brother he offered the first for an F-4 sure that the little kind of narrative hints as to the Dynamics year the first born and the fatso my attention with him first but if you do good isn't there exaltation for you to so first of all Kane is forced with a choice a test now of whether he will do good or not good and this is a part of how The Narrative of the vocabulary is setting up this test of Kane's decision as a parallel
 where the analogy to his Parent's Choice before the tree of doing good and not good or knowing good and not good
 I think this is all coming back to your first reflection I think what this little line of gods question is actually put his in his finger on exactly what you were sensing in the Eden story is that right I think so so if you do good I was taking that as hey I know you did good and I know it doesn't feel like you've been exalted but you will be. There's enough generosity to go around I just didn't go to you first and I know that feels unfair cuz you're the first born but that's not how I work at work off of that kind of schema yeah but my schema can be trusted and there's enough generosity for everyone in a way
 that doubt of God's generosity extending further than I might imagine is the same doubt that the snake was trying to introduce for it to Adam and Eve be trusted did God really say and no actually you won't die it's that God has more to give but that he doesn't want to give you like that's what the snakes after and then which is also kind of truly God has more to give that he isn't giving up yet exactly that's true but the question is does that mean he's never been our long-term
 puzzle about the eating their civis humans need the ability to discern good and bad they need them to have responsibilities and rule the world so they have to get it somehow and the question implied in the narrative is how do you take it or do you wait to receive it from God's can you trust God's method and timing of his generosity and timing of his generosity because we have our own our own idea of how it should work the method should be on the first born I get a first yeah and I get it when I need it right that's kind of like from the get-go is kind of like nope I work on a different schedule a different method and get used to it and trust that there's enough in the round will be exalted if you do good you got a choice before you right now about how you're going to respond to the fact that I divvied out my favor first to the lower one your younger brother
 your brother is naughty little younger brother and so I think God's response to Cain is essentially you're assuming that there's no exaltation for you to just cuz I went to the lowest one first and so now you got a choice whether you will do good or not do good based on this moment and be careful cuz there's an animal at the door and it is a Croucher animal but it's in what's the word for moral failure moral failure is like an a deist wants you but just called your parents to rule over the animals and they didn't they let an animal rule them you have a chance to rule this inner animal that's scratching and what you going to do
 Vanessa krauser that such a great translation well since you think it's in the grammar thanks then is a feminine noun grammatically in Hebrew about the word Croucher is a messy participle it's not a verb sin is crouching at the in our most of our translation is a thing crouching is a Croucher suggesting is the design pattern parallelism between Canyon and his parents and the decision they faced and here it's sin in this anger of envy that becomes the snake whispering in his ear
so do you feel like we've put her finger on it I love it it's right there right there so Cain kill his brother spoke to his brother Abel and it came out when they were in the field the Cain rose up to Abel his brother and he killed him and have always have them and have all this here one second and gone the next until God comes just like he came to his parents and he asked the same question where are you
 where are you at in the garden after Adam and Eve ate the fruit Ya Head Up and God knows where are you and here he comes the cane thing where is Abel your brother and just like I believe Blanchester died on this is what the woman she'd know the snake and so can he like tries to Dodges he's like I don't know why my brother underground song but I think for a point we can kind of clothes are meditation on this will try and bring it to a fine point so we talked about how he goes and becomes the what will hear something interesting is were talking about generosity, guy becomes extremely generously ain't exactly right just like God didn't enforce the death penalty in the moment on his parents Adam and Eve in the day you either but you'll die and then the day that you have at their exiled to the realm of death but they don't die animals like eight centuries in the same way God comes to the murderer
 which in the rest of the Torah Capital crime and not only forgives can but also sets a sign on him rabbit hole at the fine on him that seven times over he will protect cans life from anybody who might want to kill him it's okay in this exiled East of Eden the X-Files Kane but he liked from text him or text him forgive them and pretend the Exile yeah the one who has received you always gifts and has made a foolish decision about good and bad with the responsibilities got gave me the most foolish decision you can make is killing another image of God doesn't treat him according to the sentence to use the language Psalm 103 continuing to be super generous if you do good won't you be exalted and if you do bad I'm still can be generous the word for exaltation
 is the word to pick up and carry you to take up it's also the same word used to forgive it's the word and I saw her NASA is how you pick up and so I can wish is a great way to remember anyways cuz it's such a basic to pick up pick up and put up but when you say to pick up or carry someone sends that the standard Hebrew praise to forgive them interested so is kind of this double potential meaning of if you do good won't there be exaltation and he doesn't do good and God still decides if you do good will there be enough time lifting up and he doesn't do good but God still has a forgiving is any was kind of a cool word play oh yeah that's right so we continue to be generous as you would expect it and what came does with that generosity as he goes out into exile
 all the sudden he has a wife cuz he knows his wife just like his dad and he even brought about him and his brother so now Cain knew his wife whoever she might be and she conceived and gave birth to hug for me. And then Cain went and built a city and he called the name of the city you knock after the name of his firstborn son
 so it goes any builds the city named after his stint was first born so the narrator's and say this is good bad or indifferent he doesn't Supply motives but as we're going to see if this has a foreboding okay because we just go instantly into a genealogy that goes down seven generations from Adam and ends us with the guy named limit and limit goes against God's image of God design of a man and a woman the two become one and in that way partner as an image of God and limit gets greedy and he takes two wives and Zilla and then they have all these kids and then Lemak sings this poem where he sings about this man that he murdered
 wounding him and he says you know my ancestor can God forgave his exalted him even though he murdered him so I'm going to claim God's mercy for myself is Kane was protected by God seven times over than me Lemak 77 times so here now with somebody whose rewrite and God's mercy inside myself do you say self Advantage selections of Revenge and power so we've been saying part of the problem of evil is that we can handle God's generosity when it's given to people who don't think deserve it and then here it flowers coming to a new thing which is
 we didn't take that generosity and we twist it so that gives us license to the selfish things we want to do what's good in her eyes have not been able to handle this is a big great undercurrent for this conversation with Genesis for was all about so what happens that genealogy that we just went the way from Adam to Kane to the sky limit goes to seven generations and it ends with the sky limit who has three sons when you turn to what we call chapter 5 you find another genealogy that stems from the Sun that Adam and Eve had after Abel's murdered after Abel's the next thing as we were told that Adam and Eve have a son in the place of Abel
 and they call him Seth which means placed or set and what he says is God has placed their set for me a new sun and then the genealogy starts going through the 5th chapter Forest racing canes genealogy that like culminates in this Ecology of the disgruntled and vs murderous firstborn and that leads to let the king who is now just like not a murderous yet yeah look at Miss city of bloody murderous distorted image of God's generosity chapter 5 comes back and it reboots and it reminds us Adam and Eve were made in the image of God and then the lineage starts going through Seth and fasten goes through ten Generations who's the third born that is now the Third born yeah and that's the family that God is going to provide the seed of the woman through which we haven't the seasoned woman is going to crush the snake that's all
 nothing we haven't talked about the school yeah and I guess it's important because it's like why we're going to start talking about choosing over and over who to give the blessing to and so like there's a logic there yep that's why I got to choosing a family that carry a blessing the logic is he's going to raise up from among the humans is when I haven't even exiled a future descendant of from the woman who will strike the snake while also being struck by it and you're also told that the snake is going to have Offspring along with the woman and you like well how's that going to happen how is this what why do I care about baby snakes baby snakes until you read the story of Cain and Abel and you I thought that's how a human becomes a snake when the Beast inside takes over when the Finn is a Croucher at the door and you allow it to rule you instead of you reeling at this was our son of man video where the
 then in the snake become joined as these powers that can turn a human into a snake like in Spokane and then his lineage down to limit become this like humans Nikki line and then Genesis 5:6 us back and restarts literally goes back to the first words of Genesis 1 and 2 about God making male and female In His Image and then it's it gives a birth line from Adam as it came doesn't exist we just we read them off and wherever that future seeds make crushing sees woman come from going to come from now the Third born the real the real late Comer and that's what Jen has five is about the genealogy and it takes ten Generations leading all the way up to the 10th son Noah and Noah also has three sons
 so you get these parallel genealogies of through can you get seven generations that lead to limit and his three sons that's a city of blood and then you get the line of Seth which is 10 generations and the 10th son Noah has three sons and what's confusing is there some similar names in both genealogy identical and others he knock the firstborn yes like the seventh born there you have it who's the famous Enoch who goes to like just gets beamed up to got you get Adam to Cain Enoch Iran to Mahalia L to the message to Chantal lamech and his three sons
 next chapter you go from Adam to Seth to Ennis which is another Hebrew word for human then you get Kane on which is spelled with the same letters as Cannes now then you get mahalalel Keenan yeah it looks like Keenan that's right lol which is is the 5th generation from that sounds so much like it sounds hooyah hooyah L which is the fifth generation from Adam to Kane then you get yared who spelled almost identically to the fourth generation of candy. Then you get Enoch the famous Enoch who gets taken and he was not for God took him and that's the same name as Cain's first born son then you get the oldest human in the biblical story and the letters of his name is or just swapped around with methushael
 the 6th generation from Kane and then you got to let Max another level another level and then you get not interesting is some people have thought oh actually there maybe we just to oral traditions of the same genealogy right there being preserved here the narrative is going to Great pains to separate these two lineages and I think the rhyming of all the names is painting them as these inverted mirrors of them in other words it's hard to tell the lineage of the snake in the lineage of the woman the part they're going on Parallel tracks and see how it feels when you read it it ain't so hard to keep track of the name similarities are illiterate strategy to show that the seed of the snake and see the woman are hard to tell apart and even though you think in the narrative it's clear separation of lines the rest of Genesis is going to go on to show
 anybody can become a snake that's interesting and you can become a snake and become a human image that's what the story of Jacob's all about he's born a snake but I'm not going to him anyway so what's interesting is that what's implied is you know what's up with all these Generations in the story the firstborn we don't really know but what is interesting is God is choosing the Third born Seth from Adam and Eve and making that the future line of the seed of the woman cuz that's the main genealogies going to get traced throughout the rest of Genesis which leads us to the three sons of Noah and let's just say it's been a long time here but I think we can just kind of similarities to what we just looked at
so I I just one question you could start with the you know when God comes to Noah and Noah is the 10th Generation from Adam from Adam Adam Visa processing the third one correct Third born and what God does is he comes to Noah and says the end of All Flesh has come up before me this is a response to the spreading of violence through Kane Lemak the Nephilim would we ever talked about was born of a Cosmic Destruction that stories happened after the geology of sex right after the three stories of violent blood Spillers from Kane to Lemak to the Nephilim and God's response is he looks at the land and its ruined because of violence and innocent blood being shed everywhere and so when God says the end of all flashes come up before me
 word-plays and similar language to when God said the blood of Abel your brother is crying out and it has reached me so now it's like we have many generations of violent human spilling into the blood and What God Says is I m going to accelerate or bring about their room and with the land
 the land is going to rebell against this human violence and that's going to take the form of the flood so it is this is interesting question of Noah becomes as it were the chosen son from these two lineages to be the vehicle for preserving life for his family and for the animals like a new Adam and Eve so there's no other rival sibling for him to be compared to write okay but you do have two lineages on the stage right now in the story and God chooses the line through the Third born stuff and then makes Noah the new human that is going to preserve and make the seat of a new Humanity so we can for that more but it's just interesting kind of wet stores carry for it but what I want to focus on is where another sibling rivalry and firstborn rivalry comes into play and that is a Noah's Three Sons story about Noah's Three Sons so Noah
 comes out of the art listen 9:18 Genesis sons of Noah who came out of the Ark were Shem ham and japheth were Shem Shaman yaphet details that aren't given here yet it's true he revival-style where it's going to be another riddle story and then little details to get seated to you later that will help you understand what happened here cuz you don't know their birth order you're just given their names have assumed their birth order I suppose right yes and then what you're going to find out later is listing them sham and the outfit is not the birth order Helga will you will find out to chase us is the oldest hams the youngest and Sam is the middle middle child Three Sons were Shem ham and ham was the father of a guy named Canaan
 that's going to be important super important super important but here is just a little like aside from the sons of Noah all the land was scattered Noah began know I had a beginning in the beginning Noah became a worker of the ground like like able yeah and I got them in the beginning this guy became a worker at the ground so Adam was the first workers the ground and then ate it true to his job. Split between the two sons and Noah picks up Kings job farmer becomes at work or at home but it's just interesting Kane Noah in the beginning of Noah After the flood he became of Warcraft ground and he plants a garden Vineyard 100
 that's what God did so no no it's doing what got to do
 and he drank the fruit of the vine right he consumed the fruit of the garden and he lost his mind he just got hammered and he uncovered himself in the middle of his tent and ham father of kannon remember whenever he saw the nakedness of his father and he reported it to Two Brothers outside and Shem and they took a garment cloak and laid it on their shoulders the two of them and they walked backward covering the date of death of their father and pay attention their faces were always facing backwards so that the nakedness of their father they did not see
 the know I woke up from his wine and he knew what his youngest son I thought them to him and what we're told is that ham saw that they can assess his father and then what happens is no others three little poems of a blessing and curse on his sons it's a curse on Canaan Nottingham on Canaan like a descendant of him and you told that he's going to become a Perpetual servant to his brothers are slave he's going to be lower than his brothers thing is he's the youngest is the younger but at least I'm going to try and point out I think this is a story about the younger trying to usurp in take the place of the
 the oldest so Canaan hamster Center will be on the curse and he said blessed be our way the Elohim of Shemp
 and let Canaan come under him as a servant
 and may I love him in large yaphet it's an yavitz name means a large it's a guy named him dwell in the tents of Shem and let Canaan become his servant as well cryptic riddle like story so okay thanks Emily though japheth the oldest is now no longer the one in charge in the brothers among the brothers he is going to dwell in the tents of Shem Shem is now the leader yep he's the one who gets the blessing
 and actually he said blessed be your way so y'all way who's the source of all blessing is going to be associated with Shem the middle child and yaphet the older Davis the older one you're not excluded you'll get in on the blessing but you do it by associating yourself with your younger brother I noticed we have three sons now renovating the ways things get inverted here shows the middle son that's elevated and gets the blessing and then we got those younger son yeah here now where do you get that okay so tell remove is buried in this phrase to look upon the nakedness of your father so this is in another classroom class that we have called from know what Abraham and then we have a whole session on this but that phrase is used uniquely elsewhere in the Torah we talked about it and our journey to the Torah
 it's the phrase to have sexual intercourse with to look at the nakedness to look upon the nakedness or expose the nakedness is a Hebrew shorthand in the Bible for to have sexual intercourse with also the nakedness of your father is a phrase describing its a way that a man's wife is referred to in Leviticus 18 and the Leviticus chapter 20 exposure the nakedness of your father she is your mother your father's wife the mechanics of your father is a way to refer to taking advantage of your father's wife correct cuz if you goes into the tent of Noah
 it's the 10th of Noah and his wife now why there's an ambiguity and why it's so riddle like I think is intentional and look up the class and Cody down the rabbit hole but notice that it is The Offspring of ham that suffers the consequences for hims decision so why are we talking about the descendants of ham cuz if he took advantage of his father so cursed be Canaan there wouldn't that wouldn't produce a child but what happens is that a child coming from Ham is put in a position of curse stories about ham using the opportunity for his father being blackout drunk I actually to try and assume the position of alpha male in the family by Sleeping with his father's wife and what's interesting is this pattern will be repeat
 in the story of lot and his daughters is all hyperlink to the scene interesting and attractive that story sort of sleeping with their dad by getting him drunk and all the languages that story is adapted from this one and the story later on in Genesis 35 of Ruben who is Jacob's first born when Jacob's favorite wife Rachel. Jacob goes and he rapes this is the collection of the most disturbing stories for me it is Genesis and it's about Jacob's first born son trying to usurp the position of alpha male in the family by Sleeping with his dad servant wives
 so what here is it's important is that it's the younger
 could also that's not the youngest getting elevated the middle child because this is important super important in the steam of the firstborn is going to be kind of two streams of the state when one is where God will Elevate the younger or the latecomer doesn't seem fair but now there's a new stream beginning which is the younger trying to find a way to be sneaky and crafty and assert the blessing or the right of the firstborn get it for themselves or for themselves and this case through sexual abuse yeah we're going to see that theme continued as well yes so first let's just know what a disturbing story that says it's all so brutally honest about real human motives and behavior right and in this case it's God hasn't exalted Shem yet in the story this is Hamm's move he makes his first move to become alpha male
 and he abuses his father and I think his mom in the process he's willing and so underneath that was a design patterns were back to that reflection that this is the mindset motivate somebody to do something somebody must be so insecure so afraid so wounded that becomes irrational to them to think for me to get ahead in life it will be worth it to do this to another human or to my mom and dad I mean that's the psychology being explored here and what it brings about is Kirsten Destruction for his family
 and what God does his counter hams whatever it is motivating him by elevating his older brother but not the firstborn so it's this developing a complicating all the things but as we do it we're still exploring this portrait of human nature and the problem of evil yeah is in one sense that we can't handle God's generosity towards people who are we don't think deserve it
 but the problem of evil is also that when we don't think we have the status we deserve or should want yeah that's right that we can't handle waiting on God's generosity and so we take yeah we take control on their own terms it would lead to Violent to take and do what is good in her eyes and the steam is about status yes that's right and how do we handle status and power maybe the old adage about you know the bully on the playground is more than likely the most
 fearful and insecure kid out there and that's very common I think human mental habits overcompensate for our inner fears by exerting ourselves in ways that hurt ourselves and other people and that's what's underneath the story now you don't see that on the surface at a first reading it's when you read all the later Stories the hyperlink back to this one the to fill out character mode is more and then you come back to it and you can begin to see that's why we were told that he was the father of Kane and then swear this is odd language is used in
 also noticed that it's about seeing the nakedness which is what Adam and Eve saw when they did what was good in the router they were naked yet yeah creatively using that language of the store in but now it's connect those two becomes even more sad and tragic because it's a figure of speech for sexual abuse it's no accident that in the next chapter is a genealogy about the three sons Shem ham in Lafayette and you get the genealogy from ham and lo and behold who is this defendant a guy named Nimrod who goes and builds the Second City
 in the story The Bible so do I am the one to before was Cain the first born this time of ham Third born the youngest yes yeah and you follow a genealogy and would someone build a city that becomes a big mess and just as in the flood God confronted the city of Bloodshed that was spilling blood everywhere so in the scattering of Babylon Genesis 11 got confronts the Second City of man that is trying to reconnect heaven on Earth on idolatrous terms that's all I do. Only is the like the evil that comes out of a city because of the firstborn not trusting in God's generosity it's also because of the youngest yeah I can't handle yeah their status and tries to do their own manure yeah that's right and so the lineage of ham unleashes snake-like evil back into the world
 is Nimrod that is the Builder of Babylon and Assyria which is like the two big bad Empires alongside Egypt and Egypt is also a descendant of him yeah yeah hammock is and all the Big Daddy's the ancestor of the three big bad empires in the biblical story that we haven't everywhere so this is the biblical authors way of doing both sober meditation on human nature but then also through these lineage is trying to say that when humans don't trust God's generosity and I think he he appreciates you brought this up God's timing and method of sharing and including people generously and when humans get impatient or we feel that I've been left out of the party that there is no exaltation for me to that's when you get humans beginning to ruin ourselves and the people around us and that is the med station here
 it's like a sad
 the sad diagnosis of human impatience and inability to think the God can truly be generous with everyone and it is hard to imagine how God can be generous with everyone know you can really relate to this and it's interesting how relatable it is and to then take that thought and the go wait is that is that what opens up to this thing that I hate ya in such as violence and in the world right you didn't see the big daddy taking advantage of someone or you see ya a bully beating up on a kid or you see someone being stressed and sneaky and taking something that's not there when you see from the fire just like man that yeah but then to realize how hard it is for me
 or for any human to be in a position this doesn't feel fair and to have the perspective in the truss just be like and it's okay right now
 like God will make all things right God will take care of me but that's just like one of the hard at that's so hard so hard you know where my thoughts land is on the 9 now expensive blessing that Jesus makes in the sermon on the mountain but all the realities that he names are naming people in circumstances that look like the opposite of the good life yeah the poor in spirit by the unimportant the people who hunger and thirst for justice in the world but if you hunger and thirst mean by definition you're not in a position to get it created and it's painful for you striving to make peace of being in a position where you're in between other people that conflict really unenviable position and Jesus says
 if you know my father and what he's up to in the world do you know that that is the most blessed Fortune a place you could ever find yourself and got the generosity can meet you even there there counterintuitive I wish Bible had something to say to all people in all places about human nature and the purpose of God in the world that's remarkable. We just looked at two of the most riddle like strange stories in the Old Testament yeah and here's where we landed cuz I think that's what the stories are about to start work where we next yes I think where we going next is I just want to connect going forward and the story will be finished by looking at the next four generations in Genesis which ones God chooses another ten Generations after Noah which leads you to a guy named Abraham and then there's four generations of God inverting
 the first four generations they ran for Generations from Abraham Isaac to Jacob Jacob's 12 sons and in every generation there is a not identical but some kind of creative subversion where God keeps exalting the latecomer or the lowly over the person you think deserves that in the firstborn and each time it deepens the set the meditations on human nature that we've been looking at that's what we're going to look at next thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast the next week we continue this theme on the first born and we explored the story of Abraham where was a chance were a broom could pull rank on his nephew and choose the plot of land that he doesn't know where and what exactly are you just knows that got them into give this land and he's super open-handed and he lets his nephew go first it's the theme of a first born or sibling rivalry even though
 it's about a uncle and nephew but this is really but beautiful portrait of what happens when you really truly believe there's enough for me and for my siblings today's episode was produced by Cooper pelts with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Daniel Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza and a woo provided the annotations for our annotated podcast interact with our project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we get to make a lot of cool stuff is podcast videos Seminary level classes are app it's all free because it's already been paid for by thousands of people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us hi this is Alyssa and I'm from Palm Beach Florida
