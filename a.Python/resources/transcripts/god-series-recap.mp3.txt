So the plan is to try to tie a bow on a 21 episode conversation that we'd started a year-and-a-half ago from sitting in this room that you have a moment that's right after we start a conversation on God of God in order to make a video we talked for a long time and released almost everything usually we have a shorter conversation and then I try to cut a recap whole thing and then it kind of gives a sense of closure I think we just got done with the conversation that we were done and so we went through so much would be nice to just come back and think okay we're where we how did we get here yes is everything feel alright yeah how do you pick up well great what we called the god Series in the podcast we did really start video in Fall 2018
 the distilled a lot of what we talked about one significant thing that happened was there are a lot of things that we talked about in the gods series gas conversation that we had to cut out of the Gods video right cuz they're just too much too much and so we picked up a lot of that Cutting Room floor material and made it into a new series with a whole bunch more that's going to start releasing in 2019 yes we're calling the spiritual being serious all right which I don't know if we talked about that much did I really so I guess it's this is you know what happened was so we have that conversation on Elohim by the other Elam the sons of God or the Divine Council which the angel of the Lord yeah yeah Angels it's something that I never spent a lot time
 talking about it thinking about that opened up the floodgates yeah we are getting questions so to do in kunar is just on Spiritual Beings and I started that you were reading books that you are learning all this stuff was learning so much and so we thought at first we thought we know we need we need a video that explains the word Elohim so let's make a word a word study buddy video game and then we're like well we've been doing words study videos kind of in themes in these kind of like groups so let's do El halim the Satan was that one that was going to be the angel of the Lord would be a word study for parts maybe Sheridan was going to get in there maybe and then so we have these words studies and then as we started talking about them it kind of became clear they were bigger than words study videos
 and then it became the spirit of being serious change of the Lord because Angel of the Lord is something we talked about in this series we didn't get to put in the video cut out of it so in 2019 this is all going to come to fruition in a 7-part series that's going to release between January and June of 2019 called spiritual being serious and essentially it's what we covered early in the god serious conversation is my read my Discovery or rediscovery of the parallel storyline of the Heavenly and Earthly backdrop to Heavenly Heavenly beings the Divine staff team overlaps with and interacts with the Earthly narrative to your starting right from page 1 of Genesis and it'll be a theme video about the Heavenly been spiritual Realms their interactions about the storyline
 Bible and the profiling the main characters of each starting with humans who are supposed to be will move on to talk about the Divine Council file video on the Divine Council then on the angel of the Lord as a human figure who appears as a human and is distinct from Yahweh but also is Yahweh mean after that angels and seraphim but those both those in the same video games and the last one will be called the new Humanity which will be about Jesus as Humanity 2.0 and resurrection and the life of the spirit as the birth of the new creation Humanity that's meant to rule over Heaven and Earth
 an understanding of what's going on in the biblical story get a Divine council stuff was really helpful think that that thing that's frustrating to me is that and we might have talked about this when it comes to Divine council member ticular it's not like the Bible ever just stops you and says okay let me fill in some gaps for you reader you aren't you don't know about these guys but this is how it works and it has parallel story it just takes it for granted that you're already clued in it seems like and that you are going to pick up these pretty subtle Illusions to that storyline and that makes sense for a first-generation audience of the authors know they can take that for granted yes but that makes it so difficult for me that was abused later cuz I'm completely different.
 the Bible is Jewish meditation literature yeah especially Genesis 1 through 11 is intentionally designed as an elusive elusive like alluding to everything else in the car but also uses in that it's mysterious and opaque precisely to introduce the whole storyline in the Bible intentionally that way yeah it's not a textbook it's not like I'm going to try to give you all the information you need in a way you can't miss it right yeah and some of our thinking that it's not clear what the Bible says about Spiritual Beings in those first Pages some of it is just that we don't understand all these authors are communicating to us what they are making clear and they are also doing it often in subtle ways and so if we miss it because it's intentionally not on the surface so to speak
 nuggets or just be wrapping up the gods. But this part of it maybe one place to start as we wrap up what is I've got a question for you and maybe and maybe speaker please start we started talking in this series about the word Elohim and how it's a hardware to translate yet and we started using the word Spiritual Beings and we did talk briefly about God's warning to humans or no I'm sorry Satan's deception to the humans make I guess we'll find out later has a bigger role in store and then what does the snake say he says since God knows that in the day that you eat of it and no good and evil you will become like Elohim. Elohim is a plural or singular is it like you'll become like it's the Elohim Elohim is by definition
 for him a plural noun is never singular is like the S you referring to just Yahweh as he called him Elohim how would you say it will remember the plural form can have a singular reference when it's applied to the Elohim the particular
 do that English we use a plural for singular sure we do somewhere so but your point is what the snake says is Elohim nose and a verb is singular so the singular Elohim knows where we house at once and the verb or singular and Hebrew verb have her marked for plural and singular you masculine feminine singular Elohim God knows that in the day that y'all eat from it that is the tree your eyes will be open
 and you will be like Elohim knowing good and evil and that knowing is plural you'll be like the Elohim who all know who's referring to the class of Elohim correct so I've always thought of that verse meaning maybe like me God singular. Singular correct you want to be like me and then we can talk about this like we want to be God and said let God be God yet now there seems to be a little wrinkled in that for me lol little bit more nuanced and it's not just like I want to Dethrone God but maybe there's still some of that in there but there's a sense of I just want to be in a class correct that I'm not in this again Genesis 6 where the sons of God yeah rebelled against their limits and categories by having sex with women the singing version of this song
 to be limited to their realm of authority they want more Authority and knowledge you to be like in Genesis 6 it's it's Elohim wanting what's the weather over the human realm so they see and take what they want from Human women and then in Babylon it's humans ascending into the heavens by building their city and Tower the all these narratives are linked in terms of theme of beings in the heavens and the Earth not wanting to be limited by there by the by the balance by the realm of authority that got to place a realm authorities placed the Heavenly beings to rule in the heavens in the land and he actually wants to elevate the humans to rule a unified have another if that's what I want to talk about okay that desire yes that's something they're moving towards in the Garden of Eden they weren't like given that
 straight up in Genesis 1 and the Earthly rulers right Earthly rulers humans your the image be fruitful and multiply go fill the land for the land and spread the the goodness of the garden and don't try to be like that's right the Elohim or at least I guess it's not that explicitly this is your room this is your purpose this around yes and obviously there's a desire to be more because that's what the snake kind of Clues into correct and then that's what happens when they did that the snake is clearly a being who wants to have influence over something more than his room he's a this has to do with the Dual imagery of the snake the snake said it when it's introduced to be a beast of the field and you know from page one humans were released the rule of the Beast so you have this the snake and it gives you a name
 is a creature who doesn't want to be ruled but wants to have implements and Rule and sway over the people who are supposed to rule over him and then you can see a suspicion towards gods and generosity hear some animosity towards his creator and then this is what is equalized they have to pick up on this they developed this wasn't really a beast in a mind this is a cherry a Caribbean or Caribbean two of them got posted at the Garden in the garden is on one level you supposed to be reading him as a b skip another level you're supposed to be reading a mess and one of the forms they could appear as it says them Wednesday swing Snake-Eyes one's neck that's how the Egyptians Invision Envision theater creatures so so I guess the hang of them having yes is that in the beginning of The Narrative of Genesis it feels like there's this hey just be human
 don't try to be more than human and then you get to later and pause the ology and because vision of like actually know we're called to rule over the angels are supposed to rule in Heavenly Realms in some way and and for Paul I mean you can put books vs I don't have my fan but like it seems like he's like even like now if that's our reality correct and so is there a switch was there like this sense of it. Begin in one way and now we get to be more or was it always like this is what I just connect those dots and I am certain I need to develop my thinking on this and pain to this little bar so this is just the current state of it's very much reflects on the ideal the God envisions for his human images is to rule over a unified haven't Unearthed Eden
 Heavener City so that way they are like the Elohim yes hold on the poet of Psalm 82 reflect back on Genesis 1 Word explicitly the list of animals and this one as God purposing to exalt Humanity not just over the heavens but even over all of all things but the irony is that it's a creature that is lower than Delevingne but he's crowned with Divine honor okay to the rule over all the purpose was always to be crowned with that honor but not to be Elohim and it's almost like the absurdity of a non Elohim ruling over Elohim was what Tommy is Earth creature being made to rule with Divine Glory over the overall the creation and
 this is Daniel 7 Louis spent so much time talking about is there you have one who has suffered under a human who suffered under the Beast and yet is elevated above the Beast to the Divine throne and Daniel chapter 7 so Genesis 1 Psalm 8 Daniel 7 these are some of the most important texts for Jesus the apostles as they talk about who Jesus says they see one statement hear about the ideal purpose for Humanity that was lost when they gave in to the deception of the beast in Genesis 32 I think we're supposed to wear supposed to read the snakes words as the deception God knows in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you'll be like Elohim knowing good and evil so when there's an irony there cuz they're already the image they're already the image image of a of a
 tell him that they already are in a way but they're not in the same way and took that the sons of God are like it would be obvious to a human if you ran into one of these like I'm not one of those creatures and there would be this desire I supposedly if I could like be not so why she is that the way that Daniel 7 as the whole argument strategy as a book of Daniel is to say that that glorified send a man's figure is an emblem of the destiny of God's people who suffer and wait and then Daniel 7 in Daniel chapter 12 where Daniels like when is the exaltation going to take place and he's told you I'll go your way Daniel
 when it all hits the fan the righteous will awake from the dust and shine like stars it says it can be metaphorically described as waking up from the dirt Genesis three were you banished from you return to the best you wake up from the dust and then you shine like stars you have like this Celestial the resurrection humanity is Heavenly and Earthly different than the the type of body that correct we started with crime Genesis yes in Genesis 2 and 3/8 dirt dirt creatures yeah but that are being given a chance to become more to become more and again that's why soulmate is a poetic amplification of the image of God passage in Genesis 11 Genesis one is an ideal that innocence was never
 yeah I think and I like you've explained it before that Genesis 1 and 2 aren't about a state of perfection Genesis one should we try this one but of I don't forget the word used by its and ideals and but it's supposed to be moving in the direction correct and and so is it that the journey that like the adventure that Adam and Eve were supposed to go on and become that was never realize because we were supposed to do in a specific way correct being to eat the tree of life and not to eat the chicken. It's Genesis 1 the first creation narrative gives you start to Explorer Genesis 1 and 2 Series gives you a Sabbath cycle 7 days
 every day has a same introductory statement and God said it comes with an identical conclusion and there was evening and there was morning first day of second day the seventh day is God's rest which is all hyperlinked cool design pattern stuff done resting on the 7th day but there is no concluding formula for the 7th Day like you do have and there is even the morning 7 stay right in the narrative time frame the seventh day has no end almost gives you a treehouse here's what is supposed to happen is the ultimate ideal of an ordered having a nurse with humans is divine image rulers and a Perpetual Sabbath ruling with God the Perpetual Sabbath OK Google let's see how it goes down where the supposed to go Genesis to let's see where it actually goes and where at
 it's not it's real raspy petralex I correct a what could happen here's what actually happened no let's take what actually happened and find a way back to Ideal that was never realized but here's a short for him I think what you're getting is Genesis one is not a state of perfection that is not supposed to know it's not a state of perfection that is ruined it's depicted as an ideal that was never realized the good idea that is never realized as opposed to a Perfection that is corrupted and so and then back to the snake Decor deception is to want the knowledge of Good and Evil yes and he Ties That to being like the Elohim yes that's right you'll be like Ella him knowing
 what is good and what is not good and again these are all things God wants to guide humans give them rulership we know that from page one your idea and what we also know is he wants God wants to mature them cuz ruling requires wisdom and knowing good and evil so they're going to have to know they're going to be able to do the question is are they going to grab it or are they going to know it relationally Genesis 3 is setting the whole table for what we call the wisdom literature this is why knowledge of Good and Evil permit to vocabulary Proverbs it's why wisdom is called a tree of life either you don't take for yourself knowing good and evil you allow God to teach you couldn't evil you submit to the fear of the Lord will you grab it for yourself and which case you'll never get the tree of life and that's what happened
 and so when the snake says you'll be like the Elohim is there something about the class of Elohim I think that allows you to be able to no good and evil on your terms I think so and that's why I wanted I think more about it what do we know about the heavenly host from Genesis one will they rule through the sky lights when was the lights for weather for signs and for sacred festivals and for years and days so they hold the wisdom of the calendar and this is getting ancient near Eastern here but calendar and the meanings of the math behind calendars and the mean even the meaning of the number seven this is all going into the realm of ancient esoteric Divine knowledge cuz it's the knowledge behind the operations of the universe the universe the why did the stars move in these hypercomplex pad
 yeah and you have to dedicate your whole life in the ancient Traditions to learning the really sophisticated math to figure out these patterns that the kind of seen as a kind of divine knowledge and if you could understand that you'd be in tune with the knowledge of the Gods and the Heavenly beings have this knowledge cuz they operate by I see so ancient nearest a person would think okay what the heck is going on like how this all working the Stars just like it's his patterns but man man only the Elohim know and so then the snake comes if it's actually know you can know you can have you had a Heavenly knowledge and you should be thinking like well know I'm going to find out I'm going to know because of my relationship with Yahweh the Elohim of Elohim and the snakes don't like that you don't need that you can know you can
 you can like get a leg up and be on your own and member of the word this word for snake massage is also the Hebrew word for sorcerer Divine our knowledge of astrology how did they get this Divine knowledge speak the words of the Gods to people so you have a nakash snake which is the same three letters of the diviner sorcerer telling people you can have the secret knowledge of the other name which is also the same three letters as the word seraphim right that rhymes with the other word for snake in Hebrew is the word seraf hear the snake figure is tied into all kinds of other things about astrology and sorcery it's a cherubim and the Beast of the field it's a lucid and
 but think this is just like on this yes it's an overabundance a surplus of meaning in the surface image just like in Hebrew poetry you can put two lines next to each other and the electricity between the two lines generate I just want to simplify it so I can know what I need to know and then move on John Collins is that you you were an artistic stinker and love to communicate through images but then there are other times when a sense of clarity I want like the math or something it's really interesting artistic personalities are okay with ambiguity of the beauty and depth of an artistic form and you like but anyway it's the same word as sorcerer
 it's the word for shining things in the house is it's the Divine knowledge of the Gods at all just like make sense to me I think it's in that empty you do that for me that's where the rest of this s I'm out I do appreciate the richness tying it into wisdom I think that's really helpful for me to remember is yes in reading this there's an element of my being and being instructed on what it means to to truly be wise and how did the concept of freedom in Jewish and Christian tradition true freedom is to realize your nature your intended nature and purpose which is knowing your limits where else in the modern West we tend to think of Freedom as freedom from all external obligation
 you're made for living in the living within discovering your true potential within your own boundaries
it's interesting to me though that in Genesis these first few chapters in one sense the calling and the in the nature of humans is amazing they're the image of God and called To Rule and from me so much bigger than any perspective I had on human nature and growing up and disco ruler thing and him with unlimited potential it's human potential very exalted then even match of the Christian tradition has been able to Bear its almost 2 So Glorious that thinks I'm a freak out by it sure and that but then at the same time you and the same narrative you get that this sense of limitation correct very clear sense of what you're not Elohim for 1
 and your wisdom needs to come from God is going to be limited in the way that you can rent find wisdom and that's a pretty big restriction it's almost like it's like we're have so much potential and Aries week nor but then in the one thing that there's a some boundaries around he's desperately Want to Be Free of that sounds any video we do we are talking about humans are so intimately connected with the one whom the image that they share participate in God's eternal life the tree of life but access to the tree of life is conditional on what you do with knowing good and evil do you allow God to have that knowledge and you will that's a part of your limits if you will let him share with you
 I teach you about the fear of the Lord in the wisdom literature or do you take it for yourself visible image taking it and it's not taking it it's like a disposition will I receive it as a gift or will I take it for myself and receiving it as a gift is an elevator another yet another wave got elevating and sharing his own power and love and knowledge with the humans but the ticket reverse this whole thing and the snake is clearly a being that is already started that journey and wants to bring others bring those down and bring others down yeah so and Daniel 12 vs you will come from dust into be this Inglorious Celestial kind of image or is Paul talks about shining like stars in the heavens how far back can you trace that mean that seems to be like a new addition to the story it wasn't like Adam and Eve were told eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we knew what they were told only that real
 yeah but they weren't told like eat of the tree of life and you will become like stars in the heavens in the image of God does the phrase sell them means physical embodiment it's the Stars had an image of themselves signs or images of God's power and Status one of the things they do is shine so its potential within the phrase image of God the clearly the main context in Genesis one is ruling that's the main meaning of Genesis 1 but it's the star possibility is also there and it does get activated later on the promise to Abraham when he says yeah you see will be like the started Stars which isn't has a double meaning the metaphor and both numerous but then also is the possibility shining like stars which is what Daniel explicitly picks up on the Shine Like Stars
 Open Temple that interprets the skin after Adam and Eve were banished God provided skin he closes them with garments of skin animal skin is early tradition that sees that as the moment when humans lost their star Glory which they were first given and that they get are they read back into it there was a glorious body right and that's a narrative hint of what it was lost correct yeah it's a inference from its skin is what we have now that's given them upon banishment from the garden then they must have lost some other appearance so there is there is a possibility that was supposed to read that when Adam and Eve had some sort of Glorious state that lives lost intended and you can at least see that was in Daniel you can see that also in the gospel traditions where Jesus ascends the holy sacred Cosmic mountains and transfigured with Peter James and John and when they see who's true
 identity what they see is a glorious exalted human who's glowing here but Jesus wasn't always glowing Jesus the Risen Jesus mention he's lying it mentions that they didn't even recognize him cuz he looked like a normal person so pressing for this amount of clarity out of ya text that I'm trying to be like that if we could be just that I'm missing something still have never in all the years of following Jesus really dwelt on or hope for like the sense of Glory in fact that word Glory never meant like shining today and and now I'm wondering what that supposed to mean for me yeah like I don't have this sense of I want to be a glowing right and I'm definitely not what ancients were thinking either it's really just like I want it I want it to escape to the bird
 Frailty and death Glory has two main nuances in the biblical tradition one primarily is about status cuz it's the same word for honor and honesty societies it's about status but that high status within a Biblical Cosmic imagination the things that are the highest status of The Shining things those two have an exciting things are beautiful and so is humans are to image and rule the Creator over all created things then their exaltation will have to mean an exaltation even above the things that I think are the most glorious things the Stars I think that's what's happening so I shouldn't have this desire to be like Elohim because that's part of the deception but I should have the desire to have the glory that the elegant but it comes from still being human but being connected
 God's wisdom and cooling with him think within the framework of the story where is to image god well within the world and that when I do that and when I let his wisdom guide my knowledge of Good and Evil and how I rule and whatever my little corner of planet Earth I will find myself exhausted but not from self-exaltation but I will find myself sharing in the exalted nature of God's love and generosity but it's only when I recognized all those things are derivative for me I'm only a Channel or a mirror reflecting something other than myself and again this is also I think this is all related to so much of biblical imagery of high and low
 and the first thing last in the last being first in the high being humbled in Mary's poem in whole Gospel of Luke yeah the upside down value set this is all connected the beasts of the field the snake who's low on the ground and wants to bring down those who are high about him rulers and the snake goes in the dust before he tries to get the humans to go back to the dust is all this height imagery connected to in this as well sorry what's up related yeah that will because I'm saying what should I desire and you're saying you're not Desiring the height you should do you should decide image of God well which was often put you in a low sacrificial yes that's right but through that Lonas
 say it again this is exactly what he's marveling over when I consider the heavens the moon the stars what is the lowly human that you thought of him you made him lower than that love him but yet you want to crown him with glory and majesty and our instinct is going to be either to take ourselves or to build up a tower and get up I like those our instincts and then we see that played out in the narrative look where this leads leads to death in Exile in their violence and the thing that seems absurd is to accept the lowly status correct and to live sacrificially and humbly but it's within their this is what sets you up for the stories of Abraham Isaac and Jacob God wants to bless Abraham but then he finds himself in these patterns of trying to connive and lie deceitfully to get the
 that he already has three other promise this is Jacob he's constantly trying to gain through deception the thing that is already too pissed the Joseph story so he has these dreams of his exaltation and he's such a punk that God actually has to lower him to the pet of the prison so that he can truly humbly accept his high position when your exalted Bacchus King all those stories are in their own way commenting back on the garden story of what God Destin Humanity for what they took for themselves and therefore they're lowering unto death in the pit well knowing who you are and allows you
 to live the way you're supposed to it's like it's interesting cuz it's like Joseph if you have all these dreams that his brothers are going to worship them in stock and that the sun moon and stars I guess I had exactly he's raining then that's going to get to your head and you can be like all sweet awesome love you guys pay attention to me the way I look how much Authority I have me look at my special multicolor jackets that my father gave me is like just because of your status you act that way and you're going to be brought low that status should actually make you want to serve out their most humble cuz you realize it's I don't deserve any of this this is all a gift for all the gift man if that's all the Bible was trying to say if you like my husband
 wow I think that is what the Bible's tribes of the big I mean it's a massive we wake up into existence with all this potential different peoples different types of potential an opportunity and question is what do you do with it do you think that you made it for yourself and yeah we're in this realm again for your advantage to sign over all of the Bible but this is why I pause poem about the science weapons to is a distillation of the whole Hebrew Bible he was in the very nature and for God yeah but he didn't his mind Jesus the side of the pre incarnate mindset towards his status was not to use it for his own Advantage but rather to give it away so that he could take the form of a slave to serve others by giving up his life it's only Humanity that will lower itself even unto death for the love of God and neighbor
 is qualified to rule the Universe the power Paradox I feel like I could do well in that more often first thing I get I guess I think Christians General religious people get hung up with Zak Lee where this is heading and what does it mean when Jesus coming back or what but so much of the dance truth and wisdom is this very applicable like how we supposed to be living right now with half a millennia of this real just in the promised land is any sign God is extremely patient in letting each generation truly wake up to the reality of its own real
 responsibilities and failures as a different priorities apparently in a timely way right yeah I taken a while a while speaking of wrapping things up maybe this thing will help potentially I think we talked about God and I think what I would want and I think most people would want is a lot of clarity and closure around the Trinity and I think perhaps that's the thing that we really can't give because it's unpacking a mystery what we did was like 21 episodes of trying to unpack the mystery in in the way that the Bible seems to unpack it and not try to create any more closer than the Bible gay
 maybe there is something one way to start is maybe just asking like I don't hear you use the word Trinity much we've even gone out of the way to not really use it much in the series is there a reason behind that in this conversation and in the video that we made call God I just I'm trying to recreate my own personal journey of trying to understand how the biblical narrative leads you ultimately to a conception of God as a community of eternal love in the father loving the sun in through the spirit how do you get there how does that work just in like house that coherent as a developing set of ideas right for me that's been a many many many years long project and so that's was trying to help us recreate and helps me
 come to the Trinity with more respect and then when I just begin with it as a static like fact the illogical fact and again that with the word Trinity and the language around it means actually has so charge for different people in different ways what I actually cared more is just about this Biblical Portrait of God as a unified plurality and Hebrew Bible God's identity is of a unified plurality and not a very clear systemic type of portrait Rae but in a way that makes sense in each of it done that Divine attributes the angel of the Lord the human image and you walk away going wow what we need is a human who's completely unified part of God's very own identity for the creation to be what it's supposed to be
 and then that's what you got in the story Jesus let me ask you that then there's a sense that Jesus has unified with the father and use that language then there's another sense that humans are supposed to be in a fight with Jesus and the father in the spirit and what ways were those the same in what ways are the different types of unity yeah that's a good yeah they are they are different there because I was being unified with God doesn't now maybe if I Us in the same way again our English language is going to be tricky are the point is in the biblical story that humans are unified when John takes the language of the Shema one Lord one God and defines the one God as the father and the son who relate to each other through the spirit and who bring us into their Unity
 in through the spirit explore this in the Gospel of John so that will first of all the Disciples of Jesus maybe one as the father in the Sun for 10s. But then also that we may be in them and say in me up here so it's a way I think of the biblical author saying that God wants to create an other and share existence in love with an other and to be an other means that we won't ever be the source of all being in reality that just God but God wants to bring us into that in a way that transforms us completely in such a way that you lose you don't lose your own idea but you don't lose your own identity but you do then still gain the idea another identity that is bigger than you I don't know when I do my annual backpacking trips and I'm out there looking at the Tetons
 over the Tetons and I have no problem submitting myself as a creature to the Beautiful Mind you know that's like I'm fine being a creature yeah I don't want to be with him but the fact that that beautiful mind would want to transform me more and more into the kind of beautiful glorious being who can create that kind of beautiful good in the world and I think it's when I take the thing that God wants to give me and it's I attributed to myself and for my own self and we're back to it I guess so the divine nature this in the opening lines of 2nd Peter and then when he goes on to describe his beautiful character traits of love and gentleness and faithfulness and so on so it away out of and Eve
 they didn't either the knowledge to knowledge Knievel and went straight and just said need of the tree of life I got the wisdom that's been participating in the divine nature think so divine power has been granted to us I just give me his divine power has granted to us everything needed for life and godliness sent through the true knowing of him he has called us in Weiser going by his own glory and Excellence so through knowing him you've experienced to find glory in excellence he's given us promises that we may become share is this word Koinonia participators in at the divine nature you get knowledge but it's a relational knowledge that transforms into a participator of the Divine life itself the divine nature and I wanted to try to take the divine nature you find death
 try to know the one who created you and receives and receive it and you'll find yourself taking up so yeah it is essentially a reaffirmation of the ideal in Genesis 1
is there anything else you've been thinking about after these all these conversations that you think would be good to him and on yeah I mean I did a deep dive into the sons of God and the Giants the Nephilim and the others a lot of great recent work that isn't captive to some older real misconceptions what's going on here so by that I mean the concept of giants in the ancient world is really well-known motifs that threads through Egypt that lawn and Canaanite literature the concept of the Giants such that when the biblical authors bring up the Giants they're working a well-known set of motives here Giants or send me Divine creatures I think I just showed you I just realized this ography from Egypt Babylon and the gods are always Giants are we looking at that
 written law at the end of the Code of Hammurabi Code of Hammurabi the Sun God was a giant seated is taller than standing as typical just go through this there's is Google image the most famous Egyptian like a large Temple wall carvings and saw a chance to talk about in the Bible scriptures should be uploading that all this stuff about this sense of the day ends the beings depicted as Giants are either Divine or semi-divine part God and part human but Gilgamesh Babylonian tradition and that these giant Warriors are key figures in founding the great monarchies of the ancient and so when you see Genesis 6 saying yeah you know what
 Giants really are the result of spiritual and human rebellion and sexual immorality in the toilet and the one of them is connected to the founding of Babylon fraud and the word Nimrod we've been using the word Rebels rebels human Rebels memorize it sounds like such a lie, a name of a guy you would make fun of you no pick on yes sir I do yeah yeah when I was a kid I don't know why but Rebel you would never pick on a kid named Rebel wish your parents ninja Rebel imagery throughout the story line I was big Delilah continue learning on that
 and I think also the Daniel 7 realizing that that such a key that's like everything in the Hebrew Bible story line and all the plot tensions are metaphorically brought together in that story it's like the Deep substructure of Jesus's thinking and behavior in the gospels in the Audi percent him so Danny 70s hit me in a new way the discovery that the concept of the Divine plurality is an ancient Jewish biblical concept that was confronted with the Jewish tradition in the post Christian era una became more dangerous and almost certainly because of the rise of Messianic Jewish Christianity this ancient biblical idea became associated with this new app shoes and so you can see why that tension in the first centuries of the Jesus movement produced Within
 Messianic Judaism a movement away from those older ideas so that's when the monotheism in the Shema are now being stated in opposition to the Christians who speak of the god of the Bible as one and more than one doing this older guy has plural Jewish tradition what would they do with the Shema and are like what that look like well it's affirming yahweh's uniqueness for us among all the other element has unique this for us okay right now and then it's a statement of loyalty and then this ancient like Jewish pluralistic view of God we never really talked about that that would be just them saying he look it seems like God has these different identities and a bit he was scriptures basically what we do
 Jewish scholar named Benjamin summer book called bodies of God the bodies of God he's actually tracking with how in Babylonian and Canaanites literature and art the same deity can be simultaneously present in multiple embodiments so if it did a statue in one city gets destroyed well I took another study so and he saying this is the analog to the biblical conception of God's omnipresence and how he can't be reduced anyone manifestation is deity is ancient and logs to biblical ideas but the biblical ideas are usually taken things a step further kicking it up a notch in a way that makes it all so unique so the most important work on ancient Jewish concepts of the Divine plurality is the scholar name
 Alan Siegel called the two powers in heaven and he actually traces how you can trace in Jewish literature pre-christian into the Christian era concept of you always wanted more than one people get more nervous about bringing it up talking about it in the biblical texts or system to Christians because it's the nazarenes is off and how Christians refer to later Jewish literature in the nazarenes and so complicated. And then once the Christian start being jerks about it like using the favor they're gaining in Greek and Roman society to oppress jizz then it's just like this is what we were talking about the biblical message is being yes oh yeah I am sympathetic with why Jewish communities began
 be way more careful with this Define plurality language and in their own scriptures I get it areas of of growth for me but the fundamental thing for me was this this was a rediscovery of the importance of the the idea of portrait of God that came to be labeled as the Trinity I think because I was just introduced to the Trinity when I was a new believer I was like the fact about God without understanding the whole biblical like and it is just that the fact about God God knows everything God super powerful but to see it routed so deeply in the storyline of God as a community of Love who wants to share love and responsibility
 play with other creatures become more beautiful versions of themselves when they ironically give up the power that they're being given as a gift to ReDiscover so beautiful as a way to think about human nature that's what the biblical stories talking about that's how the story of Jesus makes perfect sense in light of that cuz that's Jesus is becomes the model of the true human one this is his giving up with his power is exactly what qualifies him to be the ruler of Heaven in Earth you've been given power to rule as a gift but to use it you have to give it up give it up you have to because I have to recognize it's a gift recognize it's not mine to do whatever I want with my own good recognize that is for the good of others recognize that it's to increase the reputation of the one who gave it to me and recognized
 you know how to use it well I need to have God's wisdom correct wisdom and all the human portraits in the Hebrew Bible there is people who don't deserve what they get from God and then the horrible things they did they do with it and then the handful of them that get it right at some point you take all those elements and you add a very patient God and you got him history being this hot very image on our behalf because we are incapable of it apparently and in so doing we find ourselves offered with opportunity and then through Jesus to be taken up into the divine nature. Once again I'm not sure if that ties about on the gods theories I don't know if they'll be there but we have a more chance with the Q R
 so yeah we'll get questions and we'll do another hour maybe that'll wrap things up I guess this would be the project show me it's amazing that the Biblical scripture of tradition Jewish Christian tradition what we're doing is we have received the set of sacred texts as a unified collection and then in the Christian tradition it's a series of events historical events the Life Death resurrection of Jesus what happened with the spirit of Pentecost the text and those two events there mute their Mutual interpreting does events mean what they mean because of how they fit into the storyline of the texts and also the techs are illuminated in a way to see that that's how they contacted with history of Justice like fancy literature but actually is our real world it's being described in these texts
 but what is tax do isn't what you're one hemisphere of your brain which they would do is just tell you give me the answers kids answer it's these narratives create a playing field that you discover the so to speak and as you enter the playing field and learn how the game works at reading and understanding this literature you find it's giving you the language within which to think and talk about this God is being and that just is the way this tradition Works no two ways about it and so we can distill it into systematic theology books but we should never mistake those summaries or synthesis for how the actual tradition Works. Which is to live in the story and read and Ponder at your whole life and the trust that things will become more clear through time to tell me you are supposed to talk about God for 21 hours and still feel confused
 one of the greatest Gifts of my or early forties had those 20 hours of, thanks so much with you about it but it was an immensely helpful for me or I find it immensely valuable and any gift for it so I'm glad we get to do more thank you for listening I hope this was helpful for you who are listening yeah I think it was helpful for people will be the true final rap of the Gods here and we'll never talk about God again not bring up the identity of God hello my name is January and I'm from the Philippines but I live in Okinawa Japan
