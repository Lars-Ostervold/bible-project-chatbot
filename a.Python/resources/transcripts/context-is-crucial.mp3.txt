hey this is John at bible project this will be the final Series in our how to read the Bible Mega series we've been walking through the different literary genres sections of the Bible learning how to understand them and read them well in these upcoming episodes we're going to talk about how to read the New Testament letters these are small books in the back of your Bible written by Apostles of Jesus to the early Christians all over the Roman world I grew up in the church that almost exclusively pot and preached out of the New Testament letters we called them Epistles which is just a fancy way of saying letter and we like them because they're accessible and practical the letter is actually become easy and accessible I think only when we ignore their literary form and when we honor their literary form all of a sudden we have a way to account for all of what's there not just some of what's there and all of us.
 includes a lot of texts that are really challenging for us to appropriate or understand in our modern context and so this is a story all the challenges that comes along with determining the New Testament letters if you ever read one all the way through you'll find that they're actually pretty hard to follow from beginning to end can't I just take my favorite lines of the letters turn them into bumper stickers and motivational posters do I have to read the whole letter and understand the entire argument like Phase 1 of just reading the Bible and getting to know you're just trying to figure out what the next step is to question that incident in to say like wood Paul be pleased that like that's what I'm getting out of that paragraph So today we start to unpack the challenges of reading the New Testament letters and we'll discover empowering ways to read them well this week's episode is recorded in front of a live audience in Dallas this was recorded before
 1960 joining us
 welcome everyone
 hey
 thank you for coming we never get out actually this is this is new for us it's great to see all of you how many of you are from Dallas
 yeah represent Dallas I want to say thanks to Munger Place Church
 and Andrew is going to be Pastor here and all the staff they've been really generous they're hosting this all for us thank you for having us yeah this is going to be kicking off a new series for the Bible project podcast connected to it some videos that we're going to do so we'll talk about that but it also has simultaneously like you and I are episode for those of you who are in the room will do a block of conversation and then Andrew will come up and he'll be looking and facilitating some of those questions so we are going to finish the how to read the Bible video series within this season before the end of next-gen yes we've been working through every literary genre in the Bible and then also
 sections B vitamins main section so it's been going to your project theater is Jeff so we just released if you just really weird and then and how to read The Parables but that's in real time and in the space-time Continuum we're actually going to be yes preparing for video that'll come out later yeah how to read the Epistles New Testament letters you text me letters we're going to do two videos on the New Testament letters for reasons that will talk about why we're going to dedicate to videos so we are starting that conversation today so actually this will be the first of many episodes and how to read the New Testament letters
 but I'm really excited about it for reasons I will talk about sweet yeah go for it okay for the gospels were going to do a video we have hold podcast series coming on how to read The Parables that was awesome to read and actually maybe you can help us and often times we don't know what to call the video and we figure it out in the pot in the conversations that we have for the podcast so is it weird that I call him a pistols that's how I have that conversation yeah it's means letter o
 is it the Greek for letter Greek word for letter and historians the first-century letters and yes there are people's his whole career is being historians of the debate going in the discipline about the difference between letters and Epistles some letters that will read not today but in future conversations with some for Century letters the really interesting and most of them are very short and like very very short and they're just to one individual what's interesting about the New Testament letters is that they are two groups of hostages almost all of them except a few namely Paul's letter to Philemon which is to one individual but then also to his wife and then another person and then the people in your house but even the letters to individuals are and also to the community at the same time and so some people use the word epistle to talk about letters to a group of people versus two letters just
 okay I don't think Epistles is a normal word know so I don't think we should but I won't use anymore yeah it's usually the Bible episode something and then reading the New Testament letters after reading the letters of the New Testament another phrase I thought I was reading the apostolic letters but Apostolic that's not a normal word if you're not religious is taking the apostles which is a Greek word spelled in English letters is in the making an adjectives and we don't have to solve this right now
 yes yes all right we got many hours so that's just basic facts in the New Testament was twenty-seven separate literary Works a large number of those in the whole new testament or new testament a large number of those are letters let it goes with the books I read growing up yeah yeah because so am I tradition and basically let me sometimes I open the song and I would try some of those out and if you could find one that you like that's not weird then that we have to break somebody's teeth on any given day if I were to read the Bible usually on my own I would do a letter because it felt the most approachable of anything in the Bible and
 what's all the passwords ever preached through to in your in your head my tradition we would read sometimes the gospels but even then I wouldn't because I think I figured out the letters will tell me what you know what to do in life I see how to be a few minutes and then I love God and all that stuff and so and the great thing about the letters is their address to when you're reading them at least an English which has the same word you goes for singular and plural I can say you John or you the people sitting in the room so unhelpful, text y'all languages have separate words for y'all and you yeah yeah but not in English translation
 my point is that if you're just picking up the Bible on you're looking for something to speak to me right now today these are books of the Bible that are addressed to you right and when I read them right now to talk about Jesus and what he means and how to follow in the Bible in general was always hard to read it's still difficult and the hack was we'll just read the letters but even in the letters I would constantly find myself confused and frustrated but they were the most approachable I want to explore that Dynamic and experience because I think that might help be kind of the hook for the video where some people in this is only in some traditions of the church where people have your experience gospels in Jesus first and then the letters you know later
 I hear they are okay so here's the distal list of letters and authors and so on so there's 13 letters from the Apostle Paul in the New Testament and actually is working to see almost half of those letters aren't Trump all alone they're actually from Paul and Timothy or Paul Silas and Timothy or perhaps even co-authors Peter has connected the two letters for some 2nd Peter John is connected to three letters do the first John doesn't have a letter introduction or conclusion and it doesn't read like a letter it reads like poetry from John the tradition the earliest tradition has connected to it and it's written by the first people as 2nd 3rd John in a second and third John the author calls himself the Elder John the Elder next is the letter of Jacob or in the English tradition James next to the
 Judah Jesus brother but get surrender to English is Jude and then the anonymous author of the letter to the Hebrews there you go not the majority of pages in the past we've done this if you actually hold all if you like single out the pages if you can get the whole new testament and then single out of pages out of the letters it's not so we have a Bible on them so I just grabbed all the way to the end of this one is just actually good tactile just separate off the New Testament there and then out of the New Testament grabbed grabbed the letters
 yeah I would totally go there are some traditions where this is where the action is in the Bible that they don't really break things down for you and a way of like my tradition is I want to understand I want to systematize and figure it all out and it's it's easier to try to do that in the Vietnamese letters yes, said officials were talking about a surface level you might save videos on like that that little section has been disproportionately influential in the history of the Jesus movement and there are many people who see that is the center of gravity and then use what's happening here as the frame to tell the for the rest of the store arguably yeah that is the case in that the rest of the Bible was written for people who followed Jesus
 leave their letters right well I will keep talking from the apostles are actual letters they were not written as Timeless abstract essays on Christian Theology and they contain a lot of early Apostolic Theology and ethical exploitation but they are real letters and real letters have not just an author and an address c letters a rise out of a whole context pre-existing relationships and circumstances that inform why the letter is written why the content of the letter is what it is and then those letters are speaking into very specific situations that the author knows about and the
 address he knows about but that either eat or may not know about I never experienced that reading on that's one of the frustrating thing is you would run into that one in particular was now it says Paul's talking to someone in one of the letters and he's like hey remember everything I taught you and it kind of sounds like you did a really legit like intro to Christianity class in this church
 yeah that's right yeah and what you actually what's colors have to do is reconstruct Paul's catechesis another words when he planted the church and he's like what the festival in example we know for Max you only got to be in thessalonica for maybe a month month-and-a-half before you was run out of town and so what did he share with them what is it and he alludes to it in the letter but he never says what it is and so what's the useful information it's a totally yes it would be useful information the Bible give us everything that we want to know are you with me so we're back to that thing again somehow we're back to the horse I want to know how to understand following Jesus from the ground floor
 I feel like it's more there than we realized in alluding to it and using its language in all of his letters and so is Jacob James The Sermon on the Mount is clearly the ground floor so assumed that they don't need to quote it explicitly is informed on a deep level of their Theology and ethical thinking we'll talk about that have the intro to like Jesus and following him package in the letters and what would that highlights for us is out will what are the letters them their actual letters and so if we're going to learn how to read this with greater wisdom learning how to ask the questions that really eliminate what the letters are instead of making them do something that I think that they ought to do
 which of this has been our conversation throughout this whole series is honoring what the biblical texts actually are and reading them the way that they're designed to be read not the way that I wish they should be rather something like that when we get to that in a moment I'm usually pretty comfortable with it you know okay so yeah it's a narrative and yeah words poetry but with the ladders man I just I'm so attached to them as helping me really discern and have all the right the categories in my face that I just feel like they should do that they need to do that yeah they do that but in a way that's different than the way I wanted to do I think so it's right it's no different than biblical narrative we talked about this biblical narratives are not children's literature giving us moral lessons there heavy duty theology
 sing the deepest questions about who we are where we are whose God what's happening on the flying space Rock and like where where are we why are we all here all that stuff but the way that they address it is not the normal way that we thinking era does do that they and their world back into all this conversation so it's very similar that's just now we're willing an actual letters so this might be silly but I thought we have this wonderful room of great people to make this Dynamic and so what that's going to require as it is a volunteer from the audience who feels very comfortable with himself all right great all right
 got a reply okay but that's okay what is your name I have a letter for you to deliver to John and he is right here but I need to involve you in the in the process and deliver recreate what's happening in these new testament letters so you and I have a long history of relationship or whatever and so what I do is I get a co-worker Saint Paul I get a co-worker we have been whatever we've been on a boat we planted some Churches together Kevin is my coworker who never got to say in Greek and I'm going to use him to deliver the letter the letters written in such a way
 what kind of say Kevin could you please I'm go deliver this letter to John and then I'm going to ask you to actually hand it to him but then he's going to hand it back to you and you are going to perform the letter to him which just means to read it okay yeah alright great thank you I'm kind who's it from him can you read it for me dear John I commend Kevin he / she is a really nice person
 who I just met and they seem trustworthy received him as you would me it's been a few days but I'm finally getting back to you about the current script man we were cooking out last day so much fun I've been thinking about The Parables especially since we talked about the deceptive manager I still think his dishonesty is meant to be taken in a neutral way maybe we should relax on that point and not included after all I don't know he's Wily like a demogorgon
 I'll be back soon I got held up in Dallas after you left I wonder if there's a Little Big Burger there could you make sure to talk with robot about the color scheme for the lip bids I'll share some more ideas when I arrive or ask Miriam I spoke with her about it before we left can't wait to rock the next topic Shalom 10
 sowed a seed deliver the letter John is there anything I'm not I'm not in the room is there anything that's unclear to you know I had to think back to our conversation and I was there I remember it so yeah I've never heard you talk about Little Big Burger with affection so that's like a new piece of information for me with my kids there's nothing at all did not understand okay now it's so here is something that's different than the New Testament letters since you and I are co-workers and we've been traveling and so on what actually would have done it had we have time I would have explained to you everything so that if John had any questions or things that were unclear you would be able to clarify that's unrealistic in our setup and you know it
 I didn't think we could go to the back room and talked for half an hour about what all this means but scenario here had Kevin shown up with the letter like take a kiss does with a vision or Africa or Phoebe Who deliver the letter to the Romans Stevie was the one to read the letter aloud and then offer any commentary or questions on it that was the dumbest Dynamic here so they can clear you doing that moment you're always like every like everybody else maybe maybe take some things that are unclear to you okay it was he who is he how does that apply to the parable
 we had to had like five hours of conversation on The Parables and you had a hang-up about the parable in Luke chapter 16 with this is alluding to for a long time and so we had an at the we made that the culmination of like applying the tools we figured out together they are so I would have talked to you through all that so that you would be on the same page as you deliver the letter did anybody know what the deceptive manager man in it a handful of you is usually called what the unjust Steward or shrewd service shrewd manager but he's he's deceptive Cooks the books I like what is a demogorgon
 it's okay no no judgement no judgment with the demogorgon demogorgon lives in what the upside down and is creepy creepy I'm just blank and yes we talked about things and and talk about it so I do you infer from the letter let's say that this weather got preserve you know for posterity and somebody's reading this a thousand years later and you infer from this like out and wasn't Dallas but then who else was in Dallas done was in Dallas I got held up in Dallas after you left Little Big Burger
 yes you know what I mean yeah you guys anybody know Little Big Burger even Portland what else is unclear actually are a little fear not little big but they make them tall and color scheme for the little robot is our art director know why is name is robot actually it's not because he likes to drive I think he drives robots because he was called robot
 he is looking for a church and he just works really hard he's a hard worker and it was a church that didn't really elaborate set design stuff and he kind of was in charge of that and so he would just stay up all night and asked rank these things out and you drop me rolls and stuff if you have to start calling him a robot get me to make sense as I'm thinking girl now if ya got it the literature videos so top-secret we can't talk about in public yet even though the podcast called live beds yeah it might stick you also get a mention of Miriam Miriam are you guys feeling the same points of uncleared is Kevin same basic issues okay and that's how I feel when I do everything was clear to you
 all right so you got it I just wanted to help recreate a moment where this isn't something special to the Bible the medium of the letter inherently has the ability to make things very clear and talk about things that anybody anytime could understand means there'll be all kinds of things that are puzzling were you in further some backstory that makes sense of why they said that a y the letter was written yeah and the New Testament letters have both have all of these Dynamics going on yeah and you're saying you this was you could sense this event from your early years of reading right away they were letters but I still wanted them to make more sense yeah I do. I still do want them make more sense they do I mean in it really does feel unfortunate strange if we're going to have a book which is God's word to us maybe it should have been
 logical essays right maybe that would have been better
 yeah you know I would like to be two inches taller back then too but it's not that bad but I want to know what God wants me to know it could have been the clear, I guess I guess if we're back to the UN headphones yet and just straight up speaking both the universal message of whatever you gotta yeah but apparently the Holy Spirit believes that what the circle of the Apostles was writing an actual letters to house churches in the first century decades of the Jesus movement that there was something here that was a value and that can speak a divine
 word to all generations of Jesus followers not despite the fact that they are letters but precisely through the fact that they are letters and I agree with you to take some adjustment of our expectations and this may be part of your experience have some of the most like sound bite the bullet wheatable one-liners in Christ Jesus our lord amen and amen right yeah and it's like in context out of contacts you know you're just a poster with the illegal in war. However the
 however the question is like this is in the context of a letter so it seems to me if I what we're trying to do in this series is invite people to take the next step and reading the Bible with more wisdom with more inside with more respect for what these texts are and so the next level question would be will when and where is that occur within the letter and what's the larger point which its making and why is Paul making that point to this particular group of people at the time and their relationship and so on yes the next level question of course you don't have to do that to understand the sentence maybe if he has to eight and nine by Grace you've been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of God as a result of work so that no one can boast come on dear friends 1st John 4:7 let us love one another for love comes from God there's a TuneIn
 remind and everyone who loves has been born of God. They're full of these kinds of things but probably what's happened is that overtime and maybe many of you can identify with this you are reading through the New Testament letters and will be all the stuff that's like the actual letter part of me like I don't know who these people are and I don't know why Paul yeah something about how they were in a fight but now they made up again and he said so himself and then run like it's clear and it warms my heart with spiritual happiness and there but then you go back into a section you like why is he talking about Jews and Gentiles and I think what people tend to do is just make it through the stuff that's difficult you know or maybe like how Kevin and you all were like I don't know what that apartment cuz I know that part makes sense
 a picture cuz I thought about this I should have put in a little short theology is a Battle Creek
 spiritual practice a religion out of the context of the letter and then we'll give us will do a sermon will do the class will do you think that's what I'm talking about like Phase 1 of just reading the Bible and getting to know you're just trying to figure out what it all means but the next step is to question that instinct to say like would Paul be pleased the like that's what I'm getting out of that paragraph in life was at Peters main point in the paragraph and if you are reading the letters as directly like from the Heavens to you and then there's the word you in a letter speed bumps in the process
 stop drinking only water and use a little wine because of your stomach and frequent illnesses
 greet one another with a kiss of love you guys go to church and start kissing people with love not sanitary 1st Corinthians 729 from now on those who have wives should live as if they have not heard
 1st Corinthians 7:14 doesn't the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair. It is a disgrace to him should remain silent in the churches they're not allowed to speak but must be in submission as the Torah says that we're getting more controversial here paragraphs after he's just talking about women who pray and prophesy words of instruction and teaching an encouragement to the church in the same Gathering where he's talking about it with me in the same letter you can take a sentence out of context and make it mean something that Paul clearly in contacts doesn't mean cuz there's lots of women speaking and he's before that so what does he mean in this paragraph nothing for it is actually become easy and accessible I think only
 when we ignore their literary form and when we honor their literary form all of a sudden we have a way to account for all of what's there not just some of what's there and all of us there includes a lot of texts that are really challenging for us to appropriate or understand in our modern context and so this is a swirl of challenges that comes along with interpreting the New Testament letters that's what I wanted to do in this first session was just get that fact on the table cool
cool and so we've got hopefully some questions we got Andrew here Bible we want the first question we know why the letters are difficult what might be the advantage for having part of our sacred scripture in the form of letters how does it actually helped us two thousand years later the great question here's the thing when we do qnr episodes I have days to think about the class is more live Q&A Nara is you hate it's a form of torture because the top of my on top of my end isn't in 24 hours I'm going to have a totally different kind of response to this question and so I care about thoughtfulness and so this is hard for me but there's value in
 the wave dancing about this in the present the New Testament letters give us a window into the nature I mean the apostles this is a circle of people who spent Time Around Jesus or like all who met the Risen Jesus and they were shaped by that first generation and they give us a window into the nature not just of the Theology and ethics of the early Jesus movement but if the way that leaders related to the communities but they and it's a model of leadership that I think every generation of the church stands to learn from cuz the letters they didn't have emails they didn't have text and Paul couldn't be everywhere in person or Peter it says if we're getting not just a theology in ethics but the actual the medium is the message we talked about this and so these there's so much more that the letters are doing and communicating than just their Theology and ethics and we'll talk about some some of those
 has become such a beautiful and valuable part of the letters is how how they communicate and then second back to our thing about the Bible isn't what I often wish it would be that itself is instructive to be like well why do I wish for the thing that I think about it a lot to be cuz I want to understand if you want it you won't understand but the question is understand what that Epistles give us an enormous amount to understand but it may not be the things that you thought were the most important understand I want all the right answers I want a complete kind of collection of the right things no yes so that's why I want the baby so that the baby Jesus or just for your own satisfaction that's a great question
 I don't know why do I want that the vein of pistols are difficult Dylan asks how do you reconcile James to faith without works is dead with Ephesians 2:4 It Is by Grace you have been saved through faith today yeah so here's another thing about the apostles they did all get together on a handful of occasions but what they seem to never have done is get together and have a conference where they all agree on what the meaning of their words are in every contact another words this word we always mean this correct in this end of the first Decades of this movement in the first decade of this moment and the sings explodes out of Jerusalem member in the book of Acts it's because of persecution and followers of Jesus getting murdered
 fleeing the city so this thing but when for example Paul's talking about faith and works he's talking about it to Gentile audiences like in Galatians or Colossians kind of Philippians and then in Rome there's very particular issues about Jewett Messianic Jews who followed Jesus non-jewish people who follow Jesus and they're having these conflicts about food laws and circumcision in kosher James comes along and he's riding to almost certainly like he calls the group they meet in a synagogue he's riding the Messianic Jews and it seems that Paul is being bad mouth and misunderstood in a lot of Messianic Jewish context and so James comes along and correct an issue that's raised from a misunderstanding that something is Santa Cruz about have a.
 Paul's letters to James doing damage control intra Apostolic conversation happening and then the way that they're being misunderstood if you just read James and Paul out of that social context and just put them next to each other it looks like a theological contradiction there save not by works James says actually your faith is proved by your works but in reality they are apart a very complex social movement and their addressing specific circumstances as the saying goes viral so that's the way that understanding how their letters really I think helps eliminate why are the letters are with the RN and the content okay so question if we read the letters how do we know when it's a command that should apply to us if I should take a little bit of wine when I have an upset stomach all followers of Christ do I know which is which goes to John's desire
 do the right thing but I don't always know if it applies to me that's exactly right yeah and my mind this is the number one challenge in Reading Apostolic letters to First Century House churches did they were written out of a very specific historical context their written into a very specific historical context how do you discern and what every tradition in the whole history of the Jesus movement uncharitable way to say it is it every tradition picks and chooses every tradition picks and chooses the question is what's the criteria by which they pick and choose and was you know it's there is a Divine criteria for picking and choosing we want to know what that is so that's part of what we're going to be working out in this series I'm just trying to set that Dynamic table cuz not everybody sees that Dynamic not everybody even knows of their tradition is picking and choosing but it's true of the thing about women speaking in 1st Corinthians 14 is a wonderful example there are very few
 Christian Traditions are some very few where women can't open their mouths anywhere in a public gathering but if they're going to take with the Bible says it I believe it that settles it if you going to take that context right or that verse that burst out of context that's what Paul says there's almost no Traditions that do that what most Traditions do is pick and choose from a selection of passages about women in leadership in the New Testament and make up their own package of it are you with me and so that you could do the same issue I mean what do we do with the issue of slavery slavery comes up a lot in the New Testament and so did we supposed to reinstitute something flavoreeds so we can obey these verses and have slaves at the course not nobody thinks that but why the Criterion is no different there commands given the slaves and Masters so every Traditions picking and choosing how do you do it we're going to put the topic on the table and give some guideposts for how how to
 one recommendation just cuz it's a great book and we'd interviewed Scott McKnight recently he has probably the most helpful but guiding people into this and figuring out the map the terrain of how Traditions pick and choose and why it's called the Blue Parakeet anybody to book called The Blue Parakeet and audio book about 5 hours short little paperback so helpful very helpful on this very topic from Grant the great question here about what he talks about the implicit references that you draw out of the vehicle text it says that can seem like a way that's difficult for modern interpreters where it feels like almost like you were associating the things that we don't see there and when it fits how you want to say it so the question is what do you say the one who is skeptical about implicit references between biblical texts or not direct quotations or Illusions but when it's right there under the surface
 much I just but even in the Epistles if there's a there's a Iceberg under the water yeah yeah how do you get modern people to see that unless they've been reading the Bible front to back for me for years and how do you explain that the people make him feel like that it's actually there we're going to do the second video of this two-part series it's going to be about learning how to follow a flow of thought through the letters from beginning to end and learning how is your following the development of a line of thought through whole letter not just taking rest of the contacts but read it from beginning to end up realizing the importance of Old Testament quotations and allusions which are non marked a couple hyperlinks to the Old Testament but if you think about it it's the same thing as this dynamic in the letter that I that Kevin delivered to you when I reference the demogorgon all I have to do is say one word and it activates the thing that we both know
 Alicia but then also lenders that is where that character comes from which is from the famous role playing game Dungeons & Dragons and so on and so just was one word I can activate a whole story World Network to another whole story world and that's all of it I'm talking about with the apostles is that their brains are not melted on TV and Twitter their media not just their media I'm it's it's hard to have an equivalent cuz it's it's so embedded in their social context the scriptures are reality for them and they the apostles are immersed in them from their earliest years and so they speak out of that world of the scriptures and so Paul give you one example I was just thinking about this the other day this is in Paul's letter to the Philippians in the Flippy and he's talking about how he's writing a letter from prison and he's actually not sure if he's going to live or die and he says I want you to know about my circumstances listen to the ghost
 shredding here in prison and he says I know that this will turn out for my Deliverance here we go right here I know that this will turn out from my Deliverance this is verbatim from the book of Jobe that little line right there and specifically from the Greek translation of that verse in the Book of Job is actually having a high point he doesn't have many of those in his pieces cuz he thinks that God wants to Paul has adopted jobs hope that even though God has allowed terrible circumstances yet I trust this will turn out for my turning into joke for a moment and I didn't even know he was doing I think so but did I explicitly bring up like episodes 3 and 4 of stranger things of this season to do this in my mind it's just the demogorgon's in my mind
 for two whole thing in that storyline and so I said you know use this metaphor and so the apostles are doing us all of the time and the Hebrew Bible is doing this about itself all of the time you click that give you the job reference. Almost English translations do you have to have internalized job to even see it yeah it's kind of like I actually wasn't a huge fan of the Fight Club movie Fight Club Fight Club you have to already know about Fight Club yeah it's so secret and in many ways that's what it's like to be in the Jewish literary tradition if you were raised in it no one else to tell you because you've been raised in it so we don't have to talk about this isn't 4 p.m. okay just one little line there that he borrows from the book of Jobe he doesn't have some huge of theology
 the prophet Isaiah he's actually appropriated the job character to see his own imprisonment through and that's just how he sees the world cuz you was raised on the scriptures this would be a part of the videos but is this a huge deposit doing this every page all the time we're going to go in the next hour so we're we're going to go is the letters require understanding the context it what this little exercise showed was that these letters were written out of a specific context and the written into a specific context and so a wise reading will be to respect that and to begin to learn about what those contacts are I think that there are four layers of context that are helpful to internalize to have on the brain when we're reading any of the New Testament letters for layers of contacts
 where do the letters appear in the unified story that least to choose us they fit in at a specific moment but the story and understanding why and how they fit in will illuminate why they are what they are and why they talk about the things that they talk about butts one moment a second layer is the cultural context both Jewish and Greek and Roman Greek and Roman culture Jewish culture inform almost all of these problematic text the raised the question of what what's for the first century and what's for the 21st century are connected to cultural context the different vastly from our own culture the situation with context does this third layer what's the prehistory of the author with this particular audience that informs why they're riding so those are all kind of story story cultural situation on and then there's just looking at each letter it's a coherent line of thought from the beginning to the end and so any verse sore
 a graph that I'm looking at I need to respect and understand how it fits in to the whole of the flow of thought so that I can do with it what the author wants me to do with it just to let you know we should relax so I want to study the whole letter so the four layers of context I know that sounds like a lot but I feel like the stakes are high with the letters because there's so many Traditions that actually get everything out of this section of the Bible but I think it's worth owning our study tools as we read this part of the Bible That's the roadmap going to take so long this just for we're just going to start and I hereby appoint one Slayer contact
 Summer Creek all right
 thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast next week we'll continue our discussion part two of our conversation live in Dallas and so it seems to me understanding how the letters fit in this has immense potential I think for the followers of Jesus today because this isn't just about Theology and ethics this is about creating next door and it's about getting people to elevate their allegiance to Jesus over their socio-economic National ethnic gender boundary line anybody
