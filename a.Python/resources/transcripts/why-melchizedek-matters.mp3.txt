everybody this is Tim and welcome to the Bible project podcast in this week's episode we are going to be concluding or a whole series on the royal priesthood in the Bible in this last episode is going to be an interview with a Biblical scholar who has researched and published work actually on the story of the first Royal priest that we meet in the Bible is it that kind of priest king of ancient Shaolin please explore the figure in the story about Abraham and Melchizedek already in the series but we're going to interview Joshua Matthews he's a professor of biblical studies at Western Seminary he did his dissertation on the story of Abraham and Melchizedek Genesis chapter 14 I can go check out his book it's called know his attacks alternative Priestley border and so in this conversation we get to talk with him about his discoveries and reflection on this
 very interesting story and the fascinating figure of milk is today we're also going to see some important connections between Melchizedek and have a surprise character in the storyline of Hebrew Bible that John and I have never talked about before Moses father-in-law Jethro the priest of Midian
 this guy is awesome lots of connections between him and milk is a deck we're also going to try and trace the path for how the milk is Attack of the Bible ended up being a very popular figure in Jewish imagination in the Time. Around Jesus the letter to the Hebrews his attacks Just A rad got to talk about any time of the day so that's what I'm going to do in this episode so thanks.
alright Josh did they have you on the podcast yeah thanks for having me it's good to be here what's also really cool both your Hebrew Bible scholar and I'll let you talk a bit about your background and what you up to now but I'll so you live in Portland Oregon I do yes I do suburb of Portland yeah I was born and raised here and yeah I hear ya it's great so the three of us actually all went to the same college and the name my. So a lot of shared memories and friends and so on so then you at school could have you heard we haven't had that many interviews with Scholars who are from Portland in fact any first you did your dissertation ever in the book on the story of milk in attack and the role that he play some indie Revival before we get too nerdy about that though maybe share with our audience destroy who you are how you ended up maybe following Jesus and then how you been
 typical studies grew up in a family that Christian family both my parents came from Christian family so it's kind of what I knew growing up and the Bible was always valued I mean not perfectly or anything like that course but I always kind of had a sense of its importance and the through high school I kind of started to think more seriously about it like to have some sort of a aptitude aptitude but just a like a taste for morning to study at more seriously where there's some like role models and figures who you thought were awesome and they cared about the Bible or just the just youth group leaders and my dad and Grandpa and I've kind of that Heritage yeah my grandpa I mean he would read by a different Bible every year and read through it every year in like make notes in it and a lot of save it and put it on the Shelf is your grandpa is Dad so that was that was kind of whenever we visited them I would see him first thing in the
 stop doing that and just I think as a little kid that made a big impression yeah so started to think a little bit more about it and it went to this one year kind of Bible school at like you know. You're kind of a bible school and again just kind of started that think I had this is enjoy reading it and want to study about kind of thought that would come down the road I didn't even really give much thought to trying to make it a career or or anything like that so after several other different kinds of things and kind of winding route I ended up going to Multnomah 450 and theology degree in college is what it was called then now Multnomah University and by that time I was in my late twenties I forget but I hadn't given it a lot of thought and but going back a little bit we had what we call Dale Seminary going about Sunday school like Monday night Sunday school class at our church and John tailhammer who
 stop being my PhD advisor came out there and did a class on the pentateuch and so that just kind of blew my mind in a different way and a new way and it was shortly after that then I just had it okay to go for it and yeah so maybe just a quick note yeah we share him as if he was a pivotal and really influential teacher and Scholar so well and also I think that's why it was so fun to read your book it feels like we're in the same kind of family of your questions that you guys are putting out I'm seeing that guy how this will end it did Tim ever tell you the story about House of hammers daughter reached out what time I have a feeling that he is influential to your research and she's just smelt it on that feeling was confirmed
 not in that class and then what you want no man once I started I went full-time and just kind of drove right in and just loved it and then from that point kind of just kept going and went to Wheaton for master's degree a couple masters degrees and then a little after I finish their got married in between came back to the port in the area got married trying to figure out what to do next and sailhamer moved out to the West Coast to the Bay area so I kind of followed him there I mean I had stayed in touch with him and tried to get lunch with him anytime I could and yeah that's where I ended up going so started with him until he was diagnosed with Parkinson's stuff part way through my program I switch to a different supervisor which ended up being a great experience also that ya did did an Old Testament PhD at Golden Gate Baptist now it's Gateway I forget what it's Gateway Baptist Seminary of the west or something like that and then came back up here after I finish there and have been working at Western Seminary and Institute out well
 couple other things but a drunk tank first and then have been on faculty since 2015 so that's a little bit of my story in your professor of Hebrew Bible or does biblical literature do you eat the biblical studies yeah so mainly Old Testament and and some biblical languages both biblical languages and then just recently took on a kind of a different role of administrative leadership dean of the faculty and then vice president of academic Affairs will be teaching last but still teaching some just to follow up on the sales part of the story I'm always curious to hear what other students experience with him and what was it that that's part for me he was again on a short list of the most influential biblical scholars in my early years who just fired my imagination and I still feel like I'm chasing down big questions he gave me the categories for so if we didn't plan on
 the boil down some of the things that it can be ignited inside of you what would you say that those were several things but one was just a real careful attention to the text to the words on the page the Hebrew Bible words but also how that comes out in our English Bibles and just take careful attention to the text and kind of a a a way to understand how it links together and how to think about it kind of as ya kind of a unified whole and with a lot of intentionality in the way that it's crafted it just it was a kind of thing where once I started hearing the categories that he's spoken it has made sense of what I had felt like I'd been seeing also I felt like that approach and not part of the approach just made more sense of Jesus made more sense of the Gospel made more sense of how the New Testament seems to view Jesus as a fulfillment of the Old Testament cuz there's a lot of answers to that kind of question out there that I think leave a lot I do
 it's just aren't fully satisfactory or don't don't really seem to account for everything that Jesus claims about himself with respect to the Old Testament or what the Apostle say about him tell us a couple of amphetamine also his personality and his character is left for the church and yeah yeah he's a master teacher in any class I ever have taught I'm trying to channel some of the people I don't even know what the quality was just like a wizard could Mesmerize a whole room of people talking about like manuscript differences between James and then Systematic Theology and the Rembrandt and Rembrandt baseball recruiting class but all changes your view of everything yeah that's cool let's go to hear I have so many great memories for me to class and then attempt to so what got you during your studies into milk is a deck
 I think it was some of those first questions or or thoughts that I was having a thinking about how to tell a kind of changed my thinking of how to approach the text as a text and how to think about it out of the Hebrew Bible related to the New Testament I kind of was on this like little bit of a mission to just figure out some kind of study that I could do that would help me dig into some of those kinds of her money to call contacts in it it wasn't that another figure me out cuz of that was that interesting to me or how many certainly is he's a mysterious and interesting but it was never really motivated by like the cracking the burning like a burning desire to figure out now cuz of that guy still don't know who he was really at work all right now it was more just a kind of wanting a real a test case for how the Hebrew Bible develops in and interprets itself and then how the news
 I kind of picked up on that those trajectories yeah it is an interesting he's a he's an interesting test case because it plays a big role in the New Testament prominent in Hebrews to understand Jesus Melchizedek really really eliminates a lot about Jesus appears in just two places in the Hebrew Bible and even then it's very short treatments why not another random character from what is it about the bigger picture that makes him so prominent valuable that he can in Richmond usually the answer to that is that the other papers is just a very creative interpreter and was doing some kind of crazy things with these couple little obscure Old Testament passages I did a seminar with George Guthrie who's done a lot of work in Hebrews and started thinking about it there and seeing observing that most of the studies
 but then I'm not cuz of that consumed that this was kind of almost kind of the classic case of real creative New Testament interpretation of the Old Testament may be taking things into Direction that's not like Against the Grain by the Old Testament but making way more out of it than any of the earlier biblical authors would have would have had in mind exactly say that's kind of been the main way people think about how Hebrews got we're Hebrews did I think so yeah I think so and I think not really giving credit to the Artistry of the Old Testament itself and the way that the pain of that passage in Genesis in particular is is designed with a lot of sophistication so we tend to not give credit to that and just assume that you know those Hebrew Bible authors are they really know what they were talking about and yeah yeah I mean you can make a really good case that if he was that point of a character he would have been mentioned more than twice
 that's a good point if one of the purposes of the Hebrew Bible was to use him as a type because he got Moses got David and I'm going to get a lot of here and the Hebrews doesn't talk about David at all right okay. Just no kids I sense that the DMV and you're sitting there and somebody asked you and just happens to be interested in the fact that you love the Hebrew Bible and teach her how do you summarize what you were going for in the book for for somebody, but I think I'd say that there's this mysterious figure that shows up in relation to in a story about Abraham Abram at that time and
 but he seems to be just out of nowhere it seems to not really fit into that story and it but what he says and his little part that he plays I'm trying to make a case is important is really fundamental to this the broader story of Abraham and then I think even maybe more specifically that the the fact that he's a priest and a king is maybe his most significant contribution to the message of the pentateuch and bringing those two offices together is a unique thing with him or or at least it's not the main way that we think about either priesthood or kingship and then as you keep going through the pentateuch kind of can't help but see the contrast between this mysterious priest-king guy and Aaron and kind of the classic official priesthood of Exodus and then be on so I think that contrast is a significant part of I think what now cuz of that contributes to our understanding coming out of the Old Testament the Hebrew Bible our understanding of
 dead end expectation of somebody somebody else or some other kind of a lineage that's going to fulfill that trajectory that expectation
 okay so let's dive into where you pierce and let's Concepts that the ground here you are convinced this is all section of chapter is that actually the story right before Abraham and Melchizedek where they even meet and so on but the story at the end of the previous chapter is crucially important for knowing the set up to how every time you can meet them in first place of paint that picture and that story setting is at the end of Genesis chapter in general in Chapter 13 that's where Abraham split their possessions all their things are too much the land can't really handle them so they split in the lot goes towards Sodom and Gomorrah Abraham goes towards Canaan and at the end of that chapter got that look at all this land this is the land that I called you to a couple chapters earlier and walk through the whole thing and look at the whole thing and observe it and and this is the land that I'm going to give to you and your descendants your C
 after you well it it ends then right after God tells him daddy says arise and walk through the full full and right after that it says that Abram moved his tent a little ways and kind of setup can tell there's at least a hint of that he didn't fully obey what God wanted him to do I think of it kind of like at the beginning of you know when he was first called out of this out of the Chaldeans got to leave your family behind and leave everything and go to this land that I called you and it says an Abraham left and lot went with him I think it's at least like a little hint that maybe that wasn't the best yet using pointed that out before super significance and and it's those kind of moments that I've noticed cuz Tim Lapoint little settle things like that before and then make it a deal about it and it's like okay we can make a deal out of that so I'm getting more and more in tune with that I never seen this and that you mention it's like yeah that's really interesting like very explicitly go walk around do the walking tour and then the next thing is he
 can you set up camp and then build an altar what you think Ray is doing an author I mean it it's never he was a totally bad guy he totally missed it and totally just how bad it's it's always kind of this mix is a man of faith and all these positive things but there's I think offering a little bit kind of under the surface hints of an imperfect faced another one where God tells him something very early on goes to Egypt and then the moment he in Lawton the crew show up in Canaan he promptly leased the land when they do there for just a couple of verses and just the first narrative about Abraham in the land after he built an altar is take it all in the land and all this terrible stuff happens cuz he's a deceiver so I don't even this little detail that you're bringing up at the end of his story is a part of the pattern of like kind of getting it right sometimes
 14 + 14 is this big big battle it's kind of like a large-scale battle with Four Kings against 5 2/4 kings that come down from the East they leave this path of destruction in their way and anyway this is big battle and one of the things that ends up happening after Abram goes goes after lot so they they come down to Sodom and Gomorrah that defeat Sodom and Gomorrah in the five King Army that's down there with them and they take lot and they start bringing the bringing the whole crew their Spoils of War kind of a start bringing those back as Abraham hears about it he gets his little household Army of 318 men and goes after them and what it says it says he goes He pursues them all the way to Dan which is always kind of the northern boundary of the territory of the promised land but then it says he pursues them even further north of Damascus to hold on north of Damascus so it seems like the author is kind of going out of his way to say something like they burn didn't fully obey at the end
 chapter 13 but part of what chapter 14 contributes is more full obedience was his Forest walking tour you're paying attention the fact that the narrative unnecessarily repeats three times really specific geographical details about the northern boundary three ways that describes it in you like one would have done so why is the prominence to the northern boundary yep I mean throughout this chapter that the author kind of steps aside several times and makes these little explanatory side comments and they all seem to be significant so the walking tour does happen it happened through his like midnight gorilla read his nephew Abraham is still with this developed
 Cafe vienza obeng the walking tour through the land but in this kind of strange so we've got that setting setting the meeting with nothing today by the way this kind of conversation to someone is coming into the Bible having not heard maybe the way Tim even, Bible she feels like when you guys are really digging for stuff and is this the sailhamer influence that's coming out cuz if I had to explain to someone why this is legitimate conversation is because the Hebrew Bible is so dense and every detail matters so much and this is like we talked about meditation literature like you're supposed to do this you're supposed to like be reading it be raining at me like that's interesting look at this pattern because it does seem a little bit like that's a lot to make out of a new Audi tail
 yeah I agree but but I also agree that the I think the Bible is meant to be read over and over and it's in one sense it simple and the first time we read it we can kind of understand basically what it means but it's not just re-read one time so and I don't think that that's that that point about Abraham having his kind of forced walking to her and obeying because of that I don't think that's really the main message of the store it's not crucial but it did you up with this idea of him needing an intercessor of some sort also the possessions I mean that's a big part of the story they get they get mentioned many times do you know that's why they had to him and I had to split in Chapter 13 and then for King Army from the East they take all the possessions and then it include the dimension of lot and his family and possessions and then that's kind of a just become a significant part of the story the stuff all this stuff and not help set up the contrast between them to fight
 two kings in the story and all cuz of that can the king of Sodom I think Abraham tithes to Melchizedek or give them 10th to mail cuz it back and then insist on giving some of the rest of the spoils Tucson cuz he doesn't want the king of Sodom cuz he doesn't want to have some sort of like obligation to him or something like that so
 there's a focus in The Narrative of how much stuff got stolen and then how much stuff they've room gets back so how does this all fit into the story of Abraham so far what's the deal with the blessing and the land and stuff cuz this is all going to Prime S4 what you're arguing is actually it's all coming together in this milk is it at the moment all the themes so far. Abraham's Story come together I think a lot of it has to do with going back to chapter 12 paper has blessed you know it gets his blessing from God and God says those who treat you poorly I'm going to curse and those who bless you I'm going to buy so that that's kind of a paradigm for much of the rest that happens throughout the Hebrew Bible but in this story it's those enemy kings that you know are just because of their their treatment of like really it's a it's a lot as the point of connection to Abraham otherwise you get the impression that maybe I won't really have any involvement in this story ending battle or in his story at all I'm so because lot is with him
 because that kind of family blessing to a Abram in some ways extends to lot until lot kind of gets the the positive side of the busing along with lots family along with these allies these guys that says Abram is staying with but then also in some ways in directly at least temporarily even Sodom and Gomorrah in the five Army these guys who we already know from chapter 13 that they're not good but I didn't even they end up getting this blessing of the stuff that The Spoils of War they end up probably better off than before this that make battle so I think in that you can see both the defeat of the enemy's what I read is a miraculous victory that God gave that that's what no cuz of that recognizes 318 man army the 318 has who knows exactly what significance it is but it's it's kind of like Gideon's Army if a cyst on the small number compared to Alliance
 Big World War kind of a localized large-scale battle I think maybe that's one of the main contributions coming out of chapter 12 in that blessing for those who who bless you and cursing for those who dishonor you will see kind of a narrative example of that in in this story with with the armies and then yeah milk is that comes in after that and recognizes that God most high whoever that is in a different people think different things about me that is but I take that to be another name for the true God Yahweh so now cuz of that gives gives credit to him and tie. Miraculous victory over these Kings and ties it to God's blessing on Abraham and sees this guy who just gained this incredible Victory and it just says any bless him and said May Abram be blessed by El but God most high the
 creator of skies and land or possessor of skies and Landon take him out to the same thing may God most high be blessed who has delivered your adversaries into your hand so He blesses Abram by Yahweh by God knows her and then he gets a blessing to God most high for delivering Abram so you're convinced this is a short little pond it's like condensing these teams that have already been at work so why is it significant that the narrative wants to highlight what milk is Dixie's happening it's like look his attack is interpreting this whole situation and I really appreciated the way you can start all the things coming together here yeah I mean I think it's the it's the defeat of the enemies I mean he's acknowledging God as the creator of possessor which I think kind of puts that whole theme of possessions that we've been seeing through the whole story come out into contacts and and maybe again may be most significantly it's it's the way that Melchizedek is characterized as
 king of Salem and priest of God most high priest of hell yeah and it's it's the joining together of those two offices and then when he says who has delivered your enemies it into your hands that terminology for deliver it is one of the many links that i c e 2 chapter 15:7 lives kind of moves into the next chapter when I think there's several really kind of I think clear verbal links between now cuz of that can his Blessing and the way that he's introducing that hold it all the passage chapter 14 verses 18 through 20 links I had to chapter 15 so it's not only kind of drawers together some of the themes of him 12 and 13 by that links it had to chapter 15 and that promise to Abraham that that's restated in chapter 15 and kind of comes to a head in the in the first part of 15 where it's the famous passage about Abraham believing in your way and being counted to him or credited to him as righteousness so I think there's a lot of links not only
 that are drawing together things from previously but also looking ahead to chapter 15 and where the Abraham story goes from that point on would you say milk is a deck is actually a supporting character in the developing themes of the Abraham story obviously a bird is Abraham and Sarah's narrative it was a main characters who is supporting role trying to think of different ways to say this you make sense of it for myself but he's he plays an important supporting role and that's what's so surprising is that he seems to come out of nowhere but then he plays this really significant B moment on the stage and then he's gone again but you walk away thinking I think that was really important that I tried not to do was make it carry too much weight I don't I don't want to make it I don't think that it's doing too much I think it's kind of like setting a trajectory of giving kind of a subtle hint of a way that we're supposed to think about who God is and how he
 now he's kind of a part of this promised Abraham but also some other kind of an office or some other kind of a character that's to come that's going to play a part in in what we're supposed to go back to coming from Abraham so so yeah I always want to tell people that I don't I don't know who now cuz of that was his Sum King some Canaanite King but from the standpoint of the way that he's portrayed in the text I think he is an important supporting character and I don't think he starts this trajectory of priest and King being joined together I think as you guys point out in your I mean several different places I think Adam was the first kind of the prototypical priestcain kind of a figure so it's not totally foreign to us as readers when we get to Genesis 14 that there could be a joining of those two offices but Melchizedek I think puts a pretty fine point on that sort of expectation and that somehow it plays at important role in Abraham
 his story and that the future of Abraham story
stomach is wrecked brings out this Feast this meal to Berlin wine be tired tired Warriors bring that bread and wine he says his Blessing and then most English translation say after it actually I think it depends some will supply the word Abram and say and Abram gave to him so it doesn't specify explicitly the subject it she says and he gave to him of everything so you're advocating that it's Abram giving milk is a deck attentive of all of this and what are what are the clues and why would that be significant for what this moment is about what one thing I think there's there's a contrast between how Abraham response to Melchizedek and how he responds to Sodom the king of Sodom and so I think that contrast really works because of it work better if it's Abraham or a brother who's giving the 10th
 so I think maybe the significance of a door or the payoff is where this is a it's clearly a sign of honor is clearly a sign that Abram recognizes this figure as this no cuz of that character as somebody who is worthy of honor and I think maybe even more specifically that from the standpoint of the pentateuch it's a Priestly kind of a thing so he's he's recognizing Melchizedek as a legitimate Priestly figure because later on then the priests would get the tithe so I'm just looking at it here I'm remembering there's a I think there's this large-scale contrast between the king of Sodom who wants all the stuff and the king of Salem who comes out bringing good stuff and so Abram gives to him a tense of everything in the next sentences and the king of Sodom said give to me as contrast where milk is it at kept some of the good stuff because he first brought a gift or as the king of Sodom
 give out and talk to the story that made sense if I know who blesses and then you have the greedy King wants to get two types of kings are born recognizes that and respond very differently to the two of them okay alright so in a sense it's almost an exciting when you just focus on the role that make his attack plays in The Narrative of Abraham helps the seams along cuz that's usually not what people are excited about me but I found your book so helpful cuz you're saying it's clear away the stuff that develops later in the interest of milk is a deck and less versus pay attention to the role that he plays in The Narrative where you a and once you get there you can kind of begin to trace where things go you know after that so let's do that how does the role
 of milk is a deck did a pattern that starts appearing later cuz we meet the priesthood later with the story of Moses and you're convinced there's a big contrast between the priests of Aaron and the priests of Melchizedek and then also Jethro's you think it's really important that time contrast with and give us an angle on that the main priesthood in Hebrew Bible I think when you get to Exodus what we first meet Aaron and the beginning of Exodus Exodus for it's not a great situation so here we have Moses and the burning bush and God is calling him to go down and take a people out of Egypt out of slavery and repeatedly Moses resists and and says well the people are going to believe me and you know how heavy of speech and up talking and I'm not articulate and has all these excuses and it's one thing after another and God gives concessions God gives way is to kind of bolster the people's faith and really I think it's under the surface it's ways to bolster Moses's Faith, Nate's in God has
 answered every one of Moses's objections and it culminates with Moses just kind of blurting out you know I'm not going to do it he's Patriarchs not be one of the best life I forgot this was the example I think I was remembering earlier that you pointed out when we're talkin through this but then after that when Moses and Aaron go do the thing got told to do they don't do exactly what God told me that it is in our podcast section was super helpful for me and understanding those first narratives where are in a and you're right it's weird it is weird right yeah and I feel bad for like throwing shade
 Mosaic Moses and then when you get to David you know these there's no like purely good guys in the end Revival yeah so Moses I think he doesn't come off looking great in this story but it's in that context where then after he finally gives us last like no I refuse to go where it says that the narrator tells us that the anger of the Lord was kindled and Jewish interpreters rabbis they they noticed that and they say that doesn't ever happen unless there's a consequence afterwards and so what comes immediately afterwards it says the anger of the Lord was kindled and then God said Aaron your brother can can come help you feel so I see that not necessarily as a consequence like as a punishment but as at least a concession that Aaron Aaron's entrance to the story is I don't think men can be seen as the ideal splitting the Priestly roll from the leader was not the ideal the priesthood what
 gone through Moses if it wasn't for his lack of faith in our scenario I don't know about that use the milk is a deck kind of school that the depriest king example of the motif of the the brothers The Sibling rival in the theme for one brother is supposed to have the honour but the other one gets it and it caught and there's anger I mean for sure it's there's a Cain and Abel motifs thought of that says if God was going to favor the younger brother but then the younger brother was so unbelievably one day he Revival okay so the contrast then is we know about milk when we have this category priest so far
 and it's King by the way and then the next is right for you know the first this right because you're going to meet is all this weird unfortunate circumstance and again you got to dig for it hey and dear reader as you say temp reader and this was a bummer you know it happened this way master I was he would just stop and just make you think through the story again and just think through God gets angry at five times and then he gets angry at you that's a significant moment in the story here and then what happens next for me once I start to look sideways at Aaron and his role in the story it seems to come out all over the place so like you're saying those encounters with Pharaoh they're they're not exactly how God wanted it to go and it certainly with the golden calf incident Aaron's the one who
 is instrumental in that Nike Monumental failure of idolatry and you got his son's doing weird things and then he license after that the priesthood is never the security deposit at the pattern and she's okay now something you and I did not talk about but the crucial in your kind of development is that the compromise priesthood of Aaron and his sons is being contrasted with milk is attacked that was awhile ago. There's another nearer priest that Erin is contrasted with that connects back to the story of Jethro Jethro in the understanding everything I think it helps
like I said if all we had was no cuz of that guy's this kind of you know this is what the priest-kings should be like this is what Chris said should be then I think we could see Aaron and and see the negative light that he is portrayed in and thank all that's different than now cuz of that, Jethro comes on the scene within in the middle of all the Aaron stuff which chapter is 18% reduced in Exodus 3 and 4 but Exodus 18 is is really where he moment I'm stay out of Egypt defeated the amalekites in arrive at Sinai he's introduced as a priest of Midian so he's a he's a priest but he gives some of the most elevated Praise of God and He blesses he gives his blessing to God just like milk is exact same kind of language and he brings out bread or after Moses and the Israelites to feed the amalekites which immediately after so there's a law
 kind of patterns within the story so that later right then and then they go through the desert and they get the man in the Water by the amalekites they're attacked and God delivers them for our enemies in the miraculous Victory miraculous miraculous victory over the amalekites so immediately before this kind of smokey fiery theophany which is what happens in Genesis 15 right after the milk is it a cup of soda and then also exit after The Exodus to the Sea tracks The Narrative sequence also a babraham narrative and in the mail slot for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs so there's about Jethro himself you know he's a priest and he's a Canaanite not a Canaanite but it non-israelite priest midianite priest and he
 turn izes Yahweh give him all the credit for delivering Moses and the Israelites out of out of Egypt he offers burnt offerings and sacrifices and so he acts like a priest can I read Play song is really great and really Exodus 18 verse 10 from the hand of the Egyptians I didn't realized I never put this together until you mentioned in the book that's exactly what let's be always who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians from the hand of pharaoh who delivered the people you and the people now I know that you always greater than all other Elohim that was proven when they don't probably against these people he's confessing our way different than the detail of life was he worshiping many gods that happens to also worship shot of Abraham which is where you're getting here yeah you don't get that with no cuz back do you know that Priests of l l u l a
 Abram cause y'all waited that same title so it seems to seems like at least the author and Abraham are trying to confirm that this is a whether he worships other gods to or not we don't know but it's at least trying to highlight that he who worship the true God knew and that statement that Jethro makes now I know that you always is greater that's a combination of this important team I think in The Exodus narrative so repeatedly through those narratives it's God says I'm going to I'm going to make my name now and I'm going to Israel Moses to Nations around the result of the plagues and The Exodus they will know they will be on my way and so I think that's an important statement in Moses use as leverage later
 why is he recognizes Yahweh more clearly than anyone else so again from early in the accidents stories and the reason they were supposed to go out of Egypt was so they could go worship Yahweh in the wilderness and and Jethro kind of realizes that we never see Moses or the Israelites recognizing your way with this this Clarity and the connections to Melchizedek not just that he's a priest but all those kind of patterns that combined the two stories I think at least for me what the case that I tried to make is that this kind of shows that it wasn't just now cuz of that back and then that's it and he's fine he's forever going to be in in our memory as that wonderful priest king that we help comes back Sunday or something like that it's that there is kind of this line of expectation that that goes forward from doctors vac that Jethro then continues its subtle it's under the surface so don't want to again don't want to make too much of it but I think it's there and I think it's intentional
 what's the Jethro Story doing that fits the pattern to bless y'all way it's almost like they seem to understand and see God's hand at work better than the Israelites who they're talking to and then what's crazy is Jethro then helps Moses like to give them wisdom to govern the people govern the people to create like to create more you know righteousness of the people Justice which you know like is the king kind of priest roll like he's kind of like he came out of his fatherly Figure Head yeah yeah to delegate it's in and it's kind of like leadership and administering Justice is something that a lot of people are involved in it's not just the individual mediating and
 in the delegates at 2 which is the whole image of God theme of Jethro + 19 + 19 is where you can you see that that I deal is for it to be a kingdom of priests and you know it quickly becomes a kingdom with pre-sorted are a nation with priest instead of a fully Priestly kind of identity and then Jethro known by a different name is the first person that they made when they leave Sinai in a Tanto Ana bracketing all Sinai narrative yeah sometimes he's called hobab sometimes he's called Ruel that he when they leave after they leave they called Moses father-in-law and Moses says go with us we need your help to kind of guide us through the Wilderness and so they they have this little discussion there but I think it seems to be the case is dropped into the texts kind of bracketing and I will check again just signals to me that he's important one way or another he's at 4 and I think at least some of that importance is that connection back to milk his attack
 raises an interesting question of why I didn't author of the Hebrews latched onto Jethro Tull because it also the Jethro he's an important leader but he wasn't a king of three Israelites are so of this bigger pattern of holding up these non-israelite these rolls it's almost more than their person it's the role of this priest leader Royal figure who brings God's wisdom to bless us God and who sees what God's doing and his often more than even God's Own people and them because he's priest-king Jerusalem that's what makes him a lightning rod in Hebrews I guess is that how you would maybe articulate yeah yeah I think so and like you said John I think someone 10 makes a significant contribution of drawers together
 those readings of Genesis 14 and ties That with David and all this kind of captured in the in the davidic promise of kingship and all that kind of gets drawn together in a concise and really confusing why in some ways it's almost then it's a dense, but it I think it's a brief poetic recollection of Genesis 14 some of those Victory themes of God's victory over the enemies and crushing the heads of whoever these people are but I think there's a lot of things that kind of come together in some 110 that help I mean those really in a lot of ways I think there was a give the basis for Hebrews to come back and some pain. Going to pick up on that trajectory. I think we can't understand what the author of Hebrews is doing without someone 10 but I think we can't understand what someone is doing without Genesis 14 and often I think but I noticed that people would either say that the Hebrews is being totally creative and making up all this stuff about Melchizedek
 that the song best was making up all this. And I'm kind of making the case that the psalmist is reading Genesis carefully Indiana to carefully and then the author Bieber is
 what I can I hear coming out and all this so tell me if I'm making too much of this I think the Paradigm I kind of came into reading the Bible was the way God set this all up with the priest and everything like this was this was the golden ideal and if that could have just worked then everything would have been great but instead of this picture of God creates Humanity as the priest-king Adam Adam and that goes south and then when he gives this blessing to Abram he should be hoping for the renewed Adam but then you just get all these little bits of the little cracks Creek I could cut and and and that crap will continue all the way down to the Exile we should do and then you get these little hints of even how the priesthood is established all this kind of stuff and it's kind of not so easy to see
 but then these two characters come in as kind of like these shining examples of like this is what should have been should have been like Humanity being the priest and the king with wisdom and this is the thing that we really need more watch the story continue but this is the thing that I was hoping for and then you get then Psalm 110 reflecting on that and saying wow it's not amazing that like there's going to be this new from the line of David David which wasn't the Priestly line is good I think I mean I think I know a lot of ways what the Hebrew Bible is doing is over and over showing those cracks showing the problems with the priesthood and with Kings and with the temple and there's always these problems that kind of are on the surface and I think what milk is that contributes and kind of everything that's captured and who he is but the connection with Jerusalem and I think what it does is it keeps her my
 hey even though this is all like not going so well we've got something to calm you got this ideal to remind us that there's something better ahead that all the ways the priesthood is failing and kingship is failing that's not how it's supposed to be but there's something there to remind us of how it is supposed to be in in some 110 really again draws a lot of them together that's how I see it yeah so somehow we get from that roll of milk is a deck but then much later in the second temple. Hundreds of years Israelites were meditating on these texts and you give the crew the prettiest is the Dead Sea Scrolls were they bunch of Scrolls Dance of the Dead Sea and the way they talked about milk is a deck was like he was a Angelic Divine figure appointed by God to judge the unrighteous at the end of days this is 11 Q of milk is a deck
 Judaism but what's your take on how the figure that we spent a lot of time talking about how the figure revolves kind of in the Israelite imagination into Heavenly Deliverance figure yeah that's I mean it's a tough one I didn't go into a lot of detail on that but definitely tried to see what qumran with what that interpretation was representing and see that as evidence that there's something more to the Genesis story than then maybe it seems at first until I think it for me it's probably things like his kind of just mysterious out of nowhere appearance it's the the bring it to the unique bringing together a priest and King it's the miraculous victory that he's associated with Aunt defeat of wicked wicked King all of that for me would contribute to an explanation for how they started to see him as kind of this exalted having they kind of figure wondered if there isn't also cuz just a few chapters
 Abram meet another surprising kind of figure with the angels now weigh in the Angels appeared I'm at the tent that's why I wondered if there wasn't you know some Israelite readers were picking up Mexicans and wondering on the kids attack must mean he's one of those you know cuz he is so he comes out of nowhere but I think the things you mentioned plus that little connection are the main two details that I think would spark that interested I hear a lot of people say you know when they know that I did stuff on there cuz of that they say what was he reincarnate Jesus ER or like Angelica. It's I think there's just this kind of sense of his mysteriousness and I think there's more to it than that that would explain the Dead Sea Scrolls but that's part of it. I think it's just his mysterious nature seemed so important to such a lack of detail just right. Let's figure this out there's got to be more of the same way and they wrote
 is desease Scrolls or not but yeah that's a good point that Book of Enoch was really popular thing to do is take these characters of seemed really important for The Sandlot detail and let's like and run with it yeah yeah and I think there are other things I mean there are one of the things that gets kind of more into the nerdy Wade's of what I worked on his some of the verbal links that I think embed this now cuz of that story Into the poems of the pentateuch to Genesis 49 and numbers 24 and Deuteronomy 32 and 33 which all are framed as these future and X kind of eschatological poems about what's going to happen in the distant future those all kind of have it this King in view also and there's ways that I think these are more subtle you have to kind of by the initial part of the argument to to go down that road but I'm convinced that there's some signals that the author has given
 we're supposed to think of this little Nook has a text to Lori in connection with those future expectations of it coming if some of those early interpreters Where She Went seen those details that would explain some of their interpretations to so would you say example of that would be if somebody sees milk is a deck at the narrative image of this developing portraits route Hebrew Bible of them coming Messianic deliver figure like this on demand and then it would make sense why some Israelites would think that this not a man like of Daniel chapter 7 could be called because it's all a part of this Mosaic bright developing of the Deliverance figures just a king K night King and then he was put in the slot going to help you understand this idea or was he the pre incarnate Christ or some Angelic being
 it's like we don't know but either way that's the slot and the reason why you're asking that question is because you're reading the story in the way it was designed to be there at like is this the little reckless like maybe one little piece of a quilt and the bigger quilt is this Messianic deliver figure that emerges from the Revival but then going back and reading each quilt individual contribution in light of that and so that seems to be what some Israelites were doing and yeah and so he can capitalize on milk is attacks Prestige this point in history and then this came out was our conversation with Amy peeler she Drew attention to this and the way I've never thought about that Jesus is like milk is attacked he actually says Zach is like Jesus all of a sudden that pop for me in a new way which is kind of what you're saying
 image of this bigger what kind of a deliver figure in the Hebrew Bible one piece of the quilt that's helpful to me there are a lot of different things that contribute to that and another one is the branch and another key text that kind of brings the stuff together as in Zechariah you've got another it's a night vision and it's about Joshua who's the high priest in Zechariah who's crown with a crown and a the king who is associated with peace and righteousness and then he's called the branch which picks up of prophetic language of Messiah so yeah I think it's at different times you see some of those individual pieces of the quilt or the language of of that Messianic image overlap with each other and I think now cuz of that kind of sucks that up and took some key ways along with a lot of other parts of that quilt and yeah massive quilt thank you a bunch of trails but I really appreciated your contribution the way you brought
 things together is really helpful for me as we as we've prepared for these conversations in the OB part of the video series on the royal priesthood I'll look forward to that I've enjoyed the series and it's been fun talking with you guys
