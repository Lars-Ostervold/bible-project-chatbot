the Bible is both human and divine its collection of literature produced through humans human words down an edited by ancient human authors but it's also to find those words were breathed out by God himself through them the Bible is the unified story and that story is also about a human and divine partnership how God appointed humans to be his image to rule the world on his behalf but the problem is that we're unable to choose God's wisdom we are unable to rule and got solution to this problem is the most important theme in the story of the Bible how God will raise up from Among Us and appoint a human who will show us what it means to be the image of God cuz my side of the category that comes from the Hebrew Bible itself and the story is building up this crisis in the sneeze
 for someone to come and do something one of the titles for that figure is needed is the human where the Messiah and then if I'm follower of Jesus Messiah of course my confession to face this is the I believe Jesus is that one Jesus famously said that the Hebrew Bible is all about him about his sacrifice for us about the salvation we can find through him the whole story every story every pound every word it's all about him I have come over the years whatever struggles that I might have in seeing the story Jesus says in the Old Testament I've come to the place where if I don't understand how a book of the Bible is some how about that the problem is for sure me I'm not asking the right questions I don't know what to look for it yet when I'm looking at XYZ book in the Hebrew Bible and once I know what the right questions are then I'll I'll see how it fits into this thing so what is the story of the Bible about
 I think it's about me but it's not it's about the Messiah and yet we're called to become one with the Messiah so that his life would become our life and his victory our Victory Bible is not about me the Bible is about the Messiah and therefore it's about us which as my personal implications that doesn't it's not private it's not about me it's about us and who we are in the world together because of what the story of Messiah song about I'm drunk calling from Bible project and today I talked with Tim Mackie and Chris and queen about the third pillar of our Paradigm the Bible is Messianic literature thanks for joining us here we go
all right we're walking through our mission statement that the Bible is Unified story that leads to Jesus and talking about how that's a paradigm for reading the Bible that we really want to unpack and where I'm packing it slowly and actually seven different attributes of this Paradigm we've been the first to which is at the Bible is both human and divine and the secondly that the Bible is Unified literature this third attribute is about how the Bible is Messianic literature big fancy word that you don't use everyday unless you're a Bible scholar supposed but we're going to we're going to get at it and with me is Tim and krissia hey guys hello to Tim you want to lead us through what do you mean what do we mean that the Bible is Messianic literature we spent the last few episodes talking about what we mean when we say the Bible is Unified Moritz a collection of diverse literature but that is Unified and one of the ways that we said it's unified that we spelled out a little bit in the
 to conversations last podcast episode was that there's a governing story that unifies it's being told from beginning to end not always straightforward linear way sometimes the story will pause a double back and recover parts of a letter go back and focus in on certain things there's a basic governing Story season 1 video that we made cuz the first word Genesis are in the beginning and then in the second to last paragraph of the Revelation The Narrative ends the saying and they rained forever and ever referring back to the image of God on page one which is God bless them and appointed them to rain let the rain so there's a governing story and that governing story is what we're referring to in this point we're just going to focus in on the unified storyline of the Bible which is what we're calling Messianic the story is Messianic it's a story about the Messiah
 there's not a lot of things right but what is it mainly about what does it mean lie about here it just raises the bigger question of what is the Bible about which will give us really significant guiding lines as to what it's for and what you do with it so back to our kind of three unhelpful approaches or paradigms a reading the Bible it's the theology dictionary and organized as such before I read it as a dictionary 1904 Paradigm another the moral hand book I read as such or the theology or know the spiritual grab-bag ocean we'll grab a cab back so each of those assumes an approach to the Bible based on what it is and so what we're saying here is that what it is is a unified story that you could say is about the Messiah but that is self forces ask like what what does that mean so that means we'd read it in a different way than we would if it were a moral handbook and what have a different impact on us it's a simple
 but I think of massive implications to one of those kinds of things but the Messiah is well maybe we have to get into it to answer this question but I'm just curious why you would say it is the most important part of the story is with the story is all about you could say the story is All About God willing there through humans you could say the stories about Messianic that is the definition of the story of the Bible and all of its main themes come to their fulfillment in Jesus's life death and resurrection and the gift of the spirit. Every time we write a theme video we isolate kind of one kind of interesting Motif going on in the story The Bible and we Trace that and every single time it comes to this climax in Jesus whatever reason Jesus is like this gravity. Everything is like Russia.
 and and then threw his life you see the theme come to some sort of fulfillment and then in his death and Resurrection even more so and then through the life of people follow him so what does something like gravity to him and that's what you mean by Messianic so a couple simple places to turn to come start this conversation are you could ask question this way why should anybody care about a collection of ancient Jewish literature what does that have to do with anything obvious to anyone why you should care about the Bible why should care about it more than you care about Egyptian word Christian which is a English word good price follower spelling a Greek word that is the Greek word for messiah
 translation of the Hebrew word machine which is the word Messiah so even if I'm a Christian means I'm a messiah person beside a person and why would I care about the Hebrew scriptures well I'm the worst huge significance and importance to the person I think it's the Messiah Jesus of Nazareth so there's a story about Jesus from the end of the Gospel of Luke Luke chapter 24 and sweaty stories where Jesus appears surprisingly to his followers after he's risen from the dead and I freaked out I think he's a ghost at first and then he's like I'm so hungry hungry right now took it out of me the dead so hungry so what is 3444 these are the words that I was speaking to you while I was still with you all the things written about me and the tour of Moses in the prophets and in the Psalms know just
 3-part shape to the scriptures on the mine on his mind all of it was written about me in the Tanakh towards process writing had to be fulfilled had to come to its fullness it's as if Jesus read the Hebrew scriptures as something that forms like an empty container is the story that creates an emptiness that must be sold. Or the prophets had to be filled full and what he says it's about me sweetie just send all the things written about me in the Torah prophets and then that's similar to what he says on the mount right where he says cuz people were worried like hey are you teaching something beyond the tour of the profits or you dismissing the tour of the profits and he's like no I've come to fill them full same word still up so what happens in this story after he says that Luke tells us that then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures
 and he said to them this is what's written so it's not so great cuz it's in one sentence that's a long one long sentence but it's in one sentence just a summary of what the Hebrew Bible is about and he is what he says this is what is written that the Messiah would suffer would rise again from the dead on the third day and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations beginning from Jerusalem this is DSS summary of what the Torah prophets and writings are about than this sentence not aware that a problem. This is BS is shorthand summary Jesus says it is written he doesn't mean like go and you can find this written somewhere he means it's about this is what the whole story is about what it's about but you're right the pay attention to the same little phrase that's it is written or so it's written is often a quotation formula to Marcus Pacific sentence
 the price quoted to make it in his words very authoritative like the same way that you were quoting from the Hebrew Bible would be authoritative you saying this is what it's all about connecting with what he said earlier it's about me and then here he says it's about the Messiah so yeah maybe we should do a session on the word Messiah what that implies what that means but it's about a figure who would go into death and suffering and then come out of death and suffering and that's somehow that would release or open up something that's really good news for other people here that it's about the announcement that the all of the failures of humanity are forgiven and that that message will be announced to all the nations starting in Jerusalem at the summer for years I would sit with us and be like man you know when I tried to read some part of the Old Testament I just have a hard time seeing that
 stop the summer I would give after my first few years of trying to read the Old Testament so how did Jesus get there you how did Jesus get there yet it's almost like causes an amount of trust you when you read this out of Jesus's mouth and he saying this is what it's all about like okay I'm going to make that my underlying assumption now reading sympathetically with Jesus the Old Testament when I can't say that I should be asking the question how is this book of the Bible fitting into the story of your suffering Messiah who will rise from the dead and offer forgiveness of sins to All Nations to and that's not an easy question to answer and every text that you read it in the Hebrew Bible I remember vividly I'd spend Krishna few years trying to breed the Bible like to figure out how it all works having a hard time but I do remember I was attending a church at the time and I remember one particular Bible teacher at this church
 and he had a really win some way of preaching from the Old Testament and I and I didn't call my categories are being formed like I didn't know and what I could notice was that he would take a stores in the Old Testament and then he was abstracted abstract kind of like a moral lesson and then the person who would get put into the slot of the main character was he would invite you The Listener to see yourself as what the story is about so it's a story about Isaac and about you and he's digging wells in the Philistines don't like him cuz he's finding Wells everywhere but he's God's chosen one who wants to provide Wells for him even in a difficult season and so you dear listener or reader are like Isaac God wants to bless you and give you well the water in the wilderness when all your enemies are against you but the technique was for you to see Isaac in this case or any given story but actually I remember it really specific sermon
 Genesis 26 on Isaac you see them as like a model for yourself in the world and so what I can do is then look at my my circumstances and see that the story is ultimately he don't like a model for me and my circumstances and that's not totally wrong but there's something about making each story about me and my spiritual journey that I think is actually really different than what Jesus is trying to tell us about what all the stories in the Torah prophets and writings are about he says they're about him and in their being about him that will implicate me and speak to me in a very important way but I think about is it about me about the Messiah but by being about the Messiah and we'll talk more about this but that doesn't mean that it is about us it's about me because it's about the Messiah right there's like a process of interpretation
 you're just like Isaac to model for me then you started this more lies all of the stories versus seeing how their patterns towards the need of a messiah yeah which then implicates me reason why the moral handbook approach especially the Old Testament biblical narrative only works part of the time is when difficult characters are portrayed positively and they're doing good and they are the models of positive behavior problem is those same characters David slaying the exactly the same characters are just as often not just portrayed as having like flaws and I'm flawed too but it's like being really horrible people and said it raised the question of like but I'm not supposed to be like that you know and then it kind of makes it feel like when I don't supposed to be like David anyway I mean it just sucks and so maybe that's the wrong question the whole question
 yes what is David story point to what is it tell me about what humans are like and about a humans are to be God's Partners in the world that's that assumes all things we should talk about what kind of human are we going to need will probably not someone like that probably someone like that and it's just a different orientation point and maybe I didn't think this through super thoroughly before raising a but it's just brought Clarity to me along the way the fundamental point of is the Bible about me and that's why I read it where is the Bible about the Messiah and therefore it's about me because it's about the Messiah yeah but speaks to me because it's about the Messiah and those are different starting point
 let's make this break concrete or talking very abstracted in what way is David about the Messiah okay actually. So yeah I'm a trespasser because the way the David about Messiah is the same way that the story of Moses when the story of Abraham or the story of Noah or Seth and Cain and Abel it's the same question how are any of those about the Messiah because that is what Jesus is saying the whole things about me and we could take any character of David's a good one for we do David and say what is the fundamental story about that would help you see how any of these characters is a story about the Messiah that make any sense yes although we just had the fun of my life story is about the Messiah suffering and dying
 that someone could arrive at that conclusion maybe we can Mike reverse-engineer something like yeah I think saying that the Bible is about Jesus could be difficult on the one hand because we're thinking no actually isn't it about David or Cain and Abel or Adam and Eve or myself like that's the one side but the other side of thing the Bible is about Jesus could be maybe an error we could make when we think that is that we to quickly say everything is about Jesus without Ryland process I don't drive that more about Lego with the Passover Lamb reading that story outside of the ancient Israelite context to just be about the person Jesus and that the authors were right about Jesus and they knew it and this is why they said it this way so maybe we can distinguish from that I would make a distinction between saying it's about Jesus and saying it's about the Messiah
 is Messiah is a category that comes from the Hebrew Bible itself and the storage building up this crisis in this needed for someone to come and do something and that someone is one of the titles for that figure whose needed is a massage is the Hebrew word Messiah and then if I'm a follower of Jesus Messiah of course My Confession of faith is the I believe Jesus is that one to me as an important little difference to stay looking for the Messiah in the old testament's a little bit different than looking for Jesus even though I do believe Jesus is Tampa from a list, and may be helpful even to think about how that portrait of the Messiah develops throughout the story so if it starts as a there's a need for a true human or Humanity to rule with God and then as that story develops becomes more and more specific did this is a certain kind of person not that kind of person it's this kind of person
 south of this kind of person becomes more specific yeah that's exactly right so the basic Dynamic of the story is that it generates expectation that becomes Future Hope based on the just the sheer momentum created by the plot crisis of the biblical story so it begins by saying God's purpose God's purpose is to rule the world through this human images male and female fruitful and multiply happy people and birds and animals and Gardens is the Eden ideal that that does seem kind of human-centric you know like you got is what I way to say like hey send me the Bible and just try to see us in it and I've also been told throughout the years is like hey this with my was not about you for the Bible about God God
 which is what the Bible say about God appoints humans rule and then you're like the story seems like a lot about the human want to do humans got to rescue or right at the center of the story it's also okay so the first title given to humans other than the word I dumb people are the time you mad at me is image image representatives of the word means representation yes one who represents another it also is the word for idle statue it's the same word as Statue that's right physical representation of a deity so even though the word image is different than the word Messiah that actually mean roughly the same thing as our appointed as God's Representatives May Fail
 Trey and fell so then the opportunities passed on to the next Generation Another Story murder failure next-generation keeps down down down down so things get so bad that there is a lot of violence spreading on the lands chances for Genesis 6 so God allows the cosmos to collapse back in on itself through the flood the waters quite be late again come back together but he takes one representative and then a few others with that representative Noah those with Noah and he delivers that one through the waters of death up to a high place where he offers to sacrifice on behalf of Creation Garden plant garden and The Story begins to cycle because then he fails to replace the failure of Adam and Eve and the cycle begins repeating and so each time you go through the cycle of a human setup
 to be the image be the image and failure creating chaos and violence there's a collapse of order and out of that collapse is a Remnant were chosen one is delivered through and then God starts over with them often through Waters or through a deathly experience like water swept through the scattering for the dissolution of Babylon in which is an exile of sorts which is like it's not a flood that's right through the Reign of Fire that comes on Sodom and Gomorrah it rains just like in the flood that it rained fire instead of water these are all decreation moment to collapse in on itself because of the evil and violence of human beings and so that story set on repeat. So either he Revival starts to train your mind
 think about the world in a certain way so what emerges from the story is all of these Representatives figures sometimes given various names Noah Abraham Jacob Joseph Moses but then sometimes they're given titles and when you get into the heart of the Torah in Exodus Leviticus and numbers that representative figure is as Israel's high priest has called for the first time that you were viable demisha and Hebrew music through the whole process of anointing the priest is what is an image of a representative figure of all of Israel yeah represents Israel before God so represents of a whole group of humans in front of God this figure is a both Priestley and Royal they weren't Crowley where Golden Crown they have all the jewels that have written the tribes of the families of his
 and the Tabernacle in Temple that the high priest goes in and out of is all designed as the symbolic Ethan it's a return back into Eden to offer interception in sacrifice before God for the failures of people so they're acting out what all humanity is supposed to be doing so high priest walking into the Tabernacle carrying the blood of a sacrifice to animal going in offering sprinkling that blood symbolically seven times before God as an offer of complete surrender in the author of a life than the high priest emerges out alive from the 10th and then announces God's blessing on the people once a year on the day of atonement it's a massage that like you're surprised they're alive well yeah yeah I was just taken symbolically every Israelite failure over the I'm talking about the day of atonement
 of the whole Torah and he goes in and it's like every time Moshe cursed his neighbor everytime Esther's like short change somebody at the market and every failure every failures whole people group gets symbolically placed upon the high priest carries the blood of a surrender an animal life into the tent and determine the high Priestly clothing chapter in Exodus it says you put little metal pomegranate bells on the hems so that he won't die it's as if there needs to be a little noise you can hear him walking around cuz the moment you hear those bells stop ringing who helped him do it wrong that was wrong and to the hope they go to the holy space carrying all of the failures failures of Israel on behalf of the people
 it's died in the plane of the people and that blood sprinkles and then the priest emerges out before everybody and we like he's got accepted the surrender and then priest blesses people during that and then remembering what you said about what you just heard about Jesus in Luke 24 that the Messiah was like we're thinking about the priests will Proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins that would have been a foreign concept and even entering into death and then emerging out of death alive and that's how they would have thought about that ritual is being summarized in the symbolic form here by Jesus in the end of Luke 24 and the day of atonement what the high priest is doing is a ritual practice that is also being played out and all these narratives about Noah and the flood or Moses being up on me
 Anna and offering his life for the sins of the people down below because they're worshipping an image instead of being the image of God it's not just one story it's not just high priest has all these narratives working together and creating a pattern of death through the waters or through suffering life out the other side the other figures name it messiah in Hebrew Bible are Israel's Kings and specifically David and then his his lineage because they are all so anointed to represent the people before God which is kind of work traditionally in an image was right was the king of of a Nation similar concept like a neighboring civilization would call the king me image of God
 scholar who at the liberating image Richard Middleton Middleton amazing book on the image of God in the Hebrew Bible called the liberating image bi surveys Egyptian Assyrian and Babylonian cultures booking for this vocabulary the image and its you specifically to describe the King's new of these nations every one has ever given is a king and a queen but then they want to King yeah Israel wants a king God bless and have a kiss like they want an image of God instead of guy campus and so also they want a single King to image God to them instead of taking on the responsibility as whole new so the selection of a mushy off in one person as a king ant up being a failure story the story of Saul the David arises and David's whole story is like constantly going in and out of death and trusting the God will raise him from the dead
 out of all of these terrible scenarios and then ultimately got promises that he would raise up a future seed from his line who will build a temple that connects God and his people in heaven and earth and that that King will reign forever and ever 2nd Samuel chapter 7 so that's it for sure another passage and character and theme it's on Jesus is mine here so I have come over the years whatever struggles that I might have in seeing the story Jesus says in the Old Testament that I've come to the place where if I don't understand how a book of the Bible is some how about that the problem is for sure me and the I'm not asking the right questions I don't know what to look for it yet when I'm looking at XYZ book in the Hebrew Bible and once I know what the right questions are then I'll I'll see how it fits into this thing
what kind of questions would you ask but that might just be helpful to keep in mind as people are reading for me it's been about discovering how the Eden story is actually on recycled throughout the whole rest of the Hebrew Bible and so every later book and story and steam is somehow all connected back to the story of the image of God sailing and eating and so like song songs for example it's a story about the seed of David and Lady wisdom being reunited and that's the image of the reunions of Adam and Eve as the new Humanity in in the garden and you can follow the links to the song Solomon's and it goes back through the story of Solomon connected to the Garden of Eden story but it's about the reunions of humans with God's wisdom to be his lovers and co-rulers in the garden and so if it's so funny that was the that was the book I was going to ask about like you're like there's still time for you get
 my house is about a scientist I need the Brilliance of the song of songs is its ability to communicate on multiple levels at once or a love story between humanity and God Temple imagery and Solomon book a number of times after the king its associated with the King question you're saying is when you read something you ask or a helpful question to ask is how does this relate to the Garden story themes and he repeated words are patterns that come out of that and how later stories after the garden story are reused in like Song of Songs could you see the temple teams they're not just the garden story told to not every book of the Hebrew Bible has to be about the whole debacle story but it means that every book in the Hebrew Bible is picking up some Core theme
 of the metis story and riffing on it filling it out developing or focusing on it and so in that case Song of Songs as he's focusing in on the reunions of humanity with Divine wisdom by telling a story about a man and a woman with meth on the Adam and Eve but even Adam and Eve get develop his characters in The Book of Proverbs as the seed of David and Lady wisdom and so on and so does this Messianic literature for reading Song of Songs is Messianic literature by our definition the story of the Bible or the story of Song of Songs maybe and all of its main themes come to their fulfillment in Jesus's life death and Resurrection so you'd see this the story of humanity being reunited with God as a part of the story of that supposed to build in Jesus Mary being reflected God's wisdom and Genesis to are just us three Humanity decides not to eat
 tree of life and use their own wisdom and that's like the first mega failure story right so this is kind of theme of like abandoning God's wisdom for something else that's right that's what the story of the tree is all about misguided quest for wisdom and so how does the Messiah reconnect us to God's wisdom and that's comes in a film it was Jesus the gospels but then also giving us a framework to think about Jesus's relationship to the spirit Spirit of wisdom and then there for my relationship to the spirit that the spirit can give God's wisdom to the followers of Jesus which is like a reunions of atom with Lady wisdom it turns out that I am an atom has the word out of meats humans it is about me
 Yahweh the Bible is about me cuz it's about a dumb Humanity but it's about me because what the story is trying to do is create the need for a kind of human food won't fail the way all of the characters keep failing and so it's a different way of thinking about how the Hebrew Bible points forward then maybe more typical ways of thinking about the Old Testament is predictive prophecy the prophecy of prediction and then Jesus did this thing in the not fulfilled it and that proves that he's the Messiah but if you look at how the old New Testament authors from the Hebrew Bible their say Jesus fulfills that that model doesn't work for all the cases but this forward momentum model I think accounts for a lot better there's a portrait I come to expect a certain kind of a person who will bring about the rescue of all Humanity
 it's one that I member from a few years ago John struck you and I and Dick what the Moses story golden calf story but the story about where God uses people going to bring them into the Eden land and on the way reveals himself to them outside and Isis hit don't make any images because y'all are the image that is the kingdom of priests but what they do is make the golden calf and so Moses goes up to intercede on behalf of the people and God says leave me alone gives me rest uses know his name as a verb give me know I'm going to destroy the people and then Moses precedes to not believe God alone and he starts interceding and then it says God relented. Change course and forgives the people and you know that's a famous story for raising theological debates about change but what's interesting about the story and is a striking me I guess in a new way is if being God
 image is representing God there is this like the sense of we are interceding right that's our purpose for interceding on behalf of God creation and so Moses going up and saying God I'm not I'm going to stand up for Humanity he's being the image of God you're doing it but yeah actually what Moses assumes is that he's going to have to dye it says listen I just took me like these people have done a really terrible thing and that's worthy of it active just just us so take me out instead of them is a blot out my name for their sin and what God does he has both forgive the people that he doesn't require Moses life in that case but Moses is intercession a successful so is this a good example of like if the Bible was a theology dictionary and if that story is about to start
 resolve the puzzle all the story that says raise this crisis of humans fail they're worthy of God's justice but someone steps in and intercedes and God shows mercy and then that person is this image of the image of God as he comes down the mountain glowing like we'll look at this person so closely connected to God they're glowing like this human is getting it and doing it and modeled on that pattern book of Isaiah begins with a whole accusation about Israel's failing to live by the terms of the Covenant just like the people during Moses time yeah and so then hold in many parts of the book could especially the opening chapters that works out how God's going to bring judgment on Jerusalem in Israel for what they've done in the form of Assyria and then Babylon
 so just like you said to Moses leave me alone let me destroy them and so low and behold Moses was called the servant of the Lord in that story in Exodus and so and Isaiah the raises up this portrait of a figure has never named just called the servant who comes then to offer his own life come before God and offered his own life for the failures of the people and this figure it's like the high priest but it's also like Moses but it's never named and it's held out as something that needs to happen and so that is precisely the role that Jesus is presented as feeling it when you come to the gospels John the Baptist comes on the scene saying yeah the axe is at the root of the tree you guys like the day of the Lord is coming and Jesus Takes that that the creation moment it's the D creation of Israel in that Melody you're talking about his failure failure decreases it, and then a Remnant are a chosen one will be pulled out to bring
 Christian anointed representative steps in and offer his own life for the people sins may be the first time you see that with Moses you wouldn't think oh this is going to be a pattern exactly like this and you know that there's going to be a prophet like Moses to come but you don't know exactly what that looks like until you start to see that pattern developed like an Isaiah UCO the servant also offers their life for the people that's just like Moses so I guess this is the pattern developing that's right but a pattern from Abraham story of having to offer Isaac and no substitutes being delivered which is itself pattern after Noah offering the sacrifice after he gets off of the Ark yeah this is the first Moses is the first one that is a self sacrifice
 the turn of the tide in the justice story is when Judah offers his life on behalf of Joseph's younger brother when Judah was the one who betrayed the older brother that is Joseph anyway but just makes a point where it's what it's about when Jesus is saying the Hebrew Bible is about exactly what it's about like every story every book it's about anointed representative going into death on behalf of others coming out to life so that new life and forgiveness can be announced to the world it's not about something else so and so about that in order for all Humanity to be God's image in the way all humanity is the call to be the anointed representative better in the image of God and so that calling all comes down on 21 so that the money can be restored to become an actor
 make a call to ironing the word Christian from Greek through from Greek to Hebrew but that the one yeah so there's a lot of ways we could go and unpacking this point but I think for me there's just tons of our beginning Point what is the Bible about and therefore what do you do with it it's a story
 unified story about God's purpose is for Humanity that all come focused in on one anointed representative who goes into death out the other side so that life and forgiveness a new creation which is then what we're all supposed to do as well becomes the model for me yes so that it's about me precisely and it being about the Messiah or it's about the Messiah so then and then become about me it's about me that feels like we're about all of us about all of us it's about the calling of humanity which we can accomplish we continue to fail at there's this consistent narrowing down to like well maybe this human maybe this group over and over and over developing this pattern for the need of someone who can actually do it you can see people get really close you see Moses is shining you see David
 crashing heads and white dresser with the poster glass about you have mentioned that before we have really got into it story of David and Goliath discount how many times the word bronze is used in the chapter exorbitant number of times to describe glass the word is spelled with the letters of the word snake and you even told that glass armor has cash cash on the word scales that's used to describe reptiles in the narrative as being covered with snake and having scales and then his head
 connected to this idea of the Giants definitely meant they're the ones that like we're behind a lot of the violence for the initial for the flood flood and David leave it like I'm getting to the root of the chaos that's right I'm just going to slice the chaos head off that's right slice Chaos Head off or what we've been talking about when we come to the story of David and Goliath would be asking in what way am I
 asking houses in what way is David or the story creating his portrait how was he from God which is what we're supposed to be doing and then how is that going to give me hope that the image of God can be fully made possible so the story about David is about the Messiah which has impudent locations for me as a follower of said Messiah but it's not about me in that way
yeah I think freaking for me it's a simple point but it's reoriented my view of what the Bible is about and there for what for what you do you know you really can't is it too bold to say you can't separate whether the story about by was about me or the Messiah and that the entity or the Messiah because the Messiah is God become human to show us what community can be and following Jesus the Messiah it's becoming part of him yeah his body and then also imitating him through sacrificing ourselves and going through death and finding a new way of life so it's like the two things are the same thing I'll try reformulation was not about me and therefore it's about us
 naming the image of God for all Humanity but it doesn't it's not private it's not it's not about me it's about us and who we are in the world together because of what the story of Messiah song about hey what's the deal with the three days to get that a man that's like totally yeah well I'm one of the first and most significant one says with the story of Abraham and Isaac going up to Mount Moriah cuz it's on the third day that Isaac is delivered from Death by a substitute on the top of the third day from when they left they arrived on the third day but then he and Isaac up the mountain and then you can track through there's a number of ways it works there's lots of narratives where the moment of testing and often in the passing through the test happens on the third day so it can become a shorthand
 for the test passing the ultimate test of surrender which often goes through a moment of risking my life to surrender all to God video to make a sign of the third day yeah there's also a woman Jonah famously is in the three days on the third day after 3 days or after three days and three nights and so whether it's strictly about 72 hours or it's a figure of speech referring to the passage of time in which one undergoes an ultimate test and after 3 days I mean in space time Jesus was in the grave 3 days
 rephrasing what you just saying was the Messiah must suffer and die and go through the test and then come out and then offer forgiveness for the test in the garden The Garden of Gethsemane that that was his time of testing so it wasn't just being in the grave wasn't just a test started Thursday night that we related Bibles a unified collection of literature that is about the Messiah or a Nar parlance unified story that leads to Jesus that's a big part of what's underneath that short-handed statement and by its being about the Messiah Jesus it is also about us.
 It's About Us by being about the Messiah and when you say Messiah you could be referring to Jesus Orchestra. Praying to God anointing someone for a task in which case all Humanity so we needed a messiah to do it for us than we can join in through that power that Messiah which happens to also be the power of God Spirit accomplish the task Patton do the test go to the chaos Waters rip off some head to Giant and when I go back and think about when I was first introduced to the Bible it would have been so helpful if I was introduced to the Bible at least somebody saying you want to know what it's about it's about this
 it's somehow it's just taking me a much longer and more complicated Journey come to a place of clarity about what it's about it's more like hidden in plain sight if you'd read the gospels it's what Jesus says it's about but I read the statement and Luke while also taking classes at the Bible College and it wasn't clear from many of those classes that this is what the Bible say about let's just that's weird stuff so anyway I guess that's why we're doing what we're doing is trying to tell people start on the on the different foot I have a feeling if you've been following along with this podcast episode probably was a lot of fun I think if you're kind of new to the Bible we've covered a lot of great use the lot of you jumping all over it but over all over the place using Bible vocabulary I can't imagine because I hear that but maybe not maybe not this is great so the next attributes Axiom sensible of Paradigm of the Bible
 I got we we were calling it something new I would be happy with this I think in the next conversation we will have some discernment traditionally we've been calling this Jewish meditation little trip me up and is that something we coined like the term no not adopted that phrase from Hebrew Bible scholar at David Andrew Teeter yeah that's the first one I heard you use that phrase as a shorthand to talk about it's a style of literature and it's designed for a lifetime of rereading in order to understand it meditation and specifically the way that was done and part of the world through the culture of Jewish people and amazing we're going to jump into that next how do you read the Bible as matician Archer what does such a thing even mean that's what we're talking about next
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we talked about the fourth pillar of the Paradigm that the Bible is meditation literature you would only get this when you're reading these texts backwards and forwards and up and down and comparing parts that you wouldn't have thought to compare but once you follow the design cues is eliminates it brings illumination into what it's about we'd love to hear your questions and have them For an upcoming question response episode so if you find yourself wondering about things that were talking about and want us to engage more you can send us your question send it to info at bible project out, try to keep it to 20 or 30 seconds let us know who you are and where you're from and if you're able to transcribe your question when you send it over that would be immensely helpful to us a podcast is produced by Cooper pelts is episode was edited by Zac mckinlay our lead editor
 is Ben Gamel and the show notes are done by Lyndsay Ponder Bible project is a nonprofit organization and our mission is to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything we make is free because of the generous support of many people around the world just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us that when I was completing in like not discipleship clothes I use the Bible project for my own spiritual growth and I like to share with my friends and new Believers my favorite thing about the Bible project is it to such a great visual aid and really helps break down the Bible into bite-sized chunks and simplifies and explains the Bible Emoji though we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus we are a crowdfunded project by people like me find free videos study notes podcast class has a much more viable project.com
