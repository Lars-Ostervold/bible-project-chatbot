we're reading through the scroll of Leviticus Israel is in the wilderness they've made a covenant with God and God has given them a sacred tents for he will dwell with them a new Eden and after all the instructions we've reached the moment we've been waiting for the inauguration of this Tabernacle and of the levitical priests it's a massive seven day party a celebration of what Yahweh has done for his people and at the end of the week fire comes out from God's presence and consumes everyone's offerings as intense as wonderful as Divine fire eating the gift of Israel is a good thing cuz it brings blessings and comb Union between Godless people awesome this is like the Garden of Eden on the first day with a great set-up but later that day yeah later that day Aaron's two sons their priests but they decide that they're going to go into the most holy place
 going to go in on their own terms these two guys who represent all those people just decide to remake the Liturgy by doing what's good in their own eyes they bring an alternative liturgy dishonoring God and that same fire that was so wonderful that same fire that came out and ate the offerings comes out and eats them and they die in the presence me out we've been here before God appoints a people to represent him and instead of trusting God and following his commands they choose death it's Adam and Eve at the tree it's Israel in Mount Sinai making the golden calf and here at the inauguration of the Tabernacle the priesthood fails install a new human representative to Stewart and care for the spot right at the center that has people who gives them everything they need to succeed and they blow it from John Collins this is Bible project podcast and today to Mackey and I begin the second movement
 of the Leviticus scroll we look at this difficult Story We traced the pattern of election and failure and we asked what is Yahweh to do thanks for joining us here we go
 it's a John hello hello and welcome to Leviticus welcome to an ancient scroll that describes Priestly a Priestly tech manual tech manual for ancient Israelites yes we've been a few episodes into this even making this really wonderful Case. Case you've been paying this picture showing that is way more than oh yeah that's right yeah even it's a story it's a part of the story that begins with the opening of Genesis and then the first main Arc of the narrative comes to a close with Deuteronomy with the death of Moses but then even then that's just the first big bundle
 of what we call the story of the Torah from creation to the death of Moses and then that ranges forward into the history of Israel that launches out through Joshua Judges Samuel and then Kings and with the Exile of Israel in Babylon and Leviticus fits squarely within not developing story line and all the motifs and patterns so Leviticus is a story it just is a lot of long speeches about Priestly Tech stuff which is why most of us get lost ya in the story in particular here is the story of whether or not Israel's going to be able to use the Tabernacle because the Exodus scroll previous girl ended with God giving Moses the designs of the Tabernacle and then coming down to like enter it in fire Glory but there's a problem the scroll ends with Moses not being able to go in correct and that's a problem because this is a
 place where you're able to go in and meet with God for the first time since the Garden of Eden in the story of the Torah God is taking up a permanent residence among a chosen people so God appointed Adam and Eve as the caretakers and Priestly stewards of the Garden of Eden which was it happen in our spot filled with the Wind of divine Glory we're God walked with his people in the garden so that was all lost and forfeited and so this is the Tabernacle is the next time that permanent residents of God takes up dwelling among his people however it's a limited space it's a very bounded space within the center of the people of Israel and it's not all of creation and all of the nation's it's one limited space within 1 family of people but those limitations are not viewed at this moment is a bad thing we're just celebrating cuz it is real kiss to play host
 the God's presence which is good news and it's dangerous which is what Moses is facing there at the end of The Exodus God's presence with them is good news yeah it's also dangerous God's presence among them can give them life out of death provide water out of a waterless desert provide Sky Google read it appears every morning if you can deliver them from their enemies whether by bringing them through the waters like with Egypt or delivering them in the narrow place in the desert like with the amalekites was a different story than Exodus 17 so you always present means life for the people but that source of life living among Israel is also a source of danger and that's something we really begin to explore in our first conversations about Leviticus over the last few episodes it all those stories God's presence was with them but in a different way like that was the clouds in the
 leading them and eating them yes that's right now God has come down more intimately and the camp first and importantly the cloud and fire leading is real through the weld moved up and then really Unleashed on the top of Mount Sinai thunder thunder and fire and lightning and God they're invited all the people to come close to him so that they could become a nation of priests and holy people set apart from among the Nations that is the story that's continuing now as God moves down off the mountain and then took up residence in the tenth the secret 10th among the people and it's both good and dangerous which is where we're going to see and what we focus on here today but I guess actually the Leviticus girl begins first with that good danger kind of tension
 but then chapters 1 through 7 of Leviticus R1 long speech from God to Israel through Moses that are an invitation a Divine gift telling his realize how they can approach the source of all life and beauty and power and goodness even though they are frail and mortal and morally corrupt but God wants them to come here and so he gives them the gift of the the quarterback on the Corbin yes translated offering but means the Drawing Near thing yeah yeah is the verb to come near and in Leviticus chapter 1 verse 1 begin saying when I don't know why would I didn't draw attention to this I think in prep for the day of atonement conversations that we're going to have a couple episodes I recalled that the first line of Leviticus
 this is so great you know or translations are wonderful but they're just sometimes where they can't show us everything that's going on in Hebrew so little kids 11 begins then the Lord called them and spoke to him from the tent of meeting saying speak to the sons of Israel and say to them when any man among you who brings an offering to Yaba something that says the opening of chapters 1 through 70 the word man there it's the word atom if any atom is any Adam bring near that's carafe lid and then the word offering is Corbin the same letters q r b in English but as a noun so when any Adam bring the thing for coming near to yell at him and that right there is a great example of how will we see as a Priestly tech manual that line is linking the beginning of the Leviticus Kroll
 to the crisis of the Lost of Eden at the beginning of the Genesis scroll cuz what did Adam and Eve lose they lost nearness and they were exiled from they have it on her spot and when an atom want to come here here's how you do it you always this is real life and I have to do with the selection of this family from among the Nations but yeah this whole section is a gift God's gift to Israel of their bringing gifts to him and we looked at the five offerings the five bringing near things and the last episode and that was wonderful if you've ever wondered what's the deal with the animal sacrifices that's a great primer those five offerings made up what we're calling the first movement of Leviticus three movements were about to step into the second movement of Leviticus and you also showed us that this three-part structure of Leviticus is like a sandwich
 you got the first part and the last part are like the pieces of bread and remind me to get how are they connected really cool laugh so chapters 1 through 7 we have to have this one 27 or all about Yahweh giving the gift of the coming near things the offerings to Israel as their means of coming here so the five offerings are all about y'all way wanting to repair the relationship with his people and the only way you know that the relationship has been broken in some ways by reading next to the scroll cuz I was the failure of the golden calf so part of why Moses can't go in is because this is a tenuous relationship between Yahweh and his people so chapters 1 through 7 are the list of sacrifice
 and that movement end with a little summary sentence that says these are the instructions about then it list the five kinds of offerings that y'all way commanded Moses on Mount Sinai that's how that chapter 7 ends
 chapters 8 through 16 shift there's a narrative about how now that the offerings have been set up and given to the people now Moses and Aaron ordained the priest attend the inauguration 10th this is a second movement the middle. The middle movement begins in chapter 8 and goes through 16 and we're going to focus on now and the next few episodes that begins with a story not a tech manual but a story about the tent and the priesthood being ordained and inaugurated and it's a seven-day inauguration come on and then on the 8th day which is supposed to be the day of great celebration something terrible happens that's in Leviticus 10 we're going to talk about it just in a little bit here
 and that terrible thing creates a crisis it pollutes the holy place of the tent with the dead bodies of rebellious priests like we just kicked off the relationship and it goes wrong immediately goes wrong and mediately inaugurating the Eden in the middle of Israel relationship set up and immediately it goes wrong it's part of a larger pattern in the Hebrew Bible so that creates a crisis that has to be resolved and it's addressed and resolved through what we call Leviticus 11 through chapter 15 chapters 1115 which is all about restoring the holy space at the middle of Israel by dealing with ritual impurity in among the people is it the Dave dummitt no no this is the ritual legislation about the laws of Purity and if we're going to have a blizzard of the real weird stuff oh yeah
 like childbirth male and female reproductive fluids skin disease animal place we're going to get in it here's all the way is that Israel can become polluted through contact with death and impurity and is going to make the whole Camp of Israel really unwelcome Spa in the presence of Yahweh who's the source of all life and Holiness and so that crisis is going to be resolved through the last part of the second movement which is the day of atonement which is about the purification an atonement for Israel's impurities and said yes I can move in you were going to tell me the relationship between the first movement and the third movement third movement of 17:27 and hear the focus shifts to the lifestyle the ways of living that the Israelites are to engage in as a holy people set apart to Yahoo
 so different than Purity and impurity we're going to have a whole conversation about Holiness impurity and all that but 17227 is about reforming the people to become a whole set apart people among the Nations and that concludes with the last three literary units of livaditis chapters 25 26 and 27 all begin and end with that same little phrase that was at the conclusion of chapter 7 these are the instructions they always commanded Moses on Mount Sinai so it's like literary thread is it where the final three units of the Leviticus scroll are linked together into a Triad through this unique phrase and then all of those linked back uniquely to the end of chapter 7 so that forms one through seven as the unit it forms 17 to 27 as a unit and then it sets apart chapters 8 through 16 in the middle that makes sense
 and it's easier looking at a chart which we are right now but we're back to school technology and the way big sections of Scrolls were woven together not by chapter and verses by literary patterning and repetition of keywords and when you find a high density of repeated words that one spot in a typical scroll it's usually a sign you're out some sort of macro juncture between the big Parts with the movements of that's cool cool
all right that's the bird's-eye view we're going to jump into the second movement of Leviticus we are we've learned how to draw near with the Drawing Near things and things are about to get awesome before they stop being awesome yeah yeah they can be wonderful for a period of seven days okay so Leviticus chapters 8 through 16 this section at the heart of Leviticus is at the heart of the tryouts 16 chapters 8 through 16 chapters 8 through 16 are at the Centre of Leviticus Leviticus is at the center of a Triad that we call Exodus Leviticus Numbers at the center of the Torah so in other words of the Torah itself actually has a big three-part structure as Genesis and then matching the other side Deuteronomy and they're uniquely matched in really important ways and then in the middle is a Triad so it's a big Triad in the middle of which is a Triad
 Manila which is Leviticus which is itself a Triad and in the middle of the middle of the middle is the section that we're looking at right now so that's a literary design way the biblical authors communicate very common in biblical literature to place have this much symmetry this much symmetry it's a way of inviting the reader to match the parts on the outer side to compare them and meditate on the differences and similarities but also to pay attention to what's in the middle cuz what's in the middle is often a pivotal importance for understanding all the matching Parts not the outside and so this is the middle of this is the middle and what it is is it about how God wants to install a new human representative to Stewart and care for the having dinner spot that you can spot right at the center that has people he gives them everything they need to succeed and the blow it and so what God has to do is deal with the Fallout of their blowing
 in a culminating Act of decreation and Recreation and if it sounds like the opening section of Genesis that's cuz it is the themes of the opening section of chance that it's also the narrative Arc of the center of the center of the center of the Torah when you say the opening scenes of Genesis you're talking about the story of Adam and Eve poem about creation in seven days Mondays completes the order of the cosmos Genesis 1 and he appoints Priestly Representatives Adam and Eve just wanted to to Steward the Garden of Eden they blow it royally the three Folly and then there's a great fall out of that Folly into rebellion and increasing violence in the spread of death in the land Through Blood and five leading up to the need for Yahweh to purify the land of all the innocent blood and then act of judgment and mercy of the flood brings the flood
 but out of the flood he selects a Remnant that is righteous who is delivered and then comes out of that Deliverance by offering a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the many so this is what you've called The Melody yes which is then simplified to creation of human Partners election you might call it or the election Tuesday using of a partner and then is a test there's failing the test there's often sibling rivalry someone fails the test and forfeits this great opportunity God gave them then there's usually multiple narratives about the Fallout you could call out the increased ripple effect that falling into greater patterns of violence in
 death which then will eventually lead to some sort of decreation yes yep so creation to failure leading to a d creation through saying that say melody in the life here and the actual vocabulary of Genesis 1 through 9 is woven deeply into the Leviticus 8 through 16 in order is the vocabulary Genesis 1 through 9 or used in sequence in Leviticus 8216 so just real quick it begins with a 7-Day ordination ritual in the Bible begins with the 7-Day ordination read all of north of creation yeah that's exactly what it is on the final day he always presents comes to take up residence in the tent and also on that day the Priestly Representatives Google are at work in that space the two sons of Erin do something really really dumb
 and not just dumb like intentionally violating the 7th day that's actually the 80-day stepped in on the eighth day do something the violates the Liturgy of the Eden space that they just agreed to it so they're dead bodies are now polluting the holy space with death Adam and Eve yeah they don't die in the Garden of Eden or dead bodies aren't pulled out no tie rope know that's right that's right so what happens is there dead bodies are laying on the 10th and they have to be taken outside the camp and then you got all these chapters that come right after that about pure and impure animals you're not supposed to eat and I'm one of the most unclean animals in chapter 11 is snake because it crawls on its belly it's exactly the phrase from Genesis 3 and then you get all of
 is narratives about the spreading defilement of death and impunity among the people that all requires 7 Day washing periods were you have to go put your body through the waters in cycles of seven days and it's exactly the language of the flood story which begin with. The multiple seven day. So if it was a it was a washing and then Noah has to wait for multiple sequences of seven days as the waters yeah that's right when he gets off the boat he offers the same sacrifices that people are supposed to offer here and live in kahoot for when they're purified it what it what kind of sacrifices he do when he gets off about for him at the same animals and birds and that's exactly what is here and also section of Leviticus purification offerings this animals and birds and then at least up to the great day of atonement when all of the impurities that he popped over Israel through the course of a year are both exiled from the camp
 the scapegoat and then a righteous representative was blameless is offered up and brings its blameless life up before God through the purification sacrifice it how does that connect to the Genesis it's about the offering of Noah the day of atonement matches the offering of Noah that he gives on Mount Ararat After the flood or just a creative way to the biblical authors are just recycling the same melody in multiple ways but here it's at the heart of the Leviticus crawl
so we'll talk about this more but that's the kind of the overview for just this conversation I just want to focus on that inauguration of the priesthood and then the terrible tragedy that happens cuz that sets up a narrative crisis that's in need of resolution throughout the rest of the section of Leviticus chapter 8 begins in time you can open up Leviticus and have a positive experience reading it
 target practice she always spoke to Moses take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments errands the high priest Aaron is Moses's brother is the one who screwed up with the golden calf but he's appointed to be the first high priest of Israel and then his sons will inherit the office after him so take Aaron and his sons have four Sons with him and the garments that's the Priestly robes yeah this whole chapter is hyperlink to back to Exodus chapter 28 and 29 which laid out in detail the description of the garments and then also the Liturgy for the inauguration of an ordination to the priesthood see how these garments just recall here it's a beautiful white linen under robe
 then this really cool like purple and blue shirt the tunic robe and the shirt is all made of one piece so that it can't be torn it's also made of linen so that you never sweat that's one of my favorite ones able to loosen back to the Eden story because once Adam and Eve were exiled from eating cuz his dad and by the sweat of your brow you'll work the landlord and the priests are supposed to be really comfortable when they're working in the eating there a new Humanity Ezekiel draws attention to that no sweat in the in the Tabernacle and then there's the beautiful breast piece that has like gold filigree like gold thread weaving it together and then there's 12 precious gems on which are inscribed the names of the 12 tribes of Israel then the priest wears this beautiful turban and then
 what does Golden Crown plaque on it that says set apart as holy DIY linen but then blue and purple and Scarlet Witch are colors of royalty and then a Golden Crown this is both a new Adam new human but an ideal Israelite representing all the tribes of Israel I mean in ancient imagination this is this is a human who looks like a god sparkly shiny one like the sky will lose about in Genesis 1 they're embracing that identity absolutely yeah this is the man whose transcending the normal limitations of a mortal frail naked human but by putting on a costume but by putting on a costume that in an opening and closing of the description in Exodus it says these clothes are for
 covered and two ferret I know you know one of those words to bode Bode Bode Glory Glory waiting us another English word that gets Us close to the meaning of coveted honor and exalted one and so these clothes are a physical manifestation or display of the high exalted status of this one but also Beauty this is the first the Tabernacle and the close of the priests are the first things described in the Bible that are just aesthetically beautiful just for the sake of being beautiful it's kind of cool to think about nothing else. And the clothing of time are the first time that the Bible begins to meditate on the nature of aesthetic Beauty as a good unto itself
 but significant there yeah you know I was actually that was first really explored for me in a contemporary way through an artist visual artist who's the father of Jesus whose name is on Makoto fujimura yeah boy yeah Art & Faith Makoto is trying to articulate in our day and time I see ology and a philosophy of Aztecs it's rooted in the man imagination field by the biblical story and the Tabernacle and the priests of clothing is an ancient expression of that same desire to articulate geology of beauty and it's so fascinating to me that it's a heaven on our spot and they have an energy role for human that are the focus of attention anyway
 yeah that's a little recall of Exodus 28 29 so back to Leviticus eighth God says to Moses take Aaron and his sons and all those garments the anointing oil a man who did I've been collecting all the talk about those are also take the bowl of the purification offering and two Rams those are going to be four other offerings and then a basket of bread and get all the people together at the doorway of the tent of meeting so that's what Moses does he gets the priest he dresses them all up in their special Glory garments the animals for the offer and the bringing near things cuz you're the ideal representative human about to come here for the first time I mean Moses tried and it didn't work but just one of the offerings with a vacation off
 sing to other animals through their animals and a gift offering which is the bread which is the BRAT where the green so Moses brings them in there and he makes them pass through the water he washes them with water because of a little blood cleansing flood they put on all the glory garments Moses takes anointing oil and he pours it over the 10th he starts daubing it's not the term you take fingers than the liquid and then began touching it a batting dabbing dabbing dabbing dabbing and the moment he touches the oil to the 10th it makes it holy consecrated we're going to be a long conversation about that term in the next, so then he take some of that oil and he sprinkle it on the altar seven times and it becomes holy
 and he takes out oil and he pours it on Aaron's head so good Psalm 133 is a meditation on this is the first time in the Bible we have someone being Anointed with oil yes okay yes address to super important you the word anoint is Masha and so this is the first appointing of a mushy ah and Erin will be the first person in the Bible called mashea which its transliterated in English has Messiah to annoyed is too much shock to Misha yeah that's the global oil onto someone sent as a symbol of the overabundance of Heaven raining down on one person to appoint them as a representative of all creation but oil is like the super tense form of life for lots of symbolic reasons it will talk about one day
 right now oh man in our kitchen olive oil or boy all am now avocado.oil yeah my son so weird to me I think this is when I was a kid is just different but like my son just love a bowl of like pasta and olive oil that's all he'll just like he just thinks it's the best stuff ever has carbs and fat and olive oil is an interesting flavor cuz it's a combination of knots Avery but like a its own category with a little bit of bitterness but somehow it's not anyway so they know it's get poured over the head of Aaron and Psalm 133 likes to imagine it dripping down the beard off the edges of the beard on select the jewels in the gold
 breastplates and then Moses brought near that bowl for the purification offering is Slaughter is it he takes the blood put some around the altar purifying it he pours it out the rest on the base to make atonement for it that is for the altar to make it to the altar turn upload all these past conversations will have them again okay I'll have them again so purifying something is taking it from a state of impurity to make a pure and actually just the next episode of talking to him for it is to let the life of an animal conquer the death and then Purity that the altar has contracted altar has been vandalized by Israel sinned and then. And it needs to be conquered by life and that's what the blood of the bull does okay sorry just I'll just say that sentence and there's a raised as a million questions that will talk about it
 and I can you also use the word about Holiness like that he's making this holy that means a person place or thing the dedicated solely to the presents and service of Yahweh I know whether to be able to be in the air in the presence and part of this tent and these priests are being purified and set apart as holy and separate dedicated only to the service of Yahweh in the have another spot that's it then he presents one of those Rams as a going up in Ascension offering the Ola Ola total surrender that's what the whole lot is so the priest and the place we're just purified and atone for now they're being surrendered over like the ram holy offered up to God then he takes the blood of s RAM and after slaughtering it he takes the blood and he put
 on the right ear lobe of Aaron on the thumb of the right hand with this is in verse 23 and he puts that blood on the earlobe of Aaron lovebirds right here on the thumb stand right here right now and on this big toe okay yeah random hearing hearing doing and walking listening acting and going is a core Biblical images images of purification going on an errand in a way I'm placing those three aspects of being in his son's ears are being set apart to hear the command of Yahweh alone yeah no other command just to come and if Yahweh it how you hear it only doing the commands of y'all way with your hands
 and only walking in the commands of y'all by 2 ft consecration a setting a part of every aspect of their lives and Minds their bodies and their life choices at your ear your hand or finger there's a new liturgy ritual thing about that imagine doing that maybe not use blood meal will be a powerful symbol with offering of grain and bread and he takes that and they put it in the hands of Aaron and the sons and Aaron and his sons take these loaves of bread and they lift them up as an act of surrender when they wave them back and forth this called the way of offering the first time that it's it's happening so just imagine somebody you know is swaying with some bread.
 and with your hands up with bread and the hands and you're saying thank you and also like this is yours but you're giving it to us so it's you take a moment to raise it up to the sky so cool that's doing that before meal then Moses took some of the anointing oil member from the beginning some Bio-Oil if you had a super-dense symbol of God's life and blessing poured out from the heavens then he took some of the blood which is from that animal you know which that represents life of the animal that's atoning for you yes I was waiting for you that's right but also where I'm going is the origin of this oil is a symbol of a Heavenly blessing coming from 5 blood is a symbol of an earth creature that comes from the dirt yeah and so what Moses dad's is he take some of the oil and some of the blood and he mixes it into a bloody oil
 then he puts that on Aaron and on his sons and on their garments and then Moses says hey you guys here is some of the leftover meat from that first offering from that bowl and this is called your ordination meal so you take some of what you always invited you to give and he gave it back to you and so sit here by the door of the tent for 7 days don't leave the door of the tent just stay right here at Camp. So visual eyes can see them there in front of the door yeah you sleep in there yeah it says don't go out of the doorway of the tent for 7 days until your ordination is complete a public spectacle so this is the creation of a subset of Israel to become an idealized Adam Humanity because creation was ordered in Six Days on the 7th day we did God
 rafts and Christians inaugurated essentially correct yeah it was humans as his partners and rulers male and female and so now here the symbolic Israelites and symbolic humans are to sit at the doorway that is the portal Between Heaven and Earth the door you at the door and be there for 7 Days eating of the gift of food that Yahweh has given to them to just enjoy it for 7 Days of rest every thought about the door as a theme video yes I have now not when we started the project but yeah I didn't see it on our list are long less know our new list yeah yeah. Also intertwined and chapter 8 anything this is what the most ignorant
 so chapter 92 genz on the 8th day so we just went to the creation cycle order has been established a little liturgical order was our human Representatives that is all there so it's like right now let's get to work yeah we just set apart this new creation space as wholly dedicated to Yahweh now let's let's get busy today in a way would be Adam and Eve in the garden told to work it so their first work is going to be another set of coming near things another set of offerings Suisse take for himself a car and a ball and a ram and bring them into the tent and they are come to purify themselves but also to make atonement for the priesthood in the people so on the seven days or Nation we were setting part the tent in the priesthood now the first day on the job
 they're acting up half of yeah now they're going to make it to him on behalf of the people so they get a whole bunch of descriptions that are very similar to the ordination that cuz the Liturgy of the animal sacrifices it's a lot when you're first take it in but once you get it it's just the same thing over and over and over again so what Aaron does is he makes all the offerings the only tells him to do this key 9:22 Aaron lifted his hands towards the people and he stepped down after making the purification offering and the Ascension offering in the peace offering and Moses and Aaron went into the tent and when they came out they Bless the people and the glory of Yahweh appeared and fire came out from your way and it ate up the Ascension offering and the people saw and I found the faces so it wasn't there like alter fire that burned up the offering yes like I always tired of the glory already came over the temp
 can go in so it's a hovering there but it becomes visible to the people and some dramatic way so much so that it shoots a lightning bolt yeah yeah the Divine Glory Cloud that is over the tent appears to the people in a new way cuz they freak out and it shoots a lightning bolt they freak out here the glory. To all the people fire came out from before you ate up the offering the people saw it they shouted and fell on the faces shouted and fell on their faces means they were scared it's interesting that text is the verb run on which is usually a shout of joy and celebrating celebrating yeah we accept our surrender our Priestly represent has just surrendered all of us made it home that for all of us as a people of God and his love moment where there are reveling in the fact that God's presence while dangerous among them
 he told us to come there and this way by bringing these offerings and appointing these priests live representative and here we are and we did it exactly the way he told us to do it and the glory of the Lord appeared the Divine fire eating the gift of Israel is a good thing cuz it brings blessing and Union awesome it's wonderful says this is like the Garden of Eden on the first day great set-up but later that day or two sons of Aaron nadab and David who picked up some fire pants but we will call them sensors if you've ever been to a Catholic mass or Greek Orthodox or just an Orthodox Christian Buffet I have Eddie okay it's a golden little I don't even know what to call it other than calling it a sensor a Spencer
 there's this thing it's a little pan that you put incense block of incense powder and then you light it on fire investigator with a c c e n s e r sensor oh it's like a little lamp that looks like a little lamp and usually it's upheld by change and so once the incense is burning then the priests can swing it around you and it starts to spread the smoke of the incense okay so here's the thing if you go back and look at these instructions God gave to Aaron Aaron their dad was the only one ever told to pick up one of these and to walk into the tent Aaron's sons were not told to it's not their job yet it's their dad's job but the dogs and Ava who were their names mean Noble or willing Juan an obvious move means he is my dad
 so Noble and he is my dad or the sons of Aaron pick up like incense sensors and put fire in them and then they put incense and so they offered fish that are Strange Fire unauthorized fire fire that is not supposed to be in this place this is their Rogue liturgy they just decide to make up their own letter G and they decide to take upon themselves the role that for right now only belongs to their dad and get Adam and Eve there when did the rule that they're going to need the knowledge of good and bad to rule question is how will they get it I see and there if they're going to be the priest they're going to need the sensor thing they're going to do this one day but right now at this point only their dad has been told to do this thing and they just somehow get it in their minds that like we're going to do it now
 so they offer unauthorized fire, which we might think on the surface like you know but remember I'm out who are these people they're more than just random people there an office there a roll and their role among the people is to be set apart for the hearing the doing and the walking out of only the commands of Yahweh members of blood and oil in their ear lobe in there so there's a uniquely High bar of accountability that these are the people who Steward and are in closest proximity to the good and dangerous presence of Yahweh and on the first day on the job they decide that the way y'all way to find the role description as it's not how we're going to Raw going to fast-track this thing and it is this interesting parallel of children
 like trying to take the role of their parents usurp the role their parents a lot like what's up what's going on with him and Noah After the flood at the rabbit hole Yeah but watch just wait for it you're talking about the nakedness Noah plants a garden After the flood and he gets drunk and exposing its 10 and I'm one of the younger sons of his many sons leave one of the youngest son's name Ham comes and does something inappropriate to his father in the tenth yeah and whether that's to his father or to his father's wife is it all because of drunkenness there's nakedness and exposure and an illicit grab for power on the part of a child which is very very big very vague yeah intentionally where did vaguely and here we've got a vague strange fire fire with son's trying to usurp what is right now
 the moment the unique perogative of their dad this is the meditation literature stuff where the story of Noah yet you know who knows what a weird, random story but then when you see a hyperlink to this story it began to take more shape in more ways than one that little odd story with ham and Noah has been worded and designed with an eye towards things happening here in Leviticus one of them is the story right here that story was designed and either written or edited in a way to make a hyperlink forward but you would only know it once you get to the store and then reflect so here's to son's trying to usurp the place of their dad with the Strange Fire and so that same fire that came out and ate the offerings sentences ago that same fire comes out from before the presence of the Lord and eats them and they died in the presents meow
 so the in the tent the fire bolt comes out of the Holy holidays I don't know it doesn't say and there's app inside the tent and then Moses said to Aaron this is what you always said and it's a little multi-line palm you always says by those who come near to me I must be treated as holy and in front of all of the people I will have commode
 see how is Cabella just appeared all the people and they all shouted and honor didn't fell down and said you always in our midst but then these two guys who represent all those people just decide to remake the Liturgy by doing what's good in the round eyes and you always holding us which consumed they're offering an act of surrender and God's fire was a blessing here that fire is also dangerous because by those who live near the all way if you don't live by his commands that you will find yourself consumed it's the paradoxes the fiery presence of Yahweh as both a gift and dangerous
 so this is severe right but it's also not an average Israelite who just did what this isn't how God treats people when they don't do the purification offering correct or something yeah there's a lower bar of accountability and degrees of intentional and unintentional and then there's ways to account for all of that but this is like the most accountable people in Israel the people who are like they are dressed up as the true humans who are and then on behalf of God are going to reclaim a human divide partnership and they're going rogue they're going about what God says Hey listen like you guys signed up for this errand and your son's like you just went through this ritual and said you'd be dedicated to hearing doing and walking in my with and so what's interesting is after Moses says that that will call him if y'all way to Aaron it we read that Erin
 silent just like Abraham on Mount Moriah really there's a detail that he was silent Abraham says nothing you just does workouts SR22 Abraham sins catch up with him God demands the life of his firstborn son through Sarah and noticeably Abraham is silent noticeably yeah he just it just as Abraham woke up and he starts doing what God says in the only time Abraham speaks is when his son asked him where is the lamb and what Abraham says God will see to it my son so Abraham is silent before God he doesn't protest God's request of his son's life and I think that Silence of Abraham which is about his submitting to the will of Yahweh and surrendering what is most precious to him and he always has Mercy right gives his son back to him through the death of a substitute g e r a father loses
 is first born sons and he is silent too cuz he recognizes that you always judgment is right so I'm not saying any of this is easy for me or the 21st century person to process I have a different but what I'm saying is I'm trying to hear the story on its own terms and interesting like her father loses his sons and he doesn't protests which I think is a symbol in The Narrative of that he says yeah my son's blow it and they got what was coming to them that interesting so this is day one yeah this is how it begins yeah so this is why I got him and he's blowing it in at least two them a cyclist in the spills over to their kids and they lose one of their sons Cain and Abel it was able Abraham sins catch up with him because him to surrender one of his sons but he gets them back
 Jacobson's catch up with him and he loses Joseph and he has to let go of Benjamin for a time only to get both back please thanks both of them are probably going to die and now here's two sons of Aaron who died this is theme and then I forgot Passover which is about the surrender of the firstborn but God provides the mercy of the blood of the Passover Lamb as a substitute so we're working a theme here about about the death of the firstborn or the death the death of the beloved Son yeah so that's another Fame yeah this
 it's like the Bible the unified story so this narrative right here is the Leviticus version of the repetition of the failure of Adam and Eve and the cycle of it's the failure of the golden calf the moment we just agreed just set up the eating situation and wow we're like basking in the glory I would love to pick time so that's the story
 so I don't know how dad's know what happens as Moses gets some of Erin's nephews to come pick up the dead bodies in the tent and to take him outside the camp just like Adam and Eve were exiled as the Living Dead is it worth to go outside the camp so now the dead bodies are carried outside the camp and then dude the next thing you know I said to Aaron is hey I make a new rule today no getting drunk before you come into the tent
 Leviticus okay so this is the hyperlink back to Noah exactly and it doesn't say earlier that they were drunk so you're supposed to get the here and go oh yeah why did they exercise such poor judgment and Sons of Erin say they were drunk they just get a rule of a narrative about them doing something really stupid right after they were told ya like what to do and then what you always says Aaron after that is don't get drunk before we're drinking on the job yeah and there's another reason why you need to have a sober you need ever be in your right mind I have this job you guys is he your job isn't just to go in and out of the 10 and I just performing rituals for the sake of get on Virtual his next sentence is Leviticus chapter 10 verses 10 and 11 are the ski jump the launch you into the next part of the book is what you always says the Erin also you also need
 not drink any wine so that you can make distinctions separations between what is Holy and what is common in between what is pure and what is Emperor so that you can teach the sons of Israel all the statutes that you always spoken through Moses understanding understanding and separating its the word separate that this is how God creates in Genesis what is separates day and night he separates the waters above and below he separates the waters from the land
 priests are the imitate God there an image of God and part of their job is to become teachers of the people through word and deed about the order of creation into holy and common into pure and a in the verse says make a distinction between that's what separates the word step make a separate a separation between what is set apart to be near God and God's Presence at God's disposal to work with and the ordinary yes profane the comment and we have a long conversation about these terms in the next episode of the fruit of a garden it will have taken inappropriately from the fruit of the garden will obscure your judgment and you will be all know good from bad and you won't be able to know good from that
 so what I need are some humans who will not take of the food that is good as they're in their own eyes but trust me to give them their food like you did for 7 days during the ordination ritual and by trusting me to provide your food you will begin to learn wisdom and as you do so you will become teachers to the people about what is Holy and what is common about what is pure and would have been so we're working the themes and the language of the Garden of Eden story here and it's later repetitions in the melody then this fascinating so this is going to be with the central section of the book is about now I have tragedy in crisis in the 10 you have dead bodies polluting the tent that is set apart as a space dedicated to the presence of the god of life so now we got to deal with that I mean a sweater it's like
 it's like someone invite you over for dinner
 have your house up for somebody yeah okay I have to and if I've actually blown at house sitting for somebody before and they drop me over to the house for dinner to this happen in college oh my gosh all coming back to me and I would have brought me over to dinner at their house I'm going to house sit for them for a week me up to very very active dogs carry active dogs and so they gave me all the instructions and I just started a new job working at a restaurant in downtown Portland and so I wasn't in the home as much as I thought it was going to be that week and the dogs
 they tear something up with the dogs ended up like pooping in the house and no matter how much I tried throughout the course of the week I couldn't get the smell out of the house cuz I was at work more than I thought I was going to be so anyway when they got back I thought we had to you know that the deal with that but it was like they brought me into their home gave me like their place to be in their food to eat for the week and I just blew it and so now there's this there was this Rift you know that had to be done a right and a stench stench and that's the scenario here how do we get rid of the stench of death and rebellion and Folly there's no vandalize the tenth yeah and there's a sense of you know this is God's solution bring these people near to him to partner with him and at the heart of the solution is
 priests and at the heart of their like vocation they screw up and there's death and so this whole thing that God's trying to do is corrupted yeah that's right so yeah we both brings judgment
 on the violators but then also there are two sons remaining a Remnant and the dad and he gives them a new command don't eat of the fruit of the tree that will make you foolish obey my word and that will be your wisdom so that you can teach the people wisdom about clean and unclean. In pure you know like what your son's just and so that launches us into the next section of the book which is going to be about how to restore Israel and the people to a place of Purity and trusting obedience in the word Leviticus 11 through 15 is all about but for the moment you know this narrative close this was just a meditation on both the potential and possibility of what's possible when God shows up to live with this people but also
 of the Folly of human heart and mind and the seriousness of being his yes set apart to be his party so there you go man we're at the Heart Center of the center of the center of the Torah and yet we feel like we're still working the same ideas as Pages 123 of Genesis it's as bad as ever yeah that's right so that's how the section concludes but really just opens up the door to the next section which is it again and got the mercy he provides a Way Forward even when humans have proven really stupid and short-sighted does sobering news but it's good news thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week will stay in this movement of Leviticus and we're going to get to a series of laws that are some of the hardest parts of the Hebrew Bible to read through food childbirth sex and skin disease this is the subject matter of Leviticus 11
 so here's what I have found if you just read them at the surface level really you'll get nothing out of it and I got nothing out of his chapters four years when you see how they're deeply woven into the vocabulary and themes of the tour as it has been on Recycle over and over and over again all of sudden all these features of these chapters just begin to pop with significant Today's show was produced by Cooper pelts edited by then double and Tyler Bailey are show notes by Lyndsay Ponder Ashland Heights in McKenzie buxman provide the invitations for our annotated podcast in our app Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us hi this is Sharon and I'm from Indonesia
