what do you believe in God and you believe that God can speak to us that we have access to his words this is the line of thought behind the conviction that a book could be God's word more specifically that the bible really a collection of books is in some way Divine these are a text that both within themselves and in the tradition claim to give us a word from from God while at the same time these texts do not hide or deny in any way that they are written by people and they're also human work those two things are true at the same time and that's what these texts claim can a book both be human and divine aren't these two things mutually exclusive but underneath that in the Simpson something is divine only if it can't be explained through normal processes of cause and effect
 human involvement events humans are involved and there's a cause-and-effect processes behind it and it can't be divine you know it's easier to think that if the bible really is God's word it came to be in spite of humor that got kind of took control over someone's mind and hand maybe put them in a trash can and then that person woke up and looked at with a handwritten and we're like wow the book of Roman is a good stuff so me this is all rooted in the deficient concept of God's involvement and creation through the person of the spirit if the primary way the God is at work in the world through the spirit is through people then it makes all the sense in the world that God's word would be communicated through a human word and in the human words are not incidental they are the way the Divine word is communicated this comes to crystallization in the spray that comes to us from Paul about the scripture is being inspired it's translate inspired thinking other
 directions dr. He's assuming a paradigm of how God works in the world through spirit store today on the show we're going to discuss the first pillar of our Paradigm and that is that the Bible is both human and divine thanks for joining us here we go
we're talking about the Bible as a unified story leads Jesus what does that mean it's a paradigm we want to bring to the Bible so that we can read the Bible along its own grain read the Bible as it wasn't intended to be known in our last conversation we talked about what we mean when we say we all have paradigms we all have a point of view of perspective view of reality in The Theory of Everything That We're operating out of mostly unconsciously all the time and we have one for the Bible and we only have one for the Bible that is shaped by a family Origins communities you've been apart of or influenced by and so the question is is the Paradigm I have when I Engage The Bible and open it up and have expectations about what it is and what it meant to do to those expectations does that run along the grain of biblical literature another words to my expectations fit what the people who wrote these texts and collected them thought they were in
 it's time to do and that's what we're trying to do for trying to recalibrate our paradigms an expectation of the Bible so for us that's what's summarized in that little phrase we trying to help people Engage The Bible as a unified story experience Bible that the unifieds choice do we have developed seven ways that we want to recalibrate 73 calibrations that efforts Lord have mercy on us cuz we're trying to help people yes if the Bible is in a reference book and as we talked about last week if I was not a reference book to make a reference book because we were at the tell us things about who got is like the illogical claims we wanted to explain to us what the right thing to do in life is so we can be your people that love others and we want it to like have a personal impact and for us to like light up when we read it and so we're attracted to certain verses and this to put a fine point on that as I was thinking
 since we last talked to you about that last point they could goes two ways one is there's a subjective element if I'm looking for this to impact me in a personal way when I read the scriptures but then also we're looking to connect to someone Beyond ourselves but like a living being the living presence of God and so let's cut both what we're looking for in this devotional warm your heart looking for like a good verse to build a sermon Round Table is doing all of these things but then for whatever reason the Temptation is to go well then it must be doing it as a reference book it must be doing it in a way that I can just find the right page and the right story or the right verse and then get the answer I'm looking for it so the whole point of that conversation was this a paradigm of a reference book as tempting as it is and is good
 intuitions underneath the news becomes a dead end in that it will just lead to frustration what that's what it has for me maybe not for everyone and I'll make it so you miss a lot of what the Bible actually is doing and it sometimes set you up to find things in the Bible that are not there and you like you said there's seven things that we have and I think as we unpack these hopefully it'll give a clearer picture clearer picture and then hopefully I can generate a clear picture what it is that we're saying the Bible actually is 7 ways that we've come to kind of articulate with a paradigm is that who you think is more in tune do you like this order that we have right now yeah I do I don't remember how we put them in these order but this first one is first for a reason I think it's foundational for the others so I'm with a John what is the first way
 we've come to talk about this first way the first started to Axiom the first conviction the first seven Axiom 7 like that the first part of the Paradigm is that this book is both human and divine human and divine human and divine this is a conviction that you begin to articulate years ago as we started really getting in to the heartbeat of our conversations about all these controversial conviction at all not in any tradition that I know of realized or underdeveloped concept that usually isn't carried out to its consistent implications yes book is divine it is God's word that's the thing that I grew up saying over and over God's word is God's word and if we wanted to try and get a objektiv way to separate ourselves from it these are a text that both within themselves
 and in the tradition claim to give us a word from from God while at the same time these texts do not hide or deny in any way that they are written by people that they are also human word those two things are true at the same time and that's what these texts claim one temptation is to go okay yeah I was written by humans but just as a vehicle I think you described the character of like someone just being Zapped by a holy impulse lose their Consciousness and they just start writing it becomes like a conduit for some other content of a snap out of it they're like wow look at that party that when he experienced a dream and then your narratives in the Bible we get first-person accounts
 of people who have moments of visions and dreams have been Altered States Of Consciousness and they encounter the presence of Person of God and it blows their categories in their fridge and pee their pants and but that's not quite true that you don't so what's important is that none of those narratives are descriptions of people writing texts or riding down the Bible there are also many points where the writing of the Bible is talked about in the Bible and it's always displays people in full possession of their is the new what they were doing and what their writing is rooted in reflection on those experiences and all kinds of other experiences but they're not the same experience and somehow it some Christian traditions we come to murder those two and to think that the Bible's Origins happened in a way that minimizes the Consciousness or personality or the agency of the end of it
 open Waters yes to the point where it was uncomfortable for me to look at the author doing atherley things conversations and I would say look up with Matthew didn't hear how Matthew arrange the section of the Gospel or look at this key word chain through the book to see how the author's making weird place right there in the first year so you were undergoing when I say stuff like that because I gave so much authorial intent of like they were doing this creative exercise this creative artistic literary project that then we're now calling God's word and just have felt uncomfortable because for whatever reason while I came from a tradition that said this is both human and divine that it was more like but it's divine God's word and really like there was this there was an Impulse to try to polish off the human fingerprints and
 and make it feel less like a piece of literature that you would expect to find if it was literature and so when I came across and we only talked about those things it felt kind of Scandal ass so what I've come to the conviction that Traditions that really emphasized the Divine authority of the Bible the Christian Traditions that have a high view scripture they view it as a Divine Guide to the mindset and life of God's people in the last couple hundred years in Europe and America in particular there's developed this crisis of biblical Authority that has to do with all kinds of things that happened in Europe and America in the last couple centuries but it resulted in communities feeling embattled that the authority of the scriptures is being put into question or under threat and so along with efforts to kind of shore up
 people's confidence in the Bible's claims about reality there's been all kinds of things that come along with that package and one of them has been to emphasize the divine nature and origins of the Bible at the expense of its human nature and Origins and history that's what that results in is communities where people are raised with the Divine Authority and nature of the Bible so emphasized that when they go I'm a whatever form they encounter the historical Narrative of the origins of the Bible for some that was when The DaVinci Code you know you know I never I never actually saw 19 years ago but you know by Dan Brown people take introduction to Western silver world religions that do a module on Judaism Christianity and they somehow somewhere people get exposed to historical account of where the Bible came from and
 very human is very much tied into the history and politics and culture and language of ancient Israel and its for some people it's too much they can't Square their view of the Bible as Divine with this very human traceable public history this just available to be studied and be studied and learned about and so it ends up breaking a lot of people's paradigms to the they can't hold on to their faith in Jesus anymore because the Bible has been so humanized and so it might conviction that is a really unfortunate and unnecessary result it never had to be this way our view of the Bible and viewing the Bible as a Divine word did not ever have to come at the expense of its human Origins and nature and so a lot of something is operating underneath what we're doing is embracing that both that the human Origins
 divine origins are not at all it's with each other this Axiom or element whatever is this a fancy way of trying to have the have it both ways how it would be perceived that way at least the way I have come to the place where I am is to see that my categories of reality were deficient this is a place where the Bible's pressing on our views about everything so modern Western Civilization has inherited a view of reality that material Centric words that matter physical matter is what is real and then there is what is Supernatural which you know if you have the absentee landlord kind of God or if you have the personal being Thea you know God loves us but there's still this category of when God reaches out to us it's through this ultimate divide and God is really mostly other and then you know
 he mostly let's nature kind of run that stuff down here but occasionally he'll do a supernatural thing and cross the Gap and intervene and so it's interview that when God does intervene that it's always counter to Nature and its you know visible like Miracles through the Red Sea God shows up and does this in which case the Bible should be have that kind of feel like I came from an alien civilization you can watch the origin of any religious Traditions that often cannot ask you to Christianity that have bought into this Cult of dualism in physical spiritual dualism actually do make their religious claims with that kind of claim that their holy books came from a supernatural Revelation that can't be explained through any human agency in the one that's a lot of a Christian apologetics efforts in the last couple centuries have been to defend that a supernatural origin of the Bible that simply can't be explained
 through any historical means the one that be great if we had that like it just like it was like clearly like this is clearly from I know intelligent and intelligence that was way Beyond us to our and I don't know how you demonstrate such a thing if you were to demonstrate such a thing cuz what we're looking for what number is underneath that's an assumption something is divine only is it can't be explained through normal processes of cause and effect and human involvement it is humans are involved and there's a cause-and-effect processes behind it then it can't be divided and its that assumption that I think the biblical authors have a completely different view of reality and its crystal-clear if you have eyes to see how I'm page 10 most exciting this is an area where the Bible's pressing on my view of reality and it's been shifting my paradigm
so tell me this is all rooted in the deficient concept of God's involvement and creation through the person of the spirit that's where the problem is rooted in my humble opinion release my current we're thinking about it. Just think about the same page 1 of Genesis we're introduced to the spirit of God the ruoff telling him it's the invisible person off vitalizing order bringing presents of the Creator and I'm in the first census of Genesis it's in the pre-creation state where there is no order a life it's just the potential subscribers of chaotic ocean ocean but the spirit of God is there and the spirit of God begins working as God is shoes words speak his words and creation began to take shape what's interesting is that it's the only narrative in the Bible where God is at work in the world without working through humans
 obvious reason there's no human race through the work of the spirit after Genesis 1 God's work in the world through his spirit is always through human agency and you're prepared for this because the match to if spirit is God's presence in the creation as they brings order the mats to that is God's presence in the creation once it's ordered through humans and so low and behold the first time you meet the spirit of God at work in the Book of Genesis after the creation is in the Joseph story and it's where a famine is about to strike the land and reduce the world back into disorder but God's spirit is at work in Joseph giving him wisdom to descend discernment and so he's elevated to a place a rule and Authority alongside the king of Egypt to bring about an Administration that will save save each other
 and lands around it the spirits at work in two narratives and test has one without him and then the next one. I thought the first time the spirit was at work in the human was what's-his-name betzalel that's the second is when God comes to live amongst people in a little symbolic micro eaten for didn't have you. That's a little son and he designs the Tabernacle and crafts all the stuff for it with whole crew and they are empowered by got spirit and don't follow right on through man Moses and the Elders of Israel Numbers Chapter 11 all of the judges and leaders of this rail David the spirit of God comes on then to rule and they are the images of God at work in the world in the prophets the Messiah is empowered by the spirit God speak to his people through the prophets who speak by means of God's spirit Micah David is aware of this
 the point is within the Hebrew Bible story of reality God is at work in the world by means of the spirit how does the spirit work in the world through humans that's the whole point so when you encounter God's spirit yes you are encountering a human a human and it was said to have been empowered by the spirit when the spirit speaks and works in the book of Acts which is really prominent in the book of Acts what people see are humans so it Pentecost Spirit comes on you know the 120 but what people see are humans who relax supercharged with communication abilities cross-cultural communication abilities flames of fire the people who have the experience did what the people outside saw people who look like they were not totally in full possession of their faculties but then they stay
 articulating the story of God the spirit shows up where it's not identify the person is went during Jesus baptism right well okay so we have the spirit mediating the love of the father to the Sun and we're told that at least John than Jesus see that but again the whole point is to lead the whole point of that story is that it's through a this Spirit anointed human God's purposes are going to be carried forward some for me I'm just trying to let that land yes the primary way the God is at work in the world through his spirit is through people then it makes all the sense in the world that God's word would be communicated through a human word and the human words are not incidental to it they're actually they are the way that the Divine word is communicated so my mind I've just really been trying to let this land and so it begins to make sense why in the Old Testament prophets and then in the New Testament this comes to Chris
 elevation in the sprays that comes to us from fall in the second letter to Timothy about the scriptures being inspired since 2nd Timothy 3:16 it's translate inspired by the end of the oceans is it is it called god-breathed that's how I know it. Breathe. Breathe it's the Greek word compound word say on his stuff God Spirit spirited the scriptures where God spirit and he's assuming a whole view he's assuming a paradigm of how God works in the world through his Spirit through spirit and in Greek and Hebrew spirit and wind and Brass it means I shouldn't go hunting for an explanation of the Bible's Origins that can't be traced to any human Agency for that can't be explained historically it's
 the dead end the Bible doesn't need that kind of origin story to bolster its Divine Authority that's not how the Bible presented itself so you know someone implication is that full power historical study into the origins of the Bible is fully compatible with a conviction that the Bible speaks of divine word to us the two are not at odds with each other just like Jesus is human nature and his divine nature In classical Christian Orthodoxy are not at odds with each other they are both through at the same time there's an allergy yeah between the Divine and human in Jesus in the Divine and human in the Bible not a Perfect Analogy project that I've come to appreciate that the payoff for that isn't merely just to explain how God could become human but to explain how humans can be the image of God which is back to what we're saying which is when God works in the world
 mr. humans so if God is at work in the world and speaking to his people through human texts but that also means is that the meaning of those texts can only be fully appreciated within the context of the language the history in the culture of people that God used to write them in this case they're all ancient Israelites and juice come from these periods of History so you know this is a paradigm shift at once both gave me a lot of new Clarity but that also forces me to stare into the mystery of a claim that Jews and Christians have been making about these texts for so long that in these human words we meet a Divine word and you can't prove that claim there's no apologetic argument you can make the proof that yeah well you know what's interesting is the thing I was always put here about was to prove that this was God's word
 was to say how else could all these prophecies have been fulfilled and then there would be this exercise are doing okay let's look at all the things that the Old Testament predicted that then the New Testament and only a supernatural book could predict the future and that was to try to prove that this is what was a divided book but it was interesting was it without exercise is it always felt frustrating because a lot of times if the prophecies that didn't really feel like it was like he was a prophecy here's a film it did feel that simple and we can talk about that but I think what is the third third aspect of our Paradigm which is his Messianic literature but there is a certain way some people have taken to relating the Old and New Testaments to each other while on a prophecy one of fulfillment the challenges it's a little more complicated than that or that doesn't explain all of the ways that
 Jesus and the apostles appeal to and talk about the Hebrew Bible there are other ways that they see the connection in the Fulfillment that isn't just prediction for filming that explains some of passages and connections but it's also possible and throughout history Jews who didn't Embrace Jesus as Messiah like the Hebrew Bible is there a Bible to and they still read and find a lot of connection and meaning and coherence to it with Jesus not as the Fulfillment and so to say look the Hebrew Bible proves and predict the specific set of events at the uniquely Christian climb and Juice throughout history has seen the same text very different way but my point is it's not self-evident that these predictions lead to it's a paradigm that I don't think it's the whole of how the old New Testament relate to each other we need a richer more nuanced way of thinking about the two you're not saying though is that you don't think that these Messianic themes in the Old Testament
 maybe not fulfilled by Jesus as a unified stories that leads to Jesus Jesus as a prediction a prediction and fulfillment and then using that as an apologetic argument I think that's going to lead us to distort how the old New Testament actually relate when we look at what they're doing on their own terms and another another way that I think we've tried to divinized the Bible to make it so that humans with the human element is a little bit subsided is in the role of profits cuz I always pictured profits as he does fortune tellers practice for so like if your biblical Prophet God Zapped you yeah you got a view to the future of something you should be able to know that there's no way you should know you're a human you were just given this Divine thing
 and while the prophets do have these encounters that are these kind of crazy apocalyptic visions and they anticipate what's happening describe what God is going to do in the future to fulfill his promise a Sprite with that said the main role of the Prophet was more of a social critic he was at least as much a Critic of the present in light of the word of God present and future Rider yes or no like oh look at this Divine you know opinion writer like we had at the human understanding what's going on underneath and trying to explain it to us and that's a very human thing that were used to humans doing now what the belief we have about the Bible is that they're doing that in a way partnered with the spirit that actually is getting to the real truth but that isn't some like weird divination thing that
 explain it through normal human process is or whatever we mean by normal we're not denying that there were things that break our categories of reality in the Bible you know the Reed sea and The Parting of the waters for everyday that's not normal that burns and doesn't bring these experiences that Abraham had visions of got the presents made of pass out on the ground like these weren't normal they happened a few times in his wife but those events shape that your nickname is life but it's more about this split love trying to create apologetic arguments that emphasizes Supernatural Origins for the Bible that show that it is it wasn't truly the product of humans and it's not going to leads people to run and accurate view of The Bible History that's a very public
 and anybody who spends a little time learning about the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Greek translation of the Septuagint the history of the Hebrew text and of the manuscript as you see the differences messy human yes yeah the history of the biblical text is amazing and beautiful as complex and you know famously there's a new testament scholar Bart Airmen who grew up in a very very easy logically traditional Church community the really empathize the divine nature and origins of the Bible and he's talked in public at length about what broke down his whole Paradigm was learning about manuscript differences and historical challenges in Matthew Mark and Luke and he didn't have a model for thinking about these human issues in the history of the Bible and how to square them with a few that is divine and so he departed from any conviction at all that the Bible is divine and he's
 the New Testament scholar he loves the literature he thinks it's important and fascinating and needs to be talked but he doesn't believe that it brings to us a word from God and so you know I just you have to say like what is something broken in the system that somebody in counters the history of the Bible's Origins and it breaks it just breaks a worldview open I think that's an unnecessary conclusion to the people
does the bible as a written communication that speaks God's word would you say to uniquely Divine how do you do something that sets it apart yeah I mean cuz the way you were talking about how we experience the Divine sushimen then in some sense every encounter with a human is divine in some sense any artistic expression of a human has a spark of divinity in it and and maybe in with not fuss over it and you know obviously there's some that maybe just like that I just got violence and bloodshed and Rod but with the Bible is literary Arts made by humans and so in that sense it's okay it's the mine but so is you know yeah I got a beautiful prayer that my pastor wrote for the writings of a revered spiritual leader think that has really open
 understandings of where the image of God and then if through the power of the spirit speak something true of God isn't that a Divine word so the effect that these texts have the claims that they make about themselves are they yeah they're offering a uniquely authoritative or truthful representation of God's Will and purposes in the world in a way that you can't find anywhere else that is a set of claims how do they make those claims for the Hebrew Bible it's just these texts represent a point of view and we'll get into this and some of the later paradigms but it's a point of view at The Minority Report of a minority community in Tradition within the history of the Israelite people they're just called the prophets and scribes in the Hebrew Bible and it's a chain of figures you know that the really gain and identity and Moses and chain of figures of follow from him so he claims to be.
 the story of got the purposes in the world a sorte the blade with from a unique point of view that point of view was accepted within the Exiles that return 12 of some Exile that return from Babylon and restarted their life there in the land so these texts came to be revered and those claims were accepted among many but not all we know of Jewish communities that were down in Egypt that didn't use the Hebrew Bible as their guide for understanding reality that makes sense in other words it's a set of text that make a clam and there has been a group of people who viewed them as uniquely revealing the will of God got different than anywhere else Jesus certainly viewed the Hebrew Bible that way there's uniquely God's word the way he quotes from it talks about it and then claimed that he was the one who was bringing that Revelation in that story to its fulfillment and then
 he claims that that was the same authorities that he had about what he was bringing to the world and then that's what he deputized his first followers to go represent him and that Divine message in Authority so these texts make a claim to be a unique place where you find the purpose and will of God revealed that doesn't mean that it wasn't revealed through human text right and I think that's I think the payoff there is a while the human and divine from a Hebrew konstruktor biblical Paradigm are always connected that this is uniquely God's word in a very special way but that doesn't make it no longer for the human in 25 minutes that will unpack more in a couple of the next ones but the point you just summarize right there is to keep one for this paradigm shift is that for a word to be even uniquely Divine Authority
 right is not at odds with the vacuum and it was written by humans so I was going to train to come at the Bible as okay it's divine let me find its Divinity and then when I encountered its Humanity if he'll scandalous and when I counted as Humanity I got too comfortable and then I wasn't able to to deal with the with a lot of what was going on in the literature because of the nature of it and so there's something happen very early in this project when I kind of just released that and it's like okay well let's just talk about this the Bible as literature human literary Artistry with crafted to communicate the message then what happened was this thing I was looking for this Divinity was there like by seeing how beautiful and Innovative in deep and penetrating and profound and is constantly Coke
 hear it and like you just kind of like this is there's nothing going on here totally it's consistently been my experience no receipt if you take if we just stopped right now someone might walk away from a conversation for thinking you were overcorrecting sure they were trying to highlight the humanity of the origins of the Bible in history at the expense of yeah it's divine word and so my point is just to restore the balance so that through these human words we can encounter something that's really there that is I don't know how to describe it but it's like the more time I spend in these texts the more I have I don't know what else to describe it except an encounter an encounter with a mind and a heart and a view of reality that is still so other to me it's so not what I would expect to hear
 about the world in about humans and about myself and the way that this literature is organized it communicates I just I have a loss of words on a regular basis when I'm reading and studying but it's it's an experience that I have through these texts and I can't systematize or logically explained that to you it's not an apologetic that I can prove to someone but I can say like this text speak the word of God and I think what I mean countering is just what Jews and Christians thousands of years that you don't get anywhere else but I don't hear you saying is it doesn't and some like choose-your-own-adventure way like in some way and the way that like Disneyland speaks the people are sometimes it just so magical it wasn't magic it is not know I'd sometimes I don't love it because I'm so uncomfortable with what
 it's something akin to what Isaiah or Moses experienced when they encounter a true that truly other I guess what I was trying to say is it's not like modern art in the sense of like you can just look at this like I said just someone splattered paint and then you could take it into this be like I've Been Changed by this another person next to them and be like me to go with him of being a changed like completely opposite ways I understand the Divinity of it is that there is an agenda an agency and an agenda moving you towards a very specific view of humanity and so we in this balance we also want to create room for this category that superintending all of the people in historical events and unique moments in Israelite history that resulted in the writing of these texts in the collection but that in an
 through all of that there is a superintending minds and hearts of the spirit the spirit of God and that we are encountering a mind but that mind is not at odds with the minds and hearts of the people is precisely through the people that the Divine speaks to us and other probably better ways to articulate it but I I've come to peace with this view of reality and of the origins of the Bible and it's allowed me to give up the anc's to trying to defend the Bible do you can just allow people to have an encounter with it the way that it actually works it just has its own effect on people I think like it's had on us and like at on lots of people do we hear from discovering the Bible in anyway and that's where that man that's like the most powerful apologetic cuz the one that you can't prove it yet this it proves itself you know I don't know so there's probably more Loose Ends
 tie up on this Paradigm how would you describe where you're at presently when you're now here is into this part of our paradigm shift is it still actively under construction for you or do you feel like you've come to think I would want to explore more and I know this is not the place but just getting into manuscript history little bit more and just like why are we confident about what we have now and what does it mean for God's word to be present here when there's a very likely the case there is mistakes historical mistakes or like of like this actually wasn't with the author originally wrote but this is what the translation is now and you're often quibbling over small details like an entire chapter of Mark or something
 yeah they don't just want a woman and there are just as significant big equivalent manuscript issues in the Hebrew Bible or am I still trying to find some kind of like protected thing that if we could just find what it what it was perfectly that's the word of God or is there something about the word of God actually still penetrating through the messiness to the degree where when you say you're not trying to defend I'm wondering what are you still trying to figure out the story of the adulterous woman Without Really written by John sure yeah yeah yeah yeah totally Yeah well yeah every example, has its own set of issues they have to take one by one but yeah these texts came into existence through a long process over the course of many generations and it was not a free-for-all like there were real constraints and precious stuff happened really remarkable things happen to this people group
 all the people groups out of the ancient world that has maintained a few things their identity you know it's the people of Israel the family of Israel and the Jewish people and the reason why one of the reasons why they've been able to retain such a distinct identity over the course of Millenia is their unique history and things that happened going all the way back to their ancestral Abraham so stuff happened in the process of Israelites reflecting on what happened and what it means for them and for the whole world around them that was a process that has been going on from the very beginning and the result of that process was the production of texts that are offering an interpretation of the history of those events and the way that that process worked was happening in every generation that these texts are multi-layered multi-generational products and so I would expect that it would actually have a fairly complicated order version history
 yes totally but it also I think it's like that's the way it works that's the way it worked and if we can see that that is the the means through which god with revealing himself and that the process didn't stop the textual history of the Bible is it continuation of that of that same process and really really need ways what do you mean not stopped so the way that the many of the books of the Hebrew Bible came into their final shape that we have them today was precisely as individual texts came which is how is it unified how did it come to be a unified collection and what we mean when we say that but we can save it the point is that the lines between just like the line between Divine and human is more integrated and interconnected that's the same way there for it's difficult not impossible but it's difficult to draw crystal clear lines between at what point did the writings
 I will stop and then it is a series the final for mr. yeah it wasn't like that it was more involved more like a Wikipedia page but not involved in like a hopeless way that we can understand how it worked I think we can understand how it worked it's just it's a different model than some of us manage but that speaks to the human and divine collaboration thing which is like if you haven't fully internalized the idea of a group of people over Generations shaping towards the final tax is kind of a ridiculous idea if the Bible Divine spirit is working through that correct it's just going to be about am I going to not only just accept the claims of the Bible on its own terms am I going to allow its view of reality and its depiction of how God works in the world influence how I read and understand the kind of book that it is and if you think about this ever all of what we're saying is already pretty intuitive for how many people
 talk about Jesus of Nazareth he was the first century Jewish man who grew up was born into a Jewish Home pooped his pants poopy diapers you know this is what I was taught Aramaic learned and memorize things learned things to trial and error you know he was a human right and he came to articulate and do what he said and did precisely through the process as a human is human chemistry and becoming aware of who he was and and learning what that would mean and so on and so in many ways that's what we're talking about. Also for the story of the Bible and we're painting very broad brushstrokes right now and so it what we're saying could be interpreted a lot of different ways I suppose maybe none of these seven Paradigm shifts can really be understood fully without the other but bright or it's a Divine and human book those work in Harmony and that has huge implications
 for how we think of both how it is divinely authoritative but also how it came into existence and there is a place where those two are in harmony that allows one to sit with the Divine claims of the Bible alongside its Republic accessible history that's very human that this frees me up to appreciate it as literary art and that is been really instrumental and I thought maybe the next Point gets into that cuz it's what kind of literature it is the different types of literature and they'll do their own thing in their own way but you were talking about the unified nature of it that it's unified literature there's two aspects of that that it's brought together as a unified whole yeah there was a historical process by which people brought this collection and that's what about what about just the point of that is literary art is that outfit in here
 I think what we had put that under was meditation literature about it's a kind of literature that communicates in a certain way that forces you to read it like any good meditatively yeah the unique literary style the way we've been talking about this last couple years has been under the heading of meditation monitor I think we can stay here though and it is 11 final thought for me was by seeing its humanity and be okay with it to Manatee I could look at the kind of literary Artistry of like repeated words in literary structure and then how this like good art speaks by its function and form and by its message and the two become one and there's something beautiful happening there is something I always missed and have eyes to see and I think that's that it's that's really wonderful that it that is B
 you get art this right and it's when one reads it that way you encounter something that's very powerful that a lot like the Divine word in presents described in the Bible it's hard to pin down but you can tell there's something there and get it was tricky about the art languages that are is very much a subjective kind of thing, and that's not the point here yeah the point yeah isn't just to be artistic it's actually the artistic form of the literature is its way of communicating its set of claims about everything so play one of our Paradigm the Bible is both Divine and human and the implications of both of those open up a lot of fruitful perspectives that are really in tune with how the Bible is designed thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're back and we're going to look at the second pillar of the Paradigm which is that the Bible
 is Unified literature before it comes from a to Hebrew Bible scholars Julia Steinberg and Timothy Stone and they talk about how the Hebrew Bible is what it's not like it is a collection of potted trees that you would come across like at your Nursery down the street you know you go to like a garden store and you go and get some backyard trees and stuff let's go out to the back lot and they have like put together you know how like the Japanese maples but each one is in his own little pot and they've been grouped together that's an analogy for how many people think about the books of the Bible each one is kind of like a self-contained entity so they're analogies it's really eliminating is to like in the origin and Hebrew Bible much more like the growth of an Aspen Grove when you see Aspen Forest you're most likely looking at not hundreds of separate trees but actually at one biological organism to Aspen Groves can be huge but they're all interconnected and share identical DNA we'd love to hear your questions
