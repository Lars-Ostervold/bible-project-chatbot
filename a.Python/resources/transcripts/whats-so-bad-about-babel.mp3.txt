is John a Bible project right now in the middle of a series called the family of God and episode when we looked at the diversity of the Jesus movement all over the Globe last week and the second episode of the series we looked at the story of Adam and Eve and how one human became too meant to be United back as well on now fast-forward through Genesis Pastor flood narrative and then you get your favorite part of the Bible in mine Genesis chapter 10 the table of the nation's like me you'll skip over this chapter is just a boring list of names right did genesis10 is so awesome it's a genealogy kind of really more of its ethnographic map of the biblical world to this graphic map consists of 70 people 70 Nations but there's way more than seventy Nations and 70f Necessities to the mythical world the number 7
 the rhetorical effect that evokes the idea of totality comprehensive Nest on a large scale as opposed to the use of seven or completeness on a smaller scale when we look at the table of nations were going to notice a lot more than a list of random people from a long time ago it's a highly designed map showing us the outline of the biblical world but why take all this time mapping out genealogy this document is no mere academic exercise get a firm's first of all a common origin and the absolute Unity of humankind all the nations and all their diversity all come from the same family and then buried in the middle of that is narrative about the origins of Babylon comes from a violent Warrior who has a great name what's the next story after genesis10 it's the story about the building of the city and Tower of Babel the Tower of Babylon for your translation likely the Tower of Babel this is the tower that all Humanity unites together to fill
 hold up to the sky and you might be thinking this is great humans uniting to build something together we want Unity the problem is they're creating a destructive type of unity to make their own name great the story of Babylon represent the human short-sighted attempt to unify the Human family but here by elevating one culture and place and City Elevate one City's name is people making a name for themselves I'm drunk Collins this is Bible project podcast today doctor to Mackey and myself will talk about the family of God and the table of Nations and at our Babylon thanks for joining us here we go
dr. Mackey Tom Collins I would prefer we are continuing our discussion on Family Guy family of God man last episode hard for me but I think I got there and he just wanted to the Bible give this in a sense like a puzzle this reflection on what it means to be human and in the puzzle go to something like this all of humankind all of humanity in the image of God but also male and female together by the image of God and in Genesis to there's this really strange story about man being alone seeing that all these animals have a companion a human alarm uses the generic term the human the human is how Genesis to start there's a human alone undifferentiated in terms of gender
 it's the word atom which becomes the man correct but as the Story begins it doesn't mean the man cuz male and female don't exist in the narrative yet it's just the human the human sees that animals have others that they come in sets to buy to and that this human has doesn't have that to complete his ability his ability and ability to lead the humans and so you get this really weird story of him going into the stupor God taking half of him forming woman and informing the other half man and then now you got two from one and then the narrator sits back and reflects you know also you when you leave your parents that the unity there and then you go and you find another
 and you unite as one flesh and you didn't the to become 11/1 body and so there's this this reflection on what does it mean to be human that be fully human you need to be unified with others to represent who God is and there's something here also about families cuz this theme is about family of God that's right into the origin of family is always about two humans coming together in a way that creates a new type of unity that creates more humans and then those humans become a unit a family unit which has a Unity but that in order for those to continue to grow someone has to leave that family unit create a new one to get families and families and families and eventually if you just look around and you think about just the human race he was like this is a bunch of families and all of these families are the image of God together which means somehow there needs to be a Unity
 amongst all of these family yeah you know where's the image of God Pawn in Genesis one begins a theme that by the end of Genesis to makes you realize that it's only as a family of humans unified that we fully represent the image of God has intended it so the many being an acting as one family the truly reflects them so when they be great for Vega along with some sort of yeah Utopia Unity yeah yeah whatever ideal existence for Humanity it's when all families are at peace and acting as one would be great that's a pretty compelling this is why don't we all get along
 here's the step to take from the ideal vision of a unified Human family that does the image of God this is shorthand with summarize everything that I deal is a unified Human family that is altogether the image of God when you say family they're using in a very generic sense cuz not family like immediate family are extended family you're talking about yeah I'm using it in the extended sense yeah tribal Nation sense but even Beyond tribes and Nations you're talking about as the whole Human family the whole Human family made up of sub families here so in a way that stories in Genesis three leading up to Babylon or Domino chain of Dominos facts about the fracturing of families all their levels so in the story of Adam and Eve in the snake they take what is good in their eyes they want to see you
 wisdom that they think will make them like God you know they are already like God and when they do so they look at each other and now they each have their own wisdom about what is good and bad and their response is to realize that you're different than me they realize the first thing happens they realized they were naked when they eat some the fruit and the nakedness tells them you are different than me oh you think that's the nakedness is like wait a second I'm a man you're a woman like me that's why the mechanism and the cover their bodies so that they can forget that they're not like each other so it's a rich image the rich image at the end of chapter 2 their naked you're different than me I'm different than you but there's no shame no need to hide we're open vulnerable cuz the 2 or 1 but then the moment something happens when humans Define their own wisdom about good and bad
 that being naked and vulnerable to an other becomes a risk I think that's where the images images of trying to push the reader to go now all the sudden are difference is a source of conflict at least potential conflict so we hide from each other we're seeing it as a fracturing of their Unity the man and the woman there unities fractured the first casualty unified when you're heading from each other the next story they have kids and you have a story about two brothers one of them becomes jealous of the favor that God chose to his brother and so that Unity is fractured through murder then with the murderer does is go exiled to the East and he wanders out of Eden and ugo's and he builds the city city first and then you get a genealogy
 7th descendant from Adam through can is a guy named Lemak who takes two wives so he makes the Two Become One by taking two which is not how dense is to set up an idea but it takes two and then he sings the song about how he murdered a young man for wounding him and how the protection of God gave Cain he declares over himself ten times over you so all of a sudden you have a whole human Community the same as is so it's like Kaine x 10 his own family with his brother and Lemak represents that in a community * 10 that's the Image Hair new splitting and dividing of the Human family because of lamech is fracturing it more because he's taking multiple wives and he's killing
 yeah in the context of a city of a whole community in a whole career has been celebrating it celebrate that kind of correct of fracturing yeah that's right and so the narrative pause is for genealogy but when it picks up again in chapter 6 we're told that there's a cosmic fracturing with the sons of God and the daughters of humans and then you combine lemex violent the Kansas City of blood represented by Lemak and you represent Cosmic crossing a boundary with the sons of God in the daughters of men Genesis 6 and then Genesis 6 verses 5 and following tell us and the land was filled with me like I was filled with violence and All Flesh had ruined its way corrected its way on the land and so will God violence like the opposite of unity oh okay yeah you are other than me
 two ways we could go about this we learn about each other learn to appreciate what is different and find a way to make it all work together as one that's one solution here being violence is for the purpose of fracturing and destroying yeah that's right so proud of something needs to be destroyed maybe that violence is good but if the purpose is to build Unity silence is going to get in the way that's right human violence between family members can able or between community members Lemak becomes a core portrait of the problem like the biblical diagnosis of the problem violence when I see and treat other people as the contempt as less than human right I am I My Brother's Keeper what am I responsible for him another human I'm responsible for them that's with a cane says to God you're supposed to be the keeper of humanity me so we're really
 find high hear God's decision is to purify his creation from the blood of the innocent the blood crying out from the ground in the cane story God purify creation from The Black Keys and Waters to wipe wipe away the violent Bloodshed from the land and actually got emotional response to it is grief has pain in his heart and you have a land was of the narrative but he selects one guy has family guy named rest in a little floating micro Eden where he's at peace with animals which are all come to buy two male and female and then the Flies over the boat rest on top of Mount karst remember this name Ararat is the Hebrew word curse with one letter different here curse you out of cars to die
 whole conversation was that I think it was about the time the trees if you didn't have a position that is funny and so you get talked about and we're told and 9:18 now the sons of Noah who came out of the Ark were Shem yaphet. Her ham was the father of the Canaanites but I'll be relevant for something later in the book first 19 these three were the sons of Noah and from these the whole land was dispersed people going to disperse from these three somehow what follows is a story where Noah replays the failure of Adam and Eve about in his own garden near Vineyard at the vineyard gets drunk and then he eats from the fruit of a garden and he gets and he's naked clearly all the
 riffing on images of Dennis 3 but then that narrative combines the Cain and Abel story with it cuz then you get a story about one of his sons who's in some way violates the dignity and honor of his father some cryptic Way by looking on his nakedness long Rabbit Hole there but then he goes out and he tells his brothers and his brothers I'm filling in the details here is not cool and they divide the list of all the Wayans brothers do is they walk in backwards with a blanket over their shoulders at the narrative slows down on the scene one brother goes in and looks the other brothers walking backwards so that they do not look and they cover their father's nakedness
 just like God covered for the human naked Nest guard animals going to have two brothers who are acting like God covering their father's nakedness and you have one brother Who's acting like the snake taking advantage of the human nakedness and it's a division of the brothers when you get your favorite part of the Bible in mine Genesis chapter 10 yeah bunch of genealogy table of the Nations
 it's a genealogy kind of really more of its ethnographic map that's no graphic map of the biblical world ethnographic meaning of graphic would be like take a graphic a graph a graph okay yeah so it's a graph of where'd all the nations cup of the nation's it from the three yeah so from the one knew Adam who saved through the floating micro put on the mountain replays in about a mini SD through him come 3 and then these three become the ancestors of the 70 nations of Genesis to the Genesis 10 is so awesome how long would it take you to convince me that Genesis Tennessee about 3 hours but here I'm just showing you a map I made a litter a design of the chapter it opens and closes with kind of a key repeated phrase it opens with the line 10:1 these are
 generations of the sons of Noah Shem ham yaphet and there were born to them Sons After the flood opening line if you look at the closing line these are the families of the sons of Noah in their Generations by their Nations cuz now we've come out from these were separated the nations in the land after the flood separated separated the land but you have to spread out in just their spelling of land and that's a good thing right but separated puts a little more of a note of finality on it and severing of breaking relationship is 3 long paragraphs that are dedicated to each of the three sons let's start with the outfit outfit outfit which looks like japheth
 seven sons of japhet then after that you get seven grandsons David and then a conclusion in verse five we're going to see is the highly schema sized where the number seven plays a key role imagine that most of these nations fill out people on the North or west of the Mediterranean Sea look at the conclusion in from these fourteen are separated the islands of the nations in their lands each into their language into their family by their Nations where did you say these were for the most part it's interesting that these are naming people cuz I'll be like in the office I gave you her father's someone so but each of these names refers to a geographical region where a people go by that name exists got it so go Maria von Yvonne is Greece so Hebrew word for graceful
 the Hebrew word for essentially we would call Eastern Europe team is Italy kind of the fire Mediterranean from Israel the islands like the Coastland Diego Diego Diego to the Mediterranean to get on the wider Mediterranean world is what it represents and noticed the categories here these are the nation's each in their language by their family by their Nation we're building out the biblical world right here these are all the characters are going to play a role in the rest of the biblical story rules another's starting VR6 you get these are the sons of ham has four Sons which is what we would call Ethiopia Egypt the time put I need to do my homework and Canaan so essentially the geographical regions Egyptians cushites canines
 appetites Northern Africa into the into the Lavon are the what are the seven sons and grandsons of kush the firstborn of narrative we'll come back to that narrative we continue on verse 13 mean with seven sons of Egypt has seven sons of kush in Egypt there are also people groups and then you get verses 15 to 18 the 12 sons of Canaan and these are all the famous list of Canaanites the hittite arvanites the summarized Bahama thoughts on the sides and the Canaanites then you get another narrative about the borders of Canaan cuz that's going to be really important want to come into the story of Abraham and Josh
 and then your seclusion these are the sons of ham into their families into their languages in their land by their Nations last son left semites where we get the word semites or Semitic him it's also the Hebrew word name I think Canaanites word Semitic people Canaanites spoke of Semitic dialect but at least in this accounting they're not they're not part of the neckline but you get after being introduced to Sham who's the father of all of the sons of ever which is the word Hebrew the word Hebrew and English pronunciation comes from name ever you'll see ever in the Bible Eber Hebrew ever have a vent the Hebrew sons of Heather is peepers then you get gems 12 cents a list of 12 sons and then you get 14
 descendants of Hebrew guy named ever then shems line drive-thru close verse 31 these are the sons of Sham in their families their language is their lands their Nations the Sun the 12 sons of shem's seemed like kind of Mesopotamian kind of their all into the East solicit pause this as a new graphic map of 70 people and they're all divided up in the multiples your why is that important number is combining the key numbers of Genesis wine which is 7 at ten 7:10 or 7 x 1070 Israel very significant numbers but their images of completeness but let me first quote Israeli scholar names are not you'll find them on the next page he's got to just kind of nice summer here he says the people's listed in Genesis 10 amount per slice
 7014 B 30 hamites in 26 shemites the figure 70 even it's not explicitly given can hardly be fortuitous the mirror recognition in verse five of the existence of additional unnamed Coastal Nations so I didn't draw attention to this but after you get the list of 14 sons of japhet or grandsons verse five in the summary comes along and it said from these the islands where the coastal lands of the nations were separated into their lands so that there are more Nations connected to yeah there's more out there than the 14 I just named which means these fourteen are selected at selected out of a larger pool to create the number 75 naming that there are other nations are not named here Lansing
 did the enumeration back the names I know that the number is deliberately chosen in the biblical world the number 70 is tip illogical it's a rhetorical effect that evokes the idea of totality comprehensiveness on a large scale as opposed to the use of 74 completeness on a smaller scale and pick up so according to Genesis 46 the whole household of Jacob that went down to Egypt 70 people the representatives of the whole community of Israel and wellness 70 others and so on and so when you need even a bigger level of completeness you a Seventy Times Seven Daniel this convention one may safely assume that making The Offspring of Noah's sons total 70 it's a literary device conveying the notion of the totality of the Human family how do we get where we're at that's right to me this past while I'm cutting this song
 does this device affords an insight into a major function of the staple a document for unparalleled in the ancient world and that's true I lost two genealogies there lots of listing names of where people live but something this artistically crafted and trying to account through the number 74 the whole like Mediterranean and Middle East is the world as far as anyone living there is concern toilet that's right he says this is no mere academic exercise is first of all a common origin and the absolute Unity of humankind which we take for granted and yes we could all get traced back to the same set of grandparents this was not take it for granted in the ancient world was not a no or to the National mythology that many people groups
 that they are the real Humanity that comes from the gods and the rest of the people are subhuman song so this is saying every human you meet all goes back to one common source that is the image of God through Noah thank you for drying attention that we take that for granted because of living post Genome Project but even before then yeah and also it's because we are live in a culture that has this story has is Heritage yes we're shaped by culture that has been living in the light of this was wrong so difficult right right turns out this is true yes or no because we can look at the NAA and we can figure that out correct and it does get messy back there with species whether there was only had two tall blood and its breeding and with the NFL's and but the point is yeah that's right yeah you can trace the line now that was not the case you know I could do a lot more homework here but I know that this is a thing
 I remember I think it it might be predecessors of the Greeks had I miss ology that they are the ones that came from the dirt and were created by the gods and that everybody else comes from some other source and therefore it gives them the right to do in Concord everybody else and being charged yep sounds great so that we might take for granted but that shouldn't go unnoticed as it's affirming the common origin and unity of the human race he says then it's tacitly but effectively asserts that all the varied instrumentalities of human divisiveness are all secondary to the essential Unity of the International Community which constitutes the family of man Genesis 10 is claiming that all humanity is Unified going back to a common origin s it's implicitly
 yeah but by affirming that Unity what is claiming is that all of the ways that we divide ourselves up from each other is all secondary to our real Unity which is the family of humanity the family of humanity we should call the video which is the family of God if you believe in the image of God that means the family of God Family Feud manatees the family fun
 Janelle said look the two have become one and you have many and the problem is now you have many and will these many become one that's impossible they're all separating from each other right now and notice they all have different languages for you at the end of each summary different languages for hiccup I thought they all got off the boat you tell me they surely were speaking the same language on the ark so how did we get from those three sons to all these nations to Generations there's more to the story that little narrative in the list of the sons of Pam interesting narrative starts and birthdate who was the first born of him he had a son
 and that son's name was Nimrod Nimrod the warrior right well it's this Hebrews word the same Hebrew letters that spell the Hebrew word Rebel Rebel Rebel and here's the thing I remember those when the sons of God violated the boundary of the heavens and had sex with human women and I've read about it in that story they bore Sons for them and those Sons will called the giborim the violent Mighty ones violent Warriors I get bored I am something of a nimrod he was one of those since Thursday he was a Gabor a mighty warrior on the land first nine Not only was he a good War avoid humans he was an animal Slayer before y'all way this Mighty violent animal Slayer before Yahweh
 nobody around here plus to say it this guy's name his name is turned into a famous saying you know let's say we're hunting out can you fire a shot from a hundred yards and you nail a nail it and you know what everybody would say you're like Nimrod. Violent animal Slayer before y'all way we need to start doing that every time I need a 3-pointer
 this is so funny why are we being told this information the beginning of nimrods Kingdom start building an empire the first Kingdom Empire Emerald did and the name of that Kingdom Babylon babylon.com addict and a card and call Nana all over there in the east in the land of shinar that Empire he went forth from that land to the north and he built another Empire called Assyria what a resume and then I also ran over here which means huge City
 and, and resin between native and Colour that the great City and then it just goes back to the genealogy what okay so first of all guys named Rebel who is also a violent war and also a good Hunter great so that everybody loves to say his name he has a great name he has a great name we talked about how that name became yes I put down you sent me an article it became a put down your bunny because of Elmer Fudd Elmer Fudd if he was a hunter he wasn't spending made fun of him calling him Nimrod will you call them then ride with me is Hunter yeah but he was always making fun of them said every time you hear the word Nimrod you think of it as a ninja go cuz it's insult which is like the ultimate so good it's like a tragic inversion
 what is the celebrate that name when you when you score a touchdown now his name means like an idiot idiot
 what is like the name Tim became the word for idiot and some other culture probably does what's this narrative dude why is it here well here's the thing is this table of Nations also raised the issue of all these nations are separated now this is giving us the result of some great stuff horatian and they're all speaking different languages and then buried in the middle of that is this narrative about the origins of Babylon comes from a violent Warrior who has a great name all of the cities in Mesopotamia founded that he founded what's the next story after genesis10 it's the story about the building of the city and Tower of Babylon
so Genesis 10:50 actually out of chronological order but it's great storytelling order so the sons of Noah get off the boat you're presented with them and you just like oh no they're being fruitful and multiply but they're all divided now and they're all speaking different languages how will the men need B12 seems like 10 and 11 are in the same way of Genesis 1 and 2 it's like they're both accounts yet of division of humanity yes that's right that's right but they're separate accounts that if you try to like mirjam together break because in Genesis Penn Yan speaking different languages there already that's right 11 they all speak the same language that's right it's as if I think Genesis 11 the story about Moses like flashback it's like you tell the story forward to a result to say how did we get here then the next narrative offers the information but still if you try to merge these it feels like it doesn't work at Genesis 2:50
 I'm Rod building Babylon all of mankind building Babylon all of the land had the same lip and unified words the phrase the same words it's the word one in plural
 it's impossible in English is translated same but it's the the Hebrew number of one they had one language and one word there one never all the way back we got off the boat everybody was one but the hell has journeyed East and they found this nice floodplain River delta in the land of shinar which is where like the most ancient civilization existed were the first cities were built the Sumer yeah where the Tigris and Euphrates create this gigantic River Delta Valley super rich soil and empties into the Persian Gulf so everybody said to one another one said to His companion there one every day up there one language there one everybody's got their body heat one said it was Buddy they're working together come on
 let's make bricks the word bricks is the letters of the word Babble on and let us burn them thoroughly and so they made bricks with against the words Babylon scrambled for instead of stone the stacking Stones I started mass-producing these nice tightly together technology Mann Take Me to the next level then let's build for ourselves a city or who built the first city and let's build ourselves at Tower whose head the Hebrew word for het whose head is in the skies really tall really talk with head in the skies and because we got this new technology we can get that thing see how that unified Humanity creating their own City
 its head in the skies and let us make for ourselves a sham a name if we don't know what will happen we are going to get scattered all over the face of the land so this is interesting tension where be fruitful and multiply fill the land so I just going to involve going out so Unity can't mean that we all to stay in one place cuz we need to fill the land I'm going to have to go out but I guess the question is how can we all go out and be multiplied but yet do you want to go back to that that call of what does it mean to be the image of God to multiply and subdue the Earth and spread out fill it because to spread you would expect division at least physical the division in terms of distance distance but how to do that while maintaining the Human family
 you're the easiest things we just all stay here correct so attached the piece of land all the sudden a region becomes part of our identity and 1 one piece of land and now all of a sudden are named we will make for ourselves and name and create a monument about our name that reaches up into the the heavens it's an image of they're creating a new Humanity but it's for their own name I think we're to imagine it's as if they're building a gigantic human
 but they have a huge Tower and it has a head to toe cuz I'm a normal turn of phrase and Hebrew to call the top of a tower ahead not that I know of no other word head can refer to the tops of things but I think it's suggestive especially because of the way that the author of The Book of Daniel picks us up with the image the king of Avalon makes a gigantic image and he had a dream about a huge image that represents all that women rulers in Empires and he is the hat and then Daniel 3 he goes to the plain of shinar the plain of shinar is only used in any biblical story 2 times right here and in Daniel chapter 3 where you makes a huge human image is up and having the heavens and all the languages and tribes in tongues and nations are around and He commands them all to bow down and give their allegiance to the
 one the one it's the many in the one so here Humanity has one but then what they want to do is create their own version of humanity with a name that honors themselves and their identity we are the Sheena right now if you read this without already knowing that this is a negative story it almost seems like this is great that they're doing it at the only hint that this is not quite right is that they don't want to scatter over the face of the Earth sure that's the other thing that leads you here is understanding the little red design of Genesis 12 11 12 11 is designed as a mirror there are three Rebellion narratives pre-flood and then three Rebellion there it is supposed to let and in each case the third pre-flood it's the rebellion of the sons of God in the daughters of men and their it's the realm of Heaven coming down to earth
 intimately here it's people of the earth round trying to get to heaven going up to heaven illegitimately and in both cases you have these violent lawyer guys in the mix right at the sons of God Rebellion results in the giborim The Violet Warriors and here Babylon has no reading back from the fact that they are seeking Unity yeah you should be like okay well correct does unity just that's exactly right just like it was good for humans to want to be wise question is what narrative what story are you living out and telling in your quest for wisdom is that the narrative where I will be like God and do what is good in my eyes not that our desires the desire for Unity that desire for wisdom yes it's how do we how do we feel this is the story of Babylon represents the human short-sighted attempt to
 unify the Human family but here through elevating one family's name front well as if the whole world stand you right by elevating culture and place and City Elevate one City's name is people making a name for themselves yeah well it seems like there's one language one common speech everyone's unified great that's awesome let's build something awesome a tower that reaches to the heavens okay it's kind of a a temple of sorts bad if you read the story out of the context of Jensen 1211 it's more neutral if you're reading it in the context of Genesis 1 to 11 and then thinking of its historical context yeah and it is that one that but then let's make a name for ourselves
 okay and it's God's going to make you great out of his wisdom you making yourself great that seems to be a problem was in the Scots to the mountain is it starting out kind of like a great Unity but the security said something wrong with it and I know that's a good point even with just on a basic level reading the story just like it was right for the humans to want to become wise it's right for the humans to want to be one but then that one this gets twisted into and a self elevation which creates violin Empires and you get a guy like Nebuchadnezzar totally who is this is this is basically riffing off of in a lot of ways it was Daniel Diaz at the foundation story of Babylon
 Babylon Foundation story you can the public domain go read it it's called a new me a leash and yeah it's founded by the gods and it's the Bastion of all against all chaos in the world and its legitimate Babylonian Kings to plunder the nation's and Genesis 11 is coming along thing now man Genesis Babylon has its origins in a misguided human attempt for Unity so yeah again this is written by people group that will have their Capital City attacked burned by this people in the city are the bad guys please the bad guys and they're going to take our people into Exile in Babylon trying to assimilate us into their machine into their name
 the reason why I wanted to get us the areas we have this diversifying of the Human family with a common origin but then Babylon represents I'd like a false start yeah of unifying failed and distorted human attempt to unify the Human family around the wrong story which is elevating our name elevated 1 cities named to be the thing that will unite us all it's strange to me how what do you do with the discrepancy of liking this story at the Twin City Kansas City but then if you think of it in terms of well it's a reflection on Babylon which is one Empire
 then what you're saying makes sense but here in this story it's all of you it's all too well it just says all the land had the same language had one language in 1 Word all the way and so sorry just the whole world all the way it says all the last one language in one words doesn't necessarily mean all the people on earth I need to think about this more cuz I think this is telling the backstory of how you get the table of nations in Genesis 10 how do you get to all the languages of Genesis 10 and then you begin a story with all the land had one language and then if you're trying to say Genesis 11 and is trying to explain the origin story of all human cultures Methodist city is mine which is the only one interpretation requires you to say that all humanity is being represented in Genesis 11 verse 1 it could just be that all bunch of people that make sense
 who makes more sense in terms of where it's placed after 10 and and how it works with 10 and it makes sense for the fact that they knew that Babylon was just one people a lot of money correct yeah yeah you know it may be because Babylon Zone origin story makes this Universal claimed that they're telling like a parody of parody version of it here yes interesting there was an important study done of the story done by scholar Jack Sasson a number of decades ago and he does a lot of people have attention to the the word place the Hebrew letters for B&L are lock riddle throughout the story and that there's all kinds of little parody interconnections with Babylon Foundation stories so it's very much trash talk but it's also the human problem
 bright doing both thanks yes seems to be doing both things I need to ponder this more so from here on out then you have to have an idea and then you have like the anti ideal you have the eating ideal which is where the Human family spreads out multiplies of 2/0 rules it but retain the unity correct in that they are all the image of God together collectively and you have the Babylon idea which tries to unify Humanity around the Imperial dream of elevating 1 cities named into the heavens I mean I think it's a narrative about how human families deify their tribe into the heavens and then all of a sudden that becomes can become a very dangerous unifying principle or yeah they could come and wipe you out yeah send you into Exile try to stimulate you
 otherwise chest because I mean what else is human history except just one group elevating itself legitimating its superiority in power and then conquer and killing taking other people's stuff three things are listening interesting essay on how cultures create ritual violence to subdue actual violence the history of Athletics a form of ritualized human violence so instead of having all these are at war with each other will create this symbolic Representatives through athletes are sons of God and then make them fight and hurt each other as a symbolic enactment of our tribal differences its ritual violence and if you think about on that level and to project Lee it's very similar most cultures have a form of ritual violence becomes
 displacement of real violence that destroys the community the way of letting the steam out the other pressure was like it's like these super humans become icons of some deified identity of our city and then we send them off to go make war on the Raiders are Raiders
 in the Dolphins
 tour guide
 do dolphins do dolphins hurt kids they can stick up for themselves and got responses to bring about the thing that they fear which is to scout of them actually What God Says in verse 60 look they are one there one people and they all have one language this is what they have begun to do nothing that they plan will be Out Of Reach for them so they got the college thing that if you get images of God unifying unify and did they start planning they might come up with the internet at some point I think I'll leave the planet and the sentence
 is structured Maps precisely onto the sentence the God says about humans in Genesis 3 now look the humans have become like one of us knowing good and evil. Genesis 3 yep what I'm saying is this sentence is structured in Hebrew with the same grammar and send out as Genesis 3:22 which is the humans have become like one of us did humans give him knowing good and bad so that they don't stretch out their hand and take from the Tree of Life and here it's the humans are one and they've begun to do this now nothing they do will be impossible for 7 let's go Buffalo let's go follow the language and so therefore they called the name of the city barbell because you follow the language so yeah Babylon becomes an icon of yeah the Imperial dream to unify Humanity under
 the ages of one particular City and culture it becomes like the blob assimilating all into itself to elevate its name and God of knowledge has that like yeah this is going to become powerful yeah and I need to save it From Hell from itself yeah which is what he does in the garden to this you eat of the Tree of Life while you're in this state yeah it's no good no good that's exactly right parallel to the design pattern parallel so it's a severe Mercy exiling humans from Eden the scattering of Babylon is got severe mercy here and so low and behold the genealogy picks up from the line of Shem and goes down to this moment with that it calls with a guy named peleg who lived during the division of the land and then it breaks off through peleg
 to get to Abraham Abraham say that he lived in this was in Genesis 1000 just as hell yeah in the line of sham and Genesis 10 you broke his went forward to this line between two guys named their names are peleg and y'all can look at just a 25 Now Hebrew had two sons was 25 one was named division petlak cousin his days the land was divided to get a little hint forward to the Babylon story and his brother's name was you have time and then it focuses on Yorktown and after Genesis 11 we replay the line of sham and when we get to pay leg we don't go through his brother this time we go through Appellate Division and then that lands us to Hebrew
 and then eventually to Abraham Haber is before peleg okay and then we finally going to make it to Abraham so yeah yeah from Adams Noah ten Generations from Noah to Abraham Abraham didn't he bring his father lived it was from Adam to Noah is 10 Generations Noah has three sons from Noah to Abraham is 10 generations and Abraham is one of three sons of the 10th Generation so Noah with his three sons Abraham and his two brothers as the three sons of the 10th Generation again Kylie designed highly designed and then God says to Abram new developer version of what he said to Noah
 after getting off the boat After the flood God said to Noah get off the boat be fruitful unless you be fruitful and multiply feel the wind and now you can eat animals yep yeah yeah but don't spill their blood or eat it and certainly don't kill another human because humans are made in the image of God and he told me that says Abraham after the scattering of Babylon how many times we've had these lines here so you can see their hinge know the whole story now just going to focus in my think of a camera zoom we've been Global for all Humanity donations God's got a plan to bless all the nations with the nation's Rebellion has culminated in Babylon so what God is going to do is start working outside the value system in the infrastructure of the human power game
 I'm going to go with some some no-name guy and God says to him leave your family leave your family a man will leave his father and mother that kind of division isn't necessarily bad that's part of the plan especially when they go out to join with another to become one flesh to become the origins of a new family actually think Genesis 12 verse one is that a hint back to and the man will leave his father and mother remember we you just talked about how to fill the image of God be fruitful and multiply just going to have to be a separation of distant but then the idea would be how can we be separated but still as a family maintain Unity because something similar here where he's leaving his family in order to be a part of something that will create Unity first two I will make you Abram a great nation that the word
 genesis10 one guy becomes a nation I'll bless you I'll make your name your name your sum he comes from the line of name Shem but then this becomes a great contrast to the people of the empire of Babylon and making their name great yeah the power game where it's the humans have one name and City and have their head in the skies that nothing will be impossible for them and that will not be good but God inverts it and takes a no-name and elevates them humble to the place of the great name now sounds like we got the Bible but not just for your sake you will be a blessing to others I'll bless those who bless you and the one who curses you I will curse I'm going to protect you cuz there's some violin family is out there and in you all the end it's the word Mishka plan family
 all the families on Earth on the land will be blessed and so this becomes yeah the key hinge in the biblical story we've been at the many and the many tried to become one and it was a disaster scatters the money and then chooses one and now the story will focus in on the family of the one who are told from the beginning of the story of God's purposes with the one family have their origins in the story of the many families and will all lead back to the blessing for the many families it just might take a while since you seem to be stopped here you kind of get this sense of okay the human project to subdue and rule the Earth it requires Unity because to Bear than one some of these things are big projects but when we do it in a way that we want to make our own name great and our own City great it just leads down to violence and bad news and then
 you get this is germ of a of a new ideal which is letting God make your name great and through that true Unity will somehow take place where all the families will be blast and there will be some sort of unity and so then the question becomes will how does that happen how does one family saying I'm not going to make my name great imma let God do it how does that create true Unity a question how is God going to do it in a way that's different than how Babylon would propose to do it yeah that's the question driving because the whole idea is here through the blessing of the one there is abundance for the 1 and then not abundance goes out to bring abundance of blessing for others so that threw the one the menu the menu of last there was one family that was connected to the life of Eden which is eternal unending source of life and blessing
 you could see how this would be great news like a a little conduit of Eatin my wife uses these soaker hoses for a garden in her front yard we used to have a front yard now we just have like a little Arboretum flower garden with no grass but she puts these soaker hoses like an inch under the dirt she can't see him there. They're dispersing water all the plants and it's cool cuz in the Summers be like a dry day and she'll just turn on the hose and then 30 minutes later everything saturated and it's why I think it's like that image the family supposed to be like the soaker hose of the life of eating out there among the Nations and that becomes the drama of Abraham store because he's not always a soaker hose of eating out there sometimes he's so gross of pesticide
 the nation's Adidas blessing and that becomes the drama they promise to re listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to continue the series on the family of God and look at the story of Abraham Sarah and Hagar the Genesis 16 opens with Sarah Abraham's wife had borne him no children but she did have an Egyptian slave whose name was the Immigrant who talks for this for Hagar the exact word The Immigrant Hebrew we love to hear your questions that have come up as you listen to this series and we love to interact with them in an upcoming question-and-answer episode so if you have a question send it to us the deadline for questions is going to be January 18th you can email your questions to info at bible project, please send an audio recording of yourself trying to keep it to twenty or thirty seconds or so and then also transcribe it for us so that we can look at it quickly me today's episode was produced by
