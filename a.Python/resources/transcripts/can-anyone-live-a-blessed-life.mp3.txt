where in the scroll of Deuteronomy Israel is ready to enter the promised land and Moses is about to stand before them and give them a pregame pep talk and what should be a motivational speech isn't very Pepe if Moses was like a team coach in the locker room right now I think it would be pretty bad for him is essentially what he saying is like the stakes are high we've trained for this is like the previous team you know last year's team like lost two tournaments like failed but here now it's your turn and hear the six you make XYZ play I'm pretty sure we're going to win if you make ABC play it's going to be disaster and do something I know you're going to make the wrong move I actually already know I know your parents I know you you're going to live instead of finding blessing they're going to find her purse the curse
 in this case isn't God actively punching people the curse is God removing himself from their lives letting chaos come back in the curse is letting his people do what they want which isn't going to end well known as part of the punishment is to get what you want which is to give your allegiance to other guy. There's a part of my desires and what seems logical and good to me but actually are leading me to death what we have here is a compelling picture of The Human Condition even when we want to do good or desires pull us astray we need something bigger than ourselves we need the source of all life to intervene on our behalf the part of the tour is diagnosis of The Human Condition is about a misdirected or distorted desire the most deceptive one says when people actually think they're doing the right thing and what they end up doing is bringing
 pain and that food a circumcision of the heart there's something that needs to be removed so that it dies so that the real heart that Yahweh knows humans are both capable of and will bring true life so that that can live on John Collins today Tim Mackie and I look at the final movements of the Deuteronomy scroll we talked about the complexity of human desire and yahweh's graciousness to do for us but we can never do for ourselves this is Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hey Tim hey John hello hello we are ran in the corner into the final stretch of the Torah the final stretch of the fifth and final score of the Torah have you ever done any competitive running one time I did at mko did you competitively like you're trying to go for a Time excuse me know it was like all the Jingle Bell run in Madison Wisconsin I was running with like two hundred other people through slashed and yeah nothing I said that's not nothing I just thinking when I said rounding the corner this very visceral memory of running track I ran I ran the mile and that last corner to the last straight away is when you just put on. Turn it on whatever you got left yeah okay I remember like Junior High track girls just peed but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 little bit and then I was like it's now or never just turned it on you didn't live to the Finish know I charged I wanted to charge to this finish we've got I mean maybe we're past that final turn around the straight away yeah we are in the final movement of the Deuteronomy scroll so big picture for a 5-ton Scrolls the first and the last Genesis and Deuteronomy are bookends the match and all kinds of important ways that we talked about many times over throughout the history of the series and those out or frames wrapped around a 3 scroll Center to the Torah Exodus Leviticus and numbers and exodus and numbers match in important ways they both have people going through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai Exodus and the numbers leaving Mount Sinai going through the Wilderness and I'm at the center is Leviticus which is 1 long that's peaches from God to Moses
 what's the Torah sandwich that we've been talking about and we are now at the bottom bun and the Santa Fe hamburger or something and then it turns out that last piece of bread on the bottom the Deuteronomy scroll scroll has three parts that begins chapters 1 through 11 first movement of passionate speeches from Moses to the children of Exodus generation telling the history up to that point and saying and choose Life by living in Covenant loyalty to The God Who rescued you out of Egypt then he went through again of the Covenant laws of the relationship terms of the relationship this chapters 12 through half of 26 an hour in the final third which is another set of passionate speeches by Moses with some poetry in a poet Moses Works in two columns here and that's what we're exploring now and this is really emphasized in the consequences of the
 people's decisions about what roads are going to choose so I can choose loyalty to Yahweh will leave the blessing and long life in the land if they choose to follow other gods give their allegiance to God's God will hand them over to that path that will lead to curse and death and evil must Choice the most slaves before them and then being Israel at the riverbed of the Jordan River going to cross over to the promised land threat this is the land god promise Abraham land where they're going to be able to multiply and subdue the Earth and Rule it as God's image and then blast all the nations part of the last section of Deuteronomy bookends the early chapters of Genesis is that Adam and Eve were placed as Gods Royal Priestly representatives in the Eden Garden land and told to follow the Divine wisdom of the command to
 only of the Trees of the garden but not take the knowledge of good and bad in here on that and they show their loyalty to a snaky deceiver by following his words instead of their creators and they are exiled from the garden so now here it's kind of inverted the children of the Exodus generation are standing right on the border of a garden they have been in Exile they've been in the wilderness and now they want to come back in ya know God's inviting them back in but their ability to stay in the land and experience what Adam and Eve missed out on will depend on whether they follow the Divine wisdom in command so that's the setup here in the last episode we did a kind of over view actually the whole book of Deuteronomy especially this last part where there's long expositions of blessings and curses and terrible things that will happen to the Israelites if they don't follow the terms of the Covenant this is kind of a stock Convention of a
 ancient near Eastern Covenant 3D kind of language and style we talked about this episode is having set that up last episode this one can follow us if you haven't listened to previous episode you'll really want to do that cuz the intensity of ancient near Eastern Covenant curse parts of a treaty that helps explain why there's so much intensity in the sectional going to be today OK Google there's two metaphors I've used in the past to describe what Moses is doing here is Moses was like a team coach in the locker room right now I think it would be pretty bad for him what he's doing right now is essentially what he saying is like the stakes are high he's trained for this like the previous team you know last year's team like lost the tournament like failed but here now it's your turn and hear the steaks if you make XYZ
 play I'm pretty sure we're going to win if you make ABC play it's going to be disaster and do and here's the thing I know you're going to make the wrong move I actually already know I know your parents I know you you're going to lose it's a really bad pep talk it's like totally demotivating pep talk and as interesting Dynamic cuz I think it's we're going all the way back to our first conversations about Deuteronomy the author who is presenting this narrative about Moses and the people in front of us is sitting way down the line of the story generations and generations down the line and so they have already been sitting in the consequences of all the generations of Israel's Covenant failure and so this kind of a wink wink going on Moses is presenting a choice to them but at the same time Moses is going to be saying and the author knows that this is all going to are you saying. There's kind of saying this through
 Moses Moses become the mouthpiece of the author and when I say author I'm talking about the compilers the compilers of the final shape but the whole Hebrew Bible of what's the Torah is the opening 3rd via so Moses has knowledge of what's going to happen is presented in the narrative as a prophetic foresight is based on the 40 years that he's had with these people right you know that they've already been pretty treacherous yeah, he very well could have had this intuition and then even shared it with them that's right the guys I've seen how this goes and it's likely you're not going to do it so that's how it feels like a maybe a bait-and-switch in terms of the rhetoric of persuasion techniques here cuz he's going to say like choose the good like here's what will happen to the right thing
 L you see that tension and assist a real Dynamic and he s so what I thought it would do was take you on a quick tour through the Covenant blessings and curses this is if Israel was to choose what Adam and Eve for fitted to be faithful to the Divine command that leads to lie there's a hold exploration of what will happen and love all packed with Garden of Eden language and then there is a much longer exploration of what will happen if they fail and it is packed with Genesis three curses and then onward language to throw it away it's really helpful also to see how the early chapters of Genesis inform the language of these chapters though so we haven't reached out
so this is Deuteronomy 28 it's one of the longest chapter in the Torah as all but chapters are chapters are in marker that were added later that's true it's one of the longest literary units okay cuz this really is one literally from what we call verses 1 through 68. So if you all fully obey it's the double you listen listen listen listen to Yahweh Our God and carefully follow all the commands I'm giving you today are y'all way our God will set you high above all the nations of the land like you less end of the heavens will be high above its using this vertical language remember eating is high above all these blessings will come on you if you say ma to Yahweh
 you'll be blessed in the city blessed out in the country this fruit of your womb will be blessed the crops of your land in the young of your livestock the Cavs have you heard the Lambs of your flocks your basket even you're needing balls were you like you do need your do even though we blessed you'll be blessed when you come in and you'll be blessed when you go out and it's important to remember the idea of blessing is connected to abundance the multiplication of Life threat which is given as a gift of God yeah it's kind of intuitive like if you have multiplying flock where did the first ones come from the major multiplying clock while they came from another block where that come from all multiplying things within the biblical worldview and the classic Fiesta worldview all lead back to the First on generated cause
 the source of all life than being a blessing the blessing is something that God possesses within God's Own internal self-sustaining being and then forgot to Grant or donate some self-regenerating power to a finite creature but the Hebrew word for that is better to give a blessing sub God will give ya a blessing and it's the word blessings use 10 times in the words of God that brought water and blasting out of darkness and death in Genesis chapter 1 so notice here the parallelism of city and Country kind of opposites the cities being walled enclosure will be blessed in the city and black diamond City blessing is about human productivity manufacturing communal Village Life clitoris word field
 the medical term yeah Cain and Abel we're out in the field well isn't cane like the classic he built the cities Abel was the one that day he worked in the field chain worked in the field of an enable was the shepherd yeah people are the country people exactly yes this was fascinating farming is a city in the ancient near East and in the Bible is connected with cities and its animal domestic fly per day in this associated with the Roman way out there in the Hills near Sheppard social location for you and me both agriculture farming and like raising hurting animals is associate of the world and city is associated with like cars and public transit yeah I read the building so Abel has the country boy can became the city everyone came to go
 you didn't travel around you centralized around fields and built cities in Mesopotamia cuz it's agriculture surrounding a walled City agricultural is what makes it possible for everybody in the city to specialize in not have to farm to the fireman is happening right up there and then the city protects all the Farms anyway when I first learned that I was like well that is both the walled City and everything in it and the surrounding fields that make city life possible okay this isn't about shepherding Fields I guess it's all good it feels that's just that Hill Side some flips the next about reproductive blessing the fruit of the womb a human productivity and then the crops of the land that is the land's fertility and then
 all of your livestock animals fortuity so the fruitfulness of the human womb is set on an allergy to the fruitfulness of animals Williams and both of those are set on an LG to the fruitfulness of the womb the dirt the Landis set an analogy to the woman you see that here the fruit of the womb the crops of the land area of the livestock you so what the ground produces the ground is viewed as a woman gets worse then the basket and the needing Bowl the baskets of bread and then the were you in a need the dough that you were baking the bread is not blessed is that story later that you use your baskets will always be in some way a well-made as well
 do the basket and that's all that's interesting the word basket is spelled with two of the three letters of the word womb the waitress to have wondered that before but you know this will come up later will be a motif a blessing in the Garden of Eden story The fruitfulness of the garden comes out of the Wilderness and then that's matched by death splitting the human needs to be so they can be fruitful and multiply so the fruitfulness of the land in the fruitfulness of human are paired right there actually in the Garden of Eden story so this is ripping off of that but then the fruitfulness of baskets and needing balls can become an Associated idea so that in the Elijah stories this in in the former prophets and 1st Kings when there's a famine in the land because of Israel's idolatry and thin and so Elijah meets this woman and she's able to have a son and then also she is able to have a jar of oil
 never runs out in the famine and it's ripping off of this idea of the fruitful womb and the fruitful like kitchen but never you know runs out of stuff anyway
 so most of continuous the Lord will grant that enemies that rise up against you will be defeated before you they'll come at you from One Direction but flee and Stephen directions to unified and leave in this unit will send a blessing on your Barnes everything that you put your hand to Yahweh will see you in the land Yahweh will establish you as his holy people as he promised you on Covenant well if if you keep the commands of your God and walking it begins to him and then all the peoples on the land will see that you are called by the name of Yahweh and they will fear you just right there no this being the holy people of Yahweh having that status is conditional on whether or not they keep the command
 that's what's in the middle and then we come back so what does it mean to be the holy people you said apart from all the nations but then here in verse 10 it's so that all the peoples from whom your set apart we'll look at you and see all those are the Yahweh people they have everything they need they have even more than what they need and they're both unique but then they are in a mirror image to all of the Nations who will look at it and go there must be some power source that is generating life in a garden in the middle of the Wilderness I wonder we can get it on any of that that's the idea here was 12 Yahweh will open the skies the storehouse of his Bounty and send rain on your land so the rain can be destructive like in flood or rain can be Showers of blessing you will lend to many nations
 the borrow from then Yahweh will make you the head and not the tail interesting evidence so you're going to be at the lead of the nation's cutting-edge working legal theory in agricultural technology sounds like sounds like he's saying like look be prepared to be the next Empire like you're going to be sure the kingdom of God the Empire of God and the way that like Egypt was as powerful and important they were the head they probably didn't borrow from people they were the first before locking this into Eden imagery Eaton was at the top of the world yet it was the head of the world and actually in Genesis 2 when it talked about the one river that went out for a meeting and then it's separated into four heads same word has human worth head meaning source so Eden becomes the source of all abundance
 life and where do those rivers go out to Four Rivers they go to Egypt you're told they go to Canaan and they go to a Syria in Babylon Yaweh who actually gives all of the source of life to all the empires of the world from the ultimate meeting place of Heaven on Earth the head place which is eaten so it is it's Imperial language kind of but it's more saying it's the Divine source of all human communities then you will become the headwaters of that you'll be the head to town
 so that's pretty sweet offer that's verses 1 through 14 in a way this is an expansion if you're thinking of design patterns of the Torah the single command that Yahweh gave Adam and Eve in the garden which is it from all the trees of the garden like it's all yours but don't eat from the Tree of knowledge of good and bad baby the vet you will share the guy is a pill you so verses 1 through 14 or expanding on the first part of you always come and Adam and Eve eat from all the trees of the garden and you'll have life you'll be fruitful and multiply it on one thing that seems missing to me in this paragraph is the idea of a blessing the nation's so feels really important to me when I think of the story yes and the purpose isn't just to make them great but to make them great to be a kingdom of priests that will bless the Nations
 and here you like the closest you get to that language is this the name of Yahweh will be great and then you can infer from that will then what will that mean for everyone when the name of Yahweh is great for everyone yeah yeah that's a good point you have the same phrase used here this back-and-forth 9 Deuteronomy 28 y'all we will make you his holy people to graphically the phrase used when the previous generation students. Sinai I brought you to myself to make you into a holy nation the kingdom of priests so in Deuteronomy the emphasis is more on Israel's distinctive nothing separation from the nation's but you do get here. We will bless you so that you will lend to many nations like you will become a source of abundance or the other nations lending yeah actually in this is another way that Deuteronomy bookends with Genesis
 back at the other end of the Torah the image of Joseph being the wise Spirit-filled image of God who is exalted in Egypt he becomes the source of Life a blessing in abundance to Egypt in the time of famine but then it's because of Joe says plan and leadership in Egypt the Egypt becomes a source of lending grain all of the Nations around them and that's what brings his brothers from Canaan so I think that's kind of the image here but you're right it's a different idea of becoming a blessing to the nation's is in Deuteronomy closely connected to Israel as a national entity being elevated among them and that's yeah that's just the reality it's also the nature of the setup of this relationship which is God's choosing one tribe in to make them the source of blessing will mean
 no setting them apart to be a nation and then blessing that Nation to be a source of blessing for others in my satisfactorily responding to hear are you saying you kind of wish it was a little more what you got with Terry and language of like I want to bless the nation so I'm going to bless you but here it's kind of like I'm going to make you the special ones and you'll be elevated and everyone else will be a little bit less yeah it's easy to read this and it to feel very focused on their own dominion and then you can just imagine it's been taking his license to just be another Empire like all the others so and it was like that is how many rulers of Israel in judges Samuel and Kings like took it so if you've been reading the whole story the whole Torah you've got all these other ideas in your mind I guess
 I wonder why if I was to write this I would make it a lot more explicit I just wouldn't want people to miss that point yeah yeah but okay so here's what's fascinating is remember
 God's commitment to a tribal National entity called Israel with its being structured as a nation making a covenant to stand by that Nation so that their enemies become God's enemies that's the setup here and that setup is not going to work and from Moses's point of view he knows it's not going to work in from the narrator's the author's point of view you sitting way down the line he's experienced in that when he's already spent it's not working and significantly Israel after the Exile never became a national independent entity again except for the small window in the 1960s
 down to the when Ron came in the 40s BC and there was the maccabean Revolt leading to the about a century of independent rule was that has minions and it seems for with in the Hebrew Bible itself especially the Book of Daniel is that. Was not viewed positively or as a period of faithfulness it was viewed as another failure I think from the author Daniel the author of Daniel is after that I think the final shape of the Book of Daniel is aware of those series of events everything in the mid 100's BC and whether that's awareness is prophetic foresight or the narrator is actually it's kind of like here in Moses that the author the final narrator and also have Daniel actually lived in a drink time those events that's a whole debate about Daniel we don't have to get into right now but my point is that the Israel that is envisioned as being true and faithful to remnant of service
 that's envisioned in the final shape of the Hebrew Bible is not a national tribal entity it is a multi-ethnic dispersed entity that doesn't have a precise geographical boundary so you're saying this ideal being sent out in front of you is it didn't work you're being told a story about the setup of a relationship that didn't work in the author knows it didn't work but it still Bears important message cuz it's part of the family history so I'm even you think of an analogy here would be like okay I'm just going to start my head's this might not work is a parable let's say
 okay this is from real life experience you know how some families learn that throughout their family kind of story that the way they do vacation and Recreation is they like to like try and save up money for an extra property right like a victim and that's the place that you go you know every vacation you go out there for like part of the summer so is Jessica and I were like you know in our old age telling the story of our family and we don't have a house on the coast but let's say the we did you work hard and saving money for it but it ended up being like just a pain in the rear end like and it just was always breaking it cost so much money and it didn't actually serve our family or a vision well and so we ended up selling it and then we would just you know with our adult children cuz like I didn't really work for raising our kids so now we just go meet at.
 at the park with their kids every summer and Rendezvous they bring their families and now it's awesome and we learn that we want to go different places every summer so it would be kind of like that where your retelling the story of a setup that could have been awesome should have been awesome but from the vantage point of the narrator it wasn't and it didn't work but that doesn't mean it was a wholesale failure like they were really important lessons to be learned about it and so we still tell that whole part of the coastal house idea even though now we live in the promised land of vacationing in meeting our kids National Parks every summer and that's the real action is that it would be kind of like that where the final framers of the Tanakh believe that will God has a purpose for Israel is a multi-ethnic dispersed family throughout the Nations that are the Covenant Servants of Yahweh really but they read the hotel read the book of Isaiah the conclusion of the book of Isaiah is Yahweh
 recruiting priests to serve in the Heavenly Jerusalem from all the nations of Genesis chapter 10 of nation really yeah it's a multi-ethnic group of people called the Servants of Yahweh who have been rescued by the servant of Yahweh Isaiah 53 ideal Wellness way it feels similar to the ideal of Adam and Eve in the garden there's the same angst where you wonder what if they just ate from the Tree of Life and then decided to trust God for the knowledge of good and bad and then what if the garden became continues to be the center of human flourishing with that was a story and so you get here and I guess you can have the same reflection which is what if is real did it had been faithful what if they were faithful to the Covenant what if they became is really prosperous
 nation that blessed all the other nations and yell his name became great through it and then all the world was blessed because of it was the same thought experiment and we know that both ya didn't work out that way yeah but back to the end of Genesis what humans planned and what resulted in evil but Joseph says to his brothers U all planned and carried out a scheme that led to people that was evil and led to evil and death but God's got his counter scheme is announced our plan which was for good and the saving of many lives just assess and that's essentially here this is a set-up that Israel will twist towards an evil and leads to death as you reach the end of 2nd Kings and their in Babylonian exile
 but the prophetic authors of the Tanakh say what Israel plant in led the evil God was scheming the ultimate plan of toes of good to leave the saving of many lives and so from the perspective of say the prophets book of Isaiah from the perspective of the final shape of the Psalms where the Book of Daniel what happened as a result of Israel's Exile was the dispersion of Israel throughout the nation's as they waited patiently for the Messianic deliver of the son of man who would regather and reconstitute the family of God's people from among all the nations and that's the message of the final shape of the Hebrew Bible which Jesus in the apostles pick up on but this point in the story is really valuable to Super valuable cuz it's setting the key categories for what God's ultimate purposes which is to create a people who become the vehicle of blessing for all the nations
 but it wouldn't happen through this political Covenant a structure that we're at in the book of Deuteronomy and so that also helps explain why Moses will turn to you and go and it's not going to work this is not going to be that way because that seems like a bad pep talk button the will come back around when we redid around me but in the scheme of this whole storyline of the Bible it is an important message which is why this was an invitation a real invitation this was not how the story will end the threat and it's crucial so the question is how will the story ever end and Eaton yeah I mean if humans and Israel keeps repeating these cycles of you know self-deception we're being deceived allegiance to other powers selfishness
 how are we ever going to escape the cycle like it's great that God keeps offering blessing but like each generation is just repeating and intensifying the failures of his ancestors what's the way out and it seems like the locker room. I sure will power isn't enough you know
so okay so we're back to that moment the pep talk to Moses just said he was a good stuff that you can stuff that will happen vs 15 to 14 verses of like here's the good stuff and blessings through 68 goes through multiple cycles of the bad stuff will the sample however if you don't listen to Yahweh is God and don't follow his commands and decrees I'm giving you today all of these curses will come on you in version of you'll be cursed in the city and cursed in the field
 your basket and you're needing Bowl will be cursed the fruit of your room will be cursed the crops of your land we're just going through the same list you'll be cursed when you come in Crystal you go out and then this is the part is why it's all of you listening didn't listen to the previous episode where we read some ancient other ancient near Eastern Covenant 3D curses this next part is it's nauseating its stomach turning if you just read the section and walked away saying what is God Like You only ever read the second part of Deuteronomy 28 you would be always vindictive angry punishing and it captures and cruel accrual and so it's important to read this as one little tile of a big Mosaic of the Hebrew Bible that renders a portrait of God's character but it is one tile in the Mosaic and I we can't ignore that
 Yahweh takes seriously the evil and the horror of what humans have been perpetually doing to each other throughout human history and the amount of suffering and evil that humans have caused and do to each other and that generates a passionate response from Yahweh that's what's reflected here
 it's also using the kind of conventional like rhetorical style of ancient near Eastern Covenant treaties which was turning up the volume member the killer chickens anyway that's from the previous episode of all so simple here Yahweh will send curses on you confusion rebuke and everything you put your hand to until you're destroyed and come to sudden ruin
 Yahweh will plague you with the diseases until he's destroyed you from the land you're entering to possess so we're like this beginning to sound like the ten strikes on Egypt exactly right Yaweh will strike you with wasting disease fever inflammation scorching heat drought flight mildew the sky will become bronze overhead the ground will become iron meaning no rain and nothing can grow up out of metal okay so no raining no crops
 Yahweh will turn the reign of your land into dust powder like sandstorms you'll be defeated before your enemies you will come at them from One Direction and your family and 7 directions Yahweh Yahweh will afflict you with the boils of Egypt I was one of the ten planks so if Israel becomes the oppressive enslaving I'm just type of community that you just was you will get exactly what he chipped got which is embracing your own decreation verse 36 Yahweh will drive you and the King that you said over you to a nation unknown to you and your ancestors and there you will get what you want you will worship other gods gods of wood and stone and become a thing of horror a byword an object of ridicule among alt Nation
 so you will still become an image to the nation's
 but an image of how not to be a human part of the punishment is to get what you want which is to give your allegiance to other gods and that's because chords and not being obedient is like the first commandment and the logic was the inner logic of it being that if you follow the wisdom of y'all way it will lead to life for your community and then that will become a model of true life to the nation's around
 but if you give your allegiance to these other gods who have a totally different moral vision of what human life is about then it will lead to ruin ruin us human community and so if that's what you want then that's what you will get the point is that worshipping other gods is here a punishment
 framed as a punishment but it is actually the thing that Israel has chosen that led them to all of this in the first place Lisa in the morning so it's another example of God handing the imagery of a canning people over giving them what they want
 you will so much seed in the field but Harvest little cuz the locusts will eat it at one of the plagues of Egypt noticed the Eden inverted eating language now you'll plant Vineyards you will cultivate them it's the word work work the ground from Genesis to but you won't drink the wine will gather the grapes cuz worms will eat them up you'll have olive trees but not get to use the oil the olive drop off you'll have sons and daughters but you won't get to keep them cuz he'll go into captivity locusts will take over all trees
 it goes on but you get the idea you get the two choices here very clear choice to Rhodes life and death Moses in Chapter 30 then this is the moment we're okay we skipped over chapter 29 and 29 where he says and I know you're actually you're not going to be faithful and all these Covenant curses are going to happen
 30:1
 so when all these blessings and curses I've set before you come up on you
 and when you take them to heart wherever y'all will your God has scattered you say spoiler alert and when you and your children return to Yahweh your God when you do listen Shema to him with all of your heart and all of your nefesh you're being according to everything I'm commanding you know if it's the language all the way back in the opening speeches of the Shema Deuteronomy chapter chance when you listen to him I mean the whole tension of the narrative is he always been telling people to listen since the Garden of Eden so what's what's going to change that's going to let them do that yeah like the way the blessing is to listen you're not going to do it but you're not going to do it but then you can get another chance to do it but how's it going to work
 we had your finger like retrospectively Adam and Eve's failure
 it seems like in the narrative it's a real and it is real for them the choice of the have but you the reader your luck now I didn't work out then you get to Israel and we know it didn't work out so what actually this is the Torres way of exploring I think we talked about this before this fundamental tension in the biblical story God's desire to share life and blessing with his image of creatures that's the irresistible Force you always desired a blast
 what happens when an irresistible Force meets an immovable object and the human heart seems like a pretty immovable object by this point so you can return and listen with all your heart and all your soul but like that I was like well let's say that somewhere down the line you do return with all your heart and your soul will then Yahweh will restore your fortune still have compassion on you who gather you from all the nations where he scattered you even if you're banished to the most distant land under the skies from there y'all we will bring you back bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors Yelp possess it will make you fruitful and multiply it's the beating and you're like great but like I'm really skeptical that that's ever going to happen he's about to address the Paradox in the next sentence but he's setting up the Paradox here
 but you can see the tension is building up here is that clear cuz it's kind of important to put your finger on it it is clear so what you're saying is Moses is giving them the opportunity to flourish in the land be blessed by listening to God's commands are being then and then he says and it's not going to it's not going to work out and we know also that doesn't work out and then in this section he saying now there's going to be a moment you're going to be scattered and God's going to bring you back and you are going to listen when you listen to him with all your heart then y'all we will restore you lose any time you're going to be in Exile I can be scattered and you're going to have an opportunity to do it again you're going to be able to listen obey God and then he'll bring you back in and from our vantage point we should be very skeptical that
 this will ever be a reality we are skeptical narrative has taught us to be skeptical about human nature what's what's going to let them actually in any situation in Exile here at the Jordan River even in the garden itself like there's no situation where humans decide to listen and choose life now it's all so if this is being this is Being Framed by those who are in Exile I got her and this is kind of ammo a rally cry moment that's going like that we can we can still do it guys we can still do it yeah we could come back and be the thing that God want us to the community that shaped the Tanakh
 in his final form with this Torah and the Book of Deuteronomy at that as a first third of it sees themselves being referred to by Moses here we are the children of the children of the children who were sitting in Exile among all the nations and is there hope for us to
 we could listen and be returned and that the Eden dream could be realized or are we stuck in this paradoxical cycle of the always giving us the Eden offer and of human nature constantly forfeiting it it's in Deuteronomy 31:6 where Moses plants a seed of the hope of how to escape the cycle and it's a metaphor that's going to get picked up by Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel Hosea Joel it's going to get just worked over in the prophets and turned into just a full-blown hope for the future that Jesus and the apostles were super locked in on
Deuteronomy 30 verse 6 Moses says he will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your seat do descendants so that you can love him with all of your heart and with all of your soul and have life took you just told them when your scattered among the Nations and when you listen to him with all your heart and all of your soul
 then he will have compassion on you but now in this sentence he says you know how you're going to be able to love and listen it's actually always
 yellow is going to do something to your heart that's right and it's the twin paradoxical like twin ideas you're going to do it you have to do it and but look you always going to do something to your heart so you can do it that's right the only way that you are going to be able to do it is if y'all way plays in initiating role in the transformation of your heart but that initiating role in the transformation of your heart won't happen to you automatically you have to realize it and it just in Protestant terms terms of black history of protestant Theology and debate human Free Will and Moses is holding them together as both are necessary both are crucial
 the restoration will happen when you all listen with all of your heart and the way that you will be able to listen with all your heart was if you always does something to your heart and the what my status of the heart is Deuteronomy the first place this metaphor occurs the circumcision of the heart
 it's a weird metaphor weird to us but yes we're just weird it is yeah I think so provocative you know attention-getting MSU so circumcision appeared for the first time all the way back in the Genesis school it was the merciful Judgment of Yahweh on Abraham's genitals for what he did the sexual abuse that he perpetrated on his Egyptian slave Hagar and circumcision was both an active judgment for what he did to haggar but also Yahweh marking the source of this family's future life and reproductive abilities now I'm stand under yahweh's judgment and mercy
 so this is a family whose very existence hangs in the Covenant loyalty of Yahweh and so circumcision becomes an image of a judgment and mercy at the same time kind of like the flood it was both Yahweh bringing judgment on food and this is X McKee this is cool remember I'm the reason for the flood violence on the land Genesis 6 verse 5 Yahweh saw how great was the evil of Humanity on the land every scheme of the purpose of the human heart was evil all the time and then that leads in the next paragraph the land was corrupt in God's eyes and full of violence
 so the human heart which is the seed of scheming that leads to violence and death is
 the Genesis Scrolls diagnosis of what's wrong with humans and that's exactly where Moses takes it here at the other end of the Torah is the healing of the human heart with all of its desires at the Reformation of human desire and will and moral discernment that needs to undergo some rebirth if humans are ever going to be faithful Covenant Partners circumcision is a rebirth removal removed and this image of being cut off
 is both literal of the skin up or skin being cut off but then after Genesis 17 where that phrase appears being cut off becomes the image of death like a death sentence being cut off from Israel cut off from the people and so there's a part of our the something got feeling used the phrase being cut off his a consistent phrase for death or Exile leading unto death to the something it on me that's corrupt I need to remove it send it away there's a part of my desires and what seems logical and good to me actually are leading me to death and get magnified by
 you know hundreds thousands millions of other human choices that are have that same mix of good and bad and if we talk really frankly about humanity and specifically about Abraham this desire to have a big family significance and power have a name in the land the name of the land cause him to sexually abuse someone in the name of what he and Sarah he and his wife thought was good which is to have a flourishing family and so in our imaginations were supposed to connect this idea of the desire to be fruitful and multiply and then this power that males have of their genitals where life comes from but then also becomes a source of pain and abuse and that this ritual of circumcision of removing something
 I'm not casting it away is a sign of taking that thing and saying I want it to be holian into I wanted to be this part of the human male anatomy that is both a source of life and death and pain in the world Yahweh in the form of circumcision with Abraham Yahweh wants to both bring Justice on the evil that is done with that part of the body but also to mercifully Spirit to become the source of life that he made it to be and that's the meaning of circumcision within the Abraham story and so now that same idea is getting apply to male and female young and old
 the human heart okay and then with its desire frame for me the Hebrew understanding of heart real quick because I have no concept of what a heart is yeah but yeah play the video a man will do a better job and I can do right now but in Biblical Hebrew and biblical ancient Israel culture of the heart combines what in our view of the human person is both the place where you have desires
 but at the heart is also where you think you're going to come up with thoughts and ideas and also you agent Hebrew you didn't think with your brain and not with your heart sink in your heart with your heart you also desire and feel in your heart your center of big and also it's where your will and volition and purpose and drive comes from so what we spread out between brain and heart into the way we talk about we primarily talk about her as if somewhere where you feel yeah but if you're thinking or planning or purposing we think of the brain and the Bible that all happens with the heart so this is a is a way that seems good to me it seems like this is the way to life the way I exist in the world yeah yeah I have is your the center of your being the locus of your self is then your heart and something needs to be removed from it
 yeah it's not wholly bad but neither is it wholly good it's a source of Good and Evil and the evil needs to be cut off so that it can be the good image of God absolute can be the source of good and we're talking here about my desires my ideas for how to get my desire for how to meet my desire and then the actual like plans enacted plans so that I carry out because of the ideas that are rooted in my desires but yeah and biblical anthropology desire Central which is why in the Garden of Eden story The Woman saw that it was good and that it was desirable for eating and desirable for gaining wisdom the part of the tour is diagnosis of The Human Condition is about a Mist directed or distorted desire and it's so subtle in self-deceptive especially when she's gone through all the
 people replaying atomies failure in the Torah the most deceptive ones or is when people actually think they're doing the right thing and what they end up doing is bringing pain and death and has Jeremiah will say later the human heart it's like it's sick Jeremiah says he has a disease and who can even know and understand the human heart
 and that's the way of summarizing in one sentence what does narrative Cycles have been doing throughout the Torah so a circumcision of the heart is something that needs to be removed so that it dies so that the real heart that Yahweh knows humans are both capable of and will bring true life so that that can live
 we're right near the same idea that work in the Apostle Paul who will talk about the desires of the Flesh and the desires of the spirit there's the works of the Flesh and the fruit of the spirit how is that connected even the reason why Paul uses it's about cabbie Larry hear of Flesh in Galatians chapter 5 is connected to circumcision of the flesh the foreskin flash is one of the key ways that is referred to in the Hebrew Bible so the works of the Flesh and then he names The Works of the flesh Palmetto parts of you that they needed are corrupted and need to be cut off actually need. They don't lead the life for me for the people around me there's a death that needs to take place but also a merciful resurrection of the true me that leads to life and other reason to do a 34-6 Yahweh will circumcise your hearts
 it will remove all the distorted desire that leads to death so that you may love him with all of your heart and with all of your being and have life so loving and listening to Yahweh is life cuz he he is the one who generates and sustains my existence anyway to be connected to him is life which is what is going to stay here so then verse 9 Yahweh will make you prosperous and all the work of your hands the fruit of your womb Yahweh will Delight in you
 just as he delighted in your ancestors if you listen to our God and keep all of his commands and decrees get this is so good man this is like the high point verse 11 everybody what I'm commanding you today it's actually not too difficult for you which is silly to say at this point not beyond your reach exploring the paradoxica cuz I really think about it like you know this moments where you like I know what I believe is actually true and good in the right thing to do with this is what Paul is exploring and Romans chapter 7 I know it I know what's good and true it's actually not like I can explain to you what are like the most beautiful Ways to Live
 it's not beyond my reach it's right that I can tell you it it's not up in this guy's so that you have to ask who will go up against guys and Proclaim it to us so that we can listen to it it's not Beyond the Sea Moses says you say woohoo has to cross the sea and Proclaim it to us know the word is near you again always word you know it it's in your mouth you recite it every day it's in your heart so you can go buy it look I set before you life and Tove goodness life and good death and Rah where evil the life-and-death good the bad the language of Genesis 2 it says the tree and I command you today love you alway your God
 walk as you listen to him keep his commands to Kris in-laws then you will have life you will be fruitful and multiply and you always will bless you down two verse 19 today this day and Chris is both Moses speaking to his generation but for the authors and every later generation it's like every day is today since today I called the skies in the land as Witnesses against you I set before you life and death blessing and curse choose life so that you and your children can have life and love you always listen to him cling to him this is the word in Genesis to a man will leave his father and mother and cling to his wife
 but now you claim the Yahweh is your spouse Yahweh is your life
 and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give two fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob Yahweh is life that's the line right there what a paradox
 how you doing
 well is it supposed to feel like a paradox you said what a paradox is supposed to feel it cuz it does feel that way well at this point in the narrative there's certainly nothing resolved here but it is saying there is a way to life you always life but it's going to require some kind of transformation of God's covenant partners that
 is beyond their own ability but if y'all way does his part then somehow it is within human ability yeah I think that's what's tricky about this for me right now is so you get to this metaphor of the circumcision of the heart and you did a great job of showing how significant that is because there's a cycle of just failure and so what's going to get was going to change and it's circumcision of the heart is really powerful image but it just sits here as a real yeah yeah what is it how would God circumcise my heart why didn't he circumcised my parents heart yeah why didn't you circumcise Adam and Eve's heart like what is it and when is it going to happen and how is it going to happen and then it's kind of moves on and then Moses says luck you can do it you can do it we can do it we got it we got God's word
 we've got it here we're reciting it like let's do it but I'm thinking no we can't write you just said we can't yet you know whether we're not going to know we're not going to say we're not going to and then there's this thing that something needs to happen something needs to get cut off so we go back to that thing like what type of that thing more instead of just rally me about how I can do it totally yeah it's a good example of how you really need to read the Hebrew Bible as a forward like directing narrative like we're just setting up the problem and intensifying the problem over and over and over and over again and so here we are at the conclusion of the first third of the Hebrew Bible and now we're pointing to their actually could be a resolution
 and we've just been given the core image of it cutting off of a part of the human heart but that's all we got now and so you just got to keep reading into the profits so the profits are going to pick this up and run with it will just touch quickly just alluded to well-known points one is in the Prophet Jeremiah chapter 31 where he talks about how Yahweh is going to make a new covenant it's going to set up a new covenant relationship with his people not like the Covenant we made at Sinai because they broke that Covenant This is Jeremiah 31 33 this is the Covenant I'll make with House of Israel after that time I will put my Torah in the middle of them and I will write the Torah on their hearts I'll be there I'll him they'll be my people just imagine imagine of God's will
 was so Central at the source of my thinking and desires like his will becomes my offer and yes. Exactly yes then Jeremiah says then no longer will Israel need anybody to teach them where they won't say it to another you know what you should get to know you cuz they'll all know me from the least to greatest
 and I will forgive their wickedness cuz they haven't known me to lie trainwrecks and so so that's a Jeremiah talks about it the interior is Asian Ezekiel text this up and develops it and Ezekiel chapter 36 and again I'll just sunrise here but as Ezekiel 36:26 says I will give y'all a new heart and a new roof new spirit so both a new center of desire and feeling and volition or will and then also a new energizing new Energy new an amazing energy I will remove Your Heart of Stone and give you a soft heart flashy heart I will put my spirit in you and make it so that you follow my decrees
 so what's interesting is that Jeremiah kind of highlights that I will write my chore on your heart and you will just do the will if y'all by Jeremiah is kind of balancing and but really naming the human initiative that you will do it in my right the door on your hearts Ezekiel turns out the volume on the Divine initiative
 my spirit will make it so that you will follow my decrees in-laws so they don't solve the Paradox they just get new more developed metaphors for how to and he's our favorite passages for Jesus before the apostles they said this is what happened in the through Jesus and the gift of the spirit and Paul and the offer to the Hebrews sites these two passages multiple times in their letters and say this is the thing that happened with Jesus and the resurrection in the gifts of the Spirit which raises a whole bunch of other
 questions but the biblical story really connects together here at the end of the Torah is so sore like this is a little springboard with Moses is a little final speech here in July 28th is there any as a springboard that just launched its even though the rest of the biblical story so they will become difficult for me is when I try to I want to create like this logical schema of how the whole biblical narrative seems to be working because in a real way I'm being invited into this story to have a transformation and be able to experience this
 that my experience is what we've seen on display which is I can't tell good from bad good enough on my own and I've seen that around me as well that we just are constantly creating violence and oppression in something has to give and so this is a way into a reflection to experience its transformation and so that's really cool
 but when I try to think about maybe a logic and what is God doing with humanity and the long run that's where it starts to just feel uncomfortable and I get a bunch of questions about it seems like what this is saying is God created Humanity
 and in such a way that we are actually incapable to intertwine our will with his well which is what he designed us to do and so that he needs to then transform our will give us a new spirit
 I guess let me say this way God gave us his Rock and deformed us and he gave us being in life and it said work and keep the garden with him to his life choose life and now we're being told actually that wasn't good enough you're going to need a new spirit and you're going to need a transformation of your heart baby my question is is that an oversight that's the puzzle I want us off like I wanted to all make sense like what I wide why is human history has to be the long stick call yeah peating yeah Trainwreck yeah yeah I'm with you I think in a way if my assumption is that the Bible is going to give me answers to all of my questions then I think you can see that reflux and different kind of Christian and Jewish traditions
 the really turn up the volume on God's Divine sovereignty in it I think where that leads logically is saying it's impossible that humans could have ever fulfilled and God knew that and plans that and that's part of the divine plan and out of the huge train wreck befallen us God will select just a few to enjoy the new Eden the new creation that's a very having it and then that is both Jewish and Christian
 Traditions that have gone that direction however there have also been Jewish and Christian Traditions that really focus on the real possibility of humans doing it right in partnership with God's mercy and the every generation that that's possible and there's been options to go that direction to in the fact that both offshoots would seem like opposites can be generated out of the same Bible to me as a sign that it's more that the story is putting its finger on and giving a realistic portrait of what every generation of the Human family. Says which is it seems like it should be possible to partner with the way things are in the world to bring about life and goodness but it just keeps crashing in on itself personally and individually and the community over the course of many generations and I think I don't know my way currently putting it is that the Hebrew Bible is much more like a
 diagnosis for realistic diagnosis while also saying but if anything exists in the first place it's because of God's generous Act of sharing his being in life that goodness and so if God did that once God can do it again to bring about new creation and we get tastes of that every time I actually choose to Love My Neighbour as myself even I don't do it as often as I ought to but I know that it's possible and I know that if I were to surrender some part of me that's is the obstacle and allow parts of me to die that God could do something in me and in us that would you know that would lead the way forward into new creation and the biblical story just doesn't
 I don't think let you go down either extreme without trying to herd you back a little bit right to the center and keep us hopeful that it will be humans that will be responsible in the renewal of creation and that responsibility will only happen because of the merciful initiative of God and I don't know I'm just naming the Paradox yeah but it's real and both are emphasized in the Bible in a way that doesn't easily resolved yeah and I think that this reflects I have to obsess about the Paradox and try to figure out the the will of God and how he's work with Humanity misses what you said beautifully is the diagnosis and also the invitation of
 saying you've experienced this and there's this opportunity to have a renewed heart and new energizing life new rock and you can take it and then that brings us to for us the story of Jesus and what does it mean to take that what does it mean to be transformed by that it's been wrapped up in hell yeah that's right because I am an atom I am a human all of Humanity's cycles of opportunity and failure are happening in seed form in the story of Adam and have a human and life so even in a way you could just meditate on the Eden story it's like this place to focus in on the Paradox and I don't know well it's in this way that Moses is called the language of today and was interesting with the school actually in Psalm 95 the poet of Psalm 95 will retell the story of Esther
 failures in the wilderness and then the poet says today
 don't Harden your heart listen today and then in the New Testament the author of Hebrews picks up that today and says to these Messianic Jews living you know when the house church and we're not quite sure and says that today of Psalm 95 is for you all sitting here hundreds of years later today is it today so it says if every generation is to see itself if the invitation the invitation right there's a diagnosis here and the point is the invitation you can be like why did God create Adam and Eve this way why did God Harden Pharaoh's heart why did all these different questions you have yeah but it's all bringing you to a moment to say hey this is going on in me and I have I have something to do thank you thank you just put your finger on something that I think is really important in other words speculating about why God did XYZ or why didn't God give Adam and Eve the real chance if he knew they would fail in a way it's
 kind of like
 the word abdicate abdicated the focusing in on like what God didn't provide Adam and Eve with so that they could have made the right decision in a way that the way of abdicating my responsibilities in the present to today make a decision to choose life and blessing and goods instead of death curse in other words it's a way of like offloading my responsibility and the fact that Moses says today in the POTUS on my if I said no no no it's for you all today and then the author of Hebrews says actually it's about you all today like every one of us it's about today yeah I think that's exactly right by me if sussing about how this all work did they really have the opportunity was the invitation to the Israelites to take the land and be the nation was that a red herring all of that is trying to make sense of something
 which is okay I have my brain wants to make sense of things but it might distract me from the decision that you have to make today and Moses said they can make the decision this decision was a friend of them how the decision was front of them whether God could change their hearts whether that could have happened I can ruminate on that but if that distracts me from the invitation front of me today yeah that's exactly the dynamic going on here yeah let's not trick ourselves into like thinking that we're not included in the you being addressed today here at the end of Deuteronomy 30 and every generation has its own Adam and Eve Choice set before them and that's how the whole Book of Proverbs setup is that every generation
 has the choice to choose lady wisdom who is the tree of life and embrace the wisdom of Proverbs where to choose you know lady Folly leads to death and yeah there's nothing for it in a way the Hebrew Bible reminds me of sore like that stage Guru who you know the Young Learners comes with all the questions and they're all agitated and the guru just like answers with more questions and refuses to answer because it will actually wants to lead you to whole new categories of thinking and living and that you provide for his kind of like that in my experience
 especially with this question of design sovereignty in human free will
 I know we're over but it might be nice to end with a reflection on Jesus and I'm just thinking Romans 10 or uf's on the decision to hard yeah okay yeah yeah I kind of want to read that again just in life where we've been yeah so One Call Away this final speech of Moses and Deuteronomy 30 gets picked up the New Testament is the Apostle Paul in Romans chapter 10 and and Romans 10 or 5 Paul is riding to the house churches around and he says Moses wrote this about the righteousness that is by the Torah the words right standing with God that happens by being faithful to the Covenant terms of the Torah Moses rides the person who does these things will have life by means of them according from Leviticus 18 here so just live by the command of the Torah and you'll have life
 but the righteousness that comes by faith or trust says and then he quotes from Deuteronomy 30 or just part of the tourist there's right Daniel was God that comes by obeying God's commands but Narrative of the tour itself is saying yeah nobody is it was doing that yeah you need a circumcision of the heart that's right but then he says there is a right standing with God that comes by just trusting in the generous promise of God and let him not trust reshape you top to bottom and he also appeals to the Torah for that idea to the Abraham stories in Genesis does Deuteronomy 30 and he says he quotes Moses saying don't say in your heart who will go up into the sky that is to bring the Messiah down
 or who will descend to the deep that is to bring the Messiah up from the dead but what does Moses say the word is near you it's in your mouth it's in your heart Paul concludes this is the message about face that we've been announcing if you say with your mouth Jesus he is Lord and Trust in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be rescued
 rescue from your from your heart get rescued from your Yap rescued from death and your distorted desires that lead to death the distorted desires that time seven billion humans are leaving us all to death so complicated passage door cuz he's pulling a number of really cool moves here but his point is the same is that the good news about Jesus's resurrection from the dead and trusting that the Risen Messiah is my life he is opened up the way to life and if I just trust and confide in their trust and give my allegiance to and follow him then it will result in life
 he is saying and I'm fairly complicated way that the death and resurrection of Israel's Messiah for all the nations is the life that Yahweh offers to his people that solve the way forward cuz Jesus was a human who actually did listen and love and receive life and now that life is a gift to the people of this probably opening up another Pandora's Box yeah just by going here but you get the basic idea
 a movie that is it that do what you want to do
 so with that diagnosis and the portrait of the only hope that humans have to be God's faithful Covenant Partners Moses actually doesn't stop talking he has to pain but he's going to order that are really really fascinating and cool and then he's going to die and the story of his death is full of riddles and really cool stuff so that's what we'll do next but I think it's just good to pause so much to ponder and meditate on here in these Covenant curses and blessings thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're wrapping up the Deuteronomy scroll they're not the wrapping up the entire Torah and we're going to look at how Israel has an opportunity to do Adam and Eve failed to do to remake a sort of Garden of Eden in a new land under the leadership of Joshua Moses was 120 years old when he died his eyes were not wheat
 strength gone this Israelites grieve for Moses in the plains of Moab for 30 days until the time and weeping and mourning is over now
 Joshua son of nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him today's episode of helps with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Dan Campbell Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza provided the annotations for annotated podcast in our pain Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus so everything that we make is to that end and everything that we make is free because it's already been paid for by thousands of people dislike you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us this is Clyde's Dharma and I'm from Sacramento California I first heard about the Bible project through YouTube and from then on I never missed an episode.
 while I read through the Bible my favorite thing about Bible project is its illustration my favorite thing about the Bible project Ida podcast for Tim and John friedrichs found the topics and themes of their videos project by people like me find free videos study notes
