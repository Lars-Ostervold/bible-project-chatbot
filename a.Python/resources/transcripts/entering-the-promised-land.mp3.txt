we are on our last stop in the scroll of numbers the wandering through the Wilderness is over the 12 tribes of Israel are at the East Bank of the Jordan River the ready to pass through the waters and make their home in a New Garden land the land promised to them except two and a half tribes they look around at the East side and they think you know this Landing bad maybe we should just stay here they steal and that is not the land that God said is there has been here but they see It'll and that it's good for their animals and then they asked could it be given to us as we've been reading the Hebrew Bible we've been trained to notice that when humans see something as good it often leads to a foolish choice and destruction humans are really bad at the surname good from bad and the archetypal story that teaches us this is the woman at the tree seeing the fruits Desiring
 taking it by the time you're in numbers this is happened dozens of times the woman at the tree moment the language there has been used in later stories to set up an analogy to The Taking of something that got his head that's not the thing for you to take this story is a wonderfully accurate portrayal of the complexity of life that we often confuse good with bad and that we don't immediately see the ramifications of our poor decision The Narrative doesn't explicitly come out and say that it's wrong and a bunch of them flourish on the east side of the Jordan first entry and you know why is this wrong the narrator doesn't say it strong but our foolish decisions will catch up to us in the book of Kings when the Empire of us Syria start chomping into Israel's territory can you just guess which tribes are picked off into Exile first to learn how to really discern good from bad we need to fear the lord the portrait of human nature over and over in the Hebrew Bible is that we
 either don't want to receive the gift as given or we forfeit that gift and take some other things that we think it's real good gift that's what the story fits into I'm done calling Bible project podcast in today to Mackey and I conclude the final movement of the scroll numbers thanks for joining us here we go
hello Tim John hi and hello and we are talking to her here we are talking to her we are at the end of the number scroll which means we're getting close to the end of the Torah you believe in the great irony I really enjoyed it so I'd like to just jump in and give ourselves as much time as possible so maybe as briefly as you can participate in his last words for yeah where we're at in the Torah and we're in the scroll numbers the Torah tells a story from creation to the Israelites sitting just outside the promised land on the east side of the Jordan River ready to go into it that's the narrative Arc and ends with the death of Moses, tour ends Genesis and Deuteronomy are the outer
 cross the first one in the last ones are frame around the story for reasons we talked about it at length in the previous episodes the three Scrolls inside Exodus Leviticus and numbers are unimportant three-part unit narrating Israel's Journey out of Egyptian slavery through the desert to Mount Sinai that's Exodus Leviticus is all at Mount Sinai and then the numbers scroll is them leaving Mount Sinai going through the desert and then about to enter into the promised land and that journey through the desert was supposed to take less than two weeks to 40 years because of the seven rebellion of the Israelites in the wilderness actually 7 + 1 there was accommodating one after the 7 but the seven or all arranged and that we had talked about those
 and so here we are in the final movement of the numbers to all these three movements two numbers they are starting Mount Sinai and they prepare the camp for travel with the Tabernacle in the best friend not just the Tabernacle and the 10th because the presents in their midst and then you think that's a great thing so then they leave and they start going through the Wilderness and they consistently Rebelle in ways that Echo and replay and intensify their first Rebellion when they first got to Mount Sinai with the golden calf and the Wilderness rebellions on the previous side of Mount Sinai things are not going well but God is merciful and just in how he deals with them and so the whole generation that left Egypt slavery in Egypt redeemed you know by Moses I'll text you the story that whole generation dies off and it's the children who were just little kids when The Exodus happen they're the ones who
 now I standing before Moses at the final movement of numbers and they've reached the border of the land promised to Abraham and they're being given laws that will prepare them for entering into the land so what's cool about numbers is has three big Parts they started Mount Sinai and it's Preparing People for traveling the second part is the travel and then the third part is they've got to their destination and now they're preparing for their last step of the travel which is end of the land and so all the preparations and the section were looking at preparations for the living in the land with Yahweh dwelling in our mist is parallel to the first movement which is preparing the camp to travel with Yahweh in our midst so it's all about the people going through the Wilderness from a mobile migrant kind of community and then the third movement is about them becoming
 landed were settled community in the land but the focus is on if y'all was in your midst you have to arrange the camp in a certain way if you always in your message you're going to have to arrange your land in a certain way because you were playing host to presence of God summary we've done in a long time significance of all of this on one level is this is these are the stories of Israel's beginnings and it tells the story of why they matter for them have their own identity but then at another level this is actually teaching us about what God is intending to do through Israel for the whole world for the whole world right that's right and is that bigger frame of the cosmic frame of the story is what you get when you compare set the story of Israel within the story
 of God and all humans and all the nations that what the prologue to the Torah in Genesis chapters 1 through 11 Concepts the chord pattern and actually this traveling in and out of the land and through the Wilderness is all set on analogy to the first stories in the Torah which was about God appointed in human representatives in the heaven on Earth Place those human representatives are foolish Adam and Eve don't trust and do what God commands them to do and it leads them to Exile outside the land where instead of having life they are slowly being killed off outside the land and so this whole story of Israel is about God at work to restore one family to the blessings of Eden
 so that threw them to eat in blasting can spread to All Nations and so the story of Israel in the wilderness has been all about trying to get his real to embrace this invitation but God has given them to come back into the eating presence of God to restore with Adam and Eve lost and they professionally fail which keeps them wandering in the wilderness just like Adam and Eve were exiled Into the Wilderness to this moment that we come right now at the end of the numbers scroll is standing essentially as it were at the gates of Eden again where is there standing at this River the River Jordan cross the river and go into this Rich Garden lands that God wants to give them as a gift is all set on analogy through verbal hyperlink. It's as if Adam and Eve are standing at the gates of Eden about to cross over one of those rivers that came out of the garden to go into bed or Cain and Abel Cain and Abel that's right you are offering
 what other yeah I mean this setting is a pattern that shows up a lot in many different ways we read stories where someone runs into the Tabernacle and goes past the Altar and stands at the curtain that opens to the holy place and the story takes place there and that's the same idea as the setting of the correct the door to the to God's holy place the tent of the Tabernacle had two sets of curtains doors that each had decorations on them that told you you're standing at the boundary of having a nurse at the boundary of Exile and eaten and to go into the tent is to return to Ethan and so that story being played out ritually at the heart of Israel's Camp is going to be a story now that's going to play out at the heart of their Land once they go into the land in the form of the tent that will eventually become a temple so there's a cosmic significance to this moment
 getting here at the river at the border yeah does historical significance or there's a significance for the story of ancient Israel but then there's a cosmic significance and when we come to these stories as Torah I was teaching tell us about what it means to be human that's that Cosmic significance that becomes really interesting totally that's right so with all that in mind that this new generation of Israel returning into the garden land is like a little picture of the return of Adam and Eve then all Humanity into the Garden of Gods life enjoy that's awesome that's what this last movement from numbers 26 to 36 kind of how it all fits together everything is about once you're in the land here is how you want to order your life to reflect that you're playing host to the Eden presence of God so we began our conversation in this
 part numbers with exploring the first three stories which were about a new census that numbers the new generation then a story about how life in the England is going to begin restoring things that have been broken or that will require new wisdom to apply God's laws from the past in new situations or unforeseen and so that story about the daughters of zelophehad into this law and through this meditation and new revelation of God's wisdom is that women and men will become responsible for land in a way that the previous laws didn't specify which is I think of restoring an Adam and Eve Mutual authority over the land which is the image of god poem in Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 to 28 that the image of God is both male and female combined together then we have the story about Joshua filled with the spirit by the God who gives
 beer at 2 all-flash that's what Moses called of God in this story about Joshua being filled with the spirit so now Josh was being depicted as the new human the new Adam called the lead the animals that is this real-life or called Sheep into the land and then you get a long list of offering for all of the feast days that are listed by numerals of seven the seventh day in the seventh month the 7th annual feast and all of a sudden life inside the land is depicted as like a new Eden to all these hyperlinks leading to a new Seventh-Day rest in the land of Israel will just trust and do what God says it's a big F
 but that is the that is the set up there we had previously been told about these feasts days but there's some more information here bright and then it kind of seems like it's trying to land of the new level two which is these feasts days weren't just to set you apart but also it's a way to embrace eat in life which is why they're filled with Eden and garden symbolism imagery in rituals practices but also packed with images that Mark the cycles of Israel story on the way to this moment so Passover was about Exodus relevant Passover is one of the feast and it's about how God provided Israel when they were in slavery and God was bringing Justice and letting pharaohs evil in the death he Unleashed come all back on Israel on Egypt's head but God provided the house you can go into the house and
 in a paint the door post with the blood of a blameless substitute and God will show mercy and give life instead of handing that house over to death so that little image of the house says The Refuge is talked about in this list of Feasts also talked about in this list of feast is the day of atonement when God will forgive and show Mercy on the whole camp or landed Israel if the life of a blameless substitute is brought before y'all way in the tent so very similar to the Passover in the house but then if you have a substitute in the tent and you always will look on that substitute and that their blamelessness will cover for the sin of the money and then you also in this list get the image of the Feast of Tabernacles which was an image of how they Journey Through the Wilderness God kept providing surprise water and bread and food for them it was like
 their Camp became a little safe Refuge tent a blessing and water and food as they were surrounded by a desolate lifeless Wilderness we're talking about its Numbers chapter 28 and 29 and what you just get is a list of these feast days and all these extra offerings but each of us feast days hyperlinks back to earlier parts of the Torah that established does feast packed with symbolism and there's a commonality to it that life is dangerous but we're outside of Eden crazy out here man we're dying dying we get sick or killing each other that's exactly where we're going to go yeah we're killing each other so God will hand
 all communities over to the violence and evil they've Unleashed in the world and bring their evil Outback on their heads that's what Passover retails God will if Israel sinned and all their sins against each other begin to create so much violence and impurity and evil in the land God will hand the whole people over to their self-destruction but if there's a blameless substitute offered on the day of atonement it's like a reset it's a dangerous Wilderness out there and they're scorpions and Thorn bushes that'll pick your likes on man I did a wedding for a friend in Arizona recently in our whole family went for the weekend and it was really fun but my eight year old son we were the hotel we're staying at at this really cool little kind of nature Wilderness Refuge area right next to the end with cool walking trails in the you know Arizona desert
 desert rabbits and coyotes and it was really cool walked into a cactus he was so taken with this animal that he didn't see there is a cactus in front of him and poor I feel so bad for him is good job. Yeah totally and actually a few of the barbs got into his pants and then as we were walking back the kind of work through his pants and starts ticking into to his leg and we have to get back to Weezer's and taking Barb's out of his a terrible experience for him is not a kind play Scorpions in the lizard man though it's dangerous it's dangerous outside eating both because of the environment and because of how humans treat each other in land of scarce resources so what is veeser about is about God continually providing little Eden refuges in the house
 in the tent in the camp where God will give a little Eden gift in the middle of the Wilderness and so these are all the images being brought to your mind in Numbers chapter 28 and 29 which is one of the most boring sections of the Torah to read cuz it's just a long list of offerings given at Festival days yeah yeah you really got a nerd out the fun is in that toy so also it seems that this is preparing us that wild this is the Gate of Eden this isn't it's not going to unite have an Earth-like Eden was that's right they're going to still celebrate these feasts which are anticipating still a future Union of Heaven and Earth that's the camp has been a temporary Eden Outpost in the middle of the wilderness
 and they're about to move into a land that will become an even more robust Outpost okay for Eden so that again all the way back to Genesis 1 through 11 and promised Abraham so that Genesis 12:3 so that threw this family the Eden blessing could be made available to all the families of the land that's the but since this family has made us humans who act just like the humans who foolishly forfeited Eden in the same way this family is going to have a whole bunch of choices to make whether they're going to really experience Eden in this land so all that kind of being said there's a lot we could do in the final chapters I just wanted to jump in at two moments highlight 2 1/2 tribes of Israel they decide they want to eat in life in the land but they want it on their own terms and in territory that they've made for themselves
 and so it's really interesting story about the tribe of Reuben Gad and half tribe of Manasseh and then also I want to spend a little time meditating on the 42 cities given over to the Levites in the land and then six more that are called the Cities of Refuge to become little Passover houses and they of atonement tent and Tabernacle the safety in the middle of a dangerous land so that's where we got to eat I'm in cat
so the setting again is Israel on the east side of the Jordan River about to go into the land Gates of Eden and the land actually that was promised to Abraham that they're going to be like the Garden of Eden 2.0 the boundaries of that land have been described back all the way to when Abraham was first promise that Land by God the boundaries were described multiple times and in none of those boundaries did the land east of the Jordan River ever get mentioned
 another words what they are now where they're sitting at this moment in the story was never included in any of the official boundaries now there were some Kings some called Amorite King to King actually they were giants to Kingsland was named was sick on and the other one was named ugh which is just a great Ancient King named Christopher giant toilet yeah so great so when Israel Kaman camped at the spot these two things we like and not in my land and so they went out and tried to start a war with them and Israelites defeated them and so this whole part of the story is you know they're in the safe little Refuge of land because they were able to overcome the Giants that tried to kill him
 The Numbers chapter 32 begins and we're told that the sons of Reuben and the sons of God had a lot like a lot of animals big big hurts and they saw the land of yeah they're in the land of gilad that's the land of the two kings that they just conquered and they saw that this is a place that is good for livestock
 why go any farther if they've got some good Meadows right here why do we need to cross that River this looks good in my eyes so the sons of God in the sons of ribbon came and spoke to Moses and the Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation and they said you know all these land and these hillsides in the towns which is Blended we just Concord from this to King's that's a land great for grazing and you know it's really what a coincidence we have a lot of animals so could we find favor in your eyes and could you give to us this land as a possession so that we don't have to cross that River but who are they talking to talking to Moses and the high priests and Elders so do you catch it that they have a lot of animals they have been fruitful and multiply. They have been given great abundance but they see a land that is not the lamb
 the guide said is there a student here at but they see It'll and that it's good for their animals and then they asked could it be given to us to see the parallels the parallels to Eden can you feel this is a woman at the tree moment right yeah she saw now the word good is that a suitable title in what are we in and nasb correct yeah doesn't appear but the phrase they saw that the land was and then they ask let it be given to us okay what is the let it be given I can't remember that phrase in his when the woman saw that the tree was good for food desirable to the eyes desirable for gaining wisdom so she took from the fruit and she ate and then she gave to her husband and he also here in this scenario
 you have people who have just been given abundance gift of animals and some land but it's not the land that God said they're supposed to take and they see that it is this is a place that could be for us and they ask that it be given to them but I know this is settled but by the time you're in numbers this has happened dozens of times that the woman at the tree moment that the language there has been used and later store is to set up an analogy to the illegitimate taking of something that God has his head that's not the thing for you to take but they want it to be given to them yeah I can see it is really subtle but you're saying that this is how this literature works at this point you've seen this so many times you just need a few notes that's right to get you there totally yeah it's like think of any of the great movie trilogies develop soundtrack and so you just need a few
 call notes of a certain characters theme by the time you're in the third movie your lie it's well-established so you can just kind of I always bring up Star Wars so I won't even though I just dissed the Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker Melody not kind of thing so look at Moses response he can see what's going on here check this out. Moses said to the sons of God that's done to ruin what you're saying all your brothers are going to cross that River into hostile territory and go to war and you all are just going to sit here why are you discouraging the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land wherever this is what your father's did your replaying the failures of your father's remember when I sent the spies Cottage Barnett to see the land and they went up to the valley of grape cluster and they came back and they discourage the sons of Israel's to not go into the land that's what you're doing right now
 this is Moses like making a very very clear hyperlink to feel like we're replaying a story I'm going to tell you exactly what's going on in that story buys go into the land and they see the fruit of the land on the trees that it's good and they take it and then they bring it back and then they discourage the other is why I'm going in so that was so clearly modeling of the failure of Adam and Eve of the tree that story back in the numbers 13 and 14 and so this story which began with very subtle Echoes of the woman at the tree but now it becomes explicit that makes sense, and where it'll be a subtle at go over earlier story
 and you're just supposed to catch it but just in case you didn't hear was a very explicit one that models back to the story that itself was modeled on the tree so Moses gives this long speech I mean and says listen you're going to destroy us all through this illegitimate taking and so they decide to come up with the compromise they say okay how about we are going to build here sheepfolds for a livestock will build cities for a little ones and so we will go into that land before the sons of Israel and our families will stay here and we will not return home until every one of the sons of Israel gets their inheritance on that side of the river
 and some Moses says okay well if you do what you're say you're going to do then that's fine you can have this land over here but if you don't be sure that you've sinned against you and your sins will find you for boating okay so what's cool about this is this getting Nerdy with hyperlink stuff but this is how this works remember how in Genesis Chapter 3 The failure of Adam and Eve at the tree that ended up with the two who are supposed to be one the man and woman to become one but their failure ends with their division to the first thing that happens after they take from the tree as they see that they're naked and instead of their nakedness being something that brought them together
 it becomes what divides them cuz the first thing to do is hide their bodies from each other with the leaves the cycle is that when humans do what's good in their eyes is inevitably leads to a conflict of interpretations of what is good and bad and all of a sudden the division because of you know you don't feel safe being vulnerable so that same story is played out in Genesis 4 in the story of the sons and one son wants the good thing that God is giving to my brother to Cain the Sprite angry about the blessing given to his brother he wants it for himself and so he doesn't act that like divides them into my permanent way you murdered his brother if it doesn't get my permit in that and then what God says to him is listen
 right before he murders his brother it says listen sin sin is crouching at your door and it wants you but you can rule over it came doesn't rule over it and so when you murders his brother you the reader go out that was sent that was an active since the first time the words than appears in the Bible and then what happens is Kane all of a sudden says to God when God comes and asks like where is your brother and he says men in my the protector of my brother my brother's keeper and then he says oh man I've murdered my brother my sin is too heavy for me to carry it whoever finds me out here outside of Eden is going to kill me and take my life and so what God does is that okay I'm going to protect you seven times over and be the sign for you in the nose doesn't say what the sign is in the canes next response to that is to go build himself a city to protect himself from any one who will
 so what we're seeing right here is these two tribes are replaying both the failure of Adam and Eve and also the failure of Kane because this illegitimate seeing Desiring and taking what God has not given for them to take is going to lead to a division within the tribe's
 now the land that was supposed to be for all of them together will be only for the 10 and a half and it will be for two and a half over on this side that they've carved out what does eating in their eyes and this leads to a division in the brothers and noticed that the use of the word sin here Moses says this is a sin against God and a sin against your brothers and they said no no no no about this will build cities for ourselves over here we'll build our own little cities and we'll protect ourselves over here and I sure it's kind of like this it's not a full but it's not like they're not murdering their brothers yeah they're like will help you out but we want to protect ourselves over here we want this stuff over here we'll build our own cities of protection and Moses says I don't know man this bad idea he says it first it's like not a good idea but then the compromise he seems to be kind of cool with it
 cool with it but can you see you is the reader you're like oh man it was supposed to be the 12 Brothers over there living in unity in the new Eden hookah it's not going to be that anymore so as a reader your kind of picking Moses don't let him compromise either that or it's a good example of how through the narrative subtlety the ideal that God wants for his people keeps getting chipped away at and tarnish and fractured and compromise sometimes a huge with and then sometimes like this in a little ways and so now you've got divided brothers and the two-and-a-half living on the east side will I and a half of it just keeps talking about Dad and Ruben it's trip yep and then that's right almost all the way through the chapter and then by the end of chapter 32 verse 33
 half of the tribe of Manasseh joins in on the party's over on that east side but what Moses Warren's is listen if you weren't faithful to your promise your sin will find you out crouching and wants to have you and it will fight like Cain was talking about like whoever finds me out here will kill me
 Sousa School merging of the language of the cane story but in a creative with the twist you know it's not brother murdering brother but it's brother abandoning and I would I didn't even go help out but really we wanted to be over here and have the little Eden in our own eyes
so Ruben egad have tribe of Manasseh they agree that they're going to help but they're going to build their own cities on the other side and we've got this foreboding feeling now if this isn't good this is a splintering of the Brotherhood of the unity of God's family entering into eaten and what happens today they do they do cross the river and they go help the other tribes settle in the land and if there's hostility from Canaanites which there is then they fight in this battle is not their brothers and his all told in the Book of Joshua so we don't read this here no no and Joshua 22 is when all this place until their promise right okay then and Joshua 22 they say okay we're done we should tell the promise we're going back to our little self-made eaten on the east side and there's another well with the rabbit hole but there's another potential conflict but they fix it and the reconcile and then they go east fascinating
 is that all the way later in the book of Kings when the Empire of us Syria start stomping into Israel's territory can you just guess which tribes are picked off into Exile first is if you guys these two and a half tribes in 2nd Kings starts and chapter 13 that's internal bleeding out through 20 is all about the rise of the Assyrian Empire and there's a little narrative there that tells you that is exactly these two and a half tribes them to alter the kingdom. There were tribes on the east side of the Jordan and it's interesting because the narrative doesn't explicitly come out and say that it's wrong right and they having a bunch of them flourish on the east side of the Jordan freed hundreds or centuries but I think so the narrative even these little subtle Echoes of Adam and Eve's failure in Africa
 enable story their ways of painting this with kind of foreboding colors that's it we're very like well is this wrong the narrator doesn't say it's wrong Moses think it's wrong but then make make a compromise so is that okay but just the fact that the language is the Eden story in the Cain and Abel story as he is makes you think this is not going to work out well and lo and behold by Scrolls later in the Torah and Prophets yeah you realize that it was a poor choice stop here we're going to go to another story in the last movement but if we stop here and we think okay what is this teaching us noses Torah yeah what it what is it like yeah yeah God wants to give good gifts to his children those good gifts often
 Force God's children into decisions about how and whether they will receive the gift as it's given the portrait of human nature over and over in the Hebrew Bible is that we either don't want to receive the gift as given we want to receive it by some version of our own terms or we forfeit that gift and take some other thing that we think is the real good gift and it ends up bringing diminished life or even death and disappointment instead of life and I think that's what the story fits into is hey here's the land over there straight there it's right in front of me is good and what if we could take that and kind of make our own version of the thing that God said he wanted to give us over there I think that's the portrait yeah and it's
 what does hardening in a way because man like you can empathize with them a little bit they've gone this far and they just want a battle so everything looks like okay. Other side they just secured his territory that's right and I mean it's just it's a small River I mean terms of a boundary line like it's not a big river and they're in beautiful Meadows they're there it's kind of like you can imagine we've been on a camping trip like you for your hiked 15 miles and it's like we were going to set up camp over that feather river boat look like there's a fire pit ready look at they left some wood
 and it's like surely surely that's can't be that a big problem this is the dynamic when you're backpacking and your life is pretty good spot is there a better spot over there maybe you're like you have your friend is like yeah I think I remember there's a really good spot over there and then you take your bag off and you're like still there and if you think about this is just like The Human Condition or if you think about it just life it's just so hard I can empathize with the situation where you're like okay God I feel like
 the mission you given me or the calling or the whatever it is is this big beautiful thing but look at where I'm at right now look at this opportunity right here doesn't this work it's beautiful like it it seems like eating and then you a story like this or even Moses himself it's kind of like well okay I guess if you do this and that and you helped us out in this way like I'm sure like everyone's getting confused and it sounds like you're saying is the Bible is very subtly kind of teaching you this will become a big problem not now not today many generations down the line many generations down the line that it is I mean you just you said disheartening earlier and yeah that's one way that I can make you feel another way you can make you feel this this is very real
 we're exploring the sloak emulation of cause-effect patterns of generational choices overtime and how one small deviation from wisdom in one generation can create huge fax down the changes in here it's the deviation is from what God Said like the land is over there but this is another version of the women at the tree it looks good it looks like it's good for gaining wisdom and I bet it tastes great right why would you not want me to have this tree here it seems like it's a good as the one over there where that same moment again in the story
 yeah so I mean I guess it's a disheartening because it's like so who Among Us can actually listen to God's word and like follow through this is Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane why would the Father Tell me to die that really what you want it's not what I want I don't want to die I don't want to live I want to have life but what if the choice is between what looks like life and then ultimate life but the way the ultimate life looks like nonsensical or even crazy where death right that's an extreme form of the same moment when Jesus is facing his test is Choice list of the name of the test right here for the two tribes this is their moment at the tree
 M&M in the garden in the test of Cain and Abel now you said earlier that there is more Echoes of Cain and Abel later and this with Matt yasso chapter 26 to 32 or kind of one big block of the first big block this last literary movement what comes right after this is chapter 33 of numbers but also might be among the more boring chapters of the Torah to read it's a complete list of all of the travel camps that is real camped in from Egypt all the way to this moment in the story and I forget the list it's 50 plus straight-up list with a couple narratives and so that's chapter 33 and that's like the pizza is actually like a summery cuz we're reaching back all the way to exit us and we're recapping their whole journey up to this spot at this time so that's the pivot and then beginning with chapter 33 verse
 to the end of the numbers scroll is the final kind of literary unit and it's all about how Israel is to the nine and a half tribes and their to Mark out the borders of the land here's the land borders of the land on the other side of Jordan here's the 12 tribal leaders who are going to organize the land here's the process of doing it going to roll more of those dice or the steak or diced the Lawton and then right in the middle of the section is chapter 35 and it's all about the special cities sacred special Cities of Refuge that you were to put in the middle of the land and that is so cool yeah so let's pick that up
number 35 verse 9 let's just dive in the Lord spoke to Moses thing speak to the sons of Israel and say to them when you cross the Jordan to go in the land of Canaan then you shall select for yourselves cities that will become Cities of Refuge this word refuge the unique word in Hebrew Hebrew word michelet in a refuge is a core biblical image the modern word we have for this is a phylum cities of Asylum designated buildings is this for immigrants often for like political exile for example if they go to another country or another land safe there and they can't be arrested by the governing authorities from the place they fled for I see there's a similar idea going on here but I don't think any translations called him Asylum today
 I would be a and the reason is because his is this continues on the purpose of the cities is for someone to go and be safe from being litigated essentially select cities will become Cities of Refuge recycling so that the murderer or NTSB says the manslayer manslaughter manslaughter the NIV say manslayer the person who have killed someone that sounds like normal English so that the person who has killed someone by accident can fleas are these will be places of Refuge from the avenger movie heroes from The Avengers from there's no City that's going to keep you safe from The Avengers you can't at the moment where they all stand up around the table like Captain America Black Widow
 okay anyway so they will be a refuge from the Avenger the idea is let's say Moshe and yes Yahoo are out shopping with an actual scenario from the Torah so they're out shopping wood and Moshe you know swinging his axe super hard against the tree you shall who's over there at that tree but me and he's pulls back to swing with all his energy and that axe head comes loose and just flies right into your shop who said brain injury and he dies 5 minutes later so this is a scenario that describes unintentional death so let's say that happens let's say you shall who who just died
 has five brothers and they here right about almost dead they could within again their tribal framework assumed cultural practice here is that Brothers can bring about blood Vengeance on someone who takes the life of a family member that's the assumed practice underneath this year and so you can see how it doesn't take much to imagine how these things can escalate right it's just a small localized version of how cities go to war with each other and they just go to war with each other right yeah exactly like no one can really explain why World War 1 actually started the murder of a duke or is it yeah it's just an act that flew and hit someone in it just spiraled out blood Feud would be a
 older style phrase to describe what's going on here and this is why I can Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet you've got the what the the capulets and fine cuz the sea round know that the capulets in the
 me and Juliet come on something that this is embarrassing
 Montague so yes monkey is McAfee let's start a blood Feud right but this is how it works and then it just goes back and forth generation to generation so these cities are designed to be a place of Asylum from the blood Avenger so that the person who killed someone won't be put to death until he stands before the congregation for justice you don't have six of these Cities of Refuge three of them here across the Jordan in the land of Canaan but also three are to be on the east side of the Jordan for the two-and-a-half tribes where the two and a half tribes just staked out their own little eating and then the traffic goes on to give for case studies of what qualifies as an intentional killing to give wisdom and guidance about that okay look How This Ends is really interesting what is this about here
 there's 33 this is so that y'all don't pollute the land that you are living in for blood pollutes the land and no atonement can be made for the land for blood that is spilled upon it except the blood of the one who has spilled blood you all shall not defile or make in pure the land in which you were living cuz it's the land that I dwell in the middle of four I Yahweh dwell in the middle of the sons of this realm
 this whole thing's got ratcheted up talking about like you know like why is Jack's protecting each other and then I'll just got Cosmic yeah there's obviously something here that I don't have in my psyche which is the cydaea of polluting the land and how blood or more specifically like blood that comes from murder right spilling some of the blood on the land pollutes the land yeah I mean why bring the land into it the land you know it's just land like in what sense does blood actually put it you know this is all assumes the reader gets a whole bunch of things from Genesis 1 through 11 the tight-knit connections between human Adam who comes from the odd dumb
 in Genesis chapter 2 which means ground around here so it's the same way that an English human is related to the Latin root hummus which is the Latin word for So Adam comes from, and Hebrew human from the ground so in the Cain and Abel story when Cain murders his brother which is the same word murder used throughout this chapter here in numbers 35 What God Says is the optimal the ground has opened up its mouth to receive the spilled blood of your brother and the blood cries out from the ground and God hears the cry and confronts the murderer right in the Cain and Abel story and though he forgive the murderer that is can what can goes on to do is build his own little City of Refuge is self-made City of Refuge and then in that City Seven Generations later you get Lemak
 killing people and singing glory of battle hymns about it and then in the next narrative in Genesis 6 what you learned is the land is filled with violence and the outcry rose up to God and God heard the outcry and then sends the flood as an act of purifying Justice to wash the land clean so that whole connection of humans coming from the other, we have the Hebrew word for blood is dumb three letters of the word human and it's the middle letters of work ground dum dum human Adamo ground ground and then dumb which is blood and blood we've learned this in Leviticus is is where the Life by is and there's something about with an animal sacrifice you take an animal who is blameless more has no blemish and its life
 is killed instead of yours who you are blemished but then the blood you take the blood so the animals dead but the blood still alive and Away the blood is a life the blood is the blood is like yeah okay yeah and then that it's put on the right on the altar on the Altar and then another practice is it sprinkled in the Holy place on the door and was attacked and its eyesight Tia of righteous blood are blameless blood being able to atone for for the guilt a blameless life can go in past the doors into the tent and appeal to God and cry out for mercy so remember the three words Adam human adamah ground Dom blood God is the Creator and so he brings Adam from The Optima brings human life out of the ground but for a human to take the LIE
 another human and return that dumb blood into the Adamo is the human playing God with the life of another and so when a human illegitimately Returns the life of another image of God into the ground it's as if the human is playing God yeah and erasing the life of another and God will not like that it doesn't work that way you can't do that because that dumb that human life will cry out from the ground against the murderer and God will eventually respond maybe not in the timing that I like but eventually that outcry will become so great that he will hand creation over to destruction because of the blood of the innocent that's a Loggia understand that logic you have to sympathetically understand the value of blood for me it's just a fluid
 yeah but not much just like a is it just the fluids for you though it's a very important I mean yeah well I guess not this is vivid and maybe some listeners including myself this kind of get a visceral reaction but that's kind of my point when you see pictures of murder scenes and you see puddles of Blood by body it's a it does something to me and lots of people hit it folks something like that is bad like that's not okay that's the thing in being a volunteer with the Cain and Abel story at the blood crying out that person's blood is there life why is it outside their body all over the ground it's like somehow that picture is so wrong it evokes something deep in us and I think that's the feeling that this imagery is tapping into
 that if a human spills another human's blood all over the ground like that's wrong and that should be accounted for in some way that can't continue or be allowed and that's what these stories are saying is yeah that's like a it's an offence to the creator of life and when too much blood gets spilled it's a sign of Chaos in the land and God will in his mercy and Justice hand over such lands or cities are people groups over to destruction and then we're back to the melody yeah but he won't let you must destroy themselves or you will provide a refuge in the middle of chaos and that's what these Cities of Refuge are all about is listen like people are going to accidentally kill each other but don't let that accidental death overflow into a flood of murder and blood feuds and so these little cities become like little Parks right but God steak.
 a little place for life even after the blood of the innocent Hearts to protect you from the flood of man's judgment yeah that's right when God handle and over to self destruction because of the blood of the innocent has Wright gotten too great but in the story of the flood the ark is a little place of Refuge in life and then that fits into this pattern of in Egypt in in the middle of slavery in the decreation of Egypt in the ten plagues God provides the House pass over at the little refuge for life and God in the wilderness from thorns and snakes and scorpions provided the tents and the camp is a little Eden refuge and so here in the land humans are going to more than likely defile the land with the blood of the innocent and God will provide the Cities of Refuge that little arcs little tense of Passover houses and low and behold all of this language is also from the Cain and Abel story about the building of cities
 to protect life and God has a version of the cities that he wants to provide and that's what this chapter is about and then on the other side of the river you have two and a half tribes who want to make their own versions of protection and security and how that plays out well you just got to keep reading the story so these are just too kind of sample stories from the end of numbers but you can kind of see how the land is being portrayed as a new opportunity a new Eden opportunity
 and God wants to provide life where humans tend to bring about violence and death and even when God gives his gift and offers them you still got some people like this two and a half of her life but I bet we could come up with their own version of it though that'll be pretty good on this side of the river and that's it's all that mixed hope and idealism and compromising as he said disheartenment that you finish the numbers called that tell numbers comes to an end comes to the end camped on the east side of the Jordan two and a half tribes kind of made a plan to stay there most of his prepared them for what to do when they get in the land and one of those things being I can buy another season for a few and see where they are
 ready to go and you can imagine us turning the page and reading the story of them going into land and it's the land where God says just like he dwelt in the middle of the garden in the tree of life we want to give that a man eat his life then you set up camp in the middle of the camp in the middle of the tent in the Tabernacle so now he wants to bring them into the land and he will take up residence in the middle that's what number is 3534 I want to live in the middle of the land with you all if you just do what I say and you will have life and really that's in a way that's what the whole final score of the Torah Deuteronomy is all about its Moses's final plea one long set of speech is final. Choose life with y'all in the land and that sets up what the book of Deuteronomy it's about here we got for now we'll say goodbye the numbers and hello
 drama next
