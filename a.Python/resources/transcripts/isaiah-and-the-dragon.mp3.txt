we're exploring the theme of the chaos Monster in the Bible from the opening pages of scripture we encounter a destructive force that the authors of the Bible that it has a serpentine belt on deceiving Humanity again and again we see that God's human image Bears shoes to side with chaos instead of a God and so become themselves chaos monsters as well today we open up the scroll of Isaiah and we see the prophet Isaiah warning is real that they have become the chaos Monster aligning with death and destruction instead of partnering with y'all way and so God has to deal with the chaos that Israel has brought the fire's coming in the fire Babylon here's the surprising thing the nation of Babylon is also a chaos Monster it's a God's going to use a bigger badder cast monster to judge Israel and if that's the case then who's going to deal with that one.
 monster that God summons to bring that fiery purification even that monster that is Babylon will be at self held accountable to Divine Justice episode will also examine a question that's been on my mind from the beginning of the series which is what do we mean when we talked about the sea serpent the chaos Monster we want his sympathetic Lee Enter the imagination of these authors they really want to entertain that there's another dimension of reality with creatures that are intelligent like us that are being described by these images of the modern reader think of chaos has an impersonal Force the ancient think of it in a more nuanced way as creatures with influence over human reality this is a picture of a cosmic battle in and Isaiah we get a vision of how that battle end in the new creation is depicted as a huge feast on top of the mountain and you always will
 follow up the monster and I talked about the theme of the chaos Monster In The Scroll of Isaiah I'm done College in your listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 a 10 by John hello hello all right we're at it dragons dragons the meaning and importance of Dragon theme throughout the story line of the Bible is dragons in the Bible and maybe what is this particular theme in the biblical story a little bit of difference all of the vehicle literature is rooted in its historical time context and biblical authors were shaped by God Spirit but also shaped by their culture and upbringing and so when they wrote they wrote in the language setting a time and place in Saint so we're always that's a big value for us is to honor that historical context of the biblical writings but there's something about this theme in particular
 because the dragon-slaying story was so widespread among Israel's neighbors going away and even like predating Israel in the neighbouring culture and the way biblical authors use specific images words and phrases that are very popular in this widespread tradition but they didn't they tweak them and that's just something about immersing myself in both the biblical texts about dragon and the other ancient near Eastern text that's just something that strikes me all the biblical literature is connected to its cultural context something about the dragon that feels like it especially is and to be clear when we talked about slaying the dragon we're not talking about some young Knight encountering a dragon in a cave yeah not the medieval European of the medieval kind of and that's the most common Dragon myth of my childhood okay Sam same for me that's right this is about
 the storm God versus the sea serpent the chaos sea monster that's right and yeah this isn't a story I mean that the closest thing we have maybe like Moby Dick or not exactly and even there that's a very modern version of the sea monster so in the all the cultures around Israel up in the north out in the East down south in Egypt and Syria on tire is all these stories of the chaotic Waters represented by a monster a serpentine monster of some sort that was chaos herself and needed to be dealt with or life itself would an end and the story is chaos and disorder is a symbol
 of the danger disorder and death that is just we're all on the verge of in any moment and he City and he's society and human is on the verge of no longer existing yeah you can feel that sometimes yeah yeah so that Universal Human Experience of the Polar Opposites of life and death and you beauty and tragedy of order and disorder and you can just pick it up from one of the next it's like we're at all of history and the realities on a knife's edge that's what these symbols re-expressing and exploring through symbol yeah that picture in the knife's edge is a battle between the god of the sky and the creature of the sea the god of the sea and it's an epic battle and it's like who's going to win and it's close and then life will prevail
 but then usually happen again there's a cycling and almost with the seasons of like winter brings death again and the battle has to happen threat so in the two versions of the story that are closest to the biblical authors and buy clothes that actually Isaiah really going to look at this as a scroll that how Isaiah picked up the dragon imagery in this book there's a Canaanite version of the story that we have evidence through their neighbors to the north Elkin Tire in Phoenicia town called jugar it and it's a story about bail or Bond cuz it's a strong guard against the serpent called lotan and against the sea call thiam and their ball has to undergo this defeat of the dragon and victory and then he'd actually dies after the battle and then he gets resurrected again brought up from the dead
 it's happens every year it's a whole agricultural cycle imagery over in Babylon which is the other version the biblical. There's no the most cuz they lived there in Babylonian exile is the version about marduke that we know through a text called in to make a leash and their marduk's victory over the sea Tiamat and Herb monster Army which includes lions and Dragons then Hairy Beast Man in there the story is ritually re-enacted every year at the New Year in the fall the fall into the air so that it's cyclical and the biblical authors have a different view of reality Israel had its own cyclical feasts and stories say that and the kind of Central and being passed over right well they had two New Year's New Year celebration in the spring and I was the first day of fall
 the month, and then that last for six months and then the second half of the year a six-month cycle also begins and 7th month with the New Year's the day of atonement and Sukkot Feast of Tabernacles the call in that seventh month if and they both are starts to different ways of thinking about the cycle of a year but the point is is that whether it's Passover celebrate God's victory over the monster pharaoh who enslaved them unto death and was defeated at the sea yeah and then the Fall New Year celebration kicks off of the month that has it at its Center the day of atonement which is also about today exiling of a
 send monster out into the Wilderness to the form of a goat but that's a whole other stuff had been so I wasn't that there is a cyclical nature to Israel's calendar as well yeah but it isn't about who's going to win this time know you're celebrating a victory that is certain and it's a victory rooted in the past celebrated throughout human history pointing to an ultimate Victory but the point is that the god of Israel for the biblical authors is not locked in Mortal Combat with a drag I love it except Mortal Kombat so the other things I guess important to remember I'm saying this for myself to is that by the bill Crothers using this creature is there not
 whole cloth adopting the story is there their they're like I don't know how you would say that they're taking the character and the idea but then they're using their employing it for their own purposes yes and in the biblical story The Leviathan the timing is not arrival of God but it's one of God's creatures that he made in his wisdom that he put in the sea on day 5 that it plays there I can praise God and that's a pretty Stark difference that's right really stand out amongst all of these other stories being like Oh yeah we know about that creature to the threat these are the variety of dragon taming strategies so to speak in the Hebrew Bible so one of them is to acknowledge that the Sea Dragon whatever being that image refers to is a part of God's creation and it's good
 at least and it's beginning or his Essence However the fact that it becomes an agent of bad and God's world imply some sort of choice on its part to not participate in the flourishing of God's good creation but rather trying to drag it back into the nothingness in disorder from which it emerged and the figure the doing that is described primarily with reptilian sea monster or ground snake imagery yes and at the same time it's me Dan all of these neighboring Stories the God yes it's a d f a c p d yeah yeah so it's not merely a creature yep it's a cosmic Force yes and that's also at play in the story of the Bible that this creature is connected to the idea of Spiritual Beings in some way which I don't fully appreciate
 enable get into a little bit to me yeah it's certainly one of those things that emerges over the course of the Hebrew Bible is to read through it and then once you get in the second temple literature and which includes the New Testament it's very clear to them what all these images prefer to Isaiah is one of the books in the Hebrew Bible where these images really comes into sharp Focus maybe I guess we'll see you then we experiencing that way but so what I want to focus on is the imagery of the dragon and the Rebel Star being the Rebels car being in Isaiah's oracle's against the nation's in Isaiah chapter 13 to 27 we're just going to read a few of Isaiah's Palms but watch how they're going to pick up the imagery from where we been so far in this conversation but also kind of provide some new focus of liquor
so just real quick we're looking at 1 literary unit in as a scroll chapters 13 227 there are seven, large literary blocks and Isaiah no surprise there a supposed to happen and 13 to 27 is the second largest litter I block him just as a kind of refresher to set the narrative setting of the book in the sticker attached to the book Isaiah of Jerusalem he lived in Jerusalem in the mid-to-late 70s BC he's connected to the reign of Four Kings but specifically his like the narratives about him have him overlapping with the King named a house and then a king named Hezekiah his son has a car so the Assyrian Empire was on the rise and actually invaded Jerusalem surrounded it and decimated the towns around Jerusalem but didn't actually Concord
 I didn't conquer the north but they took out the northern tribes yeah and then in order to ensure Jerusalem safety Hezekiah made an alliance with the sprouting Babylonian Empire and that really made Isaiah mad cuz he thought that I had to Kaya was trusting in these alliances and not a got until Isaiah forecast the Babylons actually going to come and stab you in the back and take the city captive and take all your children in Babylon we have the story of Tiamat that's right it is Syria they also have the same Assyrian Babylon or Mesopotamian neighbors okay we're just like a hundred miles apart of us and they share the same Language and Cultural mythology but the point is the Babylon is on the horizon and Isaiah can see is it babylon's going to come swallow up a Syria and swallow
 with everything and ruined everything and everyone so that's kind of the context of Syria's on the near Horizon that belongs on the far Horizon so Isaiah 1 through 12 begins with Isaiah's announcement that Jerusalem is headed for ruin because Israel has been faithless to the Covenant God is going to allow these Imperial monsters to come pick up Jerusalem but as a fire of testing to purify Jerusalem so that after that attack a New Jerusalem can emerge at the other side so we have read many times over the years the important pawns and Isaiah chapter 2 and as a 11 the both depict the ultimate future of cosmic New Jerusalem that the Nations will all gather into will be no more war will be a royal Priestly leader from the line of David will bring about a new
 didn't her ass and a man so that's we just finished that Isaiah wants for 12 with those kind of framing images and Isaiah 2 and 11 when you walk into Isaiah chapter 13 to 27 this is a whole collection of What's called the oracles against the nation's and essentially Isaiah's looking at all of the neighbors around Jerusalem and including Jerusalem and sang the fire's coming and what is going to describe even more detail is the fire itself and the fire is Babylon and he's going to describe Babylon 5 on is the fire Babylon is the fire that God is bringing yep and then what he's also going to anticipate is even the monster that God's summon to bring that fiery purification
 on the nation's belly button won't even that monster that is Babylon will be at self held accountable to Divine Justice in the end and that's actually how the whole collection begins with an oracle against Babylon itself I mean this seems important that is important actually it's really important so we've talked before about how this is Cosmic kind of fiery flood that's going to as you said tests and purify and so that like New Creation can come out of it or the New Jerusalem come out and one way to think about that and just got himself as his wrath directly the fire of God whatever that means I hear what you're saying is no God sends out Babylon T the fire and actually he calls a Serie A
 Babylon the rod of my anger so God's anger against human evil is expressed through putting the dragon on a leash and now we're calling Babylon the dragon because that's what we're going to find right we're going to find that yes how God depicts Babylon is that of the Dragon correct so this idea of the Sea Dragon becomes manifest in yes does Empire this Waring conquering bloodthirsty vampire so but it's like God's pet like he's apparently she's like it's God's yeah God sends it out and says yeah do your thing I am going to bring happiness to see through he allows it to have some ants important to know that when you actually get into Isaiah the person that set in motion the events for Babylon to come destroy Israel was the king of Israel yeah so weird more to the seam this goes back years to our character of God
 podcast Series where the language of God's anger consistently through the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament is depicting about God handing people over to the consequences of their decisions to not live by his word and wisdom and okay and that is described you as God unleashing the dragon to do it work but then God will hold even the dragon accountable for its evil and that's the interesting move cuz we could go down the rabbit hole of God's anger it's not go there it's another conversation but I think I just really need to understand and appreciate the importance of God's anger doesn't come with him riding down on the clouds like destroying or holding accountable somehow directly like there's this move of going I'm going to allow this creature of chaos to do that work
 and then I'm going to hold the creature of chaos accountable as well and that's I mean that's a very unique story compared to the neighboring stories of saying you know this creature of chaos is in a battle against God the god of the sky and they got to Duke it out and the guy this guy is going to win this is like the god of the sky is like no that thing it will just do what I wanted to do like I'm more powerful and I'm going to let its destructive nature just kind of have its way and that's kind of weird that's not weird it's just not going to be kits yeah
 yeah I think here's what's happening so funny we haven't read anything. But what's the biblical authors deepest conviction is that Yahweh creator of Heaven and Earth is Ultimate Reality there is no reality more Transcendent above and beyond then Yahweh Elohim so whatever chaos and death is it's down the chain of causation of importance and significance of sovereignty and power and authority so sometimes the biblical authors want to highlight that Yahweh Elohim is the ultimate cause in the source of all reality and so they'll depict scenes of divine judgment or God bringing Justice on human evil as God doing it himself there are other times when Zelda pet God using agents to do it on his behalf and that's what we find like here and Isaiah but there are also images and Isaiah we're all just talk about God sending the
 are on Jerusalem and so I think it's more the biblical authors actually have a more nuanced way of thinking about cause and effect and God's relationship to cause and effect and sometimes they just take the cause it all the way up to the ultimate source and other times they focus on secondary third agents and the dragon falls into that category. The important thing about the literary design of Isaiah 13227 is it begins with two chapters about Babylon Isaiah 13 to 14
 then there's a poem about Babylon in the exact center of the collection of chapter 21 and then there's a poem about the fall of this Cosmic city of arrogance and violence it's depicted as a huge city on a hill but that's like a terrible City and it's depicted as a dragon that God's going to hack up with a sword but it's never describes Babylon and I think it's on purpose also okay hun so this whole collection 13227 it begins with a story of Babylon falling but you're saying it doesn't reference Babylon it's about the Babylon and the king of Babylon and then in the middle of the collection chapter 21 minutes about Babylon following the very end about this Cosmic city of chaos not called Babylon but it's his Dragon correct and it's about a cosmic City Mountain that God is going to elevate Above All Nations and make a feast and swallow up death then there's no more crying
 pain and that is called Jerusalem or Mount Zion okay so I think because the way this pattern where it says Babylon is just the current manifestation of the Dragon will be more and however many more there are ultimately the energy behind it God will bring that down so just our God into the Dragon
Isaiah 13 opens up like this a prophecy against Babylon that Isaiah son of Omarosa
 raise up a banner on a bear Hilltop and shout out to them and them to enter end through the gates of the Nobles that was a good thing everywhere the nearest hyperlinked two things from Isaiah 14 12 yeah so this is a scene where a Harold is up on the hilltop that's going to be the foundation of the New Jerusalem has Faith refuge and he's calling everybody to come on up into this city cuz it's safe up here come come to the mountain why because down in the valley it's about to get sweaty I have commanded those that I prepared for battle summon my Warriors to carry out my anger those who rejoice in my Triumph listen annoys on the mountains like that of a huge multitude listen in
 Roar these are all words used to describe the CC elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible so the nation's massing together so you have armies you always Gathering described in the language of the chaotic see this very common in the prophets you always mustering an army for war they come from Faraway lands Yahweh is the weapons of his anger meaning he's going to let human armies do what human armies do cuz that's what humans want he's going to let them battle it out yet let you destroy each other and everything to destroy all the land
 well for the day of Yahweh is near destruction from the Almighty
 Yahweh hands humans and creation and Their Kingdoms over to what they want which is to rule the world through violence which means let us kill each other or you can flee to the mountain or you can flee to the mountains verse 9 the day of you always coming accrual day with wrath and anger to make the land desolate to destroy centers within it to get that image Sheehan's people over to their sinful decisions first 10 the stars of heaven and their constellations will no longer show their light
 the rising sun will be dark the moon will not give its light I'll punish the world for its evil the wicked for its sins I'll put an end to the arrogance of the hottie humble the pride of the ruthless so refuse our Genesis one way of viewing Real Track to make sense of this in Genesis one God puts the lights in the sky as creatures that can display God's own light so their Imaging God's own group to rule said for them to not have any light any more is God taking away their vocation to rule and their rule is to mediate God's order cuz they order light and dark but they rebelled and some way well it's more than this ruin a human order by the human rulers
 mirrored up above by Cosmic disorder even affecting the rulers about okay so some more above to shut down the lights presumably the verse 17 what what is this all refer to 417 still got speaking I'm going to stir up the medes and Persians the medes media and Persia were neighbor and cultures and they eventually merged into what was just called the Persian Empire but there were no distinctions kind of like Babylon in this area we're both. Thanks but also so I'm going to stir up against Babylon the meat they don't care about money they have no mercy on children they're going to destroy night to Babylon the jewel of Kingdoms The Pride and Glory of the Babylonians will be overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah
 that's what the problem is actually about caring about the current world Empire getting overthrown by the medes and Persians and somehow that Earthly conflict between Empires is a cosmic significance so where are there goes in chapter 14 is then to say you know on the day that the king of Babylon you know gets put in prison because of the coup the political coup what political coup well the Babylonian Kingdom fell actually without a huge Civil War in Babylon it was almost all political and Military coup that happened with a lot of details that I probably should learn more about but it's a reference in the Book of Daniel
 so Isaiah imagines that just like a king gets in throne and people write poems to celebrate his enthronement so he writes this inverted dethronement on about taking down around you call that taunt it's actually a mockery Palm okay this would be really popular on Tik-Tok yes but if he found a way to do this today so how the oppressor has ceased his insolence is no more Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked the scepter of rulers that struck the people in Wrath blows without ceasing you rule the nations in anger and unrestrained persecution that dude the grave below sure getting excited about you to meet you when you come
 it's arousing up all of the referendum him these are the spirits of dead Warrior kings that is we also know the missing a feeling it's raising up all the kings of the nations from their throat this is all it's a little scene in the Underworld it's like the underworld Kings underworld King sue you know they're not really important and they're all dead but they all get up and they say I owe you yourself are not weak like us
 you've become the same as all of us you know you put us all down here when you executed us so how does it feel in your pride is now brought down to the grave and the sound of your Harps and don't hear those anymore you know what you're going to have is a bad now just a spread of maggots and a covering of worms that's your blanket
 oh how you fallen from Heaven o Morning Star son of the sun rise
 you are cut down to the ground so conqueror of Nations you said in your heart I will Ascend up to heaven raise my throne above the stars of God I will sit on the mountain of assembly that the Assembly of God's Divine Council on the summit of Zapped phone that is the mountain referred to in the dragon slaying the hittite version It's a mountain called cuz he's up on the coast where lets see Siri of Lebanon and Syria Meats turkey down on the coast huge 6000 ft mountain right on the coast and it's where the in the hip hop version of the dragon slaying with the dragon is born on the mountain and crawled down into the sea so king of Babylon goes on all the sound up to the high places of the clouds and make myself like the most high
 but in reality the Kings say you are brought down to the Grave to the depths of the pit all right and so this sentence are you falling from Heaven Morningstar this is I mean in contacts it's clearly talking about the king of Babylon and the calls him a fallen star specifically the morning star and if I remember correctly this is one of the planets that like Venus is it at the Venus it's the last star you see surviving the sun light right before the sun rises suits the brightest star yeah but it also doesn't follow along with the constellations it's got its own pattern that's it we call it a planet which comes from the Greek word planner to wonder who has a different pattern and then deviant Sky ruler deviance guy ruler that holds on as long as possible when the sun comes out and so we need to re in Port what we were talking about which is
 these are merely stars in the imagination these are creatures which is what time does king of Babylon in the Bill's authors very comfortable calling the king of Babylon what we would call a Heavenly Heavenly being a deviant Heavenly being rebellious Heavenly do not remember however we have categories for this because the cane story just as for taught us that humans can become agents
 the dragon and you can talk about the dragon has its own agent like in the Garden of Eden story The Snake whispering and talking but then in the cane story were taught that there's just a voice in Cannes they're called sin wants him wants to consume him an animal but he's called the rule it like the animals and he doesn't and so after that then we saw was lamech in the Nimrod and then pharaoh and then she swears we go after that sisera and then Goliath and what was Goliath except one of these like Champion Warriors Rises making fun of the king of Avalon now so humans can become agents of the cosmic chaos Monster that can be depicted as a sea monster but also now here to picked it in the language of a rebel star
 and this brings us all the way back to remembering and Genesis 1 the bonus creatures in the darkness in Genesis one of the stars and the bonus creature in the Seas of day 5 are the dragons and as we're going to see right here and Isaiah this is the star image and then matching on the precise opposite end of this literary collection
 is the image of the dragon as well so we start with the star and once again Isaiah is also drawing on a well-known step of mythological motifs at work about the specially the word Isaiah uses Morningstar son of the dawn it's the first Halo been shocked are morning Stars hello son's been in the Shockers done the word Don is an actual deity in Canaanite literature and mythology the sunrise so that's how this collection begins picking the downfall of a rebel star let's turn to the opposite end of this collection and Isaiah at the 24 through 27 sometimes this collection is called the Isaiah apocalypse it's a wild is such a cool letter a in it and it is riddled like packed packed packed with hyperlinks
 Genesis 1 through 11
So It Begins like Isaiah 13 talking about what's the first line look the Lord is going to lay waste to the land and devastated is going to ruin its face and Scatter its inhabitants like Babylon yeah verse 19 the Earth where the land is broken up the land is split asunder just like in the flood the land has shaken the land reels like a drunk man it's sideways like a Hut in the wind because heavy upon it is the guilt of its Rebellion so that it will fall never to rise again in that day Yahweh will punish the powers in the heavens above and the Kings on the earth below you're like oh yeah I knew that that's what Isaiah 13 14 was talking about and it's connected in their in their mirrors of each other yet they will be her
 did together like prisoners Bound in a dungeon shut in a prison never talk about the underworld or the grave but then punished after many days the moon will be dismayed the sun ashamed because Yahweh will reign as King on Mount Zion and Jerusalem and before its Elders with great glory in the moon and the sun are just two of the lights yeah they won't be necessary anymore so the glory of Yahweh is going to come take up residence on the New Jerusalem mountain and it will be so bright that the moon and the sun will just be outshone or is that what it means by this made in the same yeah pick up later and Isaiah yeah so in Isaiah 13 they were going dark because of the great storm and collapse of the cosmos whereas here there
 not necessary
 but before we get to that the rebel powers in the heavens above any lights that don't want to participate sort of like the lights become a necessary and any lights that don't want a yield their role to Yahweh the ultimate light well here you always going to put him in prison as well as any Kings who don't want to heal their power to the cosmic came so that's seen as followed by another Pawn that's awesome it's about how on this mountain you always going to make this Rich Feast for all the peoples a banquet of aged wine the best meets the finest wines and on this man he will destroy the Shroud that's in folding all the peoples like a sheet covering all the nations
 he will swallow up death forever he will wipe away tears from all faces and remove his people's disgrace from the land of death is thought of as some sort of covering a sheet blanketing all of us walking out the light blocking out covered in death God will destroy a swallow it swallow up death swallow it cuz usually the grave is depicted as swallowing up everything right now that's a sea monster swallows up yeah it's like the death of death is a sea monster image
 so we have the land is going to be D created the rulers above and below that don't want to participate in the new creation will be dealt with and then the new creation is depicted as a huge feast on top of a mountain and Yahweh will swallow up the monster Isaiah taking all the stock imagery of the dragons like man cuz normally it's the dragon that's threatening swallow but he always depicted is coming out to deal with the monster talked about in the form of Rebel stars in Rebel Cuban Kings and then usually in the dragon-slaying missed the Victor storm God sends a great mountain and throws a huge feast built the palace to rule over the cosmos again
 and here we always doing that but his victory over the snake in this poem is just called swallowing up death so death is the monster and if we have any doubts about what this all means Isaiah 27 one just comes along and put the pin in it in that day y'all way will punish with his sword is fierce Great and Powerful sword Leviathan the gliding serpent Leviathan The coiling Serpent he'll slay the monster of the sea the Kaleidoscope at the end of it is at and I still feel uncomfortable with all the shifting between okay we're talking about death on overtime I live I have been talking about Rebel stars like it's really disorienting for me because every shift it's like I feel like a can one understand why when we mean by serpent
 see what time I can so I know what that means but I got a crap King okay but never talk about Rebel Stars I think I know what that means
 and it just like I don't know and then that Feast where you always swallows up death it's followed up later in the poem with this line Isaiah 26 19 but your dad will live their bodies will rise those who dwell in the dust will wake up and shout for Joy so basically you have let's just separate them in the opposite past the land that's full of armies their roaring like a flood yeah and they're all going to kill each other and then the ruler of all rulers on Earth the king of Babylon is going to descend to the grave and meet all of these other Earthly rulers but then you also learned later that that Earthly set of kings and specially the the big bad one is mapped onto a rebel Heavenly being who also presume the greater status and role for themselves and not just as an image of God but as tell him I'll go send
 the mountains there also cast down
 and in that realm of death both the rebel Heavenly beings and the rebel Earthly beings are handed over to the ruin that they've Unleashed on God's world
 opposite of that is the high place that mountain of yahweh's glory and victory and rain and there's a huge feast where the monster the swallowed everybody that is death is swallowed up in life and resurrection of the Dead in a great feast forever and ever and so all of these kaleidoscopes images but there's really just there's a binary where you can see where all the things match with each other and life on a mountain with a feast in New Creation and resurrection of the underworld and the Sea and the dragon and the Deviant star and the rebel Kings who ended up dying themselves yeah but you're looking for what's the more precise relationship on not just a relationship I think I'd get the relationship
 I think what I'm wrestling with is what are we actually talking about this way oh yeah I know death is real that is a very real thing have copy of that I know that war and like kings of the earth that use pride and arrogance and oppression and they can cause death of corporate form of death and ruin what happens to my body and mind on the individual level can happen to a whole culture cap its civilization yet that's right yeah okay so do those are very real things now what you could say is now every other image after that is just a way to describe how the reality of human death human corruption human violence so talking about either the Dragon
 or the spiritual Heavenly beings they're not real there's a way to talk about oh I see like something that is real witches death and one possibility would be is all what we would just call Mythic language yet and it's just helping us understand how to dele Alli of human experience and all the imagery of the mental projection up into the heavens of just stuff that we got to deal with that's one way there's one way to think about it it's not that simple and at least in the way that the Bible thinks it's actually thinks about a reality that's deeper or above or beneath however you want to think about it that is actually very real in other words if we want to sympathetically enter the imagination of these authors to see the world in their eyes not just a simulate there with talking to my way of seeing the world or are we
 show us where we want to sympathetically enter they really want us to entertain that there's another dimension of reality with creatures that are intelligent like us and that are being described in some way by these images so when we get into this category of then what's the powers underneath the creatures underneath
 we're saying it's real but then when we encounter images of fallen stars or sea serpent king snakes word like an a voice in this year as it were that these are ways for us to represent and try to understand real creatures using what we would call Mythic symbolic in a minute just means a symbolic narrative to talk about real realities in human experience and because it's not trying to tell you exactly what it is like it's the sea serpent or it's not that's the point isn't that's what the creature exactly is terms of reference right literal reference letter of reference right it's
 more of a symbolic representation because of that these images become very flexible and that's why you could be talking about the Fallen star and it suddenly just be talking about death and then be talkin about a sea dragon cuz I start to get hung up in like will like yeah we have here in the main the modern West we have severely underdeveloped symbolic imagination in some ways yes in some ways no like we actually really do get it but we have this hang-up between will a symbol or is it real and I'm not sure that most humans for most of human history had that particular hang up at least as I the longer I sit with this sample of ancient literature that is the Bible
 for them the symbol this just a fine way of talking about the real thing I don't need more than that okay but I'm I'm I share him say that I'm pathetically with you cuz I share that I think the like what was the real thing well and I still care about what's the real thing in terms of what are all of these symbols meant for me to try to understand and it's not that like if I go out into the Pacific Ocean here I might encounter the Leviathan right the threat and I can actually you would mean it would likely destroy you totally well might actually swallow me out that's if that's a possibility so but it's not preparing me for that but it is preparing for the fact that I will encounter the chaos and destruction in such a way
 in the moment it might just look like the death of a friend or my looks like a tragic homicide yeah dumbass Street it might look like a warring Nation against another one nation and More in earthquake or an earthquake
 man and it's happening right now
 and what I am when I experienced that one way to think about that is the dragon yeah and the fact that we live outside of Eden that is in a realm where we're constantly on the knife edge between life and death chaos in order and it's a live battle conflict as it were in the biblical authors have no doubt about the ultimate outcome of the conflict that y'all was going to hack the dragons heads off and that's different than how the ancient neighbors thought about that story but at the same time it recognizes we are outside of eating then we're dying out here and it's actually a lot where a lot worse off than most of us think we are and that's what these images are trying to name
 and help us be unwrapped bar mines around not to reconcile with it but to understand there's a deeper dimension of reality at work than just what we see and experience I think another thing that I'm realizing is my my picture of what we would call Cosmic evil or you know stuff chaos and death I think it's too neat and simple and even after we did that whole God series you know that like really when it deep into that topic still to me feels like I have maybe a caricature of like God and Satan or angels and demons and I don't have I don't have a rich enough kind of a perspective about spiritual evil or Heavenly evil or whatever you want to call it to be able to then come in and think about the sea dragon or think about
 capital D death that God has to like destroy swallow up and yeah I don't know I mean I sent well yeah is it similar to when I hear that I'm think about the, I made a few minutes ago to say I think most of us in the modern West have a really underdeveloped symbolic connection for evil and death and chaos and I think these symbols gave the biblical authors and this will see you in later conversations that Jesus himself
 these images provided a whole way of handling and thinking about how they encountered death and sickness and disease and evil in murder and greed was all like a bundle bundle together for them where is for us we tend to separate naturally evil and moral evil Ryan's sickness and Spears mental illness and spiritual evil where the Iditarod separated for many of us and they weren't in this way of viewing the world they were all manifestations of something deeply wrong in the interconnected way and I think that's what the dragon playing story
 but we're just going to keep working and different Dragon tax in the Hebrew Bible in My Hope Is that clarity about the interconnectedness of these images will emerge for both of us cuz we do have to our job is to write an explainer video that explains this so I'm I'm eager for the clarity to emerge for myself as well so then, and I'm back to another employee reduction and just want to do some Mike McDonald work out about project team and get to do stuff with strategic relationship yeah so what does that look like on a daily basis for you yeah so this is basically all the relationships that we have with folks outside of our office that want to use for experience our content inside their ecosystem off so it's people like you version and Alpha and crew and young life and grateful
 you're doing really cool things that find our content helpful and so I build a lot of these relationships with these different organizations with these different individuals and find ways that we can serve them really well so I was thinking about this morning I was like Mike is proof that people skills is a real thing and I wanted to ask you like how that awareness came about man I don't know if it was taught taught some of it I got into the restaurant industry when I was 18 years old as a server which is a great place to learn people skills being in the restaurant for me was where I learned so much of it cuz there's problems every day there's conflict everyday internal-external funny you just dealing with all different types of people but then I just had a really good mentors along the way that I brought me under their wing and and they were all really good with people too that's why I asked what would you want to say
 I mean on the first thank you like its first off when you listen and you're a patron in your part of this whole thing on which is why were allowed to do any of this stuff the impact around the world I was just in London but there were folks from China Uganda Kenya and all of them experiencing Bible project content where they didn't get to burn the stuff in school it's changing their lives and I always am so humbled when I'm listening that's gone like a it's not cuz I was like thank you thank you.
