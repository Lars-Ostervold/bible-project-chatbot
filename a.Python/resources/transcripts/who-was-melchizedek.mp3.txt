is it John Collins at bible project and today we're continuing our conversation on priest in the Bible last week we looked at how the first priests in the Bible are Adam and Eve in the cosmic Temple today we're going to look at the first character in The Bible explicitly called a priest and he's a mysterious character priests when they first appear in the Bible milk his attack the pain like the priest-king is the first one you meet and he's just introduced like you're supposed to know who he is and what he does he's just call the priest in the narrator doesn't say that the priests of cuz he's the first one you're moving it just assumed here's the story Abram who will later be called Abraham and a band of Fighters that he put together and just a successful he rescued his nephew lot from this Alliance of being so I've been out plundering cities and taken captive he's on his way back home Victorious from Battle and he passes by us
 he called Chelan and out comes the king of celebs who were told is also a priest-king his name is Melchizedek chelem is a shortened form of the name Jerusalem
 half of the word so this is ancient Jerusalem free Israelite so no kiss attack the came out but what he brought with him was Bread and Wine dear reader was a priest of God most high somehow this priest king worships the god of Abraham and then they'll kiss attack there's a feast in honor of Abram outside of ancient city of Jerusalem and Abram is so impressed he has an extreme response after seeing and meeting monkeys that I can eating the feast is being blessed it's been verse 20 and Abraham gave to him milk is a deck 1/10 of everything at so that's it. But if you look closely at the story you'll notice so milk is a deck is Canaanite Royal priest can bringing out the abundance of Jerusalem and bringing out the blessing of Jerusalem and showering on
 This is highly significant in terms of the narrative this is at Eton moment 1 and 2 milk is attack is the first person to bless Abram today on the show we meet an important mysterious character the first priest king in the Bible thanks for joining us here we go
 talk about the esteem of priests in the Bible being a priest this position this office where someone is a person by which you can encounter the Divine a human gateway to heaven in Earth to Heaven from Earth of that is this idea that humans by our our nature of how we're designed by God is that we are to reflect who God is the geology of being the image of God and that there's many ways you can reflect who God is and one of the ways is this office we call it three switches connected to doing it within a Sacred Space reflecting who God is within a Sacred Space so someone shows up to take her space you're there as a human saying let me guide you into the Divine yeah and when humans are in their ideal role
 they take on aspects of God's wisdom power even Glory as well say so that for a moment you might mistake the human for the Divine Glory itself we're kind of getting into later parts of where this is going in the Torah with Aaron and Moses and Jesus but the point of using the word images to say when I look at something I see like wow that looks really close to the real thing it's not a statue isn't actually the one whom it represents but it's really close the point is they're very similar to each other like a photograph sure is never get that idea of image yeah that's right we're surrounded with digital images statue images this is not a normal it doesn't incite the same kind of imaginative qualities sure we have statues around of a digital image little pixels on it screen but you imagine it is so close to the
 still saying that there is a likeness and image between them so yes that's that's the role of humans is to Emmett to image God and when the humans doing that in the Eden 6 best for where we're going to go let's focus in in Genesis 1 and 2 dirty words associated with the humans and their image of God ruling Priestly prophetic roll the supposed to remind each other of the word of God to each other as they rule and do they worship their work of worship a key word introduced when in when they may the goddess is first mentioned is God blessing and God blessed them out and said to them be fruitful and multiply so when humans are in the place of blessing that's the Garden of Eden and there's life available these are all this is all geometry that's going to get developed later on the divine blessing blessing becomes a way of talking about
 the life of Heaven experience on Earth I think we should probably make a Blessing video I know you know when it's one of those words where I've tried to really wrap my mind around it cuz it's the word to use and I feel like I've gotten there before they call okay that's a blessing it is but right now it feels like that for an idea again yeah but the way you just said that experiencing heaven on Earth that's blessing and connected with order safety security in abundance and got the presents all become aspects of the blessing so once the humans are exiled from eating they make their stupid Choice misdirected desire the word of God is twisted and compromised and so they are exiled from eaten and in the final of Senses of Genesis 3 verses 22 224 is where God says the human that become like one of us knowing good and bad and now so that you
 send out his hand and take from the Tree of Life and eat and live forever or 23 Yahweh God sent him out of the garden to work the ground from which it was taken so he's going to keep working but it's no longer that worship work of the garden that's the same word though and to be correct him working the ground but when you're working the ground outside of Eden that's the kind of work he kills you cuz the ground makes you at the slave and he banished the human and there's nothing. Did he stationed or he made to dwell and sit at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubim and the flame of the wording sword to guard the way to the tree of life we made videos about share beam or her hunting here it's like the blessings of the Heaven and Earth place are there good but then there's also there's a danger now that accessing them but what humans want
 more than anything else just to get back there at you in just the reader want them to get back there and so the whole question is how can we get those humans back and eaten and if they do so they're going to have to navigate danger is important for understanding again concepts of Sacred Space in the role of the priests in the Bible and but my point is just in the narrative it's setting up humans are exiled from the thing that would make it all great so clearly whatever the story is going to have to involve it's going to be about solving that problem getting humans somehow we connected to that place of life and blessings a Sacred Space enter the sacred task into the task yeah thank you it's the job the job has been forfeited the office we could still do the job they could still work outside yeah that's right you're still working but to do that work in the office or role of the image of God in the cabinet earthplace so they still are the image of God they're still working that's right there just
 but in secret space and that sick of space has guarded yes I can't get back in the question is how do they then reflect God's image and work I just think it's good thank you let me see it differently just in the narrative it's the Exile from the heaven and earth place that the crisis they still do bear the image of God that's going to come up later and Genesis 9 they still are working the ground but where they're doing it and the fact that there are exiled from the heaven and earth Place becomes this crisis needs to get resolved in some way and this will become especially the unique part of the representative role of the because doing it in the Sacred Space they can do it with eternal life outside the Sacred Space cuz other people want the plot of land that you're working on
 so already the biblical authors are laying the tracks here of the architecture of the Tabernacle and a temple with the saw at the East there's a door or a way there's no entrance fee to get into the Garden or go out of and the fact that you the the narrator in Genesis to describes her carefully the middle of the garden and then the garden and then the garden is not all of Eden the Garden is called a garden in the Heathen Souls 3 tears even to this heaven on Earth space which is just like the three tiers of the Tabernacle and Temple in the fact that there's Caribbean guarding the boundary points so when you leave the garden and wave goodbye Adam and Eve wave goodbye you know and then to keep going east the Cain and Abel things happens and death murder they lose both their sons want to kill the other you know on just the way you sad things to start gone horribly wrong so everything the Genesis 1 through 11 represents
 what time to go through it right now but it leads up to the building of the city and Tower of Babel on the Cub Scout us knew it's a new Adam and do Adam and Eve who will be his vehicle for restoring blessing to the nation's and just going to be key for understanding the role of the priesthood and knock his attack is on page ten just revisiting these words that we've read so many times. Yeah they're kind of like Grand Central Station has 12 1 2 3
 this is where God picks Abram out and says I'm going to make your family great and he's going to reboot the project with a man that's right and Eden Echoes are just blaring from these first lines that God says to Abram with the word blessing its repeated five times and its intensity activating that Eden blessing back from Genesis wanted to so I'll bless you I'll make your name great you'll be a blessing or blessings bless you the one who treats you with cursed out in you all the families of the earth will will find blessing to be like okay the Eden dream is coming to the whole planet I'm just whole planet and it's going to happen through this guy in The Stand by the restoration to Eaton in some form will take place through the sky in his family because
 I thought wasn't so lines 5 and 6 year I'll bless those who bless you another words God's attaching himself in this hope to particular lineage and those who bless and treat God's chosen blessed ones in a favorable way friendly way God willingly Stephen Morton blessing but for those who you know try and undermine even Abraham and its lineage the God will treat the opposite where Abraham gets blessed by somebody and the first story where somebody intentionally put Abraham and his family in danger is in Genesis chapter 14 it's a story that begins in a really unusual way Begins by telling you about five Kings who ruled far to the east of where Abraham is the king of Babylon the king of Elam all these Kings and they're ticked off
 cuz for Kings live in the land of Canaan stopped paying their taxes to two of these five candies five Kings of the Far East had a coalition and they were getting rich off the taxes of these subjugated nations of Canaan the king of Sodom being the first one OK Google name I'm Raphael was king of shinar she knows where the tower in the city of Babylon we felt okay that's what I can do or American of Atlanta doll king of course these Kings went off to war against Vera king of Sodom Peter Shaw king of Gomorrah of king of ozma shame ever King of the volume and the king of Bella that is so are so excuse me I missed a that it's
 the Far East vs 5 Kings Canyon and they're led by the kings of Sodom just an epic ancient battle and hear the five Kings joined forces in the valley of shittim because for 12 years they had been slaves to kedorlaomer but in the Thirteenth Year they said no more for not paying taxes Knoxville Independence Day so in that goes on in the 14th year those Four Kings mounted a campaign we're going to be back they just come to the like get even another day on planet Earth as like here's the kings of the land dundun what Kings do taxes money territory power so you know what's funny is and Hebrew when you read this these names are I have some more homework to do but some of these names are meant to make you Snicker Vera means
 evil and beer sha means in wickedness Shin of the king of all the motion of means hater of the father or the bad guys this is five bad guys versus for bad guys and they're just a bunch of so it's all nations raging and this is what nations did wars and rumors of wars that's essentially what the Four Kings of the East do as they come they attacked Sodom and who happens to be living there Abraham's nephew and when they burn receive that ignition blessing remember I'll bless those who bless you those who treat you as a cursed one God will take it personally and will defend his people this is a story where Abram is chilling under some oak trees with some other Canaanites and what we're told is that they attend turned into a covenant with Abram so you got a bunch of Canaanites
 some of them wins the war going on what's going on okay and he's a broom up in the hills open the hell yep sitting out and a refugee from the war comes and says there's a war happening and well your nephew's been kidnapped so Abram heard this and he pulled together 318 men yeah yeah this is when you realize Abram wasn't just some dude in the Hills he's got a little army himself 318 Grill trained Warriors yeah they do a nitrate and it just says during the night Abram divided his men told me that movie about this he attacked them chase them pursued them up as far as Damascus like a hundred miles north and he recovered all of the goods and his relative lot and all of possession rescued all the women and all I needed a night raid on specific
 just that the Four Kings that attacked the five and and took their stuff you're supposed to be crazy and this is the first instance of a pattern that we need Bruce Willis to play in here this is the first census of a pattern of God's chosen one going against Great odds yeah Gideon and his 300 soldiers that fight against the midianites is an echo of Abraham and his 318 I just repeated over and over again it happens a lot to design pattern of God blessing those who blessed blessed one and do you and harshly with those who deal harshly with his blessed one
here's the scene so everyone comes back with all the stuff and two kings come to meet him this is a tale of two kings were told a 17 the king of Sodom came out to meet Abram after he returned from striking to Doral O'Mara and all the kings with him and they met in the valley of shovel and then the narrator Whispers In Your Ear hear he says if you don't know where that is it's the Valley of the king I still don't know what that is
 is hyperlink forward it's the valley rights to the south of Jerusalem okay this is a phrase used to describe the surrounding Valley of Jerusalem so this is just Abraham's first encounter with Jerusalem so Abraham's returning the king of Sodom comes up from down by the Dead Sea and comes to meet him right outside but then pause on the king of Sodom because also at that very moment another king came out milk is a deck king of Chelan came out to meet him chelem is a shorten form of the name Drew saw them just the path of the word so this is ancient Jerusalem three Israelite Joshua hasn't taken the land David that's all wait later but the people living up there and in the city in the hillside for inhabited so milk is a deck the king of Shah Alam he also came out but what he brought with him was bred and why
 let's eat together Beast brings a feast out of Jerusalem and wine you know you famished you just went on a nighttime raid there's nothing like some bread and wine after a night of drinking assumed under this is like weeks of traveling it's a hundred miles up north to Damascus plus so Abram chase them up north and he still up North and then he came back a few sentences the whole battle like one or two verses and it's for Shirley like weeks packed into so he's coming back from the road Battle Born and this king of Jerusalem comes out and bring the feast and dear reader he was a priest of God most high El elyon
 nothing so my rabbit hole begin to the totally it's the first time the word priest appears in the Bible and it doesn't describe an Israelite phrase that describes like a King of Prussia lamb whose name is my king is righteousness Melky sedeck and also it's interesting is he's priest of God most high now as we're going to find out in a moment that's also the same job for him is following around and worships the goes by the name of Yahweh knows independently of Abraham owes the Creator God and not only knows him but like is a priest there's some backstory we are not privy to this priest is preserving some ancient connection to the Creator God independent of the lineage that was the narrative has been following through Adam down to know until noon so the point is just there that's this guy's amazing
 and I'm he was one of the Four Kings he was not one of the four and in fact you were given the Four Kings of the Far East meet the five I mean wasn't so sorry for caring though I said for I'm sorry if the four things of the East met the five Kings of Canaan 9 Kings and Melchizedek is King number and and I'm now in The Narrative of Royal priest the Royal pre skin so he comes out bring me a piece out of Jerusalem and here's the other thing he comes bringing blessing blessing he blessed Abram and said Blessed Be Abram by God most high possessor of the skies and the land and blessed be God most high who has delivered over your enemies to your and he recognizes Abram as one who has God's special blessing and He blesses the God that he is a priest
 who recognizes us the god of Abraham who's the creator the Creator God Abram is so pleased and I'm inferring hear Abraham has such a good impression will say this he has an extreme response after seeing and meeting much as that I can eating the Feast of being blessed it's in verse 20 and Abram gave to him milk is a deck 1/10 of everything he had let me know this guy's got a lot and he just he just put together an army of three hundred men on the spot he's depicted as having a lot of wealth right now and he's got the pump lender right well that's what the rest of the narrative is going to be about so funny thing is is that comes out giving a fist and giving blessing and Abram says why such generosity divine blessing he's meeting his God in this priest-king and he gives to know his attack
 now this 10th is that supposed to mean anything at this point it's what will come to be put into ritual practice with What's called the ties and Israel's worship it says of Abraham before the laws about the ties were ever created he just spontaneously does it
no verse 21 back to the king of Sodom remembered a permit to Kings here greatest this narrative is designed to introduce two kings coming to me to Abram and you were told the king of Sodom comes out switches and then we'll go back to the king of Sodom and it's a way of saying this is happening simultaneously these two encounters so that you contrast them the king of Sodom comes up to Abram and he said yeah he sees all the stuff that's under in contrast to milk is a deck who gave to Abram he says the Abram give to me all these people as for the possessions you can take that for yourself so he comes out he comes wanting to take with milk cuz of that comes wanting to give and Abram said to the king of Sodom I raise my hand Yahweh means wearing enough Yahweh God most high possessor of sky and the land whether it's a strap or a sandal song I'm not going to take anything.
 songs to you so that you'll never be able to say I'm the one who made Abraham rich just what the lads have eaten and you know and you know I've got these are the Canaanites with me on their ethical Monterey who was sitting under the tree by you know when we when this whole thing started and let them take what they want but he gives all of it back as a general's maybe of sorts they were just as partners there is Covenant partners that he was sitting under the tree with neighbors did they go to war with the did they do not ready to get this contrasting image where the king of Sodom represent the kings of the Nations and all they want to do is take and negotiate and he tries to put a bream in this debt like I you take this but give this to me when we talked about gift-giving and culture which I wouldn't have seen that I would spend like a broom you're being a little bit
 particular self-made man don't you know this is a real thing it's a real a real thing yeah he takes it I'm now indebted to you that's right if I take what used to belong to you and you're giving it to me then now I'm in your debt and you'll always be able to say number I gave you the thing I gave you so much now you know how are you going to ever be no pay me back. So he doesn't want to be indebted to the king of Sodom but he is more than happy to give a tenth of what he has to King of Jerusalem because he is the channel of the Eden blessing but him giving to Melchizedek is putting milk is a deck in his dad has already done that by bringing out the fees and giving him a blessing okay so it's like Abraham's reciprocate hookah when you give him the 10th I see you gave me a little taste of Eden and I'll happily give you the tenth of all I have but with the king of Sodom
 inexpensive meal yeah but man when you meet the face of eating outside Jerusalem milk is a deck this Canaanite Royal priest-king bringing out the abundance of Jerusalem and bringing out the blessing of Jerusalem and showering on Abram This is highly significant in terms of the narrative this is a Eaton moment one and two Melchizedek is the first person to bless Abram members of the opening words those who bless you I will bless so then is a reader you're sitting here going well okay well what's going to happen what will it look like for the city of Jerusalem and this Royal line of priest-kings to experience God's blessing so that means he and his Royal Priestly lineage and the radar
 until the story of David when David will intentionally reactivate the milk is a deck roll but which we'll talk about it when we get there okay so here's the larger point we're only at Genesis 14 this is pretty Moses this is pre Tabernacle this is before Aaron and the high priest is before any of that and we're being given this recall of the blessings of Eden and if someone being in the eaten like Place bringing out the abundance in life of Eden and blessing God's chosen one and when we know within the God's blessing economy those who bless our Blessed Like A we call it a blessing ecosystem keeps creating more financially it sets up from Genesis 14 you just supposed to say dear reader this is Way Beyond the lookout for future appearances of a royal priest-king connected to Jerusalem who will release Eaton type blessing
 that's the story. It just so we go on into the story just talkin that way it's so yeah that's such a random little thing and then it's like okay talk that away yes you'll need it later to make sense of a hold of a whole bunch of things
 okay so priests don't play a significant role in the story until we go on Abram is sometimes kind of place is Priestly roll what's the whole thing with like cutting the animals in half and like walking through the story of Abraham and Isaac in The Binding of Isaac on super important statement was I'm going to make you a great nation bought the kids instead of waiting for God to miraculously give he and Sarah a child Sarah and April or two older kids that's right this place clean up their own way and end up hurting a lot of people in the process of them are one of their slaves Hagar the Egyptian and then her son Abraham's first born son Ishmael and then
 their abuses and oppress them and it's a sad story so once Abraham and Sarah do get their own surprise miraculous sun god turns around and asks for the life of that son back like a month and where does God ask Abraham and Isaac to go to do that Mariah yeah I got it says take your son your only son go to the land of Moria Moria and offer him up make him go up as a going up offering on one of the mountains so there's some high place in the mountains of Moria for sure that's where Tolkien got the minds and Maria in the mountains of Moria is in The Lord of the Rings plagiarism in the culminating moment of that as Abraham is Binding of Isaac and about to the offer him up as a sacrifice this is inverse 11 in Genesis 22 the angel he always calls out and stopped him Abraham Abraham
 and Abraham says yeah don't stretch out your hand against the lad don't do anything now I know that you fear God you haven't withheld your son Abraham lifted his eyes on the high place of Moria and he looks over and sees a ram caught in the thicket he went and got it and he offered it as a going up offering in the place of his son Abram called the name of that place Yahweh will see or see to it usually translated y'all we will provide cuz what he just watched happened with you always spare the life of his son and provide a substitute so Abram the sun was about to die for Abraham sentence and what God does is provide a substitute which means that God still is the possessor of the life of Abraham's seed it's in God's hands but what he chooses not to treat it as is his sins deserve but to provide a substitute Yahweh will see it and then
 the last half a 14in sew with Keith the narrator speaks up to the reader it's more like a moment where if you're watching a movie and then one of the characters just turns around and starts addressing you know this is kind of a Trope now yes it is yet to become like a pretty normal thing that's cool do you know what Ferris Bueller's Day Off that's an early that's an early one example yeah that's good it is a little different cuz it's not Abraham speaking to us what is the narrator says hey dear reader and he's like paused the moment of Ingram offering the steps to deposit it and then head sticks out and do you know this is why today we still set on the mountain of Yahweh it will be seen to 4 it will be provided so the narrator is speaking to somebody
 who they just have in common this place where you can just say you know the mountain of Yahweh which is which is Drew Jerusalem yes the phrase has only ever used to describe Jerusalem in the Hebrew Bible
 and the thing that Abraham experienced were God provided substitute for the sins of his chosen one do you know that's what happens there every day dear reader on the mountain of Yahweh is still happening to that the comet comes from a vantage point of centuries later down in the history of Israel as soon as we're in the land the temples doing its thing so this story is being put here as a important part of the origin story of what of the function of the temple in Jerusalem or later Israelites Abram and Abraham here is his being a priest in a way that the point he's going to that place and he's making a sacrifice to write that will provide and cover over the people and the sacrifice that actually is offered is in the place of the life of his seed but another words what the story is he of the narrator's whispering and forever
 later Israelite whoever went to the temple they see themselves replaying the story of Abraham and Isaac with every time they offer sacrifice and then the priest there who is offering the sacrifice playing this Abraham like raw so these are the two moments and Abraham story where the city of Jerusalem is not named you have to follow the hyperlinks through later and in both cases it's the priesthood and about the Return to Eden with a with no kids attack it was about the blessings of Eden being given to those who bless Abram here here it's about sacrifices being offered to cover over the sins of the people so that God's blessing I'm can be restored because look at the next thing God says after this in Genesis 22 God says because you have done this thing and not withheld your only son I will greatly bless you and multiply your seed like stars of the heavens and Micah sand on the seashore your seed will possess the gates of their enemies like milk is it
 blessing was God delivered you the hands of your enemies and in your seed all the nations of the earth will be blessed it's exactly what God said in Genesis 12 so we can get the blessings of eating but also a substitute to cover for the sins of the people so that the blessings of Eden can be released to the nation's wow that would be awesome I wonder if that's ever going to happen and then you just keep on reading so the Abraham stories have been designed to set you up for the need of something to happen here in Jerusalem where the blessings of Eden can be released and where the sins of God's covenant people can be covered over that amazing this is like in the Abraham story Locust attack shows how a Priestly figure can come and provide you the blessings of Eden and then this
 free of Abraham and Isaac shows how I'm obedience and obedience to God and then bring us to a place where God can provide for us a covering or a substitute or a way to out of the mess that we've created for ourselves and they're both taking place foreshadowing Jerusalem in the temple what we want is someone who can mediate to us the life in the blessing of Ethan and the abundance of Eden and milk is a deck is that kind of pit stops lot but to do that we got to get past those cherubim we have to deal with this problem that's been created by human Folly and evil and so what is the way to access and pass by the cherubim to
 experience the blessing of Eden and that's with Genesis 22 tapping into is that it requires a surrender of what one defines as the meaning of your life but Abraham Sarah were willing to hurt people or the way or a surrender of of your plan for How To Succeed your knowledge of Good and Bad and the Ugly the moment that you think the Abraham's future and family is about to die is the moment of the goddess of mercy and provides a covering for the substitute and they both happen in the same spot in the same spot which leads me to think that will visit just to cover one generation is his family my hunch that this is probably going to have to keep happening or it will happen again and some climactic way and said that paves the way for the next Generations will be there's going to be a Moses and Aaron iteration
 in the portable portable Eden with the Tabernacle and then they'll be a third iteration with the story of David and Solomon setting up the temple so you can see it in terms of theme video we kind of set this design pattern and in our conversations were doing and Abraham the duration of Moses and Aaron David and then a Jesus iteration thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to continue the series on the role of priests in the Bible we're going to look at the story of Aaron brother of Moses the first Israelite priest why is he called a levite in the first time Aaron is mentioned who is the son of Levi but this is Moses's brother so I certainly What's Happening Here is we're talking we're naming his tribe because this is the tribe that will play the role of the priesthood I'm saying it's the narrative strategy by calling him are in the levite the nurse
 there wants to draw attention to this is the foundation of the levite category of the priesthood we've got a few more episodes in this conversation on priests but we're going to start taking questions for our upcoming question response episode at the end of the series so as questions arise as you listen through this series with us we'd love to hear from you record yourself asking the question let us know your name where you from and try to keep it to around 20 or 30 seconds or so and email it to info at bible project.
