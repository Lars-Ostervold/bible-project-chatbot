all right Tim. We finish the whole series on the theme family of God and we get to do an interview with someone that you got to know recently tell it tells about that yeah yeah so are we serious tracing the theme of the multi-ethnic international family of Abraham in the Messiah in the storyline of the Bible and as I was reading and actually through a friend of a friend I came across work of a new testament scholar Andrew Rivera who has been pursuing like these very questions especially in Paul's letters which is where we ended our conversations for the podcast and so it just felt like a perfect fit to include interview with Andrew about this so Andrew he's a new testament scholar who is finishing his PhD at Duke Divinity School and he's been an adjunct professor of biblical studies at eternity Bible College
 third a book with another New Testament scholar Preston sprinkle called fight a Christian Case for non-violence though I just learned it's going to be retitled and re-released again under the title non-violence the Revolutionary way of Jesus which by the way I took multiple book clubs through that but I talked of it is from the Old Testament which might surprise some people but anyway so that's awesome of academic articles but the one that caught my attention is actually yet to be published at least we're talking right now it's going to be published in 2021 in the Journal called biblical research it's on Ephesians to the title of the article is 30 mm gayness is Latin for third race in will talk about what that means to us or dyadic Unity investigating socio-political salvation in Ephesians Island ton
 this tackle essay and Andrew it's great to have you on the podcast we're really excited talk with you honored to be on here it's great thank you totally so before we even take another step we're going to have his are launching pad a really dense paragraph from the fusions chapter 2 who you are and your story then we'll get into the weeds sure I think one of the more important things to know about me I'm as far as like why I'm in this line of work this weird place of Steel call scholarship trying to find gainful employment all that but it really has to do with me growing up Jehovah's Witness in Google around buy more about them going to take out some air time describing their beliefs but basically I think it will flag is is they don't believe in the try and got they think you know the Trinity being one God Eternal existence 3
 thinked person's United the Divine Essence their modern-day Ariens if anyone knows church history was areas who did not believe Jesus was God but rather the first created by the word of God being a creature there was a serious on this but they don't believe Jesus Is God and the Holy Spirit they don't believe the holy spirit in a person let alone God's kind of like Star Wars active Force type of thing but my parents got divorced when when I was younger my mother grew up on a reform Jewish a house while she was adopted into it from birth and became is James Arness and then became Christians in a conservative Evangelical context and putting the trauma of divorce to side for a second I mean that in the South that caused another crisis for me which was a logical crisis because I had to wrestle with a very young age with profoundly different ways of interpreting scripture from two people who both love me both were sincere
 representing whole communities of interpretive communities my mom and my dad are both believe in the Bible to be the inspired word of God you're coming to drastically different conclusions about meeting interpretation of you've got all these things you're a little guy that was more around fourth fifth sixth grade of w really like wait all the stuff is super conflicting but my parents were divorced when I was four around the age of 78 it really started to sort of rock my world and that's a logical sense I mean kind of our being young and inexperienced and pants go to divorce but I was studying the Bible very closely just as a matter of like survival and coping with a theological crisis that this divorce or can just run up on me so I've just been interested almost as a matter I guess I've survived necessity in biblical studies in theology from a very young age and so that's just kind of I just happened to grow up basically you know time
 everyone and I was just keep having these questions keep wanting to be able to be a responsible and thoughtful reader scripture and teacher and so I just kind of kept calling cuz my dad to underground Bible did a master's at Fuller and now that Duke doing a PhD and New Testament and minor in Theology and early Judaism in stay curious you know yeah that's so interesting you know John you and I have had the Bible play different roles in our lives are formative years and then Andrew to think about you and the encounters we have or don't have with the Bible right in those formative years man they say it's they really do set a trajectory even into our adult years. They and why do you think you decided just keep doubling down on the Bible and investigated versus just go I parents think different things who knows I'll leave it be
 sound really Pius the calling of God I don't know I have two older brothers who did exactly what you just said they just went whatever I don't care anymore and to this day have one of them's kind of asking questions a bit more now I'm ten years older than me but yeah I mean I don't know I don't know why I was different for me it just I didn't feel like I was deciding to do this it just kind of felt like I said a matter of necessity I got to figure this stuff out type of a thing in the further I got a long though the further I started to notice and truthfully patterns that have regrettably in real-time come to a tragic Climax and in this nation and mainly that the same sorts of patterns of thinking and interpretation that I inherited this job is witness and studied were replicated in my conservative Evangelical contacts just you know substituting out a couple bits and I was really troubled by that and wanted to understand
 teach people who claim allegiance to God and to his word and I wanted to wrestle with these questions of the Bible is used and wielded as a weapon of Oppression and in some contexts just look at some history about how also it's it's been reclaimed as a toy of redemption and of setting things right of training in righteousness and Justice and so that's kind of why I kept going into my adulthood is wanting to be a responsible leader and teacher of scripture to the church yeah the sense of calling I'm curious how would you describe that was it just a conviction was it was it something more than that I think it comes you know and it in Friday ways both something I get excited about liking stuff I would do my free time I play hockey still grew up playing ice hockey roller hockey Ferguson ice hockey you know that's like normal kids that ride your bike skateboarding
 yeah I did all that stuff but I didn't do it as often as my brother's another friend when I wanted to do for fun of my free time wasn't always as watch the hockey game or whatever but was you know I want to read I need to figure these questions out something I like to do and then as I got older and your kind of thrust into leadership roles right by Lynyrd guy yours should be a pastor and I I resisted that for a while cuz I was like now that's just what to me this is just a normal person should be different with claiming that the claim to believe these things they should be something that everyone just does like this is just a normal pattern of life for a Christian this isn't something that's unique that's whatever yes I think I'm being kind of given opportunities to teach in various contacts and being affirmed by that in various ways kind of overtime sealed that in my mind that whatever I'm going to do ultimate Lee it
 might have something to do with bringing the fruits of biblical scholarship in the time I've been given as a gift to devote most of my waking time hours to be used in service for the church so yeah I get it I totally get it and everything you're saying I I really resonated with and understand you're up and if I force John Ortiz willingly come along with me and let me take him down the rabbit hole of difficult studies and it's a waterfall is wonderful down here is that so we're going to jump into fusions you're going to read this paragraph a paragraph is a difficult translation issue and I'm actually kind of coming in a bit blind so I asked the questions that everyone else is happening this is a wonderful what I love about this essay Andrew was that it's a great example of the literally the interpretation and translation of 1
 verse in one of Paul's letters opens up how you think about the whole biblical story as it relates to ethnicity and race and sometimes we're like one sentence in the Bible becomes like a lightning rod for a hole bigger set of universal issues related to a passion of yours which is why you wrote this essay in the first place and I guess we're going to drill down and getting ready and then we're going to keep expanding out to talk about why you think how we understand this paragraph and Paul's Theology of the multi-ethnic families God why this matters for the church right now I'll start I'm going to read this paragraph Andrew and then I'm going to start asking you questions about it perfect
so this from the fusions 2:11 Paul says therefore remember that one time you Gentiles remember John that's a word that means nations in Greek the nations in the flesh you who are called uncircumcised by those called the circumsized and then he breaks off his sentence and insert the comment the circumcision performed by hands in the flash so if you're lost already circumcision made was a sign symbol that you were in the Covenant family babraham Israelites and so donations they didn't do it so Paul's just basically saying hey all you in the nation's you didn't have to sign that said you were part of the family already non-israelite non Messianic Jewish audience here he's a significant
 in the past apart from the Messiah you were estranged from citizenship or the citizenry of Israel you were foreigners to the covenants of the promise having no hope without God in the world but now in Messiah Jesus Yahoo were at one time far off have been brought in the air by the blood of the Messiah he himself is our peace he's the one who made the two into one having destroyed the barrier of the wall having exhausted in his flesh the hostility that is the Torah of Commandments with decrees so that he could create in himself the two into one new Humanity making peace and that he might reconcile to God that these two by means of one body through the cross having killed the hostility in himself and as he came out good news of peace to all of you who are far off peace to those who are near because through him we both
 buy me the one Spirit have access to the father holy cow that is a dense as dance the sentence or paragraph. So Andrew you read this essay because paragraphs like this and Paul's letters which clearly relating to that Israel and not Israelites and how they come together as one of the big team and Paul's writings however there's a lot of disagreement about what exactly Paul was saying it and doing with this idea that gots creating one family out of all the nations and there's actually an important fork in the road issue to hear about how people understand polish Theology of God forming one family as the nation's and there's a long theological word called supersessionism but often comes into play here so it helped us driving map for us of the set of issues and possibly ology and why it matters for how we think about the family is God
 shirt so I think so was talking about for a second supersessionism can't get into the weeds but basically to supersede something is to replace it to overtake it you know if you want up at 1 I'll be so supersessionism because it's kind of nebulous like that can be applied to various ways so to be clear about kind of what I'm talking about when I see the issue is is in the history of Christianity there's the Steelers in Kendall Solon who teaches over at Emory read a book called The God of Israel and Christian Theology and he talks about two different kinds of supersessionism what is punitive supersessionism this is so what we're talking about is Israel in the church right the two different groups of the circumcised and uncircumcised the question is is Israel superseded by the church and there's punitive supersessionism which that is a yes answer is yes it is the church replaced Israel completely in is punitive because they rejected their Messiah just as God's punishment on them and they are forever abandoned everything gets transferred over to the church
 punitive supersessionism there she proceeded as punishment then there's economic supersessionism which is softer sometimes they go hand-in-hand but basically the idea that is reoccurring to the flash kosher all the way things are now I have become obsolete their kind of meaningless now in the church so the church has superseded Israel but not as a punishment just kind of because of we've moved on to different dispensation type of thing and what I am kind of mapping here is economic supersessionism creeping in either wittingly or unwittingly whenever we think that baptized use within the church that they should no longer be Jewish they should no longer practice Judaism they should no longer circumcised their sons they should no longer pass on that Jewish identity generation after generation because it's been wiped out right this season's as Tim said
 sort of the flashpoint for certain interpreters for this view that Judaism is abolished in the church because of the syntax that goes on a couple of verses which Jesus said about washing something and it's chores mention a Commandments are mentioned in so people just say Jesus is a polishing the Torah and the Commandments and in the church it's creative homogeneous same that's why there's no distinctions anymore in terms of ethnicity and all that we're all just this same thing and therefore choose are becoming former juice to be coming they need to become Jen and if they don't one famous New Testament scholar that I that I interact with him in my article explicitly flag this up as saying you're redirecting the border of hostility he was a Jew continue these things in the church and again willingly or unwillingly I think that's both wrong number one exegetical into incredibly dangerous and is exact
 the rhetoric that has been used throughout centuries to not just from anti-Semitism but to transfer that anti-Semitism worth it the Jew than just becomes the symbol for everything that Christianity is not and everything is wrong with you on the world don't medieval theology legalism the big deal out Jews are legalists right New Perspective comes along and says I don't know it's not illegal it's at the center has them their nationalist ethnocentric all Judit that's every all these markers that makes them guilty of ethnocentrism and so those ideas then get transferred over a book as a chest on this is Willie Jennings book or is it called the Christian imagination I forgot the subtitle are Google Willie Jennings in the Christian imagination and one of the students when my teachers, given to teachers at 4 I'm at the book called Israel in the Catholic city of Jesus deals with this issue of that supersessionism being transferred over in the church and then to Colonial age
 all others any difference musivend be smoothed out and homogenized and assimilated to project of assimilation so miss y'all and he gets wrapped up in a simulating people into a sameness and at this is why I think it's so I'm trying I'm raising the stakes if they scored I'm trying to do here both in terms of history but then I chose this passage to to discuss these things because I think this passage itself raises the stakes it pushes these concerns into a sociological register is that too big of a rush I love it it's a Salvation issue right there's salvation to being mentioned here and the only time we hear about Jesus death in the the fruit of it what is Jesus death do it's mentioned right here with all these but I called socio-political concerned that's just the way of saying hey get out of our your individualism and it's like going to heaven when you die thing this is what we mean in our culture by social concerns political concerns this is exactly where this is located and so we don't get this right it's not
 bad axe Adidas it's bad salvation theology spasticity rheology and it has immense historical consequences so this is just one passes though right I'm not trying to say that this is doing everything there's a lot of work to be done is being done but this is an important passage
alright Andrew the sauce that's the whole package right there are so many good little nuggets you laid along the trail right there so I'm going to go back to start in this paragraph and in reality we had these two groups and Paul here is saying these two have become one and Sue supersessionism we're in the title of your article 30am gayness which is the Latin phrase means the third race so this would be a view that says if you're becoming a Christian you are leaving whatever Gentile identity you had before Jews are called to leave their Jewish identity and you become the new humanity and misinterpretation the new humanity is ethnically colorblind that's supposedly supposedly supposedly problem is it's not just becomes Jen. Just going to break or whatever the dominant hegemonic culture is in our day because of whiteness yes that way of reading what the
 humanity is your condenses both damaging and this have damaged throughout church history but that also if you pay close attention that's not what Paul means he doesn't Envision the new Humanity as erasing people's pre-existing ethnic or national identity which by the way is John when we started the series it's the first question you asked when we started talking about ethnicity in the family of God what's the status of our existing National ethnic family identities so let's get into why you think this is a incorrect reading that's not what Paul meant it is damaging the let's talk about what Paul meant for a moment what can we first talked about why some people think Paul means there's supposed to be this that what's the word homogeneous homogeneous some ominous ethnicity I want to register what you said just make sure I get it cuz I think it's in a
 if your theology is saying leave behind your nationality or leave behind your ethnicity leave behind your Traditions to become this new thing then that might sound nice but in reality whatever whatever the dominant tradition ethnicity is that's the thing that will be will take over and that's not a hypothetical I don't like that's something we just look back that's provable that's just in fact could happen right and that's the tower Babel project to a little bit and we talked about which is one one thought and one language language and so how do you get to that reading first time he's just help me understand how you get to that reading here like why why is that then the common reading but what I think is their mistake and reading and at least I have you asked a question I think be a version that incorporated our kind of I don't want to call it a revision cuz I think it's translating the Greek
 properly but it's a revision of most English translation so if you're reading an English translation for instance the nrsv at Ephesians 2:15 it'll say that he might he might create in himself when did humanity and then they have this cyst in the Greek in place of the to dust making piso the condition of peace and Reconciliation is predicated on that translation on replacing the to the to being a Jew or not Jew Israel and not Israel what he calls the the the four skinned and the circumcised or is that the relations at Nanny and Israel so those are the two groups throughout but I think that's how this happened before there's English translations of the Bible I'm just complicated set of historical circumstances that I think led up to this sort of reading of what the church is what verse was that again Ephesians 2:15 I'm going to get a traditional translation in front of you out here he himself is our peace made the to grow
 in 21 destroying the barrier the dividing wall of hostility by the way the the barrier the dividing wall of hostility was referring to hear exactly that the question has Flash the law with his commands and regulations and its purpose was to create himself one new Humanity out of the two that's making peace that's the new international version that's an IV in the dividing wall with the with the law and I hope I need to be removed if there's going to be peace need to remove the law if you need to replace the 20 that one didn't say replace so good job on them and that verse and I stay in place of the two to make a crystal clear that issue at stake here is that the law given to Israel which in particular were talking about circumcision but there are other issues kosher Sabbath
 observance that to become part of the new family do you have to leave that behind or can you still participate in those Traditions cuz that's part of your tradition and if Paul is saying here that the dividing wall of hostility the thing that's keeping the family separated are those Traditions then you would have to say well then you have to get rid of them stopped using them that's what's dividing family exactly that is not just the danger isn't just maybe anti-Semitism the danger actually is much bigger than that it actually is now it's this idea of some sort of new Superior race that's what's going to be the dominant race because otherwise they're divisive right essentially right that's what these readers do and that's a me to their credit that's what a lot of these commentators actually say which is why they're using Ephesians
 at 2:14 to 15 can make these comments on tour observance but the problem is as you guys I mean a real time I just listen to the podcast y'all really some packs right and as you say Tim right so we're on a lot of the same page on all this Peter vision isn't about abolishing cash route and all this stuff so I want to say is that that the whole problem in Acts 15 the question concerning whether those from the nation's Gentiles are obligated to observe Torah you can't make sense of that problems unintelligible unless it was taken for granted that baptized use as four main terms Urban and part of that is continuing circumcise their their sons that are born in this is something that's represented in several places in the in the New Testament in Paul's letter to the Corinthians 1st Corinthians 7 and says this is all a la I'm going to come and lay down all the churches that are circumcised you're not
 seek to become an uncircumcised you're not to abandon that and if likewise you know if your not circumcised you not to think that you're obligated to become Jewish to become and I'll go through this elaborate play me in Acts 21 with James and several others to prove publicly his message about not circumcising has nothing to do with the Jewish people and everything to do with the Gentiles as as obligating Gentiles to become Jewish so I want to be clear at this point though cuz I get this all the time when I teach New Testament row or it comes up in his Roxy ology that has heaves and stuff I want to be clear that this it's not that I think are Paul that would have you know whichever way however we want to raise this stop it but I think Paul thinks that circumcision is necessary for salvation for Jews the Jews are saved in a different way than Gentiles Jesus alone is necessary for salvation
 crank up on both juice non-jews alike salvations only through Jesus however they issue at hand has to do with ecclesiology right that is what's the nature of the church is it supposed to be this color blind new race thing that superseding not just the Jews that all others or the union of all Nations especially and its core the Jewish nation that you guys like the bat battle in your podcast in here earlier podcast I think what we need to realize that having a color-blind homogeneous non-jewish people for Paul it's important it's very important not just a question of is this individual in and then I want the in what if we're asking if pasta is this person in the thing
 which demonstrates to the powers as a seasons 3 9 and 10 are you into thing to demonstrate to the to the powers that they have been superseded by the Lord Jesus Christ and that you are seated with Jesus far above them are you in that saying vote for that answer are you in that you need to be in a community that looks like a community of diversity in a different hospitable difference rather than hostile difference and so we too often I think I get like stuck on the individual level are you saying individual to be saved and either do this then the other thing and talk concern isn't back here it's actually what demonstrates the powers that there's a new Lord and it's a certain sort of polis is a certain sort of political entity and that entity cannot be color-blind homogeneous
 this was a whole section of that says really Illuminating you draw attention the fact that this paragraph infusions to is actually the second half of a much larger movement of thought and that the paragraph right before it so if he's into verses 1 through 10 is actually drafted Paul drafted that paragraph to be a precise parallel progression of ideas that he comes back and runs through again from a different angle in the paragraph that we just read and this was really helpful for me and this is where you get the phrase social socio-political salvation so I can I just read how these two paragraphs are parallel and then I want you to summarize kind of the conclusions you drew from that this was super helpful for me so if he says to begins with some really famous actually well-known words if you're in Christian circles begins and y'all were dead and your transgressions and sins in which at one time you walked doing the desires of the flesh he goes on
 say that you were under the ruler of the authority of the are the spirit now at work among those who disobey Tiant the powers powers but then he says but God being rich in Mercy he made us a live together with the Messiah it's by grace that you can say he made y'all a live together with the Messiah raise you up together seated you together in the Heavenly Realms in Messiah you've been created in Messiah Jesus for good works that whole line of thought and even the words are all repeated again so you were at one time Dad but then he says and starting the second paragraph you all were at one time Gentiles is strange trip Israel so being dead in your sins is equated with being estranged from the nation of Israel from the Covenant Promises of Israel you were under the ruler of the authority of air Paul says you were / this dividing wall whatever that isn't Angela talk about that he says but God
 rich in Mercy saving us of making us alive with Messiah and then he says in the second paragraph but now in Messiah Jesus you've been brought here by the blood of the Messiah and the previous paragraph he's made you a live together raised you up together seated you together with the Messiah and that's a parallel to the verses were talking about where he made the two one he brought together those that were separate so why is Paul drafted these two paragraphs alongside each other Andrew why do you think that's significant for understanding of what it means to be saved and possibly phones because it goes back to what I was trying to stumble over earlier which is that participating in Salvation is participating in a certain sort of political reality for Paul and the word political maybe Define what you mean you got to give me the Biblical word political like the Greek word yeah I mean I'm I'm also assuming maybe I should I'm also assuming listeners are tracking with all your
 previous stuff and work on these things I've heard you explicate so I mean you can think about it as your public life together and you're common life together what you do in Republic which isn't as separable from what you do in private is that impact its it just I mean what I mean is the visible Gathering of people around certain customs and commitments and liturgies and all these stuff and the life that exudes out of that yeah what Paul's articulating is that certain political Gatherings are under the lordship Emily says this spell s in verse 2 chapter 2 verse 2 you're under the powers that have been usurped by Jesus Jesus has been at Delta. So these powers that rule over the systems and institutions of the world bring death and hostility to Vision all these things your participation
 salvation Johnson raising you up and seeding you together with Christ as actually another parallel that goes back even further with what God did for Jesus same burbs other than talk with the prefix the with Co even Cole raised with Christ and cozy with Christ Jesus. God did to Jesus raise them up seated in Heavenly places is saying is what does that look like what does that actually mean that you've been saved by this God in this way of being raised and seated well it looks like participation in this new Humanity in which former hostilities have been abolished and you are together United before got but there's a lot more to that that I want to pack a part of the reason I show the parallel to say this is a Salvation issue for calling this letter this isn't just like oh what's I don't know. Go application or something like that this is explicating the Salvation that you just talked about
 Haitian you mean a deposit he talked out with the spirit right you've been given a spirit as a deposit what is that life what is this anticipatory experience of a renewed humanity mean you can have that now only if you are part of this community so that has nothing to do and it's going to annoy people it annoys me to admit it that has nothing to do with a person's individual post-mortem fate he's not concerned about that right here he's concerned about how do you participate right now in this world for all the time so I'm just going to go on for a bit how do you share in the life of Salvation right now it looks like he says in chapter 4 you have to be diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace in the peace is only mentioned right here before this so the Fusions for 3 you know what piece are we supposed to do
 if this Beast the piece of piece of Jesus makes and that piece is a certain sort of gathering a certain sort of political entity that rejects the current powers of inverse to Ephesians 2 to cuz it's over them so that's the thing that superseded the powers have been keeping Humanity at odds with each other and violence and Injustice and tribalism and Christ being raised above and us being raised with him above the powers does logic of now no longer is that the animating force that you live under there's something new that you get to be a part of it says in the question becomes what is this new thing is that this third race or yeah what is the what's the biblical vision for this Unity do we need to get rid of jewishness and and then after that
 what other kind of others and things that we consider to be two other two exotic to nest in our midst kind of weeks expel those from us that becomes a question if you have a third race ecclesiology cuz the difference starts to mean division rather than opportunity for Hospitality you could read most contemporary translations and walk away from this paragraph thinking Paul thinks that cultural Customs for example the example hear the practices of tort observance are what divides the new humanity and so Messianic Jews need to leave of cultural practices aside if we're going to experience Unity Paul a break out in a rash convinced of it cuz it's exactly not what he means what will actually tell the powers that they are powerless is people who actually practice culture
 different ways of life but discover their unity in the Messiah and so they gather together but they keep practicing their communities to keep practicing the Torah observant way of life but living at peace in the nudity with their Gentile neighbors who practice around different ways of life and so this has to do again down to the syntax and grammar of one sentence a verse 15 of Ephesians chapter 2 what exactly is it that the Messiah is setting aside the most of our translation to read he sets aside the Torah with his commands and decrees but there are many reasons to conclude that that's an incorrect interpretation translations not what palm means here so walk us through what you think's going on in this verse in what you think is being abolished and set aside and how this fits into the larger picture so there's several ways to go to go at this the first one is to kind of do a argument like a geometrical proof
 type of argument where you assume the wrong thing you know when they played out and if the conclusions ridiculous thing I update will then you just proved that thing right so let's assume the opposite of what I'm saying what's assume that what's what's going on what's being abolished is the law right that's the problem the problem is tour observance within within the church and the problem is circumcision so if the problems circumcision then the solution how do you solve that problem solution would not be concentrated on the citizenship change that the current to the nation to the Gentiles writing but you go read the text all the pressures on the citizenship change of the Gentiles Visa Visa at the pulley Tia the political to Commonwealth Politti ingredients of Israel the citizenship changes strangers their far all the emphasis is actually on what's happening to the Gentiles in relation to them. Is it from the circumcision on
 occurring the Jews who are who would then have to be counseled stop being distinctively Jewish right for the sake of peace and Reconciliation it's it would be the text could be centered on dismantling jewishness is if the problem was jewishness but in fact it's on the Texas centered on reimagining the socio-political relationship between Israel and the Gentiles and so this is why the solution isn't to replace the pulley Tia Israel with the church or something else but rather to integrate apart from circumcision these Gentiles be strangers as my fellow citizens and into 1980s up at the same prefix that Paul put on those birds to join us with Jesus of raising its heating he puts on this word for for citizen probably taste which itself means fellow-citizen makes it so he's like Stella fellow that he has another prefix on their into 19 what you would expect if the third race View
 right is something completely absent for the rest of the passage everything all the changes happening now with Israel that was a circumcision but from the Gentiles on that side of things which tells you that the problem is exactly what he said the problem was the problem was you at the time your dad and your sins right and then now he's been a life and then the parallel you at the time or separate from all this now you've been brought here not you were separate because they were so that no Centric and how dare they let's get them to stop that and now we're all the same so you can look at it that way right so just to say like okay will that be strong it's got to be something else will then might lead you to believe that Paul misspoke then here when he called the dividing wall the Torah and its Commandments in the world does that mean then write a few another option that needs to be dismissed like pretty quickly which is that the Nullification of the Mosaic Commandments can't be in view because just a few chapters later
 I know quote from one of The Commandments children obey your parents for this is righteousness this is Justice a candy since the first commandment comes up with a promise of tests and so obviously the community that all the dressing is still organized around the the Commandments in the Mosaic Covenant so he's not a bow washing those Commandments because he appeals to them just a couple of seconds later so there's got to be a again there's going to be another what what is going on here why is the Torah mentioned right there when he's talking about abolishing things and destroying things and making peace and all this so we got those to write week I think I made this probably too quick right that's a work trip but at least in theory we put away what it what it can't be saying so then you want to we want to figure out okay what did you say
one thing didn't answer is that in Greek word order is more flexible than an English so if you're looking at your English translation in your life but the word order seems very clear I am not clear in Greek actually the Greek is capable of about 3 different ways or more of translating and interpreting what is the dividing wall that gets destroyed and I don't want to get really into the weeds and right right now before we talk about the Syntax for a second I want to do is like a live exercising in the in hermeneutics right once we've identified some problems and we are both out some certain readings how should we make sense out of the work what it what are the clues we need to look for it well we need to to see how the author or in this case you know right here in the fusions how are they using their words how are they building their own lexicon of what these words mean in this context and so what we have is we have keywords
 in chapter two dead male I've raised up covenants of Promise Torah and then Covenant identity marker circumcision foreskin Israel ask May 10th so this to me says okay Paul speaking in between the drama of the Covenant economy of Israel so we need to go to the Covenant to see if there's language there that helps us see what he talking about here and Moma hole to go to the Covenant is specifically that the blessings and cursings mentioned Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 and then at the end of Deuteronomy 30 Moses sums all these sums up the blessings and cursings the curses with life-and-death I leave before you life and death choose life if not all these things are all these forces are going to come up on you so we know that already okay if Paul's flagging this up and pick him up for a ham talking about Commandments him talking about Israel in the nation's I'm talking about life
 talking about death maybe we should go to the covenants a promise that he mentioned to figure out you know what what these for these words mean and when you look at the curses the curse is don't happen in a socio-political vacuum they implicate the nation's so when Israel's disobedient the Covenant curse of death are all about hostility with a nation I mean they climax is there but its first hostility kind of Civil War type stuff like internal hostility is all kind of theirs they're spam and there's all sorts of bad things but it's climaxes and the Nations coming in and removing Israel from the land that is deaf right and then Ezekiel makes it even more clear there in Exile and and he's looking at his vision and they are the deadest dead dead Community there ever was dry bones Valley of of just right and how is this coming to Renewal pictures it's pictures of resurrections being made alive again
 in a restoration of the unity of Israel settled between the North and the South and all this and then later and Ezekiel 2 Nations themselves coming in importantly they Remain the nation's right and then Isaiah and all the stuff they don't become Israelite so we have in here at the covenants a promise write this promise of a renewal of all that is bound up in this language of life and death and if so what's your political hostility between Israel and the Nations and so what what my argument is is all that's there any fuses to it's all that same exact language is there and in fact in Deuteronomy it says part of that Exile part of that when the when the nation's come in you're going to serve their gods you're going to you're going to be under their power that's what I think is being flagged up with these powers that he says we too were under that white because we are in the Covenant curse of death we were exiled under the foreign rulers and their foreign language Deuteronomy before God and these special powers so the condition
 Jesus saves both circumcised and the force can't Israel and the nation's is the Covenant economy of curses of mutual hostility and slavery to foreign Gods to these Powers which is death to usher in the economy of blessing of mutual Mutual reconciliation and service to the to the to the god of Life timing to the god of Israel which is Covenant Life so when you now when you go back in and look at the syntax you okay does this does this make grammatical does that kind of canonical context again these words are actually the ones used in Ephesians 2 so that you know what he's talking about life that is written all those things you know it kind of has this Covenant all history behind it now what we need to do is check that against the grammar and say okay is it actually possible
 that was being mellified is not the Torah itself but the hostility which is proclaimed Artesian by the Torah that is determined by the tour these generic hostility it's coming mental hostility is Torah hostility against I hope the cats in the Nuance there's not what my argument is it's it's not that you're equating the Torah its self and for obedient itself with hostility and Division and all that but that was in the Torah and its Commandments the logic of the of that Covenant is that is real and the nations are always tethered Together For Better or For Worse it happens to be for Worse right now and Jesus is healing that Covenant will curse of death to bring life to the hostility that is being abolished is that which is prescribed within or stimulated by whatever source of ways we want to put by the mosaics
 Commandments in ordinances now when you look at the Greek you'll find out I mean again I can just get this is skip to the weed's part a lot of translations take destroyed was the Greek word loose. So I got to go right before me otherwise I'll I'll lose my train of thought I'm going off memory so it's a participial here but it comes to the word luimneach destroy the way they do a lot of translations take this verb is having to what the call direct object so that's already crazy night oh my gosh direct objects what's going on at the temple fight these are participles cuz grammatically they're dependent on the statement he is our peace and so now it's telling you how is that the case and uses a series of participles now these participles have direct object over but I hit the ball the balls of direct objects that the thing that receives the action of the verb so what's receiving the action of destroyed well everyone agrees
 the dividing wall of the fence is being destroyed that's governed by Lou sauce in Greek after Lou sauce comes another and in Greek the nouns of cells that strict endings that tell you what function that has relative to the verb queso the next word after Lou sauce is in the accusative case which marks it as being the direct object of a verb so now the question is that belong with loose us or does that belong with another with another part of several that follows again like Tim said there is debates all over the place on on how to figure this out what I'm saying is precisely because it's ambiguous this is where all those those negative argument that what it can't be come in because you can rule out on the basis of the context and coherence I've just a flow thought like okay well I know Mike syntactically grammatically could have these reference but if it leads us down one of those roads that we already said no to then we should prefer
 some other option so this is a realize that people are probably dying in their commute or something like that on their exercise bikes listening to this basically in favor of what I'm saying is Greek word orders you know it's not as as rigid as an English but you typically don't have a verb taking to direct objects separating those two direct objects which is what you would need to have happen for the ways nrsv translate sit over there where the NIV or whatever else you've nasb these translations what you're saying is that are common English translations are actually pulling a move and translating but by actually violating some common Greek grammar rules that say you can't see it English but in Greek you can see like actually doesn't reflect what's going on here and this is why it's important it's because if you take enmity
 Televisa Greek word extra if you take that as being the second direct object of looseness of destroyed that leaves another accusative case string of words that needs a verb and that string of word is the law of Commandments in ordinances and then the verb attached to that one is a bit more of a forceful verb than a cat and it means to abolish or nullify and so then you have the only direct object for that participle is the law so this is why I said that is because if you take enmity to belong to the verbal Lusa us to being part of the dividing whole venue your Force into a translation that says the law was abolished our we've already said no that can't make sense just in this letter itself that doesn't it doesn't make any sense because they use it's just a couple seconds later so now all right so just
 Facebook so now what we have is you say okay in the wall in the fence those are being lured those are those are being destroyed that the verb logos of that now you have the enmity somehow related to the law of Commandments in ordinances that's being notified her abolished so the direct object of that verb abolish catcher ghetto is extra strong and if you're using the accusative case the hostility vanity what I'm saying is the reason you get the law commands in ordinances tacked-on they're both in the same case and bring your Bose qc2 is because it specifying that this hostility is precisely that Covenant hostility that we should I just try to summarize which is then exactly what we see being remedy fright is real the hostility in the in the Torah as described is a hostility between Israel and Nations that is summarized as death by Moses so when you have have the claim he is our peace
 making us alive this whole parallel structure all that he's abolishing the hostility what hostiles leave the hostility the Torah hostility the one described in the Torah the Covenant hostility so it's use adjectives Ali I think to describe what sort of snow are we talking about here
 what I'm hearing is and and I couldn't follow all of the Greeks in text up and that's fine I'm sure like people sneaking what I'm hearing is that one translation is that the law and its decrees were abolished and that's kind of been the comment translation what you're saying is that what's being abolished is the enmity that was predicted by the law or basically occasion for shadowed yeah that the law was basically saying and in in Deuteronomy Moses coming up like discovering a promise cuz you to pass life and death and the path of death is this Unity amongst Israel and disunity among the Nations and the subjugation to Powers the gods and that thing having been what's the word you just used occasion to buy the law
 but if you disobey if you disobey the command to the Torah these other nations are going to come destroy the door itself as saying the role of the Torah is is going to make this become this is a promise of the Torah is what it's saying that being abolished is the thing that the Torah was and what I miss is death exhausted the power of that hostility can I think of a moment where Israel's Messiah put himself in between Israel and the nation and he died well there's this moment but he's condemned to death by the high priest and put to death by Roman centurions this where you gone and threw the cross is the moment where the Messiah stands in between and gets killed by the hostility between Israel and the Nations and even introduced ourselves of how to relate to Rome and all that so yeah yeah in the gospels What occasion
 is the death itself is introduced hostilities culminating in hostility with the Gentile powers that is exactly the kind of death Jesus dies as a as a crucified want to be in directions revolutionary in its focus on his body that hostility in a very particular way and he exhausted as as Tim said until this is why I think also like in a side but is why I'm not saying that those Covenant that life and death now I think part of Osteology is that Jesus has removed forever that conditionality of that Covenant that no longer is the condition ality of I set before you life and death contingent upon Israel is obedience to the commands this is part of the Proclamation of the Salvation of Jesus death in the end of how is making pizzas that he's exhausted that hostility interesting that is part of the Torah so in a way he is a polishing something of the tour was doing would that be fair to say
 you know like when jeremias proclaim a new coven or Ezekiel with the with the restoration is a symbolized as a resurrection and all that part of both of us visions of renewal is a is a renewed capacity Hyundai happening internally I was polishing but identify with the spirit of Jesus in you putting to death the Deeds of the Flesh in the body in your mortal body that part of the blessing of the New Covenant is a capacity for obedience because I'll be there isn't seen as the condition any more of God's blessing but as the result knows the result exactly and so obedience is just a matter of as you guys rightly up pump on a lot of being image bears in this world and the you know from Jenna Swan the song 8 now they're soul mates quoted and in Ephesians 1:3 and their this is part of Jesus exaltation with all things under his feet so it's part of us living in to that human the original a human vocation and this is what I mean about being you know why this is has Sottero
 importances because part of that salvation is enabling us to participate in that sort of humanity that sort of way of being with one another in this world above these powers and structures that try to gather and separate us in various ways that are hostile rather than ways like I said before the vacation Hospitality so one way to think about this the Paul also Flags later is the Oneness of to being the marriage of husband and wife and he says almost verbatim the same thing that the two become one and it's going from Dennis and all this we don't need to get into it to wrap holes there was a point for me and for this conversation is that this Oneness doesn't obliterate the Tunis of the husband and wife that there is Paul. Same become androgynous you know I'm like forget about all this stuff and that's exactly what I think he's saying earlier about the to becoming what I said the Tunis is an obliterated you actually need the Tunis for there to be any sort of visible indiscernible
 reconciliation and peace and unity that coldness is exactly what Paul Flags in chapter 3 as being what testifies to these rulers they've been this round so you're no longer organizing the world the way you saw me where you're no longer keeping us different so that we could be divided instead look at what the Messiah has done in uniting us all bringing us to God in one body while remaining two more remaining
let's get big picture again it kind of draw the threads together maybe with an illustration if Paul were to see a group of Christians Gathering and you can see that there are a bunch of different ethnic groups but that all of them have just jettisoned their different uniqueness has and cultural uniqueness has and are all just adopting one cultural mode of living together he would see that as a failure he would see that as a defeated church as opposed to a community that consists of all those and they are actually are discovering a new way of life together with their differences including baptized Messianic Jews and toward observance where their differences in Rich each other they learn from each other's differences and adopt and cross-pollinate speak in peace that's the vision de Paul's painting here I think so I think part of the reason it's so hard for us to get out of this is because of this is why important historical study and Theological reading of history there will eat
 stazon BellSouth Christian imagination than after whiteness and others do it but me how he accused the meant for my mentor said I kind of gravitate to him is what happened with our race and ethnicity are so complex because today we've constructed race as kind of reducing to phenotype and I'm using other things like how your jeans look like what color your skin looks like what are the shape of your eyes and your nose and and and stuff like that in your skin color if I hadn't already said that and so we think because of that we think what does it mean to be multi-ethnic it means like you know have a people with different colors around the room that's part of the problem is we think about race and ethnicity in terms of skin color only which is how the powers of this world organize us so part of testifying to these Powers they know it's not just about getting a people with a bunch of different skin tones and nose shapes in the ice shapes and whatever are Curly Straight whatever together and then went didn't that's good
 it's really fundamentally about custom and in practice and have it in hand language and food and all this real nitty-gritty stuff that's a tall order trying to say hey let's do this and that's why we get the letters we get but it sounds like a fun potluck organizing that sort of thing is exactly what I thought was struggling so hard to do cuz it's it is it is genuinely I think the works of the spirit when it happens it's just not the way we typically 10 together and then separate from one another so yeah that's that's one way of taking the sort of like diversity point in a wrong direction
so I'm guessing but your work on a fusion this is not going to be the end of this theme in your own like research and learning for you what would you Hope Scholarship that's trying to pursue this line of thought it just has a concluding thought from you what it what do you hope the influence in the end game is for recovering this real sense of the multi-family of God in New Testament theology ReDiscover that got a sore stuff with the resources necessary to actually embody a revolutionary vision of community of gathering and this is happening in a lot of places in biblical studies right now the presidential address of the society biblical literature it's like that the big you know conference killed for Scholars Junior Stars aspiring biblical studies Scholars alike Adele rhinehart's in her presidential address with Lee
 these issues of anti-judaism supersessionism and racist and concerns which for a while then separate and now people are starting to see exactly how they're reinforcing one another for better for worse and so I think you know there's a a book just recently came out by Abdul Kalam graduated before I got here but his name is Massachusetts called Jesus in the forces of Death Note start time at forces of death for sure isn't that isn't the title and so is dealing with these issues from the gospels perspective about like Jewish Purity concerns or a lot of people say well geez abolish you know all this stuff and he has a brilliant well-researched book on that kind of addressing those concerns my flight have to work at David Rudolf and Mark ensor and Paul Fredericks and and tantalizing bomb who are all the showing in various ways that when we are beginning to to be more patient I guess with everything
 you discovered that the Paul that we've all inherited in the west is is just as her Western sort of conception and we're constantly in the Wii isn't Humanity as a whole scholarship in specific specifically are constantly having to reread and ReDiscover and check our own locations and how we are perceiving things in those could be again for better for worse reading from a particular location helps you be sensitive to certain things that are there in the text other people just don't notice or can have you read things into the text that aren't there and so we need to be reading one another through hearing and listening to one another in order to push the conversation forward but I think it's when I initially wrote this it was actually in 2014 as a master's student at 4 and then I decided to use it as of my writing sample to get into a lot is actually probably not a lot of changed a lot I became aware of a lot more in the intervening time where is that the of people
 in this same thing trying to undo the super session s readings that don't actually have good historical exegetical basis and so there is a lot more work to be done as part of my dissertation on Romans right now there's a few things in there that I'm that I'm dealing with yeah so I guess my hope is that people will start to see that that this isn't as new as it may sound at first hearing it here or whatever that it's actually conversations going on across several different types of Scholars and that I think for the church so again I'm a confessing Christian I want to serve the church my scholarship for the church I think reading these people being familiar with their work is going to help us all ReDiscover the value that the Detachment has for addressing particularly pressing concerns facing the church today in terms of race and ethnicity issues yeah thanks man thank you Andrew I know I'm a better reader
 after reading your work and it really really inspired me with his already inspiring vision of the multi-ethnic family of the Abraham tell the powers what's up yeah tell him the powers what's up so thanks for walking us through that I know those details but in this case metaphorically speaking the devil's in the details and we want to flush flush him out of the bushes to recover the unity of God's family so thanks Andrew for help and thanks for taking the time to talk about of course thanks for having me on preciate it thank you for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast we are now at the end of this series on the family of God thanks for coming along with us I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did if you want to see the theme video that were making on this being the family of God well you're going to have to stay tuned we're not done but this video will come out sometime in 2021.

 Abbas India I first heard about Bible project when I was studying abroad in London and one of the members of the church I went to over there recommended Bible project to me when I first started listening to it I was very surprised to find out that it was two guys from the US and it kind of felt like a piece of home I've looked good are going Bible project Bible project for driving I've always listened to podcast on driving and Bible project is kind of a, form of worship while driving for me I used by Buddy brother to listen to podcast about Bible project is the animated videos and podcast project is just that it feels like you're among friends while you're listening to it and I feel like that's how the body of Christ should be we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus where crowdfunded projects by people like me riding free videos of glasses and more
