we are in the scroll of numbers and we've been looking at a sequence of rebellion stories that all increase in intensity the first all the people of Israel worried about how they don't want to go into the promised land then the inner circle of Israel the Levites Rebelle they think God is playing favoritism and now we get a third Rebellion focusing on two characters who are at the center of it all and is working to see Moses and Aaron have their failure moment to in the section that we're going to look at it's a strange little story is real is thirsty and so God tells Moses to take his staff and go to a rock and speak to the Rock so that water can come out Moses goes and instead of speaking to the Rock he strikes the rock with his staff water comes out and you think great it worked but then God says God says to Moses hear you didn't trust me and you didn't treat me as the Holy One in the eyes of the people and avocado
 Quentin Moses can't go into the promised land like the Wilderness generation and as you read the story you might think what's the big deal so we hit the rock instead of speaking to the Rock why is it so important that Moses does exactly what God says this is Moses's test will you do what God says the way that God said that even if at this moment it seems rather counterintuitive because what God is after is a human partner whose heart and desire and will is the same as the Divine well God designed all of humanity so the our wills and the Divine will can be one in the story of the Bible is not feeling at that over and over Moses is the first one who can stand In God's Presence who can speak on God's behalf perhaps Moses is our ultimate mediator the whole story leading you to this crisis stuff like this where the human partner who will do God's will that lead to Abundant Life for themselves and for the many we don't have that mediator even Moses can't rescue us
 ourselves and then the Book of Numbers ends with a fascinating tale of a pagan sorcerer hired by one of Israel's enemies to curse is real yet God won't let him do it instead this Pagan sorcerer gives Israel seven blessings like this one about the future king promised to Israel to be the ultimate mediator I see him that is the king but not now I behold him but he's not near a star will come out of Jacob in a scepter Will Rise Up from Israel we're talking about Earthly King ruler but we're comparing it to a Heavenly ruler the star so the future delivering King from Israel who will bring God's kingdom of the nation's he's both Al and ruler and the sky ruler I'm John Collins this is Bible project podcast quick apology you're going to notice as we began talking that when we reported I was dealing with a bit of a sickness thanks for joining us
 here we go
 hey Tim hey there John we are in the Book of Numbers we're about halfway through this too funny that's a sentence that sounds in no way exciting that we are in the Book of Numbers the name of the Hebrew tradition is in the wilderness by made by God and that. That sounds more exciting where in the book of in the wilderness yeah or in the scroll I guess we're trying to adapter terminology here where the squirrel live in the wilderness where we're reading numbers Movement by movement there's three movements were in the second one but give us an overview of yeah okay so we're in the heart of the Torah the heart of the Torah is the three Scrolls at the center Exodus Leviticus Numbers Exodus out of Egypt to Mount Sinai and then Mount Sinai takes up the center of the Torah at the end of Exodus all of Leviticus and then as you walk into the numbers scroll the first movement is about Israelites preparing to leave Mount Sinai and then
 as a mobile Eden camp like a mobile garden with you always Tabernacle at the sensor so the first movement which has chapters 1 through 12 is about they're arranging the camp as a series of concentric circles around the little Eden spot in the middle which is Tabernacle in the holy of holies and so that was about the arrangement of the camp and then how the camp is to remain a place of Purity and life and Holiness that they travel and then that movement ended with chapters 10 11 12 with them actually leaving Mount Sinai One calendar year later after they camped out there that's first movement
 and that was meant and with signs of how this road trip is going to go cuz they're supposed to go on a road trip from Sinai to the land that Abraham and Isaac and Jacob lived in the land that was promised to those ancestors to be a place where Israel would be fruitful and multiply and become a conduit of God's blessing to the nation's and so in the second movement they are on their way and if things don't go well from Lou the first narratives after they leave our about the people grumbling and complaining not trusting God and we then been covering in the second movement so which goes from chapter 13 to 25 there is a sequence all told in the wilderness Journeys are the sequence of seven Rebellion narratives where the people Grumble or not trust God and it Cycles through the snow
 a concentric circles around the camp the Outer Circle was all those tribes then inside of that was a circle which was the Levites and then the centre-circle is the Tabernacle itself we're just the priests in the high priest can go in and so in this middle section of numbers the second movement the Rebellion there it is go from people from the Outer Circle to keep by cunning in so the story of the rebellion of the spies is about one of the spices for me to try that was the first circle around the camp so that layer you know rebelles and they got tells them Grapevine then you won't enter the land if you don't want to
 and they don't want to go into the land because there are giants there that they think will squash them the Nephilim the Nephilim descendants of the Nephilim then in the middle movement of number is the second rebellion was a rebellion of the Levites against Moses and Aaron the high priest and so that didn't end well and that leads to a d creation of a whole bunch of Levites and so that leaves now the Centre Circle The Tabernacle at self and the people who operate within that are Moses and Aaron high priest and the two sons of Aaron and is working to see Moses and Aaron have their failure moment to in the section that we're going to look at
 like a like a punchline you know jokes usually have a 123 and so he knows there's three stories of people rebelling or failing to live up to Cuts calling and so what you expect one two three on the third one what happens The Twist it's like at the bottom when she reached the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of his Rebellion what God begins to give them his water in the wilderness victory over their enemies and he turns curse into blasting and that's the shape of the section we're going to be looking at in this conversation yeah so
 we're saying is there's three narratives about rebellion and the intensify they go from the outer Camp to in the inner camp and they are intensifying the first one is the tribes they're not going into the new land they want to repeal go back to Egypt and God says you're going to wander the Wilderness your whole life that's the consequence super intense and got summary of the problem is he says you don't trust me his word believe or have faith in you don't have faith in me and so you won't get to enter the land that's right then the next story is this rebellion of the Levites priests are from the family of of Levi and there's this sense of why do only some of us get to be priests were Levites in there's this rebellion and the intensity of the consequence of this one is is even more crazy they get
 swallowed up by the Earth so now you get to this that's 12 you get to the 3rd and we're going to read another rebellion and it's going to be a rebellion from the inner circle that's right and you shouldn't be anticipating like what kind of consequence is going to be worse than being swallowed up by the Earth in what are you've already said which is a spoiler is instead of a consequence there's actually a blessing yeah in the overall shape of this last section there's a severe consequence for Moses and Aaron but right at the moment to think like well okay I guess they're all they're all dead everyone's going to be done and then some surprise blessings happen one of the thing to note in this section numbers 13 to 25 is there is a symmetrical in shape to this whole section or a chiasm shape the rebellion of the spies takes place
 the spies are sent out from a region or place called kaddish which is spelled with the Hebrew letters for Holiness so they're sent out from the holy place the spies go into the land and they don't trust God and so they are excluded from the land and then after that the Spy is an Israelite say oh no we're sorry God will go into the land after all and then got this now. You already made your choice and the people go into land anyway and they're defeated by Canaanites and amalekites at a place called who am I so what's going to happen then is here then we have the next Rebellion which is of the Levites against the priests and once we turn to chapter 20 we're all of a sudden at that place called again yeah and what's going to happen is Moses is going to have a lack of face and he and Aaron are going to get the same consequence that the spies in that generation. If not entering the land so there's a parallelism
 between the rebellion of the spies what happens and where it happens is replayed in chapter 20 of numbers with the rebellion of Moses has like a a b a structure where is Rubino's by the kaddish cuz you don't believe the candle and B is a rebellion of Levites and once we come to Moses we're back at 8 again rebellion. Khaddash of Moses and Aaron they don't trust and they too will not get to enter the land this whole section has been designed as a little meditation Triad for you to think about how each of these three rebellions relate to each other and Son yeah so
 anyone listening doesn't have the benefit of of seeing this structure but if you've been listening along even realize structure is is really important guess who the way the Hebrew Bible works and there's all sorts of structure and you're saying within this movement the structure of these three kind of sections in this movement have an ADA mean by awesome or sandwiches you like to call the first Rebellion sandwich tastes terrible why is that important other than that it's so nice to notice so interesting like this was intentionally designed so that this narrative is in a way parallel to this other narrative are they just having fun like what's the meaning of significance of Art For Art's Sake
 no it is definitely a creative expression the point of literary design of Hebrew Bible literature from how biblical authors construct sentences and wines to how they construct collections of paragraphs in two units and then into movements in the whole Scrolls is there constantly designing things in symmetrical patterns not just so that you notice it but so you begin to compare things with other things so the fact that the rebellion of the spies happens that kaddish it's the people don't trust and so they don't enter the land is set in design parallelism to Moses has an Aaron's Rebellion at Kadesh same place they don't have trust and they don't enter the land and so the design is inviting you to hold those two narratives which are
 7 chapters a part in our modern chapters in but to bring them as if they're next to each other in your mind and then read them both as if they're back-to-back and meditate on the similarities and the differences and so often times biblical authors well put little puzzles or Little Riddles where they will introduce intentional ambiguities in 21 narrative and those ambiguities will be answered or clarified by things that they've designed in the matching story and so the story about Moses has an Aaron's lack of trust is a good example because it's illuminated by comparing it to its parallel which is the rebellion of the spies let's just do it is actually an invitation to the reader to gain more insight into the narratives through the literate design parallelism
 but it was just jumped into the story of Moses narins failure and I think you'll see some of the payoff
Numbers Chapter 20 The Sons of Israel the whole congregation came to the Wilderness of Zin in the first month and the people stayed at Kadesh another year since they've left are all this is the halfway through the year new year guess is wonderful wonderful cat first of all you told they are in the wilderness of Zin okay. What's interesting is that's exactly where the spies went up out into the promised land to spit out that can chapter 13 they went out from the Wilderness of Zin so good-looking to that story yep so the introduction to chapter 20 is taking place at the same locations named in the rebellion of the Spy narrative and the people stayed there at Kadesh which is exactly where the
 rebellion of the spy stores begin so the technique of the people are at the same place and what did I learn that story I learned that that generation because of what happened there the consequence was for them to wander in the wilderness for 40 years and there's been no time markers since chapter 13 you're just wandering in the wilderness and remember this could be a less than two weeks trip to get from point A to point B if you mapped it on on Google Maps yeah yeah I'm Moses at the beginning of Deuteronomy like it should take 11 days how to get from where we were to where we wanted to be and they took forty years so the fact that we're seven chapters later
 we're at the same spot I think it's a literary way to say it's like we're trapped in the wilderness or text or lost his Twilight Zone yeah And So It Begins by saying in the first month but it doesn't specify the year and you're going to have to read on and what you're going to learn is that we're now in the 38-year later oh you on this later if you learn this in the next chapter and so they're going to start seeding you time information that's not fully enough for you to know but you're going to be walked through a series of stories that are going to be all linking back to chapter 13 and 14 and then you realize though this is 38 years later and the people are still acting the same way way okay so what chapter 20 takes place 38 years later from the Spy Rebellion correct now your not told that in the first line what you told us in the first month they came to the
 asean that caught us do you like wait that's where the Rebellion happened and they were told to go back into the Wilderness so the first month of what year like you're not told what you are told in the next line is Miriam died to their the sister of Moses and Aaron got there and then a chapter at the end of chapter 20 Aaron is going to die so all the sudden Moses his brother and a sister are like the last ones of his generation to die off and so you just have a few people left from the generation that's been wandering in the wilderness and then you learn in chapter 21 and is he gone through the book that we're near the end of The Wiltern this one drinks here okay yeah we jump to that he totally yeah
 so there's two of chapter 20 and there was no water for the congregation and so they assemble themselves against Moses and Aaron and I can wait I've been here before to no water this was the problem all the way back on the other side of Mount Sinai all the way back in Exodus chapter 17 so right here the circle in the opening lines of the story it's like I use this image of I think a harpoon a few episodes ago but I imagine we're like we're trying to lock together a ghost going to get really Atlantis is excited for locking her food but not for what I'm thinking is like some Arctic explorers that we're like out on their boats and they were serving some ice but the ice cracked apart and you got like three teams on three different icebergs floating apart and so what do we have
 but we have heart Tunes this is ridiculous so we're going to do is launch of Harpoon with a rope attached Over The Water Gap and it locks into the other team's Iceberg we start pulling it
 so the opening line of the story of the Wilderness of Zin the kaddish it fires a harpoon back to chapter 13 anchor and so now I'm reading the story bringing it close to Numbers Chapter 20 and I'm not going to read numbers 13 and a 20 is if they're next to each other but then this line there was no water for the congregation and the people contended with Moses saying if only we had died when our brothers died before the Lord why have you brought us out into the Wilderness and our animals to die here why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this wretched place there's no grain or figs or Vines are pomegranates here and there's no water this is almost identical to how the story of Israel confronting Moses about no water in the wilderness back in Exodus 17 so he's now fired another harpoon
 do an iceberg floating like really to Scrolls back and it locks there and you bring it close and now you're reading these three stories next to each other in your mind what movie or story did you read on Arctic harpoons in mind I'm making it up I did I've been watching Jesse and I've been watching with the boys like an Arctic Survival show yeah pretty awesome about 10 people who go out into the like the Canadian foreign tourist the goal is last 100 days and you know you get to take 10 items with you and that's it you know by the time of day like 80s it's like you know -20 everyday Fahrenheit and so there was one guy the guy who won went out ice fishing but he'd never fired her pins to bring icebergs together. That's just my imagination but I helped me
 can I paint the picture of like one story is firing something back to an earlier story linking them together so that you know how to read the stories and compare and contrast so Moses and Aaron response is to come in from the presence of the assembly they go to the door of the tent of meeting great idea list all in their faces the door would be would this be right for the holy place would be walking in front of the altar that is outside the 10 and they would be walking and yeah kneeling down in front of the first doorway into the holy place of the tent and the glory of y'all way up here to them in some form we're not told either fire cloud and you always spoke to Moses say take that Rod you and your brother and
 sorry quick yeah just singular verb you singular take the rod and you and your brother Aaron assemble all the congregation and speak to the Rock before their eyes so that it may give its water this is how you will bring forth water for them out of the Rock and then let the congregation in there be strict instruction speak to the Rock which is kind of fascinating will seem to imagine like what they supposed to say take your Rod yeah and speak to the rock sample is my Harpoon metaphor the parallel story in Exodus 17 began with the congregation of the sons of Israel camping at the Wilderness 16 the people quarreled with Moses
 they're thirsty for water why did you bring us up out of Egypt to kill us what God said to Moses in Exodus 17 was taken your hand staff was what you struck the Nile go I will stand before you on the Rock at Horeb and you will strike the Rock and water will come out in the people can drink via their Moses takes the staff and he strikes The Rock and that's how the imagery works here in numbers 20 you can see the parallelism where God says take that Rod but then there's a Twist which is talk to the Rock which both sounds odd
 and it's kind of a surprise cuz your little ass. Why what do you need a ride for you. What are you at 4 and last time you actually use the ride so yeah you want to take the ride totally but you can speak to the Rock so this is this is Moses's test will you do what God says the way that God says it even if at this moment it seems rather counterintuitive I think that's what's going on here so Moses took the ride is a 9 from before the Lord just as the Lord commanded him so notice how is drawing attention to Moses did what God commanded and taking the rod okay good so far so good then Moses and Aaron gather the assembly in front of the Rock sweet that's exactly what God Said to do
 then Moses said to them listen you rebels are we supposed to bring out water for you from this rock then Moses lifted up his hand and he struck the rock two times with his rod and water came out abundantly and the congregation and their beasts drink guess for the further you tell me what your nose thing I know observations to simple this is like but this time he wasn't supposed to strike the rock used to speak to the Rock but it still works yes okay and then but he does Speak doesn't he but he doesn't speak to the Rock he speaks to his people and eat them
 but you know they kind of had it coming if you're comparing this to the other story exactly exactly yeah yeah listen now you rebels and then shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock so who's that we'd earned himself an errand down one level. Seems to be the most natural reading cuz he doesn't mention Yahweh has mentioned God you know are we with the help and power of God going to bring forth water so that's the line is really interesting and it might seem minut too but this is not what God told him to do he's not doing what God told him to he doesn't speak to the rock you speak to the people and he hits the rock so and multiple counts he's not doing it and this is just after the narrator highlighted the two things that he did do that is exactly what God told him to so God said take the ride
 are the people speak to the Rock samosas takes the ride gathers the people here to build it up and then he speaks not to the Rock the people that has the 123 punch the highlights he doesn't do what God says and now you can kind of forgive him for getting confused I mean last time this happened he was told to strike the Rock and God said bring the rod I can imagine like I'm like sitting there and Moses and I'm like I got the rod if last time I struck the rock yeah yeah that's right what's the big deal yep toy and so what the clues are the author gives is that by comparing it to the earlier exit 217 story
 what we're highlighting is that the command that God gave in this instance was different when I told why but God didn't tell Moses to do what he did next to the 17 he gave him a new 7 structure and spread this moment and Moses he doesn't do what God says that's so clearly the way the narrative is designed to leave you out to that third moment of life he obeyed God's word wanted to so I think we're back to the steam in the melody all the way back to Genesis one where God's word is life God's word is the way to life yeah that's what God speaking 10 times in creation is all about this is the God's word is what sustains and generates life out of non-life and then in the evening story following the word of God is what allows God's Partners to continue enjoying the gift of abundant life so the true life is still a gift from
 crossword Dunedin story that sets up this Motif and so the idea of people doing what God says exactly and that leads to life that's a major theme in the flood story when God gives you know all the commands about how to build the the eating box and it's been a major theme here in numbers were God said don't be afraid to go into the land I'm going to deliver the Giants and your hand
 and the people don't trust in God's accusation against the people back in rebellion of the spies is exactly the same thing of what God says to Moses hear you didn't trust me and you didn't treat me as the Holy One in the eyes of the people Moses is now being given the same consequence that the people got cuz of the rebellion of the spies and for the same reason you failed to trust me you didn't treat me as wholly so I'm with you in terms of for many years I had the same reaction as why what's the big deal
 but the design of the story the two parallel stories that are hyperlinked are meant to slowly help us focus on the moment that Moses did the opposite of what God told him to do and you memorize how we kind of have this feeling back in Leviticus when the sons of Aaron take the incense you know and walks into the tent like it's hilarious the waltz into and the narrator said they did what he always had not commanded them to do and these are the people selected out of the tribe of Levi who are selected out of Israelites to be the image of God Representatives on behalf of all the people so the stakes are higher the closer you operate to the 10th
 the stakes are higher
 and so there's a severe consequence for Moses and Aaron because of the position that God has elevated them too so I think those are all factors that are really there in the text that are highlighting why Moses kisses to dire consequence Moses is like the best person we've had in the story so far he's not perfect but he's he's the only character whose ascended to heaven in the biblical story of accept me knock back in Genesis when God are like the tight his right arm is God's right on yeah so the fact that now Moses is excluded from entry into the Eden land so huge blow man this is like major Downer moment story yes okay I get it like he didn't do exactly what God Said
 but it's such a small detail and it's not like God was like Hey Moses don't don't murder and he's like hoopsick killed someone yeah yeah yeah you know something of like much consequence that's going to like yeah have Ripple effects throughout the community or something it was just a small detail of like how God wanted to perform this this miracle Moses being disqualified go to the promised land it's a big deal and it's such a small detail we supposed to learn a thing could meditate on that I think so yeah yeah and I don't think they take away the we should have primarily is oh man like I'm walking on eggshells with God at all times everyday I don't think that's the takeaway
 kind of feels that way love that I tell and I can understand why and why would I say I don't think that's the takeaway Moses is not an average person
 this whole story is about God selecting a special partner out of the money and then giving more for someone more generous abundance to them and also more instruction more clarity about God's purpose and will and desire and so to those to whom this is what is the Spider-Man and Elsa bows what is it with great power comes great responsibility in our conversation but that is naming a dynamic at work in the story and so what the narrative is doing is it saying God selects humans gives them an instruction they don't do and they bring death on themselves instead of life and blessing which was what was on offer and then the next Generation steps up to the plate and it write the biblical story just keeps repeating so God selects a hoe
 family and then God selects One Tribe out of that family and God selects one clan out of that tribe and its Moses and Aaron and they have received more instruction and log more time with Dale face-to-face specially Moses than anybody and I think that's what we're meant to feel and you know Moses didn't just mistake I mean what is when he gives a speech when God told him to speak and he does speak but he doesn't speak to the Rockies speaks to the people and you know he's mad at them you rebels and he said sure we bring forth water for you out of the rock that's interesting you know and this is actually not the first time Moses says showed displeasure and anger about the role God gave them to be the leader of the people that we didn't talk about the story in the podcast conversations with back in numbers 11
 he actually asked God to kill him I would rather die than have to lead these people anymore Skittle cantankerous he totally so at that's at the beginning of the Wilderness wandering stand here at the end the Moses is also depicted as like a character on the edge along with the people from the beginning to the end of the the Wilderness narratives and then I think we're back to the first point haven't gone through that with the first angle which is to Those whom God invest High degrees of power influence ability to represent him God asks for a high degree of adherence to the Divine will and instruction and because what God is after is a human partner whose heart and desire and will is the same as the Divine well write a human partner for him. The will and they're well-armed are the same thing and sometimes taking forward to depictions of
 ideal servant it like in the book of Isaiah and there's a big emphasis on how the coming King from the line of David not suffering servant will love to do God's Will and God's will is their pleasure and so this is a big medicine throughout the melody cycling to the heat Revival and so the fact that Moses has been so in sync with God's will through Exodus 10 Leviticus and then here and numbers it starts to crack and Moses begins to gripe about God's Will and then here he just straight-up doesn't do what God told him to do so you're saying if you take all that into account like his grumbling before you read this and you think he'd make a mistake he knew what he was supposed to do and he decided not to do it it was an act of rebellion I'm going to do this my own way
 yeah but God says you didn't have faith in me and you didn't treat me as the Holy One in front of the people of Israel was the two things that God says yeah he doesn't say like hey you forgot step you did this on purpose that's right so the last thing about why I don't think the takeaway from the story is we're walking on eggshells the story of Israel selected out from among the nations in the story of the Torah and the prophets is all about how even when God selects a special one out gives them more instruction more Revelations more proximity to the divine presence than anybody else and even they keep repeating the failed choices of Adam and Eve in every generation leading to death the whole story leading you to this crisis of liked it where the human partner little do God's will that lead to Abundant Life for themselves and for the many
 and so that is the vocation that falls upon the expected coming Royal servant Royal priest that is portrayed in the profits and that is exactly how Jesus presents himself and is presented in the gospels as Israel's representative and Humanity's representative and this is really highlight in the Gospel of John where Jesus talks about how he's come to do the will of the father and the father has given everything into my hand and I do my father's work what my father wants to do that's what I do that's big team and John and he's tapping into this right here it here it's to the Divine will leads to true life even when it looks like that yeah so that's where this team is going and so I think where we should walk away from this story is to say man what we need is a human partner for God who will do the Divine will that leads to life for the money because if we don't have that mediator even Moses
 just give us much less ourselves
 that's why I think it needs to read this in light of the kind of the Messianic trajectory of the Hebrew Bible
 as opposed to think no I don't man I'm I'm screwed which is this is a study in human nature and so you are that is a take away but that's not the end of the story because God provides water even though Moses fails and God keeps the promise of a future coming mediator even though most of us fails and I think that's where the story is meant to point
 after the failure of Moses they start journeying to the east side of the Jordan River and Aaron dies bummer instead and then right at the point where you think okay Moses going to die I think they're all going to die and starting in Numbers chapter 21 you get all of these River Soul twist after the third most climactic rebellion of Moses and Aaron so chapter 21 at that place called korma which is where the Israelites were defeated after the rebellion of the spies a Canaanite king attacks them and God gives him Victory so the place of defeat has turned into a place to Victory next you get another grumbling story about the people grumbling because of no water and so that's the story of the snakes and the brawn staff how did that story so amazing we don't have time but then after the people Grumble for no water and that grumbling leads to death Moses enters
 it's for them and then the next stories about how God gives them a surprise well water of water in the wilderness so you get these pivots of grumbling leads to death but then Moses mediates and then that leads to water in life and then chapter 21 end with two giant Kings like to King's Olga and seek on who were Amorite Kings on the east side of the Jordan they hear that Israel has marched into their territory and they come out to attack and their Giants and God gives them victory over the Giants and this is ironic reversal cuz the spies were afraid of the Giants
 but now I got to get some victory so these become a little reversals of the curse and death even out here in the wilderness and that leads up to the ultimate reversal climax the movement to which is what we call numbers 22:25 which is a story which has this figure named Balaam at the center of it is a pagan sorcery give you a whole conversation on Phelan Phelan was a well-known sorcerer For Hire he's actually mentioned in Canaanite literature outside the Hebrew Bible yeah oh yeah listeners the podcast Google the year Allah inscription d e i r a l l a h a r a law that's the name of the excavation site where I was found over on the Eastern side of the Jordan and it's this inscription talking about Balaam is this really the influential sorcerer For Hire that was you know
 melted by Kings and would pronounce the fate of the nation since on it's really cool so what's interesting is what we're taking the biblical authors taking an actual figure of historical memory from this region and time and then this narrative it's just like it's Saturday Night Live the story is total satire literally comparing Balaam to and a talking ass fucking donkey cuz there's a talking donkey in the story but the literary design of the story is comparing Balaam as The Talking Pig and sore throat to the talking donkey and God speaks truth through an ass and God speaks truth and Blistex to the Pagan sorcery that the whole thing is really awesome in our numbers videos we try and portray this is like the surprise blessing where the king of Moab hires the sky to pronounce curse and Death on his enemies
 Israelites and why does the king of Moab do this oh yeah cuz he want he sees the camp wandering into the edge of his territory so huge migrant Camp just came on to the borders of his land and he says like I want nothing to do with these people they're going to overwhelm us so he hires the sky to start pronouncing curses of death and destruction upon these migrant camps and what God does he takes the three attempts of the king of Moab to curse through the sorcerer and God turns the curse into a blessing in the mouth of the talking sorcerer is compared to a talking donkey so the king of Moab makes three attempts and bail on the sorcerer speaks Three Palms of blessing
 and then after the third attempt the king of Moab get so mad that balaam's just like all three wasn't enough for you will hear is fourth the fifth to sixth and seventh Oracle so the other seven poems total and all of them are about how God is going to raise up from Israel a future king who God is going to raise up and deliver out of Egypt just like he delivered the Israelites out of Egypt and that that King from the Israelites is going to bring God's Rule and Kingdom over the nation's and it's one of the most explicit like Messianic prophecies in the Torah right here numbers chapters 23 and 24 explicit about it in terms of promising that a future coming King will arise out of Jacob some of the lines cuz it these became really important in second temple Judaism and in the New Testament so this is
 in the third Oracle that Mela matters he starts describing the Israelites and catch this imagery hair this is number 24 of his five Balaam says how told how good are your tent so Jacob how good are your dwellings o Israel like valleys that stretch out like Gardens beside a river like aloe trees planted by Yahweh like cedar trees beside the waters yeah. So he's looking down at these migrant camps from a cliff and they got to be looking pretty rough at the yes in the middle of the Wilderness and what this guy says is eating these are eating people out here in the middle of the Wilderness is great water will flow from his buckets so it's depicting the Israelites as carrying like buckets of water witching out in the Wilderness water is very precious
 the gods made them like a garden here and Israel is going to have overflowing buckets like a bucket is overflowing with water and then the next line in the poem is and his seed will be in the many Waters so the future seed of Israel coming out of the seat in life is like drops of water spilling up over an abundant bucket down on the ground so cool and then that water and see eating up eating life is compared to a k that will be exalted higher than agog is at the middle of a dog is a king and a sub-clan connected to a group of Israel's enemies called the amalekites oh yeah
 so God is going to exalt a king and a kingdom from the Abundant seed of Israel who is going to have a kingdom that's exhausted even over Israel's hostile relatives and we're told that God brings him that is God brings that Future King up out of Egypt the first Pacific is comparing the past exit the exit of scroll as telling a story that is actually pointing forward to a future Exodus yeah when God will deliver a future king out of slavery and bondage to the Nations and exalt them to the place of rule over those Nations and then God will enable that came to Devour the Nations that are his enemies and Custom
 Nike outfit crushing just like God raised up Moses and crushed pharaoh who became snakey so there will be a future Mosasaur a future king then a 9 bailout quotes from the promise that Jacob said to Judah back in Genesis 49 he crouches down like a lion like a lion who dares to arouse him that's what Jacob said about Judah and talking about the future king from The Lion of Judah and then Balaam says blessed is everyone who blesses you cursed is everyone curses you and that's what God Said to Abraham when he came out of Babylon so we're bringing together all the main themes of the tour out here in these times and then just real quick in the next one Balaam starts talking about that Future King again in twenty-four Seventeen and says I see him that is the king but not now I behold him but he's not near a star will come out of Jacob
 any scepter Will Rise Up from Israel we're talking about Earthly King ruler but we're comparing him to a Heavenly ruler the star yeah so the future delivering King from this rail who will bring God's kingdom of the nation's is compared he's both Al and ruler and the sky ruler ha Des Moines are amazing so who saw this coming is just like I thought everything was about to everybody's going to die and God's going to drop these people like a bad habit you're saying as you as you read through this section of numbers yeah it's like everything is going wrong backwards repelling all these consequences and then we get to most rebellion and everyone's dying yeah but then a series of blessings essentially like they're winning battles they get water in a well and then as they are coming in to Moab which is going to be
 I remember correctly this is kind of the staging ground for then going into the land correct yeah they're going to be right at the river across from Jericho to cross and go in the wall during is almost over but the king of Moab throws a gauntlet if you want to mess with someone in the ancient world you hire a like a pagan sorcery guy these guys and let's see if we can destroy them yet this Pagan sorcerer comes and he can't curse them it said He blesses them blessing is pulling together the whole story and all this hope and blessing that God wants to now very explicitly leading to a King is it the first time like that we're hearing about this kind of Messianic King in the Torah no no that little quotation from Jacob's blessing on Judah it's a straight-up copy and paste quote
 it is not the first time the blessing to Judah it's the first time that a royal figure is described a blessing to Judah yeah I mean you knew from Genesis 3 15 but we need a human right of the woman to overcome the snake but in Genesis 49 all the genealogies have led you to expect it'll be a royal figure from the future Lion of Judah and now that promise is picked up and developed explicitly it's super cool yeah so it's very similar to when God exiled Adam and Eve from Eden that provides them with the promise of a future snake Crusher so here you know the last people are dying off in the wilderness in Exile not being able to go into the Eden land and yet even here at the end of the Exile if that rebellious generation got unbeknownst to them like this is all happening on a cliff way far away right and unbeknownst to the people
 like they think you know they're like just barely surviving down there but from the Heavenly perspective up above they are actually still a little Eden the wisest with the promise of the Messianic Kingdom attached to them that's kind of this ironic contrast here at the conclusion of the second movement it said this is a Grace moment God is giving them eating the gift and promise even while they're down there crumbling wondering if God is with them in the wilderness powerful scene contrast and so this is how the second movement of numbers ends with balaam's poems and then that launches into the third movement of numbers if the third movement is going to begin with everybody of that last Generation Dead except for Moses and then the two spies who didn't reveal Joshua and Caleb and their
 the only ones alive and now we're going to turn our attention to the drive into the promised land and so that's going to be the main theme we're going to trace in the reading Journey for the app through the third movement of numbers that goes from chapters 26 to 36 and it's all about the entry of Israel getting them ready to go into the Eden Promised Land thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week There's a gap in the laws of the Torah there's a scenario that the laws don't address and the laws as currently stated will lead to what they're trying to say is Injustice of Hope Ranch will be lost from the family tree just because women can't inherit land and what God says they are right there shouldn't be a family that loses possession of the land just because there isn't a patriarch Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts edited by Dan Campbell and Tyler Bailey Lindsay pond
