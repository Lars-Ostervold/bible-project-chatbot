all right we are going to do a question response episode make 2/3 of the way through the letters conversation and we'll do a second question response at the very end yes. Midway that we've been getting some great questions selected a few many good questions to ask questions about how to read the New Testament letters how to read the New Testament letters that start with a question from Damien and Minnesota hates him and John my name is Damien Love and I live in St Paul Minnesota classically-trained theater after a former and listening to these episodes has made me wonder if it could be a fruitful practice for churches to have people like me who trained in speaking complex text in an active in body wave read the letters in their entirety in live Gathering what do you think about this idea is it stupid are there any pitfalls or
 I'd love your advice thanks for all you do all right I'll respond first Damien your idea is the opposite of stupid it's actually brilliant and so important and yes you should do it no questions asked as my first response was yours John for sure you we talked about how these letters were originally heard ready yeah that's right and that there is something about hearing it all in one sitting and that helps you kind of feel the shape of it in a different way I noticed when I read I get really stuck like we did that since mean and then I just like I don't keep moving but if you're in a situation where just being read aloud you know you listening to an audio version of the Bible That's So if you have a vision for using your experience in theater and that's awesome yes John and I both knew a guy named Jason Nightingale
 Ministry nonprofit you called wordsolver Ministries but essentially he memorized all the books of the New Testament did you do all of them well I don't know that for certain but the sampling that I know that I've heard him recite before it makes me think he's for sure got the whole thing from the gospel of Mark to the Book of Revelation to Romans Hebrews efficient so we we back when we were in our twenties heard him back in the 90s 90s Nightingale and the world reciting books of the New Testament and then sometimes he would give a short little homily afterwards but his main thing was just to recite whole books of New Testament in one go for groups of people with such a booming wonderful this trip you had a uniquely amazing voice so yes Damien it's a wonderful idea it should be normal I think this kind of
 Patricia be normal in the life of a local church having somebody who's like the memorizer in reciter of books of the New Testament so godspeed Damien go for it and memorize and recite every question from Lauren in Indiana Indiana I'm listening to your conversation on the New Testament letters with my usual rapt attention and episode 3 is John expressed some frustration that the New Testament isn't more thoroughly connected and explicated it made me wonder whether Paul as a Hebrew scripture scholar who understood that it was as you call it Hebrews meditation literature do you think it's possible that he crafted his Epistles in that same way to the people would need to hear them and read them over and over to really get at the depth of meaning just curious thanks for all you do God bless all that his letters
 hard to understand there are already you could say there are many parts that are difficult to follow and you remember at some point in the series I mention that passage in 2nd Peter Weir Peter felt the same way yeah he does there's something simple sweaters that are hard to understand however the question is is that intentional my hunch is it for Paul's letters that it was expensive to write letters we can talk about this in future episodes letters were actually produced and how expensive it was in the process involved but I think part of it was just the way that you communicated through these letters and the way his mind works was like a beautiful mind like terms of is this guy crazy or is it got really at I think it's seen you can just feel bursting out of sentences in Galatians that there's whole volumes you can write on what's underneath just a couple sentences and
 I think you actually could you do need to read them over and over at least I have for years but I'm not sure it's necessarily cuz he crafted at the way the Hebrew letter to the crafted I think it's he was raised on that literature and so he certainly is shaped by it and talks and thinks by it but I think it's also just a nature of him his unique personality and the letter medium, what do you think I hear what you're saying there yeah he is not designed with the same maybe intentionality that scroll in the Tanakh would have been designed potentially but he had internalized that design tradition in that tradition so much that it undergirds everything you say yeah so by by meditating on Hebrew Bible and then meditating on Paul's writing yeah it's cool chemistry that happens totally which I've noticed
 project with you so many things come pop a lot more when when I start to see the things that that Paul was saying and which are things that you've been cleaning out his design patterns and themes in the inside that would you say though that the Book of Revelations is that way for sure it's a letter it is a letter and actually Richard Malcolm and his little a book The Theology of the Book of Revelation he talks about this when you talk about something what are signs that something is intentionally crafted to be read over and over and over again to really get what I say and usually it's about layers of patterns of repetition or key little signals are hyperlinks that you just won't notice on the first hearing or reading and sew in Revelation yeah the the number of words that are phrases that are repeated by multiples of 74 just like in Genesis just like the old stuff like that is
 it really crafted it to make sure that that seventh phrase appeared in this chapter in this thing and the letter to the Romans is elegantly composed The Way of the movements of the letter introducing introduction of key themes how it develops but other letters seem like they didn't I do not have this quite that amount of composition intention to it because that takes a lot of time by an enormous amount of time and that's time is something Paul didn't have a ton of and Paul was cruising around after church and some of these letters maybe is episode we talked about how he wrote them with colleagues was that already have a future together they actually had a lot of intentionality but they have the medium in the in the feel is a bit different than say like the book of Isaiah or the the book of Samuel and kings in the Hebrew Bible I will say that the thing though
 as helping me what she's mentioning is my frustration talk about that part of your frustration of the letters complete why is it that Paul refers to things that I don't even know what he's talking about but probably we'll never know why isn't there a more thorough conversation about the way of Jesus and you said well that's The Sermon on the Mount Auburn and secondly we're just talking about this really helps me that these are letters written to someone else but they are also God's word to us and so how do we get into that space will we recognize both of those things and this is what I remember taking away by learning how Paul or Timothy or James is crafting and is taking the way of Jesus into these new communities by watching them do that we're watching and we're learning how we can do the same thing into our modern contacts yet and that was cool because then it makes it less of a bug and more of a few
 yeah I was like I get to wrestle through these and not get the whole both sides of the conversation all the time but by wrestling through that I'm going to learn some skills of how to take the word Jesus to a to a new context that's right because they were addressing the apostles were addressing their specific issues at work in 1st Century Jewish in Greco-Roman culture however human culture has really changed over time but there are some cool things that are just kind of the part of the human experience and that will carry over but they'll also be all these new areas that we face in our time and place that the apostles don't speak to because they couldn't have but that doesn't mean the spirit is bound and that there's nothing new this gospel let's say for time and place that just means we need to keep stuff with Spirit and the apostles to hear what that is and then carried out I think this is what a job of a church is
 in all the different times and places of history in the world that's a good question let's go and hear question from Amy from Ohio hi this is Amy from Ohio I've really been enjoying your podcast they've helped me dig deeper in my Bible study my questions concerning the letters as this 2nd Timothy 3:16 Says all scripture is breathed out by God and is profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness what do you think Paul meant when he referred to all scripture was he referring to what we would Now call the Provost in the Old Testament or what is understanding of all scripture also have included other books also was he referring to his letter and the letters of other Apostles as well thanks for all you do praying for your ministry yes that's a great question and it's one that has been debated between different Christian Traditions throughout time and it's a matter of huge
 today in academic typical scholarship too so maybe it's something so that most people and Christian Traditions would agree on when Paul's writing this letter to Timothy the New Testament as a collection of documents doesn't exist yet know many of the individual books or maybe small groups of the New Testament books do exist they have been written but in terms of fake 27 book collection that we have and it might even be likely that you were passed along one of these letters that wasn't originally written to you yeah. That's right but your church correct maybe around the same time the pulse reading 2nd Timothy he talks about Paul's letters you know that there are plural letters circulating but what Paul is talking about here is scriptures on which Timothy was raised tensions in the right before this and the verse that you quoted Amy he mentions the Timothy was raised on the scriptures which you know from childhood so he is certainly talking about not what we would call
 New Testament he's talking about the scriptures of Israel weather in their Greek or Hebrew form possibly know them in both languages and that's what he's referring to I hesitate to call it the Old Testament because for most Christians with that refers to is like a balanced volume hard or soft a table of content in table of contents and maybe a few Maps yeah it was actually a huge interest in research for me for a lot of years cuz I was really driven and wanted to understand it so just some hard facts on the ground the early Christian and Jewish communities had a clear conception that there is this thing called the scriptures the core content was agreed upon across all kinds of different communities but the boundaries were fussy in Jewish and early Christian communities they just simply were in the same way that it is today correct answer to life the Christian Bible will which Christian Bible
 Orthodox and which kind of Orthodox tradition cuz different Orthodox Traditions have slightly so this fuzzy boundaries which I never knew I felt like it was very clear Canon it is proposed that a surprise so you're saying the same thing was true in these early for Century Jewish Community is referring to is certainly includes what we would call the Protestant old Old Testament weather in its Greek or Hebrew form probably depends on the crew Paul's hanging out with if you hang out with Messianic Jews it may be in the Aramaic or Hebrew form grew up with Jewish Mom and Grandma but not a juice dad this will be learn the facts so it's flip a coin it's the maybe he likely in Jessamine Creek or the Hebrew but there were other text that we know that Paul red and valued one is call
 call the wisdom of Solomon which is the second temple Jewish work that's written as if it's from the mouths of Solomon to the kings of the nations of the world it's really a remarkable work and Paul is adapting language and notice from it in the early chapters to the Romans and it's not even a debate its act like it was super obvious once you read it the Romans 1 is adapting stuff from the Smith Solomon you think Paul could have considered that part of the scripture said that's what we don't know we don't know there are patterns of the win the apostles quote from what Protestants call the Old Testament books the pattern is they will stay as it's written in the scriptures or call it even with the scripture say or what God says but when Paul is in a picking up language from wisdom of Solomon he doesn't ever attributed explicitly the way he does but Paul is constantly weeding and scripture language from all kinds of text so I know for some people if you're hearing this for the first time
 this is really disturbing and a long time to I'm not disturbed by it anymore because it didn't disturb the early Generations they knew what the core of the scriptures were they knew that there were fuzzy boundary and boundary line texts but that didn't prevent them from working together and moving the Jesus movement forward where is the debates really begin to come in just when power politics and church denomination of politics got involved in the process and Reformation or in the split between Catholic and Orthodox these are moments where the boundaries of the mythical collection become contentious and and divisive and people were aware of these differences from the earliest centuries Church fathers weren't song it's a bigger question actually we have one more will do another question from one that's kind of attack on to this topic here or if it was a pleasure having y'all over here for the
 since we can see hints of the book of 1st Enoch and bought the letters of 2nd Peter and Jude how should we approach these is a testament to books to more effectively read the New Testament letters and you for all you do and letting the series these are books than that may have been in some people's mix of scriptural be springing up is well Paul is adapting language from say it with some Solomon it was eventually included in the Catholic Apocrypha Jude explicitly quotes the book that is today called first Enoch he quotes from it and first Enoch is not in the Catholic Apocrypha it is in one branch of the Orthodox Church one branch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church that has first Enoch in the Bible today like still today and apparently Jude Jesus's brother
 not very highly of this text enough to quote from it so we just have to reckon with this the boundaries of the cannon were fuzzy and those are released generations and it didn't seem to bother people and they have been poured us throughout all of history and that. But that doesn't mean all but now we don't know what the Bible is now that's of course we do but we need to reckon with us is that there are certain boundary text that the church has debated and the spirit hasn't given to the church unanimity on that point and I don't know what else to say about it there is just for you on the find this interesting I just read a book review this last week of a brand new history of the reception of first Enoch in the history of the church it's by an Ethiopian Orthodox color is her name baruk Ila Allah but you can search the title is called first Enoch is Christian scripture and it's the most up-to-date scholarly work on the history of first Enoch and Krishna
 it is most interesting it is interest I haven't read it you be brighter recently right at first what kind of project that took me there and so fast and so much these texts have diminished value in Illuminating the thought world of the Apostles your perspective has been whether or not you are going to consider it scripture largely comes from your tradition but whether or not you read it it's not dangerous to read them there's a lot of value even if you don't think they're scripture in reading them I would happily recommend that people go by either get a Catholic Bible or at least get a in Apocrypha collection could any bookstore you'll notice stuff it will feel like familiar territory because the second temple Jewish Literature Like the final phases of the Hebrew Bible and like the new testament which is also a second so and we've made one video on
 that was like really concise when would a video of what is the Bible yeah we'll break down what books are in which versions of people's Cannon and just kind of it's very broad but it just introduced at the idea that people that the Bible has poor boundaries in different traditions in the thought is not very wealthy is that should actually enrich your view of the history of the Jewish Christian tradition than what the Bible is see Kathy and I think I'm going to pronounce the name right I hope Damaris both have questions a kind of overlaps we thought we play them together and can respond to them together call or any of the others but they were on the same level as Genesis or Deuteronomy or Isaiah
 and if it didn't make a difference in how we read the letters thanks my name is changed my view the Bible completely and forever my question about this letter series is one about Canon how did these letters get churros in to be in the Bible and not others why did some of Paul's mail get chosen and what happened to the ones that didn't get chosen thanks what was the apostles can see if it now these are questions about how did the letters become part of the Bible as we conceive of it is a very interesting question your point first you're asking did the apostles have an awareness that what they were riding. The same level as of Authority or importance that it would one day get bound together
 I think that's a separate question actually I mean how could they possibly know when I write a letter to you I have no idea but I've actually never been at the beginning of the series and it was read to you in front of a bunch of people but when you write a letter how can you know that it might be put together in a collection of Correspondence one day so that's a that's a different I think is actually fairly easy to answer that question to be like at I just don't think the apostles were thinking in those categories that they meant the James meant for his letter to sit alongside the letter to Galatians I just I don't think that was in his mind it's an interesting question cuz you could ask the same thing for other second temple Jewish writers like 14 or any of these they're rioting in the tradition correct and in this community
 whether or not they're thinking there's this like maybe this will get selected to be part of the like a team selection was there any of that sentiment well did they imagine they're letters being collected together that's all I'm speaking to you right there there's a related issue but it's the different issue of whether they thought their writings carry the same level of importance and Authority as what they considered their Bible the Greek or Hebrew scriptures and on that I think we're on the ground I'm pretty excited that they did think that that they did think that these letters and the correspondents and they're teaching carry the same level of scriptural Authority as what was in their Bible so then actually someone asked that question in a queue and I are of our first or second episode of the series when we were in Dallas Saul refer back to that but just to summarize in that response there's two or three places
 and Paul's letters first letter to the Thessalonians reset he's retelling the story of how like the first got there they were only there I think not even a month and he says we going to annoy you when you came you received our teaching not as a human word but as a word from God so Paul very clearly has the sense that when he is there and Power by the spirit telling the good news about Jesus that that's not just his you know who concocted tell that he is speaking with a mode of Jesus's Authority they received his teaching as of a Divine word know there's a difference between least in my in my mind saying that someone speaking a Divine word of God's Authority and someone speaking with the authority that this should be scripture got it but it all depends on what we even mean by scripture in the first place so this was in my response to that question in the first episode of Jesus commissioned a group of people after he was resurrected
 the defense really the accounts of Luke John and Matthew tell us she's at the Risen Jesus commissioned the group of people to go represent him and his teaching and message to the nation's and that's the group of people that has letters come from and so that's why I've used that were Deputy in terms of his passing his authority to them so if I follow Jesus and I got a letter from Jesus yeah I would do I would have thought I would do with it because it would come from DSS Authority and what Jesus is doing and how the apostles Envision themselves was as emissaries half of Jesus and so they are riding with commissioned Authority has helped all of his many of his letters use them as slaves of Jesus the Messiah so in that sense I think they knew that they were riding into communities and believe that they were speaking with the message and authority of Jesus and God I think that you we can say I'm totally persuaded that's how they envisioned that but that's a
 a question then whether they thought it would be collected into these books that we have today I see so that's interesting you would think that it should be the same question because if it does have the authority of Jesus then it should be in our Cannon and so like you brought up that first and second Corinthians it more likely for stand up Saturday 2nd for 2nd for that Paul wrote to other letters to the church in Corinth in Corinth yeah and if we suddenly had those wooden that that would have the same Authority as the others well okay so then this gets to damaris's question which is how did certain letters get chosen all we can infer is from what we know about how the letter circulated to Paul says in Colossians make sure you get the letter I wrote to the laodiceans and make sure the letter I wrote to you get the rest of them which we don't have unless it's the
 see Visions may be in the same region Peter refers to a collection of Paul's letters by the time you write the seasons can refer to the biblical tradition as the prophets in the apostles talks about how does the movement of Jesus is built on Jesus and the foundation of the prophets in the Apostle Paul has a conception does there's an emerging body of authoritative teaching alongside the Hebrew Bible prophets that he calls the apostles but which of the letters get chosen there are studies on this academic studies retracing the historical process but I think that you can't prove the inspiration of just some letters and just a mother's I just think that's not a helpful way to go about it but we can say is these letters I think by Merit of their amazing content Rose to the top there is a kind of an analogy to have videos go
 so good man my brother is a down the city and he hosted Church community down and whatever the city down there and they got to have a copy they got here though it was surely a lot of that element going on and that the cream of the apostolic letters Rose to the top so to speak and what we have to trust is that that was a gift and work of the spirit in those early decades and centuries even so that the 21 letters that we have today we have to trust that that's what the spirit wanted the church to here so from that perspective the first letter to the church in Corinth didn't survive because it wasn't passed along as much and it didn't have the community's didn't feel I had that same weight for a p we don't know we don't know for whatever reason that it didn't survive if the spirit is involved then you trust what we got is we have correct
 this would be really disturbing if you are pre-loaded assumption about the Bible is it's the Divine Behavior manual complete and perfect dropped out of the Heavens to you with everything you need to know for life and godliness then these historical facts will have to find a way to create an apologetic to explain them in a different way or make them not seem like they have them patience of at least that's my opinion but when we think of the letters of the New Testament they were both the product and the fuel driving the early missionary movement of the early decades as the Jewish Messianic movement went out into the Greco-Roman world and these letters a rose out of that context by the commissioned representatives of Jesus and I shouldn't expect them to be something other than that I should love them for what they are for that for that reason and let them be what they are and let them speak got to work to me as for Century letters that's where I'm at
 and it is it's helped me come to peace with most of the things I used to be really bothered about yeah let's put a 5-point on that because I want understand that more give me an example of then something that would have bothered you when you had more of the Paradigm of this is a behavior manual that doesn't bother you when you leave space for I get to just listen in on a one-sided conversation from Jesus's apostles to the early Church in many ways it's just what we've done in this podcast series on the letters so well this wouldn't bother me but your pulse and stuff about cancer to mail Christians getting circumcised you know a city of Asia Minor that doesn't I've never been there so that's one level of it but that's not quite what you're asking me is it but what I'm saying is this historical indebtedness of that context could for one person raised a question of like why how did
 letter from that become gods were dropped out of Heaven to me like there's a disconnect there things that used to bother me yeah where is she's about this cannon collection information about Paul mentioning a letter to laodicea and we don't have it one of our first teachers used to raise the issue by saying is Paul wrote a grocery list and drop it on the ground and somebody picked it up you with it that inspired and so there's just the way the letters came to be collected causes so many problems for a model of divine inspiration of the Bible that says you know this golden tablets from Heaven it just doesn't work as an explanation for what the letters r i don't know it doesn't bother me anymore I think I've just come to appreciate the process by which they into which they are written in and by which they were collected tell me another way to remember how who asked the question earlier about meditation literature was at the first question Loren has worn a question the second question we played at
 where these letters and meditation their turn the same way the Hebrew Bible is the way it's crafted and such one thing we have talked about is how the Bible is also wisdom literature would use that phrase before we use the phrase meditation their turn that speaks to how you're supposed to come to it constantly lifetime of mulling over seeing connections that I shape imagination its wisdom literature also and what I understand of how use that phrase is that you can't like go to the Israel's Covenant laws and then try to do those things in your contacts most of them we couldn't do today if we want you to cut it and when you look at the way Paul reads them and thinks and meditates on them he takes the wisdom and applies it and we talked about how the same thing is true when you read the narratives or even what we call the wisdom literature it's there to make us wise not in this sense of knowledgeable but the sense of this fear of the Lord
 yeah Divine Guided by an guidance yes eating of the tree of life and wisdom literature that's right and I think that there is a meditative quality to wisdom literature absolutely and so I think that the hang up when you're looking at the New Testament letters as okay this is part of my either grab bag of devotional thoughts or this is part of my behavior man is part of the wisdom literature that I get to mine for God's wisdom now when you say that or if we do say that it kind of leaves this opportunity to use a hermeneutic that let you dismiss maybe a lot of things in the letter is like okay well that doesn't matter for us anymore you think is there a danger to this perspective of
 actually you don't know that you're doing this you are paraphrasing exactly my question from Nevada that we were going to talk about next let's hear Mike yeah this is Mike from Reno Nevada my question is how did the church be using the officials are they wisdom or are they finding law I assume it's somewhere in between and if so how do we determine which things are prescriptive for all the churches of all time and which things are just timely instruction for that cultural moment for example it seems clear that Paul's instruction about meat sacrificed to Idols is timely for the Corinthian Church and churches today rarely if ever consider binding however many churches won't allow women to teach because I suppose instructions in 1st Timothy so yeah what should the church be doing with the Epistles yep that's exactly right Mike that is the question so are they wisdom literature are they lost their scripture scripture
 and all scripture I believe will Paul says I can share the conviction that it's got its a god breathed is the gift of a human Divine Partnerships through the spirit and what Jesus says that what did he say till the end of the age that it all away and also scripture the scriptures exist to tell a unified story about history in human story humanity and the world the least Jesus so that Jesus's followers can have Divine guidance as they go on into the world about how to live is the new Humanity that gives allegiance to Jesus so to say that their law for not lot of the letters are not bother letters but that but to the people receive them there were laws in there there was their heavier Behavior mandates for sure there was like very clear guide
 sometimes command but their commands given to first century churches to address things are going on in those first century communities for might bring up with me it might bring some meat sacrificed to Idols this is back to your point John that you have a cultural you have a clash of cultures within one Church community almost certainly connected to an ethnic divisions or boundary line in the Church of Jewish people and not Jewish people and so Paul actually in that he develops a whole set of wisdom guidance and even says like you really means it he even sometimes he gives in the form of commands if you're doing something that is going to offend the conscience of another follower of Jesus and may be compromised their moral Integrity don't do it love your neighbor as yourself so that's not an issue in many cultures and it doesn't have to be to have a password you have to look for the wisdom so I think the same thing holds for Paul's commands about women teaching
 1st Timothy we have to do is look throughout Paul's letters as a whole first of all and you'll find that he says different things to different churches so in 1st Corinthians you have some female prophetesses or leaders in the church who were very clearly speaking in the church cuz their leading in prayer and Prophecy in the Gathering for the 3 chapters later he has the sense you know I want the women to be silent with a few times earlier who was just giving guidance on what women should or should not do with their hair when they speak and pray very clearly they're the bigger picture going on in that church and he's also putting out fires and then church in 1st Timothy Paul's putting out a fire and emphasis that he tells you about in the opening paragraph that there is a group of male teachers who hijacking the Theology of the church with bad interpretation based on their the chapters of Genesis and then he tells you that there's a group of wealthy influential women
 sponsoring these teachers that they've taken into there and those women are grabbing the mic and usurping Authority in Ephesus and supposed shutting down in Chapter 2 and so the whole question is how does what Paul is doing to a first-century church relate to how we are doing and whatever the answer that question is going to be it's not going to be mine by neglecting contextual nature of Paul's guidance to the first century churches we have to discover what spirit is saying bye contextualizing what Paul was doing right there and so then you have to incorporate it with everything else the Paul says about male and female on the fact that he had many female co-workers and that he worked alongside Priscilla as a prominent teacher that she was in the early church since its eyes at all and it's difficult and I'm not issue a particular different Church Traditions have come to different conclusions all of them are trying to get with the spirit of saying through these texts and so you know
 well you know this Paradigm it takes off this really clear guardrail of if it says it you do it right nobody actually does that nobody nobody I bet if you go into the church where that the Christian tradition where people are where women are not allowed to ever speak by take that one line the 1st Corinthians 14 out of context I am almost certain that those people don't also kiss each other when they leave when they come together and then to the building everybody's picking and choosing five every Christian tradition examination is Magic guardrail of if it says it do it doesn't exist and tradition every Traditions picking and choosing the question is what are the assumptions the criteria the guidelines by which a Christian tradition is picking and choosing
 that has I'm so forgetful this question was brought up directly in our Dallas and actually what I did was I just named it as an issue and then I recommended Scott McKnight's book The Blue Parrot remember that that's what that book is all about I'll have to read that then listen to it it's a great audiobook but what are you trying to do is just say everybody speaking in choosing a new testament letters of how do you do that well when you do that with God's wisdom the wisdom of what the spirit has been saying to the church for the last two thousand years whatever it is it's not simple or else you wouldn't have the diversity on all all these kinds of issues in the letters so there's no way to answer answer your question might but we have responded to it this is Langston I hit or yes who's asking a related question but not on the topic of food sacrificed to Idols or women are the church but about slavery in the fridge
 Country Church to Tim and John my name is Langston and I'm from Atlanta Georgia I really appreciate the Bible project y'all give me a safe place to like run about my face and grow so my questions about slavery specifically why the New Testament authors didn't just say not to own slaves if you're Christian like how they say not to be no sleep around if you're Christian and other things like that I feel like I would go a lot better with much ease as I know there's other stuff going on at things I don't understand also does a descendant of slaves myself this is something that keeps coming up and I'm just would like to know I like to understand more about this it would help me a lot personally so thank you appreciate you guys and keep doing what you do yes thank you Justin for your honest question I appreciate it and the way you articulated it is true the house so many people feel when they read text about slavery in the New Testament 25 minutes just leaps off the page to most modern
 is it doesn't prohibit and there are some texts like in Timothy or Titus that actually tells slaves to like that you know that your master is right and the history of houses versus have been used to legitimate all kinds of things specially in American history is is really horrific the core of your question like then if I understand is why didn't the apostles to see the implication that slavery is inconsistent with the message of Jesus creating a multi-ethnic family of people who are all loved by God and stand on equal Rank and dignity before him it seems so clear to us now on this side of whatever of History it's not an abolition of slavery for the Civil Rights Movement all kinds of other things and Russell living in a moment we're especially America is coming to a Reckoning with the fact that it's not as advanced or progressed as far as many people thought I had
 an issues of racial equity and so on so that's the question right why didn't they draw the implication in the way that it seems more clear to us right now and I've been a long journey with that question salt likes and I'll just catch a ride I'm at and John I'm I want to hear if your thoughts to do everything we're just saying the previous you know responses to the questions was that the apostles and the letters are fully embedded in the first century cultural context in which they are written to which they're in and what the apostles are doing is groundbreaking stuff in terms of working out the implications of what happened with Jesus so just the sheer fact that Jews and non-jews eating together are eating together it's just like wow this was bound to be breaking stuff that Paul can write something like lations 326 of 28 there is no slave or free Greek or Barbarian male or female you are all one in the Messiah very Progressive Progressive it was just like
 there's no category for thinking about a community of all those kinds of people who have equal dignity together there was nowhere else for something like that was happening so what the letters are doing with we're watching The Apostles work out the implications of it as the movement spreads in a century and just because someone has the conviction that the apostles are inspired by God's spirit to write and teach with her teaching that doesn't mean that they are all so omniscient or are writing in light of the cultural developments two thousand years later on the other side of the planet and what the spirit would be making crystal clear to the church then cuz that makes sense the apostles are themselves working out the implications of the gospel and it'll we have imaginations shaped by all kinds of events were post abolition of the Atlantic slave trade where decades after the Civil Rights Movement here in America we also live in a culture
 though that has political structures that I'm raised from as a child to make me think like I'm in towered to influence things are by my vote and by my involvement in my community but we have to imagine is that culture where none of that exist it's a dictatorship Empire you have no it wouldn't even occur to you to think to try and change your culture like so you get crucified for that and that's kind of my point here is that it only way to change the culture would be to take over with power and the threat all a new toilet that's right and so decided to do was start these with continued the practice of Jesus is starting the cells be stuck networks of a cell community meeting in homes who were creating common life together that live by a different story and so Langston would submit to you that Paul comes very close to
 but you wish you would say yeah in the letter letters of Philemon in the House Church there and what he says to Philemon isn't free or slave what he says is received by leaving back not just as a slave but as a brother in the Messiah and then he leaves it to Philemon to work out the implications of that cuz that means that he you and he are going to eat at the same table together at least on the Lord's day he doesn't serve you you actually are the hosts for him in your house church on that day but for why he doesn't say just free or slave was it man there's so many things that we're going on then there were so many factors at work there that are very different than our context
 so one person who's helped me a lot already mentioned Scott McKnight's book blue parakeet he recently wrote one of the most robust studies and commentaries on Philemon in Paul's letter to Philemon and he has probably one of the most up-to-date Explorations both historical but also from a Christian perspective on your question Langston Scott McKnight's commentary on letter to Philemon and I've also talked with him about this he's he's persuaded that Paul was on the cusp of seeing the full implications of what the gospel means for the institution of slavery and that what we're seeing him on the front edge of his awareness of that in the letter to Philemon but it's not it's not the statement that two thousand years later than we wish you would say the Holy Spirit does not give them a little further and get him there that's a great question but I was really I think there's something to the conclusion there that's worth paying attention to the fact that Paul doesn't say
 doesn't mean that that the spirit isn't saying that right now or throughout history to the church later cuz the implication that slavery is inconsistent with a community of the Gospel did become more and more clear to more and more Christians throughout history it took a my opinion far too long for the church to catch up with the beard on that one but that's me speaking isn't a social occasion so like them out I'll recommend one other thing just because I can't wait for this book to come out by New Testament scholar Esau mccaulley is an African-American New Testaments color book comes out September one 2020 I cannot wait to read it called reading while black African-American biblical interpretation as an exercise and hope I am hoping to get my butt kicked by the to be honest with you did you see a table of contents I did yeah it looks amazing it looks like it's going to be very challenging especially for people in my demographic and social okay
 listen to hear about how even the educational institutions in biblical scholarship that I was trained in I think are embedded in all kinds of practices that relate to the same set of issues about embracing inequity in the body of Christ and so I'm eager to hear what you thought has to say and to learn from him cuz I can see is that he's going to dress how slavery has been understood and New Testament reputation throughout history and I'm expecting to learn a lot and be challenged so they go and thank you for a good question finish off with a question from Cody and California by Tim and John this is Cody from Palmdale California my question is about a passage in the letter to the Romans chapter 13 verses 1 through 7 Paul talks about submitting to government authorities bills in line with Jesus saying to give to Caesar what is Caesar's I think in light of recent Fourth of July and movements to take down
 systemic racism in America my head is buzzing with things like was the American Revolution unbiblical how far do we submit if it's a totally unjust government how does a command like this Vibe with the Israelites destroying other nations in the Old Testament or is this something specific to those this letter is written to thank you for all you do by how far do we submit in an unjust you could ride a whole history of how Romans 13 12 7 has been used and abused over the last two thousand years just like any of these other passages I've noticed is when the government is exposing your values are really excited about this that's right and when it's not your this person it's another example of how taking paragraph your paragraphs out of
 flutters out of context and reapplying it without attention to what Paul was doing in his situational contacts it's just we're really going to miss yous we're going to do something with this paragraph I think Paul would not would not be pleased with so let's see by the time this Cuban re-releases will have talked about the situation in context of Romans will talk about this passage but just as a recap the Paul's writing to a network of house churches divided along the Jewish non-jewish boundary lines juice had been expelled from rum years earlier because the riots surrounding the Divide division caused in Jewish and Messianic Christian Jewish communities the Jewish war against the realm we're just like a decade away from that so there is huge division Jewish animosity against Roman authorities War resistance against Rome is in the air in Jewish culture
 and so Paul wants these multi-ethnic Jesus communities that include a lot of juice to be distance from that he doesn't want the Jesus communities to be brought into association with the resistance movements happening in other Jewish Community Center and so he writes will be right here so it's a different setting entirely to think about people living under oppressive violently oppressive governments and what how followers of Jesus should respond in those settings you just can't copy and paste passwords into another contacts without using with them you know Peter didn't think he should submit to the Jewish authorities when they were kicking him out of the temple courts and Acts telling them not to preach in the name of Jesus right A B to Authority he resisted their Authority in the name of Jesus
 so Paul negotiated Roman Authority in very clever ways in the book of Acts he didn't take things lying down that's for sure so it's just another example of the speaker thing that we're talking about where I'm understanding what the apostles we did hang in there setting helps us see and gives us guidance but not necessarily A exact part in a vast rules to do in our in our context to do that you need the whole new testament all the scriptures at church Community around you and the wisdom of the spirit and we explored this idea and more depth and RX our way of the Exile we looked at how did how the Prophet Jeremiah told him to seek the well-being of Babylon yeah but then at the same time they were supposed to keep their own identity and so how do you how do you do that how do you serve Babylon
 while still serving your way and that's the subversive loyalty pension that that we discussed what's the current man I'm thinking about that a common denominator for so much of this conversation in this Cuban are I think in this is the assumption that I had for the Bible about a short while that you grew up with the tablets falling from Heaven. The Divine command just read it God says it I believe that settles it in a way but that Paradigm wants from the Bible is something that removes responsibility from me except to just hear it and go bad that's my only responsibility what it takes away from me is the responsibility to learn to study to become informed to love my neighbor and to use wisdom to discover new Uncharted territories how to live out the gospel in new and creative ways to die
 innocence yeah do you think that's what Jeremiah meant when he said that the world be written on your heart has the Torah written on people's hearts and in the world that can tell you what to do and every single situation that you encounter and there is just internalisation of a scripture that then helps you at be the kind of person that has a heart wisdom that's right and this is actually just like what Paul says in Romans 12 when he says I want y'all to offer y'all's bodies plural all y'all's bodies as a singular sacrifice so that you can discern the will of God is good pleasing and perfect will fall off and prayed the people in this church has would be able to discern the will of God and that's what we're talkin about you even Paul didn't think he was giving all the comprehensive commands for people to live by he wanted people to become mature and learn how to discern God's will but not on their own in the church
 in which they're in bed at this being Guided by the spirit what I'm saying is that this Paradigm the golden tablets via the Bible is trying to make the Bible do all of that work for us for it and taking that responsibility on our shoulders and the way I understand how the story of the Bible works now it seems like a misplaced responsibility this seems to be in Genesis one that's what God wants humans to be his image ruling the World by his wisdom but them ruling the World by his wisdom and how we will do one more of these at the end of the series yes thank you everybody for your great questions as always such a thoughtful audience yes yes Bible project we're a nonprofit in a studio in Portland Oregon we make videos and this podcast and other free resources it's all available at bywood project.com and it's all free because it's your support people like
