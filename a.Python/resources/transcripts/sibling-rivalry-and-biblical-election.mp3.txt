this is John from Bible project and we are in the middle of a series called the family of God how God created all Humanity as one family and while we become different tribes and Nations spread out all over the land with different languages and cultures the biblical hope is that all of humanity will come together to represent God with all of our diversity now the entire plot the Hebrew Bible says that God is going to accomplish all of this through one family the family of Abraham and his son Isaac who become the nation of Israel but here's the thing Abraham has lots of other kids other than Isaac like Ishmael is first born and he also has a lot of children from his wife Keturah a woman he marries when Sara dies the back to Genesis chapter 25 we get a list of all the names of these other kids and their descendants in the Nations that they become and if you need to get bored when we read genealogies in the Bible but this one's really important
 happening these genealogies are populating the biblical world and you're going to meet all of these families again later in the store and they're all hostile these are the Nations that Israel fights against throughout the store in the end this is all sibling rivalry this is a very realistic depiction of the human story estranged siblings it's a thing and somehow through it all God is going to bring blessing to all of these nations through Israel but we learned pretty early on is that I didn't choose Israel because they are a gold standard of what it means to be human he's choosing to bring his Blessing to The Many Nations through one family and even though this family is not morally or ethically superior to end to the other families in any way back turn off and worse that's not the basis for God's choosing them nor is its purpose God's choosing them for the simple fact that he chose them you chose it because it was them and their
 who is going to work with but that doesn't mean that all these other families are outside of the scope of God's mercy just the opposite they often produce the heroes and heroines of Israel story today on the episode we going to talk about the election of Israel sibling rivalry and the hope of unity thanks for joining us here we go
okay Tim let's continue this the theme of the family of God in the family of humanity, fundamentalists theme is another thing we talked at length about which is the God wants to rule the world through humans humans representing God's Reign and Rule and not just through one or two humans or this group of humans but all of humanity and so all Humanity needs to be United in that rain and Rule so we're tracing the theme of how a disunited and onion knighted fractured divided Humanity can be the image of God which means that they need to learn how to represent God and fundamental to being able to do that it's doing that in unity with other humans also got strategy for bring about this Rescue of humanity to be reclaimed as the image Bears is to select one man make a great family with him and through that family then
 find this blessing and unity of all the families of the earth Abraham Abraham right away we see the problem with the strategy which is the humans and Abraham goes and starts just doing dumb things not trusting God and deceiving the nation and being deceptive then taking into his own hands with him and Sarah in this total just repetition of the garden narrative use their own schemes to try to get the thing that God promised them on their own terms instead of just trusting God and that is getting a son by a pressing having sex with one of their Egyptian slaves that they got to another deception and Matt
 is it to this infighting and which now Sarah and the in the immigrants slave whose name is a great with each other so we're left with this mess but despite the mess we saw some beautiful things happen which is that God comes back to Abraham and he says subduing the the dumb stuff but he doubles down on his Covenant with Abraham I said I'm I'm going to make your your family great and only going to bless the nation's we learned that now is he the father of many nations development of the coven it and then we see how he isn't a sign of circumcision which we talked a lot about drinks than that that's last episode very fascinating but that entryway into the Covenant family isn't about whether or not you're Abraham son or daughter it's about whether you take on the sign yeah so it's available to not just the chosen family them to anyone wants to participate in that so that kind of bubbles out of this story
 and then when Elsa bubbles out is that Ishmael to the sun-ray Abraham has with the Immigrant who Sarah doesn't want who now has created this division in the family. Says I'm going to take care of that family. Family is Mel said they're going to be blessed and so despite all the evil that Abraham was doing and his wife God is finding goodness in this and doubles down on his promise to use it as good in that what he does is he creates good out of the bad yes situation that which doesn't redeem it or erase the evil make it okay but it is God's response to create a situation that Abraham and his wife responsible for yeah it sounds very much like the message of Genesis to save many lives.
 I got stuck with a strategy that God has made a covenant promise to this family and to use one particular lineage and he doesn't want to use a lineage that came about through human scheming that's what Ishmael represents what he's going to do is continue to work in surprising ways that upset schemes and the power and wisdom of humans and so he's going to give Sarah who's 90 and Abraham who's 100 a miraculous son named after the Abraham's family is now bigger than just the family this real family that will become Israel yeah because there's Ishmael and his descendants and a whole lot more are going to start appearing Abraham is the father of many nations not just Israel but Israel in the biblical story is the chosen lineage for the seed
 I see the promised seed to come through them God will restore blessing to all of the rest so even though old testament's going to keep focusing in on a smaller and smaller stuff group to family of Abraham family of Abraham is always still in the background I want to do in this stuff is just explore that more what's going to happen is after Ishmael Abraham's family is actually going to continue to multiply into some other nations and we're going to see is a family divided as Abraham dies his family is fractured and divided between many nations and there's just one through him God is working and that sets a pattern in motion that's just going to work on recycle through the rest of the Torah and in the prophet Joshua Judges Samuel Kings it's just going to be all of these repetitions of Abraham's descendants doing exactly what Abraham and Sarah did
 humans do stupid stuff selfish things to each other and then we don't want to be around each other anymore that's basically
 pretty stupid as that I would describe a bumper sticker that says the more people I meet the more I like my dog feels kinda I'm glad God doesn't feel that way so we're going to follow that through and then we're going to see is how Isaiah the prophet sums all this and rekindles the hope of the unified Human family steps
 so let's begin at the end of Abraham Story 25 is where Abraham dies it's probably a chapter over him having Isaac promised seed proceed tests him yes the moment he gives that he demands the life of the promise I'm back by the test at the test and Abraham passes passes the test had to give an ultimate sacrifice for Abraham to make and then God repeats the promise and said because you passed the test I'm going to do what I said I would do so Genesis 25 Full Bucket genealogies yeah but have the Symmetry it begins with some genealogies has an important thing in the middle and then it ends with some more genealogies it begins Abraham took another wife after Sarah died her name was Crown spell
 differently but it rhymes with the queen died and now he married and then he married another woman whose name sounds like to work Crown she bore for him and then a bunch of Stan's Zimmern option Madden Midian Chua let's turn back to that second option he became the father of Sheba and Dedham all the sons of dadan where Usher Raymond latuchie Malone meme midianites well there's two are effing aspirin Hanukkah Navidad in El Dorado business sons of 16-16-16 you know this is weird Bible trivia I don't know you don't like sometimes you do sometimes I get a laugh out of you what is the first time you're reading the Tanakh the way it's designed to got red which is over and over and over again the moment you see Maiden
 and Meridian and Sheva and dead on your like we're Moses's wife comes from a correct that's right totally so it's going to come back to us but especially in the Book of Judges the midianites are a hostile desert tribes are constantly performing Reds on this Caravan okay so this is the birth of some estranged mean a hostile Brothers but what's important here is that they are brothers of Isaac with 16 will a 16 descendants from Keturah and these are all brothers or nephews and cousins of Isaac so all of these are going to come to have some kind of hostile relationship to the family of Isaac sweet story so I gave everything he had to you talked to Isaac laughter but to the sons of his concubines
 and he gave them guests while he was still living but he sent them away from his son Isaac into the East to the land of the further into Exile Adam and Eve and scattering of Babylon all this so he sends them off to the east even though it just seems like a neutral description here yeah it's loaded bloated the East is always a place where you've been made distant from the present promise of God told Abraham live 175 years he breathed his last night came about after the death of Abram that God blessed his son Isaac & Isaac went to go live by a well called The Well of the living one who sees me because back chapter 16 when Sarah oppressed Hagar
 place a text with her if she got pregnant Sarah I pressed her and Hagar fled Into the Wilderness and she found a well that saves her life and she calls that well the airlock Jairo he still in other words Isaac is blessed and he goes and lives by the well that was the place where God said you met and rescued Hagar who gave birth to Ishmael who's the Rivalry 3 lives in the place of his rival brother and finds God's blessings and so it becomes a narrative image of the division of Abraham's family okay cuz this is where by Isaac being placed their you like always there with his rival brother or just he's in the place where his rival brother was was given his name and someone speaking of Israel brother the records of the generations of Ishmael handsome son you know who are the Egyptian Sarah slave board Abraham
 so unnecessary at this point in the story of course I know who had one but it repeats it all just to rekindle the memory of what they did to her hear the names of the sons of Ishmael by their first name is the order of their birth you get the whole list of names these are the sons of Ishmael twelve princes according to their tribes at 12 so these are the years of life of Ishmael he died and his descendants with and settled from Hobby Lobby in sure which is east of Egypt as you go to usher and he settled against the face of all his brothers more hostile Brothers here in three streams you can see them here and then all these sons of Abraham's wife Keturah
 then all the sons of Ishmael Abraham's son via Hagler and they're all out there living in the East Abraham sends them out to the East and hear the Ishmael were told they went they settled in the east of Egypt the same they all go to the same place what's happening these genealogies are populating the biblical world and you're going to meet all of these families again later in the story right there all bad guys and they're all hostile so just like how God chose able to choose one son favored and that generated hostility from the other brother is that Motif are becoming yeah but here's the thing is the one that God has chosen doesn't actually prove to be any more lie or more ethical yeah then the ones who are chosen
 yeah the only reason why I call him the bad guys is because they're not the protagonist yeah that's right now that they've done more bad than a family of our hopes when God called Abraham I'm going to make a great nation make your name great I'm going to bless you you'll be a blessing this a real gut punch then hear this chapter in here is Abram finally dying and he has become a father of many nations and they all hate each other it's a downer you're really like man that did not go well there were some things possible moments that happened but Abraham and Sarah's son really yeah and now you have a bunch of tribes who are all out for each other we can happen this is a very realistic depiction of the human story this is just strange.
 it's a thing you know both of our we both have two sons and their young this all the time wondering if you know your kids are going to like like you get along and like want to be in each other's lives everyday is depends on the hour whether or not they like each other and they go from just asked friend yes I mean there's six and nine right now best friends to did mortal enemies yes I can for that you know I've had a great relationship with my brother then that would never become estranged but we haven't done a great job of also being really connected in Brotherhood we've had our moments but yeah there's hope for Sons or siblings of this like this real sense of unity and Allegiance or I just this is a sense of what we have this Bond and it's really thick
 see a family whose children are really dedicated to each other even into adulthood and in their own family years it's really beautiful it's actually stunning and beautiful when there's those networks not just of support but of enriched relational enrichment and doing things together and it's actually less common experience usually it's a mixed bag and that's true for all families but it seems as much of the rule it's not more that there's as much attention but you're a sibling says there is Unity so that's the portrait of the show some family of God in Hebrew Bible is he at one and a half hours and stay on and it is
 so here we're going to fly real high here if you think through this design pattern at every transition of the generations God's going to keep selecting one subgroup of the of the chosen mine and it will always be set in contrast to some other siblings and then just watch those other siblings are usually going to go live in the same place or if they don't live in the same place they're going to act similar with hostility and this becomes a whole network of design patterns of sibling rivalry and it begins with Cain and Abel here's what happens if you have the chosen we're going to call at the chosen line but just think through that line real quick that goes from Abel whose sacrifices favorite because murdered by Saul brother Seth Eve says God gave me Seth in the place of Abel Eufaula Seth
 find down through and you get to Noah and then you get from Noah has three sons Shem ham and japheth and Shem is the chosen one then you go from Shem today from Abram follows this is if you read closely all the genealogies and then we just went through his story Isaac Isaac has two sons Jacob and Esau Jacob Stoneman Jacob has such as and Seed mine and then do this line goes for a long time and then you need one key figure from The Lion of Judah David so just follow that so every single one of those figures we just named has an alternate unchosen brother who ends up being hostile and who becomes the patriarch of a whole family who comes from them so in this pattern is kind of all
 crystallized remember back in the winter of 2019 and it was like all of a sudden so many things became much clearer in the Hebrew Bible so let's go back to Kane back and go through all the non chosen son wasn't chosen for his name is Kane and what that masks is it spelled in our English translation Cain masks from you is the fact that you're going to meet a people group later in the biblical story who come from his line but it's spelled differently so you don't notice the connection but it's spelled exactly the same in Hebrew so it's a group of people called the Canaanites spelled k e n but Kevin can I see the can lights are the cainites butt in Hebrew it's there and then there's the cainites it's exactly the same it's okay and becomes the father of this whole group of people called the kenites
 contrast to the night and then the future generation you have no son sham chosen one but the nachos and are Chaifetz and ham I wonder if Noah know there's not a silly grin by wolf know he's just walked out of the waters and ham are going to be coming to the Patriarchs of the island nation's does the from the table of Nations at 11 but then the Canaanites the Egyptians and the Babylonians all come from Ham hostile Brothers the brothers here all of the bad guys in the Bible are brothers of Israel her brother's to the forefathers of his father's whenever he goes into the land he supposed to leave his family behind but he takes one family member
 with him enough you a lot and how's that going to go well. Becomes the father of Moab and it's in the moabites are the sons of Abraham's nephew when is looking to cause me problems all of these people are going to cause problems next-generation Isaac has chosen Ishmael Sanchez we already saw this far as I can come from them Jacob and Esau the father of the people of Edom you get the 12 sons of Jacob you're going to get Judah and then the 11 other brothers I wonder how Judah is the tribe of Judah is going to get along with the rest of the tribes you know right after Solomon the son of David and Solomon dies the 11 tribes all break off from Solomon's son rehoboam and there's almost a civil war between
 brothers that only a profit but that's a whole other story of David and who is David's great rival saw saw your brother will Solace from The Tribe of Benjamin so they are brothers in that Collective the Canaanites the Egyptians the Babylonians MB ammonites Israelites edomites the benjaminites these are all families or I will have these are all the family they bring him give me not the Canaanites Egyptians are all connected so on the surface is the feud Dynamics here is he think about all these Generations first of all it almost every bad guy you meet in the Bible then is a repetition of the sibling rivalry of Cain and able to always brothers and sisters against brothers and sisters that's how the buy wants you to view all of these clashes
 sibling rivalries humans who are in the same family who can't live in unity together it's the Babylonian tragedy so to speak so that's one thing it's interesting the whole Bible Revival whole series of sibling rivalries for some reason that is very powerful in it so write this one out of the money and is he supposed to go into Abraham Isaac Jacob Judah David what is it with whites. Keep choosing these particular people write why it's not working it's not working and none of them are very upstanding moral examples in fact the narratives of every one of these chosen figures is going to highlight for the reader huge moral failings so to be the elect does not mean that you are righteous and good
 the moral superiority to the elect of the elect what about the non it lacked it's the elector not the righteous and good though sometimes you get some good guys in there but what that means is that the people who aren't chosen they are not the wicked and the evil in the story another with this is not a story about the good guys and the bad guys the chosen the man chosen because the chosen can be good or bad and the non chosen can sometimes be bad so often hostile to check this out just a little list I made I need to keep growing up what you're going to meet as you read through out the Torah and the prophets is all of these Heroes of different biblical stories who are from these non chosen families in fact their identity in these nachos and families is highlighted for the reader for example right after the Israelites escape from Egypt and it goes through the desert
 and Moses is trying to lead all these people and he's exhausted and he doesn't know how to organize the people his father-in-law Jethro comes up and he's the priest in the land of Midian over told simitian yeah that's why I thought Moses married a millionaire but he's not admitting that you're he's the priest of Midian the priest of Midian what we are told in Exodus 18 and then again later in the Book of Numbers is that he is a kid night music night he's associated with cane the first murder yeah and he's a hero and yes because he saves Moses by giving wisdom to Moses and he's also he when he hears the story of The Exodus he praises the got in his room so the hero who saved Moses is from the line of Kane that's interesting let's see the famous story of Deborah and Barak who saved is released in the Book of Judges
 and there's at the Canaanite King David and his General cisra and they're pressing Israel this the famous story does is the general is he squeezed when he is defeated about on the fleas and he sees some like some migrant wandering tent farmers and he runs into a tent and he needs a woman there named Yael rjl and what we're told is that she's from the line of Cocaine Muzik a night and she crushes the head sisera the savior of Israel fresh has the head of a descendant of ham is from the line of can does the author highlight her family except there's a strategy at work ya wrist is it from the line of Moab and she becomes the great-grandmother of David by marrying Boaz who this is a good one Caleb you know this
 the spies are the 12 Spies are sent into the land by Moses in 10 come back with a bad report but there's two who trusts got one of them is Joshua and the other one is Caleb and Caleb and what when you meet Caleb what you're told is Caleb the kenizzite Kenna's is the descendant of you divide and he's like the model of faith and actually what he is a kenizzite but he's becoming married into the family of Judah so he's actually part of the Messianic lineage but he's from he's from Issa in route as well as part of the Messianic David himself is a descendant of Caleb a descendant of both Ruth cuz Caleb is in the in the same line because my whole point is that all of a sudden you realize the biblical story is populated with all of these Ishmael types and Kane and Esau and lot
 and him and all of these figures actually are models of faith and trust in righteousness and they are not from the chosen mine the Bible does not have a clear black and white view of the election to be the elect does not mean to be the righteous and to be the non-elect does not mean that you were the wicked that interesting so there's a difference way God discern between the righteous and the wicked correct there you go not by lineage that's not by lineage your lineage doesn't Define your identity and association with God's family but the lineage is this vehicle of God's promise of the seed of the snake crushing seed in the blessing and the blessing is because most people associate the Hebrew Bible as Israelite literature which I just about got to cover
 with his real long and therefore it's Pro Israelite God is for Israel and against everybody else cuz they're the nachos and that's exactly the opposite of what the stories are trying to sell these for Israel he is but he's not for Israel in the sense of Peace for his promises I want to find better language to talk about this kind of new ideas I'm working out so God chooses one family from among the many so that they become the vehicle of blessing for the many however that means that every generation will have some non chosen family members and the people that God chooses often bring as much curse and violence is death and Division in does human story that's been on shows so what God is for and continuing his election
 of one isn't for these people at such it's that through these people he will bring a seat if you will crush the head of the steak and I think maybe it's because you know what are the brand new Christian I was introduced to the word election to have a meaning to tell us whether or not it whether or not God is going to rescue you save you to go to the good place after you die right if you take that part out and say okay with Bibles most risque then just die and go to heaven choosing you to be part of his family to be part of his plan to rescue the world or choosing you to be sorry choosing you to be trying to put this in language that I think I would have understood choosing to be saved save you now you could just mean go to heaven when you die but you could be more sophisticated say to be a part of uniting Heaven and Earth together
 sure to be a follower of Jesus is a sense of but that's how I understood being alive I've been elected I've been chosen to be a follower of Jesus and God in his foreknowledge was able to decide that that's kind of a Kubota category for me. So he's here he's choosing to bring his Blessing to The Many Nations through one family and even though this family is not morally or ethically superior to the other families in any way off and worse that's not the basis for God's choosing them nor is it the purpose is God's choosing them to just for the simple fact that he chose them you chose me because I bought them and there's always going to work with but that doesn't mean that all these other families are outside of the scope of God's mercy just the opposite they often produce the heroes and heroines of Israel story
 or even first they are the point of God collecting the rent to be to be blast and unity back in the image of God yeah but even in that plan it isn't so black-and-white was like okay where you at you got people over there out in the Nations who are corrupt and evil and wicked and I'm trying to forward the plan of God and then you've got the elect to our trust in God and are on a mission to try to be God's Partners in to make that Alex the whole world that's not the story represented correct it's that the God's elect are just as bad in the stories often times and also the people that you would think are the the bad guys out there they keep popping up in these narratives as actual Heroes and in the genealogy
 yeah that's right this is the David himself who's the icon of the Messianic hope least until the Bashi the failure is himself the product of a moabite the lion of Judah and the lion of Edom through Caleb so that the Messianic icon in the Hebrew Bible is himself made up of the whole family is Abraham not just the line through Jacob yeah there was there wasn't any sense in the assembling of this book it was a speedy stories of let's try to protect this this sense of dignity around this line yeah like yeah I was just reflect on that for a moment that this that propaganda literature was biblical scholarship of comments, sociological way of thinking about ancient literature that it's call identity serving informing and so the goal of this is to bolster our group identity as better than a distinct from all the others and this family
 literature definitely set this family apart among the nation's but in a way that elevates them as Superior on the surface it does seem to do on the surface you start scratching in your like this is there in a lot of dirty laundry here and it's a big indictment indictment of the family of Abraham and it's showing that even though they have a unique role among the nation's they believe that they are certainly not Superior to those other nations that this is the literature that reflects a group of people that believes that somehow despite their deep failures God is going I'm just thinking Hebrew Bible here like I don't like a Daniel something or the Amaya they believe that they are the people that the Creator God has chosen to bring blessing and rescue to the nation's but we have botched the job and the whole Human family has box the job and whether you're Israelite or mobile.
 matter in God's eyes. What matters is how you relate to him will you be like Ruth will you be like David will you be like Caleb will you be like J at all and your ethnicity doesn't determine your value in God's eyes what else is the story is the saying for a while but it surprised me it sounds like the message of the New Testament should be what you expected and now it's what I expected so the family of Abraham is huge it's made up of many nations and they all can't stand each other and they all constantly fight and trying to take each other stuff and territory again through yes the stories in the wilderness begins once again the land
 once you get into Joshua the stories of the all the Canaanites they're all Brothers once you get into judges all the oppressive Nations they're all Brothers all of them like all of that list we just read through earlier names almost every one of the bad guys that you'll meet in the story of Joshua Judges Samuel and kings and if you've been meditating on these chapters in Genesis and you get to that you're like these are all Brothers yes who are Menthol be the image of God together to close the step of our conversation with a pawn in the book of Isaiah
Isaiah's in. Where he's watching the sons of ham come and begin to attack Israel and Judah the Assyrians and he's Babylon on the horizon for All Sons of him and this is after the the tribes of Israel that are all Brothers have divided and I can't they're hostile with each other and so this is the famous poem and Isaiah chapter 2 we fed it before I'll let you read it but just think in light of the whole story that's for grounding the sibling rivalry in hostile brothers and sisters who can't get along think about how this poem land in that context is it you want for the word which Isaiah the son of a Famous Amos had to present the word which I almost saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem now it will come about that in the last days the mountain of the House of Yahweh will be established as the head of the mountains and he will be raised above the hills and all the nations will stream to it
 and many peoples will come and say come let us go up to the mountain of y'all way to the house of God of Jacob that he may teach us concerning his ways and that we may walk in his paths for the Torah will go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem and he will judge between the Nations and he will render decisions many peoples and they will Hammer their swords into plow blades and their Spears into pruning hooks Nation will not lift up sword against nation and never again will they learn War
 sounds nice so notice listening about the visual picture he's painting a visual metaphor here about a a hill and a city whose head is exalted high up to see that that mountain of the House of Yahweh will be the head of the Mountain Zion it's the antithesis of Babylon right they tried to make it themselves and put the head in the skies and now here's a city and a hill whose head is in a pie and contrasting Jerusalem with other mountains is kind of saying there's other gods and their ways and schemes but you always will be above them all so this is called the house of Yahweh the mountain The House of the god of Jacob so this is very much it's the one the one family science the city of David was from the tribe of Judah who's the Sun
 Jacob so this is the one the hill in the city and the temple of one family will become the source of divine peace and justice for The Many Nations this is Hope Farm takes the Genesis 12 concept as a given here right the one for the all the people's come there to learn God's ways and then this piece we're having a nursemaid the temple on top and then all of the nation's to pilgrimage up like the tribes of Israel would do you know what times a year but now it's all the nations doing pilgrimage and this is the picture we get in Revelation 21 and 22 with the New Jerusalem and all the names of all the nations come up to the gates yeah yeah that's right totally what usually happens when all the
 when they hook up together and meeting the place they usually so this is beautiful just from The Human Experience in general but within the Hebrew Bible when you get to Isaiah you've just read Genesis to Kings and it's just one long history of sibling hostility and War and this becomes such a Beacon of Hope City on a Hill City on a Hill where there's wisdom Divine Torah and wisdom that teaches people how to resolve resolve conflicts sounds like The Sermon on the Mount to me so that's pretty amazing it's pretty amazing hope to begin the book of Isaiah with his the book of Isaiah develops you're going to learn that ruling that house and City on the hill is a seed from the line of David a shoot from the line of David this in chapter 11 we read that poem many times he's endowed with the Sevenfold Spirit Sevenfold Spirit of Yahweh and then as you go on throughout the
 hope you realize that seed is actually going to call the one family's Jacob to follow him and they won't in fact they'll be hostile to their brother and they'll want to kill this one who tries to lead the people back to the Yahweh then here we get into the suffering servant Palms but suffering servant is going to give up his life for the sins of the many and then God's going to his life by showing him light after the grave at the end of Isaiah 53 and then the servant begins to speak up in the Poetry of later Isaiah and all of a sudden the future of the future seed and the future of that City on the hill become two ways to think about two ways two sides the same point so you get a poem like Isaiah 60 and we know Jesus loves 61 the next time he's called but I'm sure he loved this talk to even though he never said anything about it so I'm going to read it and we'll just we'll just see how this is bringing
 pieces together here is talking about the Vindication of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile
 the pill that says get up Shine for your light has come the glory of Yahweh has risen up over you for look Darkness covers the land think Genesis one here deep darkness is over the people's butt Yahweh will rise upon you and His glory will appear over you so God's it's another creates a new creation moment so there's Darkness over the nation's but God's going to become the light and that light will become a beacon verse three nations will come to your light Kings will come to the brightness of your Rising lift up your eyes look around see they that is the Nations and kings are gathering together all coming to you and your sons will come from afar your daughters carried in their arms to speaking to the diaspora of the family of Abraham.
 pattern among the nation's then you will see and you will glow be radiant your heart will thrill and rejoice because the abundance of the Seas will be turned to the wealth of the Nations will come to you you find out that you here is a city that's the New Jerusalem sitting on a hill at Sunrise and then down below are all the nations were coming bringing all of these exiled Israelites and bringing their whelps to come honor that way so a multitude of camels and they're like pack horses in the way of things about the wagon of Midian and those from Sheba will come oh yeah you know what those were the sons of Catra member I would never have died off of sons got sent away to the east
 now they're coming they're coming into yeah yeah bringing gold and frankincense that sounds familiar from the Wiseman yes exactly what the wise men bearing the gospel of the praise of Yahweh all the flocks of kedar will be gathered to you the ROMs of netbios who's that quick important search why am I being told about a guy named Nevaeh he's a son of Ishmael and they will offer up Rams that will be accepted on my Altar and glorify my house this whole poem is about the unification of the family of Abraham family that got divided in Genesis 25 is here being united the family is Abraham yo this is assuming all of the stuff that we've looked at and bring all those threads
 together we could go on but I'm just curious what's connecting in your mind well you brought out the uniting of the family of Abraham that was just one thing we got the development of does inception fracture that was like a fracture and it seems like this other Isaiah 2 is kind of about an all-night is the thing that started with Cain and Abel streaming up to the river ring up to Jerusalem and see how are we going to continue into the New Testament include observations the next step or going to take is going to be to how the story of Jesus and the apostles pick all this up if you just read you just see a size what we've done for it with the Hebrew Bible you get some pretty profound claims yeah. The family of God writes and about
 but actually what we didn't talk about which we have talked about outside of this conversation is Babylon we talked about we talk about the Tower of Babel you like what we did was we talked about the family of God but then we start talking about election and how just because God chose a family doesn't mean that they're more special or more righteous or Superior Warrior. Has the whole all the nations in mind and you see this and Isaiah to and Isaiah 60 but you see another places and you see it in this promise to Abraham it's all it's great just got to keep that in in the Forefront but this idea of this finding Unity among the Nations that doesn't seem to be on David's mind or know this truth it doesn't seem to be on so long the story doesn't seem to be
 that's the thing they don't have this charge in their heart about like the image of God needs to be protected by all of these nations were all brothers can't we all like instead it's kind of almost as justification of like I got to protect Israel cuz we're the chosen ones because they lost the plot or is that because we're in a different part of the story that has spoken different themes part of it's working out the I will bless those who bless you and those who curse you I will curse we're in the territory that I'm very much processing real time right now because the the the Hebrew Bible is subverting critiquing the family Abraham at the same time that's claiming to be the chosen family of God protects and then you're saying those two things
 can live together there's a visit there is a logic to that are Harmony to that end in the biblical narrative David didn't go on a peacemaking mission over to Moab in Amman what he went to go do a subjugate them you're only became king and made them his servants and when Israel would encounter these tribes they are cast as the wicked if I feel like it may be in sometimes sometimes sometimes it's of these unchosen brothers the moabites were the midianites who come and oppress and try to enslave this for lights and so it's so they're on the Israel's on the defensive and it's these other brothers who are the ones who were taking advantage but thought the tables are turned in to see Israelites who are the evil ones taking advantage of how these other so he goes all directions it's much more similar to when I enter the room of my
 boys and they're in a vicious fight with each other I love them both I expect more out of the older one cuz he's a little more developed and you and Siri can make wiser choices although I don't know but also I'm entering into a situation where their choices have already created the landscape that I as a parent can operate with them if I might have an ideal plan for all of a sudden realize like there's three hits in till like white and like all I need to do damage control and triage and that's much more the picture of how you always working out his purpose is adaptive Lee reacting to what's already happening on the ground which is why for example in the story of Abraham and we looked at a few conversations ago he defends Abraham as a liar you punishes the family of Egypt for Abraham's why that seems so screwed up but God
 made a promise and so now he's got to work within the framework of that promised and it's a non ideal situation I think there's something like that going on with all of the stories of God defending Israel even when they're really screwed up so big picture God's chosen this very non ideal family to be his vehicle a blessing to the nation's they've landed themselves in a heap Exile and hostility with all their brothers Isaiah has hope the seed will come from live Abraham to bring Unity to the fractured family of Abraham and the family of Adam and Eve and the Book of the story of Jesus story of Jesus Takes all of this for granted and just starts story of Jesus assuming that you kind of have uploaded all this so let's look at those stories thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast next week we're going to continue in this series on the fan
