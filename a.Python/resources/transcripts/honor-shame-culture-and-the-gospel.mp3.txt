welcome to the Bible project podcast in the middle of the series discussing how to read the New Testament letters these are letters written by the Apostles of Jesus sent to the early church reading these letters is like listening to one side of a phone conversation so don't understand them the kind of need to know who's on the other side of the phone who were these letters written to and today we're going to try to figure out what kind of world did they live in so by the time Jesus has resurrected and ascended the Roman Empire has been ruling over israel-palestine for about 60 years years what was it like to live in the first century under Roman occupation will this episode two ways that room shaped culture during the times of these letters the first if the socio-economic realities of the Roman Empire trying to imagine yourself packed Roman cities around the Mediterranean or mostly full of people who is just to survive
 but the vast majority as we'll talk about the honor and shame torture of the first-century Rome in the world the whole concept of a human to finding their value not by a relation to their group for family this is one of the most radical realities of the Gospel that broke into the human history in the Jesus to its take a trip to the first century and get into the skin the first people to read the New Testament letters
we are talking about how to read a section of the Bible which are letters letters from the apostles the apostles who have first-hand experience of Jesus and his teachings and who are shaped by him and then our commission to go in and spread the good news that Jesus is King of the universe is Lord and to do that take this Messianic Jewish experience and then bring it to people of all other cultures and as they do that we get at we get a narrative of of them doing that in the book of Acts which is a kind of second part of Gospel of Luke but then we have all these letters that they written to all these churches that they've helped start and that's what we're talking about here how do you read those letters and we really spend a lot of time just talking about the fact they are letters and how that's unique in the Bible
 there's a couple in the Hebrew Bible if you letter a letter from Jeremiah Babylon narrative contacts directly here in the New Testament The Narrative context is act we're supposed to do then this kind of plug the letters into somewhere in the to the narrative framework Max so we know the narrative contacts in the whole story of the Bible this is post-resurrection Jesus the Fulfillment of the partnership that humans are supposed to have with God that we can now join and ReDiscover and that it's going to all the nations which was the idea about God's partnership in the first place that's right and this message in the story doesn't fit into categories that we have in the modern west of religion is religion was religious topics and issues then there's political Topics in the shoes of namik or socialist
 is it all of the other this religious message is that one that a Jewish man is the embodiment of the Creator God exalted as the king of the Nations and All Nations need to give their loyalty to him an outrageous thing to this story sounded especially if they weren't familiar with the Jewish Tradition at all so it's like what we would call a religious message that has political economic and social consequences and the political social economic context of all of this was the Roman Empire the first big contacts is where in the Bible the second contacts that you can apply to any part of the Bible is what was the actual cultural socio-economic contacts that was written in to kind of help give
 I sense of economy place in time and this is specifically helpful in the letters because the letters are your listening to half of a correspondence attracts a year you have to fill in a lot of gaps still in why did they say what they say what are the issues that they are dressing in the cultural context it's just very similar to if you read your great-grandpa's letter collection but let's say these were all said he was in World War Two from you know some place in Europe you know I'll get it if you want understand that and claim to understand them and tell other people about them before I feel you're obligated to understand what was happening right there on the ground what trench warfare was like yep at what moment in the war so you can understand why he says what he says and it's no different with the letters so we need to understand at least something of the cult
 dynamics of the Roman Empire around the Mediterranean the first century and this is a whole did amazing stuff and parts of the letters will shine with new brilliant white and meaning when we see them in a contacts
 who's paint broad brush is here the Roman Empire by the time Jesus sends out the apostles right in the early thirties ID and then the book of texts you know tracking was about two decades esch of their the Jesus movement so by the time Jesus has resurrected and ascended the Roman Empire has been ruling over israel-palestine for about 60 years years by the time that the book of Acts and somewhere in the 50s you know they're now 20 years of 80 years so relatively recent in terms of the history of ancient empires yeah I know how that long how long that sounds to anybody listening sitting in at the end of the book of Acts under house arrest in Rome you're sitting in the capital of an Empire who became ruler over Israel Palestine the same way that we would look back same time as to World War Two recent memory or World War II
 so the Roman Empire had been around before it wasn't an Empire who is Republic and this is I'm not a Roman History X. So the Roman culture and people have a history of the prelates this is like Greco-Roman culture correct so Greco mean in Greek the Greek and Roman so Alexander the Great. Specie storms from Grease all the way to India just taken charge charge to bring the whole Known World under the sway of his culture and their power and this was called the Hellenism based on the Greek word on this day is the Greek word for Greek Greek gods Greek culture gymnasiums of life
 from the third 300 on Grease the culture of Greece permeate sores every without whole part of the world the Romans inherit the scoop up after Alexander the Great power tractors across the whole span of territory and it's just pout Regional power games all over Alexander the Great's territories Rose Game of Thrones in the forties and thirties all of the great events surrounding the transition of the Roman Republic to an Empire and Octavia and then I'll go read Wikipedia BC you've got a Roman Emperor and he's a certain his authority and all of the territory again from Greece and Rome new power structure
 culture is Greek is Greek when I do with it and the same yeah it's very similar to how you could call it the way you can talk about England and America in a way England America is not America in offshoot of rebellious colonies we got their culture but we have our own power structure so what America is the England is similar to what Rome was to Greece
 so I'll buy the first century the good news of Caesar Augustus has spread around the world and on coins roads festivals gymnasiums being built in every city there's a whole a Colt not in our modern sense of the word but in actual religion of the emperor celebrating him as the Incarnation of you know the ultimate divine power bi and drown you can go offer sacrifices to the deified emperor throughout specially in the eastern part of the Empire throughout the first century so this is this is reality can you call the emperor Savior and Lord and Master Roman culture was ubiquitous inescapable reality Michael Gordmans amazing introduction to Paul's letters is called Apostle of the crucified Lord a theological introduction to Paul sweaters the first hundred pages is just roaming
 call and Jewish culture in the setting of Paul's letters and buy that just dies for a Jewish Community spread throughout the ancient world culture brought infrastructure with the Roman Empire brought courts the court system of infrastructure Road system economic Unity through roads and the Navy and the all of the economic fleets Now using the Mediterranean in the highway for goods and grain so that you know there were lots of upsides to it I guess if you're into the vampire kind of thing but Gorman this is where it says brother Iz a Darkside to Rome's piece that should not be forgotten the Romans established and maintained their end
 fire through Conquest subjugation and intimidation it was another words peace through war and security via domination the Romans invaded and enslaved they moved the Concord in and out they formed new qualities they re founded old Greek cities as their own colonies they impose taxes and tributes to maintain the Empire and its peace among the subjugated and they had a deterrent to make sure that anyone who threatened this piece understood the consequences crucifixion so a very small number of people are going to see in a moment actually got to enjoy the full benefits of the Roman Empire most people what they knew of the Roman Empire was the face of Roman legionaries who will break your kneecaps if you don't pay your taxes and and then people you've never met who keep buying up your ancestral land
 or forcing you to move off of your land and go be relocated to some other place cuz somebody is appropriating your land and going to build a gymnasium thing so there are many analogies to Empire survives history it's like a world Empire runs the world what percentage of people got to enjoy the benefits of the oppressed let's talk about this so this is another quote from Gorman and a really helpful the pie diagram in charging so put the chart in the show notes in Michael garman's book but it's his adaptation of a social theorist who is trying to understand the Dynamics of class in the Roman Empire I got a scholar named Gerhard lenski so I'll just everything was kind of a longest quote if you look at the picture it looks like what do you say like a pyramid, like a pyramid looks like an arrowhead okay better
 Arrowhead so it has a very sharp long tip at the top of the tip is the Emperor yeah and then coming down from the tip is a class of its the power and privilege scale so it's actually a very narrow group of people who get to participate in the top-level Elite Class once you brought an out to the far distant edges of the arrowhead you have the vast majority of population of the Roman Empire on the y-axis is how many people are in that part of the class is right and the x-axis is how much power that class has that's right the vertical access up and down is power and privilege privilege the horizontal how wide it is is about numbers of people population has really thin slice of the governing class which has all the power there's a very few many people I mean it's just it's just a
 in line and Rec graph the threat so the Roman hierarchical Arrangement power was concentrated at the top at the Pinnacle was the emperor benisim were the Senators then the equestrians a class of high-ranking military and political figures after them are the Koreans who are Aristocrats with land and other kinds of wealth but only local political power that's what's called the governing class OK a senator's equestrians in decorations supporting this small governing class was a network of retainers that is political and religious officials like priests or government functionaries who kept the Machinery of power running and attended to the needs of the elite this entire group composed about 3% of the population so you know there's a there's people talk about the 1% or 5% or
 do in Rome we talked about 3% 3 % possess the majority of the wealth and then described as hell in that one lines governing class retainers in there you see the governing class going down and then there's no there's a retainers yeah retainers and Priests yep to come further down the tower are people of some means to have welts but no political power like Merchants are successful Artisans a successful statue Carver and purple cloth you know it different ports but no one like you have no connections and no power in Rome and you're never going to so he says these were not like with westerners call the middle class cuz they did exist in the middle in terms of power and privilege yeah there's nothing like representative political structures or institutions like Republicans or
 Publix half so they just exist and called it a republic do you say it was called the middle group constituted anywhere from five to 15% of the populace depended on the city and the region the bottom line is that the remaining 85% consisted of working lower-class slaves were free persons like Artisans Craftsman's Merchants below them are the Working Poor and day laborers at the very bottom are The Expendables namely those without any status or wealth or skills to contribute value to those around them widows orphans prisoners Baggers anyone with physical disabilities so you can see from this that for the vast majority of the population the main priority was to play Survival so this is different than the culture I grew up in has a huge middle class
 and the middle class there is her stop for middle class and then there's you know what sociologists call two working for like in American culture which is people who are able to provide basic sustainable living for a family but they're only one disaster medical emergency away from going under so that's from the middle of her class down to the Working Poor that's a big part of the American population and in Rome that's a smaller middle and the majority of people you're saying that middle is like the five 15% correct that's right the majority of the Roman Empire would be what we might call the Working Poor or just people living in poverty poverty and just surviving the vast majority for just trying to imagine yourself into that packed Roman cities around the Mediterranean
 I'm mostly full of people who are just surviving does the vast majority has lots of countries and cultures on planet Earth right now but that's the name of the game there many cities and towns even in America or Europe or that's the economic social reality so it's not altogether different you know but it's imagine 3% control everything yeah and in a different way we talked about the 1% that became a meme in that if you look at where wealth is distributed this is about wealth and power in the modern world we've done better at this tributing power even if in the last few decades wealth has really been yeah consolidate Saleh dating power has as well but not as if you do not as much like we still do have
 a lot of ability to to shape things even if we're not in the ruling class so that maybe the where westerners we have to use our imaginations is same consolidation of wealth among a very small group but also it's an Empire it's a dictatorship and so it's a very small small group of people who actually can't make any decisions that affect reality and how things are run so just psychologically that people who have grown up in dictatorships you know that does something you psychologically whereas westerners tend to have a feeling of we can change it we can be the difference where I imagine growing up in a culture where do you mean you're going to make a difference in how ridiculous
 it's interesting I think a lot of people would say I don't feel empowered to actually make a difference there is still a difference when you grow up in a cultural setting which people do you have that thought and belief even if you don't personally but didn't grow up in a setting where just it's not even on the radar it's not a possibility yeah no one sitting around going like well maybe we can hit the our it's this crazy radical is living in the mountains in like yeah yeah right trying to create some sort of militia or something and they're probably going to go down I don't have the imaginative framework for this to imagine how the announcement of the Apostles with dents found in this context like in thessalonica in Acts 17 people are going around saying there is another King Jesus and they started these communities where everybody calls each other brother and sister and they're all sharing their stuff and taking care of the poor
 I mean just there wasn't anybody doing this kind of thing when you said it's a dictatorship what I thought of immediately was well then so is the gospel you've got a kink yes and it's friend but you look at this Roman emperor empire and then the way the powers distributed is very skewed been so what's the difference with the kingdom of God is at the power is distributed differently yeah it's that diagram turned upside down first will be last what are the titles for our King is the slave the servant of the Lord the suffering servant of Isaiah come to be served but to be the slave and to get my life as a ransom for many the gift of being included in the family of the Messiah is given without regard to
 someone's placement on this power and rank scale which is why a slave owner and a slave and an orphan and a merchant and a whatever City Commissioner and the tentmaker all sit at the same table and treat each other as of equal value on Resurrection Sunday when they take the present cup it's a redefinition of Power with very social implications for people will fly us out a little bit more and we're just kind of paint the picture to the point here was to paint the power and wealth was distributed stupid an organized
 let's just touch down on a few cultural realities in the setting to the are helpful categories have been hugely helpful for me and understanding the letters and why the apostles right the way that they're right so one with people call honor honor and shame Dynamics honor and shame cultures I've heard this a lot but after you can a plugged it in the last episode and said I I won't be able to understand that I'm like huh I wonder if I really do understand it but it's a work of sympathetic imagination his whole chapter on it and fourth grade bibliography if you want to follow the rabbit hole kept on this one he says simply to find honor and shame refer to the ongoing attribution or loss of esteem by one's peers Family Social
 City and so on in Roman society this respect or steam was based primarily on such things as wealth education rhetorical skill a good of a public speaker you are family pedigree and political connections these were Roman cultures status indicators in this context self-esteem would be conceived as a ridiculous oxymoron team that one has is bestowed not by the self but by the group in this environment. Pressure is not something negative to be avoided it's appropriate and welcome so here's one thing I've discovered over the years is that the Western culture is our Amex almost like a strange contradictory mix of some honor shame elements
 Dynamics and self-esteem is a great example yes I think so real and this is me as a kid self esteem you have value no matter what anyone thinks about you do your own thing don't let other people to find you discover yourself you do you do you and this is in the in the water at least modern agriculture in the 21st century yeah this is pervasive this is what defines a good that would have been unheard of ridiculous in a 100 years ago so this is a modern movement people call all kinds of things no matter what anyone says or thinks it's the only thing that really matters is where your tribute yourself what you tribute to self if other people don't understand who you are. Forget them doesn't matter just think of every Disney movie
 and it would have sounded ridiculous and does sound ridiculous I mean American culture on this angle looks expensive ridiculous and misguided history and culture and looks really dangerous to a lot of people in traditional cultures around the world but we do a value inherit regardless of any social economic or political system where the grown up in more traditional honor shame culture and it can get the store today to get ugly helpful but yeah I think the whole concept of a human defining their value not by a relation to their group or family this is one of the most radical realities of the Gospel that broke into human history
 and the Jesus movement what is the idea that humans value is not defined by the group or their family for that for that in the Roman World correct yeah it would just sound crazy and Gorman brings up self-esteem where the gospel is going is that you have Divine the steam rights as an image of God and Jesus died that's what gives you your Altima value and your value as defined by your Creator and what your creator has done for you and Jesus so that's not self-esteem either but that is a gateway into the world vocabulary about a steam reputation being recognized this is very standard vocabulary and it's what you're trained from the earliest memories to get up on that scale
 do whatever you can to get up on the power privilege scale really there wasn't just a sense of where I am if I'm stuck well if you're a slave even if you've been freed you're always still marked you have a great clear ceiling in the on the prankster is it that's another thing about the modern world is there's more fluidity of how you can move up and down the social rank scale where I'm sure there's stories of people moving up and down in the ancient world yet I just would have been very very rare yeah less common more difficult and for some people it's like the caste system you have a clear ceiling yes because of your family and if you've ever been enslaved you related to that what are the Greek words on a shame vocabulary is this word of Greek word which means to recognize or to recognize someone as a value
 steam steam someone to recognize their honor this is the root word for the Greek word doxa which gets translated in our Modern English translation says Glory but from Dhaka to be recognized to have Ducks as a means to be recognized what I started to do is everytime I see the word glory in the New Testament to insert the word honor and it will really make some familiar passages pop with a new significance because it's about your rank this is a rank a social rank in the first century that's different than how covid in Hebrew what is related in Hebrew means heavy heaviness your significance does overlap what's interesting is that the Greek word ducks a comes from how you are perceived the word means how you are recognized by others so they have Ducks igloo
 it means I am perceived as having social rank in the eyes of people looking at me in the Septuagint is covered trailer doxa correct often so Verse 18 says Paul saying I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the Ducks are that is going to be revealed in us so this is the founder of A persecuted religious minority group writing to other members of the persecuted minority religious group sang that listen life is hard and your neighbors think you're stupid and crazy and you might lose your job you might you know this kind of stuff and in the Empire of this world you still are you are you as having no status. And you're suffering just is this like reminder if you lots and lots of that fact that your status is low that's right
 call says a biblical story so that actually Divine doxa is going to be revealed in us so Cosmic Divine status and honor is actually our future Migos into the story talking retelling the story is that he Revival the creation itself is in a state of longing anticipation for what he says the apocalypse the revealing of the children of God creation right now is in a phase of futility of human rulers for the human rulers children this is what we're looking forward to verse 21 is for creation to be liberated Exodus language from its slavery to corruption and mortality and to obtain the freedom of the Duck Say of the children of God
 so Genesis one male and female ruling is God's Divine image over all creation is the ultimate ultimate state of ducks a glory and creation is waiting for humans to become what God made them to be kings and queens of all creation and he says that's what's waiting for us so what if you were to read the word honor they're so let's reread that I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worth comparing with the honor that's going to be revealed in us-421 creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the honor of the children of God
 you know this reading would be really dangerous to stress of Trish and I grew up in there is and it's actually connected to this idea of a self-esteem movement which is if we have too much self-esteem then that's our problem we need to not think of ourselves as a high so and it's all about God has honor I'm just lucky he's putting up with me and anything beyond that is dangerously getting into worship of like ourselves even came up to us during the I was talking to someone at the Life podcast she gave him more of a New Age movement one of the things that she said was kind of dangerous was the sensitive kind of self-glorification which I think she met was kind of this entitlement disconnected from from God and to that degree
 that's dangerous anyways that's not what this is talking about here we're back to the image of God humans are meant to be glorious honored creatures of the highest-ranked not because of something inherent within themselves but because of the gift of existence and divine image bearing that God has given us and at what age does this bear witness to the honor of the one whom the image represent and the one whom we represent is the one whose honor was displayed when he was crucified as a criminal here so this is from movie the poem in Philippines to is another good example there's some people that don't like each other and not getting along very well in the house churches of Phillipi the Paul rights to them at multiple points he's trying to get them to be unified encouragement in the Messiah if you
 received any comfort from his love if you are participating in what the spirit is up to in your midst if you have any affection for each other if you have any sympathy if you care about each other at all make my joy complete by having a unified mindset and having the same love don't do anything out of selfish ambition and humility treat people is more important than yourself than a Spivey says have this mindset namely the mindset of Messiah Jesus and then the spam at the pump and Yuri tells the story of Jesus he was one with God but he didn't exploit his status rather he gave it up became a slave even more than a slave he became obedient to the humiliating death of the Cross Force nine therefore God has hyper exalted him giving him the name the name you give Jesus the name Yahweh
 so that at the name of Jesus every knee vows and Heaven on Earth and under the Earth and every tongue confess that the Jesus Messiah is Yahweh to the Ducks are of God the Father wait so that were there it says Lord Lord yes then they would hear pulse laser Jesus is the true Emperor and recognized as an emperor is the way that I give doxa honor to God the Father so-called father has a point as a son as his second self as the true Emperor and incarnation of divinity and by worshiping and giving my believing loyalty to Jesus I am a steaming giving ultimate honor to God and
 is about Jesus being exhausted to a place of honor over having a nurse that's the ultimate type of language in in Roman culture talk about exaltation set the point is the unashamed society language of rank of status of Honor esteem this is fundamental to the cultural worldview it's everywhere in the letters I guess it kind of shows to like the power of adoption how powerful that is in the fact that like if you were if you were adopted by someone with power in the Roman world or just an ancient world some of your life changes not just that you have nicer things till like play with us up now but you're at your honor that's right chefs family pedigree is one of the most important status it's right to be a sibling of the emperor
 weather in sisters in the family of the Messiah no different than saying your brother or sister of the emperor that's the point the real emperor is Jesus Messiah and yeah all the sibling language in the New Testament this was a scholar Joe Joseph Heller men with this great study of sibling language in the letters called when the church was a family and not in like American Pie type of family you know where the church was a family in small-town America Way the people created with use the sprays fictive kinship groups calling each other brother and sister and then understanding that the the leader of their group Jesus Messiah was their brother
 truly remarkable
 what the honors same Dynamic illuminates is the way that group value works in the New Testament in the letter to the Corinthians Paul at multiple points and looks this awkward there's a guy sleeping with his mother-in-law 1st Corinthians 5 and he says listen all of your room and neighbors even think this is terrible and I wouldn't even dream of doing something like this so he knows how severe is he excommunicates the guy from the church and we look at that and that severe but it on or shame culture one person's misbehavior can endanger the whole group by association it's the same thing as having like a proverbial black sheep among the kids in the family and honor shame Society Black Sheep child can bring dishonor to the whole family by whatever not pursuing the family trade or becoming a musician then
 you know to me this is so foreign to imagine group value being more important than individual value that's dreams and aspirations the honor and reputation of my family or my group is more important than my individual fulfillment desires dreams reputation so this is the historical context that said so that is two things for me right now what is it helps you understand a word like Lori and then so maybe brings more texture to some of these passages but that second example of Paul excommunicating the guy in Corinth he was doing something so shameful even just regular Roman god worship being neighbors would be disgusted that the result of that was excommunication yes so I guess I'm a question would become is honor shame how is it connected to the gospel in terms of
 the chews apples that one is that we're all given honor because of what Jesus did but then there's also this will then how do you do church or none of you live together in unity in the courts are your and if you're in an honor shame culture you might act differently at what I'm saying is what the apostolic letters are is the gospel being applied in an honor shame culture correct so modern westerners will have a more difficult time really understanding the letters cuz we don't share that cultural context I was just talking to a pastor is an Indian Pastor recently and we were just talking about this very Dynamic he was saying it's so much easier for him to read and talk about the letters of the New Testament in his church because it's an older shame culture culture and so just Sergio. The same things totally so
 it's people who live in modern Western individualistic cultures to Christians where the disadvantaged should Jesus followers than try to create Coulter to be ownership okay all right so now we're to it is exactly the issue another words the culture cultural context shaped how the apostles talked how they argue how they value you say persuade people and their solution to the problem to a solution to the problems are solutions in honor shame culture and so then the question will be I don't live in a culture so do I create new solution or do I fight for recreating an owner shame culture what is it is actually inspired by the spirit here is it the cultural setting or is it the story and I get to watch them apply it in a different cultural setting but the way that the spirit is going to work out the lordship of Jesus and the creation of
 families of siblings here in Portland where we live it's going to have to require different strategies and to me that seems to be at this is called being a missionary I only took one class on cross cultural Ministry in college, Theology and a lot of it was about like comparative anthropology and sociology just learning how to understand a culture and its story and values and that how the story of Jesus challenges certain things and overlaps with other things will differ from culture to culture but this is a big challenge in the history of the church trying to understand the New Testament letters is just this the way that gender or slavery is dealt with in the letters and the different groups and denominations differ and how they read and understand those things today is often do to this core difference of what the letters are in about an hour will be appropriate time today because the closer
 Big Country live in resembles the culture of first-century Roman world the easier it is to just copy and paste and letters into your setting oh we have something going on let's just do it just copy what Paul said for this church to do further away you get culturally the harder that becomes correct and so there's this impetus to then say well then let's just try to consider of the culture that they had so that we can then no it's easier if we can know what to do and then there's some confusion about preserving the culture or we preserving God's desire for human flourishing and those two things become conflated body parts then we have are some on why interpretation of the letters is such a denominational a divisive issue in the history of the Christian church at least the Protestant Reformation
 why do we have a million different denomination a lot of it seriously much of it is based on are pre-loaded assumptions about how we appropriate the New Testament letters now doesn't the kingdom of God create a culture that we should desire and part of quote-unquote culture war is assuming that exists and then try to realize that a culture where you talking about in America that's an American kind of thing yeah but yeah so it's by culture or its Christian saying this is how cold should exist to glorify God so we're going to fight all these cultural battles where another way to think about it is I'm going to come into my culture as a missionary how does this culture working and now how can the gospel truth now yes but then also a firm and Challenge and reshape the Queens are from it when we shake them but the story of the gospel and maybe those two things shouldn't
 feel so different there's an example I think in honor shame culture Paul's gospel was incredibly scandalous because it disrupted the social ladder of rank and value and created what we westerners look back on and see as though he was about equality and it's like well that's not how he would have imagined it for him it was just the gift of God's grace comes to every person regardless of who they are and puts them at the same place of value before the cree and that's different than what we think of it as equality Liberty equality we've got a quality is loaded with a different story and worldview for anybody living after the French Revolution what's the quick version oh well I mean in history of the French Revolution it was a quality that is for white males right and so that's of course the Legacy that's getting shaking a new ways with each generation now
 Brett and it's also very much bound up with a deist worldview and the story about God as a clockmaker who said the universe to work and then he's out but it's just different different setting my point is just an honor shame culture the disruption of the social rank scale was what was most scandalous my modern Western individualist self esteem self therapeutic culture it's going to be actually the opposite I think it's going to be live the gospel challenges the way that I have exist within a community yeah it's going to challenge The Narrative that I'm an island unto myself right now that I can realize my full all my dreams and my potential by disassociating myself from value from other group it's going to be about my value comes from that I am up brother you have the emperor somebody's brother and sister whether it's my actual family or some other group so the same story
 we'll have to do very different types of challenges they are the different cultures the New Testament was written in honor shame culture and so we get lots of case studies of how that worked out the necessary mean that those exact strategies should be applied across the board it depends on the culture now we're back to the letters as snapshots of the first generation working out the gospel in a Greco-Roman honor shame culture thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast if you'd like to submit a question for upcoming question response podcast on the series we love to hear from you record yourself asking the question and email that recording to info at bible project. Calm keep the question to about 20 or 30 seconds let us know your name where you're from and if you can also in the email that you sent it transcribe your audio so it's easier for us to sift through them that would be wonderful next week
 going to continue to talk about the context of the New Testament Letters by looking at their situational context what were the specific issues of the early church had that the apostles were dressing stop reading the letters as a grab bag of inspiring verses I think that's not a helpful practice however if once you read through the whole letter and understand how it all works there will be certain lines that popped into reading in context in the situation in context doesn't prevent you from having a spirit Bible verses what it will do is actually help you understand anymore today show is produced by Dan double Donut Star by Camden McAfee Warcraft by the nonprofit in Portland Oregon we make free resources to experience the Bible as a unified story that leaves you can find everything that was made on our website Bible project.com it's all for free because of the generosity of thousands of people just like you to pitch in and make this project possible thanks
