hi this is John from Bible project and we are in the third episode in a series about what kind of literature the Bible is we're calling this the Paradigm Series in the last episode we looked at the Orthodox view that the Bible is both human and divine today we're going to look at how the Bible is actually many different Scrolls that all together hell one unified story so who wrote the Scrolls and made them so elegantly hell one unified story who wrote the Bible now if you take a normal day like Moby Dick and you ask who wrote it will Baptist easy Herman Melville it took an 18 months back in 1850 who wrote One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish dr. Seuss who wrote Dark Matter that's actually a pretty fun Quantum sci-fi thriller by Blake Crouch this is easy right so who wrote the Scrolls we find in the Bible ancient literature in general
 and then biblical literature as an example has a different kind of authorial History than we imagined it today it's traditional literature if it's Community traditional literature just mean it was written by anybody and everybody but it was literature that was studied attitude compiled reshaped over the course of many generations and that's a part of its origin that I think differently I always keep a box today describes take oral Traditions Priestly manuals ancient law codes ancient poems all the stories and then put them together into the form we have today the final form is he reliable is a lot like a museum exhibit where all these diverse materials have been brought together in a very curated design and experience what did Moses write the first books of the Bible and a squirrel like Jeremiah that was simply written by Jeremiah right so we don't encounter the Hebrew Bible in the Forum
 of what Moses was riding in the wilderness or what Isaiah was like right or Jeremiah were riding what we have is a highly polished interconnected Museum exhibit created by a set of hands at the very end of the process that have like created a Polish or a glazed over the whole thing to make it unified today on the show the scribes who created the unified set of squirrels that tell the unified story that leads to Jesus thanks for joining us here we go
okay we are in the beginnings of a new series on the Paradigm that we use a Bible project the Paradigm for how we view the Bible it says a very kind of foundational stuff that were talking about and so no I'm here with Tim Mackie and Carissa Quinn conversations the first conversation we just talked about what is a paradigm and what are three unhelpful paradigms that have good intuition But ultimately kind of leave the Bible flatter than it should be try to make it do things that it wasn't quite designed to do and then in the second episode we talked about the first attribute of the Paradigm we've broken down the pear Diamond to seven attributes everywhere we go to use the first one is that it is both human and divine has a big conversation about God using humans and Bible not
 made in spite of humans but in collaboration with intelligent human beings yes and we'll talk about that more after this episode actually it's probably a good kind of way to to lay some tracks to kind of been talked about then how was this collection of their try to come together why was it designed the way it was and this whole like group of brilliant Jewish scribes and Scholars who like warm the stuff that the Bible is a unified piece of literature you know it's just going to be another way to intro this I'm remembering us from our conversations in the first one isn't that many ways the series on the Paradigm we used to explore the Bible it's an unpacking of our shorthand.
 tag line which is our mission statement as long as they can we exist to help people experience the Bible as a unified Story the least Jesus and that little and phrases that unified story least Jesus there's a paradigm built into that little phrase what do you mean by that statement is also the approach and the methodology for how reading scripture is pretty cool because I know for ourselves and also our audience who are finding that they resonate with the work that were putting out there this is bringing a lot of clarity I think in definition to power reading and it's not our part I am it's what we think the biblical authors Paradigm is and how the Bible wants us if I can afford Spotify it to read itself how do Jesus read the Bible how the apostles read the Bible every project we're trying to recover a paradigm that tends to be obscured
 undecided right away to read intro on top of your thing to it but then we really think about it okay what do you really mean and I've heard a lot of other phrases being used like it's Jewish meditation literature its wisdom literature like all of this stuff it's easy for me to just my brain to start getting kind of mushy and be like what are we talkin what are we really talking about so this is the next step. It's that it's unified literature story Jesus what do we mean by unified John and Chrissa because the Bible isn't just like a normal book A Normal book that I'm used to you know one author
 Arco office sure they're really working together contemporaneously at the same time end or a thesis and what the Bible is actually a collection of a bunch of different authors or cloud rhaetian of a bunch of authors then bringing it into this big and I can thaw leje Scrolls and so if that's the case then is there any Rhyme or Reason to how this is all put together and the conviction is that there is a lot of unification yeah that's what I understand so far when I hear unified I think of the word coherence it's a coherent story so it's there's one story there's even maybe a narrative thread through that entire story but that is really hard to Fathom when we're talking about so many different authors over a Long Long Trailer Tires yeah yeah
 yeah that's what we did craft a sentence to try and summarize the sentence that we crafted the Bible has many authors many literary Styles and money seems but it is telling one story about God's Rescue of humanity to be as partners in ruling the world so there it's a diverse collection with lots of minis different off there's many different books and Scrolls scroll contains a variety of literary Styles and topics are themes and styles you mean narrative discourse Proverbs it's a collection that's diverse but it has been unified in a couple of important ways wind is what you could say is the editorial or compositional unity in the same way an author could bring to create an anthology authors often do this different fields
 a philosophy will collect some of the key I say is a important father has taught history and then bring them together and then write introductions and conclusions and thology so that's a diverse work was diverse authors in Origins but it's been brought together under one unified whole and interesting about that example is that all the literary style that can be very similar they're all just like philosophical like probably but it's such an Eclectic yes and Halle g a few more like an art project a little bit harder for us because we're not really used to sing that kind of an anthology woke up so I think the two ways to talk about the unity of the Bible one is this anthological there's an editorial anthological Unity to it on one level and we can talk about that but then is off
 so unified in terms of its content that there is a governing narrative from beginning to end that isn't like an organizing principle and that's where like if you went to some sort of art show that had an overall bike theme but there's projections on the wall and this paintings and if someone doing spoken word and so it's like feels very eclectic but there's like a common motifs and ideas that are recurrence when you're done there is a sense of coherent the Bible kind of does that as well as like many Millennia of history and cultural artifacts but in one building you can be taken on a tour that it's itself and ontology of artifacts from different times and parts that people's history and so on and so on Sala G of literature from a particular people group ancient Israel but it has been brought together editorial
 and it's unified terms of its content and seen this truck me to do that when we say the Bible's unified literature we were taking for granted is that it is an Eclectic Anthology I think a lot of people don't maybe realize that when they open the Bible that they're actually coming to a library of many different Scrolls written different literary style post right now so let's just say you open a Bible and you looking table contents you'll see there's two major collections in a Christian Bible Protestant Catholic or Orthodox Bible office to main sections one called the Old Testament that we call usually the Hebrew Bible in our conversations and then the New Testament and it's helpful to understand the unity of the Bible it's helpful in my mind to separate those two Collections and cuz they each have a unique formation history that is a little bit different just so top of in my mind to separate them out and talk a little bit about the editorial unity in history of the Hebrew Bible or Bible to collection
 go to collections each with a different formation history but one governing narrative that spans both Collections and why would you say it's important to understand the formation history to understand how did that thing to relate well how you imagine but then came into being will affect how you interact with it especially with collection so if I think of the Hebrew Bible this for example cuz it's the bigger one the bigger collection as an anthology but anthologies can be really taken the unified the fact that they brought together under one collection recover but they can still be super divers and unrelated like an anthology of philosophers only has in common that they're all flustered the Hebrew Bible has unified in a much more thorough embracive way yes and it's unified even in ways that I never I am still like coming to reckon with
 you are reading this thing obsessively for the last 20 plus years and it's more unified than I ever realized and that many people feel it came together and help us see that if I understand that and also help us understand it's not just like Divine document that dropped out of Heaven as this unified let's take a quick come serve a tour of the formation of the Hebrew Bible as a way to talk about how it's been brought into the unity in the form we have it and then we talked about formation and unity of the New Testament and then I think the first Thursday after that it's a talk about the governing narrative that unifies both collections even listen to One medical action
okay so the Hebrew Bible so depending on the form in which you encounter the Old Testament whether it's in a Protestant Bible the Catholic Bible in Orthodox Bible or a Jewish Bible there's going to be a different number of books and your table of contents for the Old Testament exit the moment I'm saying this opening a can for a whole other podcast series that we need to do and should do at some point right but that I don't think that but we actually kind of explain a little bit of it in the how to read the Bible app so to the Bible quick review of why there's some of the folks in other Traditions even in the Hebrew Bible there's two things going on one is that some traditions have what's called a dude your Canon here let's reverse the timeline let's go back and do it from oldest to be the Jewish Hebrew Bible
 Tanaka what is an acronym for Tara which means law instruction nevi'im which means profits and then catch a movie in which is the writing's so same books as a Protestant Bible different order on different groupings for the Hebrew Bible has twenty-four separate Scrolls that have been organized together and have to read those three parts you just named if you look at a product and Old Testament it's the same the same book same books but they have been divided up differently so that you get a total of 39 example and I guess I didn't even really really realize it until recently the 12 Minor Prophets are all separate books in the Protestant Old Testament correct there one scroll is one scrawled in the Hebrew Bible and importantly so cuz they belong to it a section called the latter profits which is three big prophetic Scrolls and they're too
 Ezekiel + 12 + 3 + 12 is itself an imitation of the three plus 12 nature of the story of the Patriarchs in Genesis how many structures of how depending on ordering and even the other discrepancies is like 1st 2nd Samuel yeah it's just for Samuel 24:10 in the three-part shape is the design of the Hebrew Bible in its original form and that's the form that Jesus refers to add any call him to tour in the prophets and the Psalms of the collection was referred to in the Dead Sea scroll community that the exact same Moses the prophet and David Josephus prefers to this three-part organization
 in the Psalms is representing all of the writings but it's just the book shorthand writing start with has a distinct origin in the history of the people that are like a museum exhibit Egypt room will come from a different maybe. Focus on different characters and so the literature was growing and accumulating all throughout over like over the holy Scrolls that they were like writing and reading and work tonight versus of the material that we find in the biblical Scrolls is often referred to in the Bible tell me a poem and numbers and it comes from the scroll of your sharp or the author Chronicles is constantly quoting all these sources that are found nowhere in the Hebrew Bible is how I got this from the Scrolls of The Chronicles of the Kings
 so yeah I can see Revival is a selection of a much larger literary tradition of ancient Israel Jewish literature even know right isn't there like a a few things are come from the neighboring yeah I mean it's hard to know the pendants wise but there was some parts of a of a well but they're sorry not important their work is important in the same way that knitology can collect related things that are important but that may be began are at the origin Point outside the national boundaries of Israel but has been Incorporated in Psalm 29 actually is often cited as a well-known example because I have so much overlap with
 handful of King night poems materials in tonight literature origination is it still becomes part of the unified Anthology and becomes part of this stream of Jewish literature a Jewish tradition of writing and how how they crafted narratives in poems in a very it was very like specific correct that's what I was about to say is the fourth point of the Paradigm will get to later this about that unique style of writing for hear what you're saying it's a collection that's over a thousand years in the making and each scroll the material and it begin in different points in people and institutions in Israel sister is Olivia
 it's clear lake has like some Priestly text Manuel Isaiah and his disciples in Jerusalem Moses starts writing were told in the wilderness Journeys to all these different come together but the final form in which we encounter these texts is actually all it's very much like the final form of the Tanakh final form of the Hebrew Bible is a lot like a museum exhibit where all these diverse materials have been brought together in a very curated designed experience highly design design and so we don't encounter the Hebrew Bible in the form of what Moses was riding in the wilderness or what Isaiah was like right or Jeremiah we're riding what we have is a highly polished interconnected Museum exhibit editorialized created by a set of hands at the very end of the process that is like created a Polish or a glazed over the whole thing to make it
 scandalous to some people like oh wait Deuteronomy just wasn't with Moses handed over but even then you can go throughout the history of interpretation and Jewish and early Christian Scholars try history just read the last paragraph of Deuteronomy something will really stick out and then someone a later editor says Hey ever come along since him as clearly as somebody's voice is not on the other than Moses putting the final touch on the Torah but it's somebody like long after Moses yeah, it only makes sense it does if that's okay yeah I think it helps to think about these editors and or redactors as also filled with the spirit and so it's not just the original authors but it's the authors and
 letters that shaped the story later to that are part of this Spirit-filled community
yes it is all of this material it's all important as part of their national identity as part of our understanding of God and Humanity but there's something happening at a certain time in their history where this is all coming together in a form that kind of gets finalized to what Jesus would have called the Tanakh correct and tell me about like what. Of time was this like set the station as best as we can tell we're talking somewhere in the early to Middle phase of the second temple. Second temple meeting so after the Babylonian exile the first temple would have been Solomon's Temple Temple destroyed then a small number of the Jewish Exiles return from Babylon to rebuild their lives there but stories told in the scroll of Ezra Nehemiah in the Bible
 and so in the five twenties 5:20 BC the temple and then that temple in dorid even though it was remodeled heavily for over another five hundred years but it was ultimately destroyed by the Romans accept a remodeled by the second temple. Went from the 520 b.c.e. to 70 AD when the temple was destroyed by it somewhere in the early. In the three hundred to two hundred the Hebrew Bible in the final form that we encounter it was being brought into its final people come back out of Exile they're taking out of their land the temple is destroyed right there's a few that remain there right yep yep
 he might tell the story coming back of the book that we encounter them right of in an earlier shape so I guess it's to me I like to think about the culture that developed of like okay we're reestablishing our identity we're coming back and we're trying to make sense of why did we go into Exile and what is Al Pacino in front of us what is God doing it with all this material and there's this there's a history of being the brilliant readers and writers of literature that's connected to not only are we just doing this but this is actually this is sacred. This is stuff that God is explaining of God working through us even in this literature and I can all coalesces to like I imagined 3 Elite Squad of His Brilliant scribes just like obsessing
 over the snap you could make analogies to current in a populations that end up because I'm going to do something in another country you know I say it's like there's a group of people that migrated from one country to another then all of a sudden for that Community there Traditions their traditional literature the stories of their family history become super important and they study and and they want to know it even more cuz they're in a foreign land and its what's going to keep their identity alive isn't Community something certainly is happening like that and you can even send see in the Book of Ezekiel which is one of the first authors from the early Exile and tutus he was like a nerd of of Israelite literature cuz he's quoting Leviticus like nobody's business he knows the Eden stories so he's a good example
 whose mind is saturated with the earlier literature other people but also he is riding in a time when all that literature is itself still taking new shape and form a mug thing some of this literature is old and is kind of being like copied and maybe and studied and then some of its brand-new like Ezekiel looks like there's a whole new he's girl that's right idea in general and then biblical literature as an example has a different kind of authorial History than we imagined it today it's traditional literature its Community traditional literature doesn't mean it was written by anybody and everybody but it was literature that was studied edited compiled reshaped over the course of many generations and that's a part of its Origins that's I think different than how we plan books today I took me a long time
 yeah except with a very very clear criteria who can write an ad the page Wikipedia does have okay let's three of us I guess I don't know very much but I don't know maybe in the early history Wikipedia you could like anyone to change anything but pretty dated now yeah so I'm trying to think about what this means for readers as we approach the Bible as a unified Story the fact that there's this earlier collection that is studied and maybe edited a redacted into the overall story line but then there are these later works at least one thing that makes me think of is that as we read the later works like the prophets and the writings that we should be looking for how they're reflecting on the Torah the earlier Parts they've studied them and their weaving together those themes So reading the Bible as unified story it'll it'll look for developments from the Torah through the prophets through the writing
 look it up real quick
 and it comes from a to Hebrew Bible scholars Julius Steinberg and Timothy Stone in the book they have called the shape of the writings and it's all about the formation history of the caches in that's part of it and they talk about how the Hebrew Bible is much more like what it's not like is a collection of potted trees that you would come across like your Nursery down the street you know you go to like a garden store and you gon get some backyard trees and stuff let's go out to the back lot and they have like put together you know like the Japanese maples and the big trees or whatever but each one is in its own little pot and they've been grouped together that's an analogy for how many people think about the books of the Bible each one is kind of like a self-contained entity and put that at some point they like the lot is closed in the gates locked and like no more
 like in the origin of Hebrew Bible much more like the growth of an Aspen Grove of Aspen trees are like well first of all when you see Aspen Forest you're most likely looking at not hundreds of separate trees but actually at one biological organism so Aspen Groves can be huge but they're all interconnected and share identical DNA threat of their underground root system and so what you can do and I mean I'm not a botanist but I guess with nothing Grove is isolate where the what's the oldest in original root ball out of which everything else but there's an identical Leti to them and then this is what most helpful is that at some point when the original RuPaul spawned a new one but then they began interacting mutually so that what happens in one section the forest will affect the older root ball and vice versa and so that's there an LG for the Hebrew Bible to another words the Torah for example of Moses is the real ball is like a root ball
 form that it's in was also influenced by how the prophets emerged in grew into the shape that they did and so the book of Isaiah ever Jeremiah for example very much was growing and taking shape along with important developments and how the book of Deuteronomy took shape and they were growing simultaneously as opposed to the Torah was finished it's in a potted tree and then Isaiah wrote his thing and then it was scooted locks are there yeah the whole collection grew in this deeply interconnected way righteous why it's so there's so many cross references and it's hard to tell the dirt off in the direction of which part is deciding which which part of students what other part cuz it was a massively complex stories so like you've got a group of scribes call scribes and they are bringing this all together the tour is probably in more shape then other things but they're still kind of like oh let's add this in
 Deuteronomy that's whatever and it's taking shape with the prophets like hell of a time. Is it happening over the course of a millennia over the course of a thousand years but maybe before the Exile something about the weather is like a specific time words like it got really intense and they're like yeah I came like the difference from actual little details a great example as a little of microcosm like the conclusion of the end of Psalm 72 but it's like the emergence of the book of Psalms you can see happened in stages and its collection of Collections and then giving you an introduction to conclusions may be Parts even redacted added to certain songs later like a line at it later I mean by the word redacted edited or attic word for edit
 I asked about the editor editor and some news talk about like government documents I think so I'm used I'm used to hearing it in studies of the psalter The Book of Psalms there was a redaction or an edit that went on later but I think read action it's a hard in the Book of Psalms there's you know whatever 6070 plus Psalms that are connected to David and someone from the sons of Korah Psalm 72 Ends by saying the prayers of David Son of Jesse are finished and then not 20 songs later if you get another song by so clearly it's a multi-step process over the course of the centuries and see if that sort of thing these literary Q's you can see it by the language if you know it's older Hebrew or
 later he found within the Hebrew Bible itself I just looked it up and modern terminology redaction refers to when there is a countable at it so like you can see the edit history so when you read back something you that whole wide history is, okay well if only that were the case in terms of trying to figure out the edit Hillary so yeah a lot of people when they look at the Bible when they see the different layers they're trying to figure out what and what order did this happen exactly and what does that mean and so maybe if we're not trying to understand that exactly but looking at the final shape then editing is a more appropriate term to use through even though today but especially so in the mid-1900s there was a big way of the Hebrew Bible scholarship that was a trying to reverse-engineer the collection Bible to break it back
 into its previous Parts in stages and what the earliest being the most authentic and Siri and so I get this is important to talk about because we're saying that these are different layers but they actually form one unified story which is a specific way of viewing the text of the Hebrew Bible the word inspiration meaning people Guided by the spirit what some traditions of Christianity have tended to do is to limit the god-breathed nature of these documents to the activity of the handful of people named Moses Isaiah Jeremiah and not the guy who wrote the last paragraph and people were ignoring the historical realities that it was generations of profits and scribes and Disciples of Isaiah that are talked about in the book of Isaiah is the people who inherited the fur
 version of the book of Isaiah or Baruch who's mentioned in Jeremiah is the author of the book mentioned in the book so we have to I think adjust our view of inspiration to the way it actually talked about in the Bible itself which is that it's a community of profits and people who saw themselves as part of the composition history of this collection it's it's it's marvelous
it was there one day where they all just came out of the temple courts in it like we did it the Finish compiled the virgin of our our scriptures let it never be changed again it seems like it was if there was like a release event that happened in the temple courts we don't have any have any record of it is a tricky is it was pretty well like it wasn't being so we have to like open the can of worms cuz we haven't talked about the New Testament literature and accept the thing is that the composition of new Scrolls the word picking up in developing the themes of the core Aspen Forest so to speak to Revival the production of new material didn't stop the Hebrew Bible itself
 was created out of a bunch of pre-existing ancient Israelite literature in through a time but it also came into existence during a period of great literary people and so there's lots of other second temple Jewish literature that even some Jewish communities also treated with the same status as the books of the Hebrew Bible and so you have to kind of think of a Venn diagram you've got like sadja sees the run in the temple you got Pharisees they wish they were running the text message you got the Dead Sea scroll community and they try to run a kicked out and so they went out to the desert and hate everybody else and then you've got the Messianic Jewish community and all and all the other writings they take for granted that there's this kind of core because the Aspen Grove but there's also a lot of other literature that was accorded different status in different communities and so this is where the books that became the Duro Canyon
 there's nothing Catholic or Orthodox about these texts they're just s w e r g e r s o n Sarah and some of it involves second or third editions of Tanakh books all right like Daniel has an upgrade is Daniel 2.0 because the 2.0 of Esther for example takes the Book of Esther and situated it with all of this new material that hyperlink sit through design patterns into the stories of The Exodus and the stories of Genesis and it's awesome which Esther is god-breathed Esther 1.00 or after you put a stake in the ground about project a little bit and here's here's why the whole question is when you talk about the history of the literature the development of Jewish literature didn't stop magically one day when the Hebrew
 I was finished we did it Jewish literature kept growing and it all kept growing up snowballs just like the way the book of Chronicles is ripping off of Genesis the Kings and developing at but in light of different things so the wisdom of been Sarah is ripping off of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and Joanne Genesis altogether and so that process never stopped like a kept on going and so the question is is the line where you say okay we're going to take this part of the tradition and the section of it as coming from God but this part not in so traditionally where Christians have done this is to say well what was Jesus's Bible the only reason I read this in the first place is because I am like a third-generation from Scottish immigrants to the United States like I don't have any Jewish blood in me you do John
 but here we are with like staked our adult lives I'm trying to understand this literature and help other people so weird why is it that that's why we care about that so what was the literature the Jesus referred to as the scriptures that he said we're about him. And he refers to the three parts of this literature that corresponds as far as we can tell to the Hebrew Bible or that's not wild Jesus and the apostles allude to and use language from other Jewish literature of the time they don't as a general pattern refer to it with the same type of status as coming from a divine origin but they value it is useful to read it's true but yeah different and that text you're referring to or Jesus talks about the three-part to knock are you thinking of the live 20
 passage just the people 24 but you know what Jesus quotes from the Torah from the prophets hildasay as a scripture say sometimes you'll even say as God says but for example the famous saying where Jesus is like come to me all you who are weary and heavy-laden I'll give you the rest he's ripping off of a little line out of the wisdom of Ben Sarah which is where lady wisdom says come to me all who are heavy laden and I will give you rest I've been Sarah is ripping off of Proverbs in the scriptures where is it says in the wisdom of Ben Sira has adopted and that the pattern whenever Jesus the apostles quote formula or allude to other S type of literature they don't market with the same types of little markers as when they say as a scripture saying there's one very important exception and not the letter from Jesus's brother
 quotes from The Scroll of Enoch seem so cord it you know with Divine Authority like you would quote from Isaiah Isaiah Jeremiah fascinating to read The Book of Enoch is itself just riffing off of design patterns in Genesis and Deuteronomy and Isaiah and has to be a little humility but me and the seems really important right back the boundaries of the collection I think if we go back and interview second temple of Jews and did these different communities yeah and we could say like what's in and what's out I'm not sure that's even how they would conceive of this collection it because think about it where would you even encounter The Collector not bound up in the collection of Westeros and not every Tabernacle when it comes to a synagogue is going to have the whole collection talking about
 he reads the mind has a collection correct yep that's right before we started talking about how there are 24 bucks in the Jewish to not assume that it's feels very complete ass 2 x 12 with the number for completeness of the Scrolls of the I think give us the clues that there was a bounded collection that is that it also corresponds to the Protestant New Testament and those are the books that do for the most part when they get quoted by Jesus and the apostles they ascribe them at Divine Authority it's different but again if we could just go interview your average to and in the second temple. They didn't ever see it in one volume the way we do and they wouldn't have conceived of it as a book there might have been a hierarchy in their minds of like oh yeah well that's that's a squirrel from the Tanakh that's a school that I take very seriously over here but it's not for the Tanakh
 about how they viewed the relative Authority that the divine origins of each scroll not whether it's in the collection or out even though the Tanakh did seem like a very complete collection that you're either a day that's right but there were also other Scrolls that were treated as having Divine Authority in different communities that are not a part of the Tanakh and thus there is the Catholic tradition that's right include them in Eastern Orthodox tradition includes more the church Community Jude was a part of it clearly was a part of their collection in Augustine not think James was part of the New Testament Martin Luther Martin Luther it was because he struggled with it logically the New Testament so I can say is this all took me a very long time to come to terms with but if this is a question that bothers you
 I didn't keep you up at night you need to wrestle with it cuz it it's a reality that the boundaries of the scriptural collection differed in Jewish different Jewish communities and so we just need to be a lot more humble in how dogmatic we are about these questions
go to land a plane with unified though cuz we talked a lot about okay so this collection was brought together as a collection but the purpose of it was to do something very specific which is the tell one very specific story about what's going on in the world correct as we encountered it the whole collection is spun out of the first few literate units of the Genesis scroll saw the creation and the Edan stories and stories of the flood and the scattering of Babylon in the choosing of Abraham that sequence rather set the vocabulary literary themes that are just going to be on recycle in every part every scroll and it's not collection as a ripping off of stuff going on in those early chapters and what are those themes God is the great Creator and provider River of Life quarter life he's installed Humanity as an image through whom to rule the world and Stewart
 humans do a really poor job violence and yeah we take God's gifts and we use them to aggrandize ourselves and our agendas and log people get hurt in the process so God has two choices you can either scrap the whole thing like the flood but then that means no more humans through them to rule the world and that's not satisfied with that apparently cuz he likes the humans too much work wants to rule the world through them so the out of the decreation he saves the remnant chooses a Remnant and gives them a chance to become a community to nap is Noah then with Abraham and Isaac and then with Jacob then then so on so on to the cycle of God creating establishing such human and are the first all Humanity but then picking humans like a try again feeling some sort of decreation yep and then selecting than human again
 it's like a melody it's like a melody eating is very clear Genesis and that just continues on to the Holy Bible in the profits are about and the Babylonian exile betrayal is the ultimate catastrophic flood that happened to the chosen people the family favor him a Remnant returned and the route to the Hebrew Bible comes from that Remnant which is taking the whole collection and oriented around the Future Hope about God raising up someone from Among The Remnant who will do for Israel and for the world what none of us seem to be able to do for ourselves the seed of the woman the snake Crusher the Messiah and so that's where the Hebrew Bible is organized in terms of content and seeing him without the hope for a future human who will reverse the failure eating and reverse Israel's failure and release God's blessing to all of the world every book in the Tanakh is about about that in some
 if I can't see how it's about that the problem is probably more to do with my assumptions that when we approach the Bible I like to think of it as reading sympathetic with the author's so trying on that Viewpoint of this is a unified and coherent story even if I can't see it that's where the evidence points because that's how design patterns seem to be working and intertextuality in this overarching storyline and so yeah when you can't see it it's helpful to read sympathetically and ask okay curiously and with wonder what could the author be doing here and I don't understand this but there must be a reason and I think that's also where it's helpful to study ancient Jewish convention like how did the how did these texts work you know how did they write them how is it different than how we would write or read a story today how's it similar that's where I think all that stuff comes into play in a super fascinating more
 principal principals axioms attributes of of this Paradigm that a Jewish meditation literature correct this idea even more there's an acknowledgement that this ancient Jewish literature could tolerate diversity or something that seems disjunctive or contradictory maybe more than we had someone will you read something that seems like a contradiction or seems out of place in the overall story line or where would you experience that yeah I think there are a lot of different ways we could experience that one would be where you know if Sammy on King's Material and then Chronicles material and they are telling the same story and a different way so why is that yeah totally different details details really different yeah so for me if I'm approaching that text with this assumption if I'm trying on that lends sympathetic
 I would say I wonder why this is and let me see if I can figure out what the author's point is in Samuel and kings and how that point differs in Chronicles what's the other trying to do differently and why might that be a great example because for many people Divergent details in accounts of the same event happening all over the Hebrew Bible and so if your assumption is well this is a historical record of the history of ancient Israel those are going to be problems contradictions but a contradiction in a collection of text is in the eye of the beholder the fact that a recipe book like you turn 21 page and the recipe is really different than the recipe 20 Pages later oh it's a contradiction the contradiction is only in your assumptions that a recipe book should have all the recipes like that the wrong assumption the same way if my assumptions about what the Bible is leave me to see contradictions in it maybe my assumptions the problem. The Bible again we are getting into
 Jewish meditation literature vs. what is Juju Smith Schuster literature as opposed to history and I love to get in that more was just saying in a diverse collection there's going to be diverse today and if I can see how it was brought together in this particular way I was like Anthology but that's been given a unified shape and its final form year were talking about the unified highly designed editorialize unified shape that the Hebrew Bible came in to be very specific and beautifully designed as an editorial unity and unified in terms of its themes of storage and governing storyline and concept that tolerate enormous diversity terms of content literary style but it's unified in really clear and obvious ways if you have eyes to see it so the formation of the Hebrew
 this is like the ultimate Rabbit Hole I've been going down there for a couple decades now so helpful guide along the way I'll just recommend a couple books that I found helpful one is more General introduction by Hebrew Bible scholar Paul Wagner called The Journey from text to translation the origin and development of the Bible is actually about both Old and New Testaments but he really zeros in a lot of these things were talking about that compositional history and then if you want to take the ultimate dive in the Hebrew Bible stuff you got to read Lee Martin McDonald's work and it's hard to know which of his 15 bucks on the formation of the bible to read as he learns more heed to write a new book He's written 15 books he's written so many books are in the formation of the Bible but it's sort of like he'll do a few more years of research learned a whole bunch more and then publish a new book on it so you just have one called the biblical Canon he had just released this year like a much bigger
 volume work on the origins of the cannon but anyway if you to search for him and go on Amazon and look for the biblical Canon that's a really great definitive treatment of a distillation of all the key things you got to think about when it comes to the origin history of the Bible supposed to Scholars that have been helpful like I said it's not canon formation but somebody who's interested in the unified story but story well it's hard to know where to start with it depends on what feature of the story somebody sees as unifying and soap some helpful places to start it or like Stephen Dempster dominion and dynasty of the royal Messianic of God yeah yeah unlocking the Bible crafts narrative I think that the Hebrew Bible and all our questions are answered thank you
 and I will jump in next to the formation of the New Testament and how that's part of the unified story as a separate collection active listening to this episode of Bible project podcast in the next episode we're going to look at our next pillar of the Paradigm which is that the Bible is Messianic literature all the New Testament document presented Jesus who's in continuity with the storyline of the Hebrew Bible and that's really important because they're emerged offshoot of the Jesus movement that were down for Jesus but that we're not down for anyting Jewish and they disconnected Jesus from his Jewish Heritage we'd love to hear your questions and have them For an upcoming question and response episode so if you find yourself wondering about things that were talking about and want us to engage more you can send us your question send it to info at bible project that, try to keep it to
