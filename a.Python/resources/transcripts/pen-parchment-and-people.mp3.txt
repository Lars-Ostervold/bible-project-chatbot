when was the last time you wrote a letter to someone
 picture that moment for a second
 was it written longhand pencil and paper and mailed with a typed out on a computer
 punched out on your phone with your thumbs and sent as an email throughout history readers of the New Testament letters have tended to take their experience and practice of writing a letter that they've been taught and their culture and assumed that's what the apostles were doing
 when you think of Paul riding one of the letters what at least modern westerns tend to do is Imagine Paul sitting by himself where room where he has like privacy and he's producing a single unedited draft that he's got to get out the door so that's the mental image they were going to look at how the early Apostles would have written their letters while letter writing something simple for us for those in the first century was a bunch of part of feet the skills required a significant it was a significant undertaking the materials are really expensive and so you want somebody who can write fast but really precise and still a lot cuz every square inch cost a lot of money it was so expensive to write letters the letters that we find from the first century are all pretty short but it didn't stop her from writing long and creative letters they were creative they had a variety of means at their disposal but these letters are some of the longest letters in it
 world is you read through them some sections feel like he's going off the top of his head other sections feel like really well crafted short sermon on John Collins and this is the Bible project podcast day on the show at Grand in Cohoes. Kim Mackay and I discuss the craft the first century letter writing and how that will help us understand how to better read the letters in the Bible thanks for joining us.
all right we are starting a new conversation about how to read the New Testament letters we've already had one conversation but we're having two videos in our how to read the Bible's series on how to read the New Testament first video is on we are calling historical context of the historical context yes the biggest layer is the story of the Bible which is a type of history but this is the only form of literary context to as what I'm confused storyline of the Bible is found in a literary work we call the wife of the biggest form of contact that's how did the New Testament letters fit into the story of the Bible and then we explored how do these new testament letters fit into its historical context is socio-economic World stage happening threat
 Roman Empire for Century Jewish diaspora communities around the Mediterranean to ask for a meeting and let me look more specifically the context of the community to receive the letters yeah so the situation will contact situation of the biblical narrative contact you or the letters come in the cultural context of the Roman Empire terms of history but also what was the culture like and then yeah the situation in context the unique circumstances happening in the different cities and then the different within the cities they actually people at the church Community the Paul's writing to see if you want to listen to those those are in the previous series on how to read the letters m series is going to holding on a new type of context that were going to call literary context which if I understand correctly how were these letters written
 as literary pieces and how do you understand them as a literary piece of how do you read the cultural context and the situation of contacts those are all layers of contacts that are behind the letter there the context out of which the letter emerges you can actually read and get a little snippet some details of those but you have to infer a lot to do with a lot of inference work well we're focusing on now is not the context behind the letters but the letters actually written work from beginning to end as a context of words on the page as a context for understanding what the words mean so not behind the text but the context of actual text itself using the word text a lot but that's the shift here you could do this with any texts as you can say what's the historical context
 of this being written what was the life like of the people who this is written to now it's look at actually what was written that's what this video is going to be about 10 quick intro with Anne it's quick for us to talk about it we'll find out about how letters were actually written in the first century what it look like the produce literary correspondence because it differs from culture to culture it turns out, the function that letters have how you write them and the form that they take differs from culture to culture have learned so much from a couple of the great Scholars and then the second I want to go through the form for Century letters have a sixth-form just like I have loaded templates
 the letter template going and then you just fill in the lyrics it's where I put my name and address and this is where I saw those conventions exist in the first century almost all the letters of the Apostles adapting and tweaking and then the the last bit which really didn't know how to read the Bible series is that will pay off is like for practical steps for how to read the letters as a whole and understand the flow of thought in context so that's kind of the outline of where we're going and what I think the video could be about personally you have told me before you grew up in a context of the Christian tradition where the letters of the apostles were like the main event comes of like the most important are the Bible read the letters of Paul in particular has preached I'm only familiar with I suppose my tradition really but I'm wondering if you somehow were able to catalogue every sermon preached on a Sunday morning yeah cross America the Western
 world or the world and like had a spreadsheet of all the of the passages that were printed out of and then like made a graphic like here's where the Christian churches preaching out of all I know is that growing up it would have been 90% splattershot across Paul's letters right and then maybe like some songs or maybe you know up for a huge portions of the church it's easy because many churches follow was called the lectionary which is a calendar year reading through the Bible that we didn't do that but mostly nondenominational churches don't use that and low there yeah yeah yeah I bet they specifically the letters of Paul or the New Testament letters for sure would be probably the highest percentage and I know any time I went to read the Bible growing up and I would typically turn to the letters they were the most approachable the most
 collectible is their address to you believe the first census binder I get confused often get confused I would get less confused if I were say in the profits or reading the Bible it's typically about reading these letters so here is my hunch is that some of them because they're short some of them just 25 Pages Colossians you know 1st Peter that you actually probably did like read them beginning to end know not always but not always not typically actually because I was always looking for that moment of I can apply that or know that makes sense that all that's a thought I could dwell on and then you're done
 looks like a treasure hunt that was like my my experience so yeah if you can get that three versus boom awesome is warm and filled with the love of God from two sentences it was a revelation of sorts to read it all at 1 go in Bible school when we went I think we had to read Romans in one go and kind of talked about its structure and I spent a lot of time in Romans but I never read it all in one go yeah however just sat down and didn't read the whole thing and one go and that was a revelation of sorts yeah I remember that too when I first started to read the letters so I will look at these a little bit later but the two places in the New Testament letters that actually show you I'll read one of them one is the line near the end of Paul's letters
 Colossians Colossians chapter 4 verse 16 sentence in the letter and he says when this letter is red among you all have it also read in the Church of the laodiceans that's down the road and you for your part make sure you read my letter that is from laodicea so I wrote a letter to the both of you yeah so I learned when you read them aloud also it's like make a copy and send it down the road I'm sure you get a copy of theirs too so we don't have that letter right unless it's the letter to the last letter that we call the letter to the Ephesians is the letter to the warehouse and grab a hold of what is important here is Paul he doesn't even instruct he just assumes how are the people attending the House Church our house churches in class today going to read this letter and the fact is they're not going to read it likely ever
 recipients of the letter to the Colossians the vast majority did not read it they listen to it which means they listened to it as a whole that takes 25 minutes right. The media they had yeah that's right he makes a similar comment at the end of 1st Thessalonians 2 and there he actually instructs thing I instruct you read this letter before everybody after everybody's there so the New Testament letters were actually written to be heard they were written to be listens to buy a group of people now course I'm sure he would be happy if people actually sat down and read it closely and certainly the people who he put the letter in the hands off is working to see letter carriers were most often the people who were commissioned by the author to go read it aloud with instructions having received instruction about it son says this is Starr there that's a really different way to encounter the New Testament letters and how do you grow up isn't it so we have to have conversations
 reading the letters as a whole and learning not to take sentences out of context but that's because we live in a culture saturated with translations of the Bible and where the primary way people are encouraged to engage the Bible is by themselves alone maybe at the beginning of the day that's not the type of literature that the letters are designed us it's like You're the Inspiration guide but the primary way they're meant to do what they do is to have them read aloud to a group of followers of Jesus yeah for me that was a significant Insight this continued to shape how I interact with the New Testament letters that were making which are pretty simple one is from the previous conversation these are letters these are actual actual now someone wrote this to some other group and that was a big
 kanaha for us to talk about and this next one is read the whole letter
 the most should be the most intuitive thing you could imagine ya read the whole thing even better listen to the whole thing I want to listen to the whole thing nowadays he's was free Bibles on your phone you could read and listen at the same time that's right that really is the heartbeat of this conversation this video to read or listen to the letters as a whole and learn how to understand them as a hole developing key ideas from the beginning to the end in a really it may not seem to us any more like an orderly line of progression but for the people who wrote These they took you want to ride from the first lines to the last and everything is intentional and so that's really what this the literary context talk about ancient letter writing them because I wouldn't ask
 Doom that a letter has I'm sort of elegant literary designs you right cuz of my mind a letter is just the correspondence and correspondences take all shapes and sizes I could just be like quickly filling with few details or I could just wax on about all sorts of things and then send it off to you because we're buds yeah okay perfect perfect transitioned into our first step so not only do we have to counter like bad practices or unhelpful practices that maybe our tradition our culture has developed and how we engage these letters but also I found that I had all kinds of assumptions about how the letters were produced that are totally Incorrect and that were pre-loading me with all these misconceptions of what to look for and what to expect expect and it's just a simple principle how you think something came into existence will affect what you think it is and what you do with it and what you
 from it and it's for someone with the with the letters so it's something that you thought you understood you thought you understood him because you thought you understood that your misconceptions shaped the way you view did ya Origins another was how the letters were actually written and came into existence has challenged my assumptions about what I thought they were in the first place to Origins yeah so I've been hugely helped here by the work of two Scholars Randolph Richards wrote a book called Paul and first century letter writing secretaries composition and collection that sounds riveting kind of O'Connor called Paul the letter writer the same title each of these works is it is a deep dive into everything about writing letters in the first century that you never knew that you never even stopped to think of
 the Richards dedicate the whole chapter 2 exploring what he calls the most common misconceptions that we have Paul and how he wrote his letters so here's how we stay it's the misconception when you think of Paul riding one of the letters but at least modern westerners tend to do is Imagine Paul sitting by himself right thing by themself producing maybe in a study he's going to study for a room where he has like privacy and we'll bask time will desk and he's producing a single unedited draft that he's got to get out the door cuz there's a crisis in galatia something like that or they know a little bit about history they know that people use secretaries someone to transcribe had great handwriting and could write small and fit it all into use as least look at
 around the room talking out loud that we seen those scenes coming out of the room talkin there's a scribe you know secretary get her a note down but still single draft finished he puts his handwriting or signature at the end like he does hit multiple letters this is my hand out the door goes so that's the couple that sees her letters like when I write a letter when is exactly the point when you write a letter I have written multiple drafts of a letter yes but maybe once or twice in my life that's right right cuz they're like really important last it's amazing you say that throughout history readers of the New Testament letters have tended to take their experience and practice of writing a letter that they've been taught and their culture and assume that's what the apostles were doing the fact is richer than murphy-o'connor go on it links to show how
 that mental picture is out of sync with everything we know about letter writing in the first century Roman world most famous paintings of the Apostle Paul is the Rembrandt mid-1600s and it's type it in my eyes has this misconception it's a beautiful painting he's got his hand on his forehead this is contemplating what's he going to say that quilt and he's sitting at a European style chair yeah yeah yeah you working it out he's like in his mind is working out Romans 5 through 8. Works together to do is help us get a more historically accurate imagination and I have found you can just kind of walking through how letters were actually written has really transformed how I engage them
 the first of all there are lots of letters from the Greek and Roman world that have been left behind to us now the most prolific was a guy named Marcus tullius Cicero where he just goes by Cicero for short he was one of the Roman Elite he was a lawyer a philosopher great public speaker who's known for giving great speeches he lived in the first century and there's great collections of his letters he had a lot of leisure time to write letters hundreds of them really really wealthy so he's giving us one of the biggest collection 24 Century letters but also his correspondence and Richard specifically became like an expert in such as letters he remarks a lot about how and why he writes letters like he often makes little comments about when and how he wrote his letters and so looking at the information here
 this is where people like murphy-o'connor and Richards can I build up this picture for us here another famous collection of letters was found in a trash pile down in Egypt called the oxyrhynchus papyri this was the pile of manuscripts that the famous nagamati manuscript found which was an Egyptian Christian sect called the gnostics or something anyway is in a trash Heap is made of Papyrus and I survived British explorers Kyrie scraps or papyri that have been re-purposed to make other things so and yeah it has been all condensed in the scrap Heap that got buried underground it's dry down in Egypt hundreds of letters from their Cicero was he first century ya-ya sister lived in the first century BC before Jesus in the year is essentially kind of in the years right before Rome
 sing into and from a republic into an Empire and right before I think he died in the raid decade that rum gain power over Israel Palestine today so there you go so when you look at patterns and how people wrote letters and then you compare them or features in the New Testament letters you can put together the picture picture of the the way the letters are in a cracker through the first thing Richard Springs retention is how many of the letters of Paul specifically are written from a group of people I've just put the list right here in 1st Thessalonians is very difficult life begins saying Paul Sylvanas and Timothy to the Church of the Thessalonians same with second Thessalonians three names co-authors Marco's tenders Paul sylvanus Timothy
 1st Corinthians Paul names himself Paul called Miss Apostle of Jesus Messiah by the will of God and Destiny is our brother to the Church of God 2nd Corinthians is from Paul and Timothy Philippians Philemon Colossians are all from Paul and Timothy the name both of the beginning and then Galatians begins with saying it's from Paul and all the siblings were with me all the brothers and sisters who were with me I don't even think about this when you read it but what Richards did was he compared this to how the first line of the letter when you write who it's from how do people do this in the first century and what do you know it's just that the naming of Coast Enders is very rare unless it's a family member so the naming of non-family members was not common in the ancient world which raises the question why they're named and then the other pattern he knows then when somebody's that's not your family is named it's because they had a role in the
 section of a letter so Richards really wants us to take seriously communal or group authorship of the letters that clearly if it's Paul's voice in these letters he sometimes because we represent in the group most often the I so he is clear it's from him but it's from like his crew these letters are from Paul and his crew and so that's the first step it could be that he's just a generous Spirit who wants to give other people credit but he did most of the work or it could be that like him in this crew has been a lot of time hashing out like what are we going to say and how we going to say it and let's talk about flow of this letter and then they were all as really Cooperative yes but I guess those are the options there's a, spectrum of options when he's just being nice and he's naming the people who happen to be in the room and he sent it on the other would be that he
 has been working on the content of this letter with these people that you need that's why he named them that's the most likely that's more likely given how uncommon it was to name Coco Cinders in the opening line if they aren't a family member would make sense if it's you know me riding to my son I'm going to put from me and your mom but to say I from me and saucony's unless he had some role to play with in it these observations all kind of stacked on top of each other. Second thing not have a study he was a traveling missionary missionary planting communities of Jesus throughout the Roman World in cities so he didn't have Leisure Time you without earning his own money during the days in the marketplace and making leather tents and so on so we have to imagine where did he work and when did he find time to work
 we preached in and taught a lot we would go plant to church save up a bunch of money making tents and then you could go to quartets and we learn about him leaving bible studies at night so Richard wants us to imagine a scenario where Paul would have Extended Stays where he sponsored by somebody and the most likely place where you would have room to work in would never be a private place where this poorly lit it would be in guest rooms and ends in rest stops where you would have space for Paul and Barnabas and Timothy to get together and be elected I need to send a letter to class A hear the issues these are things I've taught them in the past here's what I want to say and that these letters could have been in the making over the course of weeks and months in multiple steps
 so you're saying before 1 Paul didn't have just like a study that he wasn't. He's like, what am I going to write on today correct. It's more like day-to-day life building tents selling his tents in the marketplace traveling from City to City getting kicked out of cities teaching and synagogue teaching in other places this is just fill this hole all his days and in the background is this like all these communities that he wants to keep in touch with and so he'll have his crew and they might be in the market place setting up they might be tearing down they might be traveling whatever and they're like working out what is it that we're going to talk to the Church of Ephesus about like discussing discussing that and at some point you're saying that solidifies to Plymouth psych okay let's carve out an afternoon let's put this all down on us for to be some sort of parchment some sort of oh yeah
 Brother Moore this is just about we have to imagine the life of an itinerant missionary who's raising his own money doing a day job right in the marketplace and who does the own property or stuffy so he's going to be in places that other people are paying for hosted by patrons would swear the house church is often gathered the where would he have to imagine him at mid-day I think with the people that he names and even though he often names at the end of the letter I was like hey this person says hi the whole experience of arresting these letters so thinking of the letters a social experience social experience and group efforts with Paul is you know he's the leader of the group but he's working with group once you start to pay attention to those features you can see it in the letters that there are lots of other people named both of the beginning and at the end and the tools to write letters were not very abundant right like these would be
 next thing he does whole section on how people generated teaching material and deposit teacher to preacher letter writer
 so the main technology for writing down your ideas is these wax tablets the wooden frame maybe the size of what we would call like a piece of paper or something and then maybe have some hinges and there's maybe five or six of these wooden frames with a whack job on either side and you can basically scrap and what are the ages for kids you can have multiple a wood frames together in one would look to us for a book hinges around multiple little wooden frame frame has a wax tablet on each side in a wax tablet is the tablet the notebook is the equivalent of a notebook and it's just wax on wood correct and you can can write on it at least your hand right into the line dancing that's right and then when you want to do a clean I thought I did I did read about this maybe if heated up and smooth
 but the point is is that the place you can collect notes ideas it's enough that it would need to be would probably look a lot like my notebooks that are just full of literary design chart so here's another thing Richard wants us to consider and anybody who's been a preacher or traveling teacher on a regular basis will get this the overtime you build up your material writes you you are that's a great quote or sometimes you'll come across Paul's letters and they'll be like three or four Old Testament quotations all strung together by a link word they all have the same words do so they'll be some really beautiful little flow of thought someone like a little pump or the poems of War poems yeah Richard wants us to imagine that all of this is material that he's crafting over his career
 and that he's collecting in his mind and on these tablets are high and then when he sits down to write a letter he's not pacing the room wondering what to say he's going to draw Upon A lot of the material that is used before most of the stuff must get memorize though because eventually you got to clear that wax tablet for the next idea Timothy chapter 4 he makes a Note 2 Timothy he says hey when you come visit me he's in prison and he says the Timothy bring the cloak that I left with carpus at troas so bummed I left that a favorite club to my favorite club and above all and uses the word Apartments it's the Greek word membranas membrana member and yes where we get the word membrane like a banshee animal skin animal skin which was material used in Scrolls and then it could also be used as a as a notebook
 so because even if he distinguishes between Scrolls which would likely be like Papyrus and then especially bring the membranas and some people think he's talking about Netflix flicks can't do anything just sketching out ideas correct but if you wanted to keep an idea you put it on a parchment apartment that's right his favorite poem or something I mean likely he's going to memorize it but to he might be like I want to keep that handy and if you'll put that on the front and you can actually see signs of this in Paul's letters where they'll be like a little paragraph me like that sounds a lot like what he said over here and you compare bits of the fusion to caution and you like us some of its verbatim so these paragraphs and it'll just be a little tweaks and make them different or he'll talk about the armor of God and the end of Ephesians but also
 in a little section of Romans 12 and in 1st Thessalonian what more than likely he had a little notebook where he'd worked out the armor of God bit and then he can tweak it and apply it when he's riding different letter which has caused this preformed material so is an extended quote but I like it it's kind of a bit of historical imagination about how Paul wrote those letters Richard says ancient letter writers compose material in the midst of daily life Paul would certainly take opportunities afforded by a few days stopped over in a town to write and work on his letters Paul preached and synagogues and in the market he no doubt spoke to guess after dinner and Holmes where he was hosted at he debated and discussed material with this team as they walked along the road or aboard a ship all of these occasions gave opportunities for Paul to write notes and a home material it's reasonable that Paul like other ancient writers was always in the process of composing editing
 polishing material as he traveled and is administered does that picture right there that makes so much sense to some extent and I do a lot of writing and that's kind of how it works for me is like there's an idea on the table and there is time just to sit down and talk about it and think about it and write about it but then there's just the margins throughout the day we're like you're in the shower and your processing it or I'm having a conversation with someone and I bring it up in order to kind of like see how does this land if I tell you what you tell you that an illustration yeah yeah or you like I wrote that thing a year ago and there were two great quotes in that that I could really use here so that's what that's the idea these letters are the product of Paul's daily life and rhythms with his missionary team Richards goes on he says this material under construction might best be termed as pre letter b a
 composing a major letter and transferring notes into a complete letter was a significant undertaking he's going to list the steps that it would require like how do you go from notes to complete attack correct cell first Paul and his team would need to locate an available secretary and reach an agreement about when the work would be done and how much it would cost because likely and his crew there isn't someone who can place I could take some people think that Timothy would have had the skills but he goes through and you list the skills required as significant significant undertaking materials are really expensive and so you want somebody who can write fast but really precise and still a lot into the small amount cuz every square inch costs a lot of money so it's worth it to hire professional Tully that's right so you want somebody who this is their thing yeah totally I was going to say stuff like when you need a logo done in like the junior high nephews
 I could do it and I thank you but we're going to go with a professional the first is every letter represents and we'll talk in a minute here about how much this would have cost expensive so okay let's say they find somebody and they're able to name the cost and raise the money available the second secretary would come with the proper materials ready so if you got parchment Papyrus you have the letter quills you have pots of ink like all the stuff has to be purchased and made ready and we take that for granted and yeah where do you go where you can't get access to a pendant has no real existence yeah it's just typing it ones and zeros in Saint Cloud computer so a first draft
 Star notes they would then leave and prepare a written first draft they would write a first draft how would they do that so Richards goes through everything we know about dictation practices and it's actually very unlikely the scenario Paul pacing around the room just talking out loud and describe doing the first draft the final draft of a letter on the spot there's no way no way that happened just in terms of actual Logistics in the materials that they had to use so the question is how would a first draft get pretty and it would be through a long session there's this movement here are my notes on a whiteboard session like a whiteboard session but then I'm also handing you some wax tablets and some parchment sand like the raw materials of the letter-writing anything you're just you're assembling your seat I'm going to be talking as to what do you call this blocking be kind of go through each of the scenes shirt
 just the basic idea for some notes so you then you would commission secretary to go pull together create the first draft with just goes on they would then leave and prepare that first draft babying the secretary remember everything you said and everything handed to him and figure it out correct assembly this and another without work if everything was from pre written notes start here sup there but if it was like and then say something about this we're not say something about this so yeah what this does is how for slips for Century letters written creates a spectrum of opportunities for the secretary's involvement and there's examples across the full spectrum where Cicero would just say I met with my secretary gave him the basic points and he wrote the letter but everything in the letter if you read it it's from I Cicero to you so and so it
 does it's a letter from Cicero so there's that and then there's all the way down to the Other Extreme which is something like dictation and their worst forms of shorthand so if someone were giving a speech some scribes were trained in some versions of shorthand notes to actually take down while they were talking and then they would have to go and translate that short hand into long longer than let the rate at which Spa would have had the talk for ascribed actually write out Romans word by word he did a measurement of it this ridiculous like that would take 36 hours for Paul to speak at the speed of somebody being able to write unlikely richest thinks it's unreasonable to imagine reasonable that Paul spoke at 1 mi an hour for 36 hours I've worked it out let me finish this this description
 the richest is giving him so hear what riches is saying more likely we look at how letters were written in what we know there's a 3/4 material there's a initial whiteboard session where you work through the blocking of the letter by hand over the parchments notes and saw on then the secretary would return with the first draft the team would go over it and the secretary would jot down Corrections additions and changes noted by Paul and his team then the secretary would leave to prepare the next draft this process will continue until the final draft was approved then the secretary would leave and prepare the final polished copy on better materials and with the best handwriting needless to say Richard's concludes this entire process required more than a few days we are wise to locate the writing of the final draft in places where Paul had longer space such as Corinth Ephesus we're up to me I'd never done the work to them
 and how how this work but this all once I really thought it through this felt very realistic and I'm also matched my experience of reading the letters how they how they work when you read them aloud aloud most of the letter sound like you're listening to a pretty well crafted speech is not the itinerant ramblings of just what happened to occur to somebody's mind is that goes through this is really well architected sure beginning to end or you do get really black long you do get rambling sentences totally would feel like like kind of like dictation that's right so these would be moments of where no man this thing in Romans 5:12 perfect example Romans 5:12 pill begins a sentence clearly something you realized a misunderstanding that he wanted to clarify so we goes on for about 5
 verses to make a clarification and then he finally jumps back to continuing the sentence for 12:18 and so that it for sure is a place where he like cracked it open and inserted a clarifying paragraph into the middle and there's multiple places where you can do that would you be like on this verse would continue seamlessly from like four sentences ago but there's a paragraph in the middle that clarifies or make some point and that's what I'm talking about when you read the letters how they flow makes a lot of sense in light of this composition kind of process we're going to flush us out what Richards is done is he's read all the ancient letters from Angie ROM with your counter to all the letters that survive from Century to Century before and after the apostles both looking at the form of the letters but then also looking at all the moments where people talk about how they wrote the letters and the most
 lithic of all other ancient letter writers is Cicero and so he's reconstructing from that information and then from things within the actual letters themselves and imagining a historical process the information in the letters themselves is important these named co-authors are at the beginning okay so how does a group of people come up with something like the letter to the Romans or the letter to the Corinthians Paul at the end of Romans the secretary that you speak up cuz it's he's a follower of Jesus look at Romans chapter 16
so down in verse 21 Romans 16 Paul says Timothy my coworker he greets you yep so delicious Jason Sosa pater they're all my siblings they all say hi I tertius who wrote this letter greet you in the Lord guide us who's been a host to me and to the whole church they greet you erastus the city treasurer greets you and goes on and it says if you're hearing Paul's voice but then in verse 22 tertius by The Wailers of the weather is like everybody to Peter at the end of 1st Peter names someone named Sylvanas he says I wrote to you through or by Silvana and I said that makes a lot of sense people often wondered how did somebody who grew up as a fisherman speaking Aramaic on Steve Galilee write a piece of beautiful polished rhetorical Greek that is for
 Peter I had to get there and find a way of the most compelling explanation I think is because Savannah is with the letter he wrote it by means of Savannah so there you have to not that Peter couldn't learn how to speak well but just to say that secretaries were more than just like you know what we would think of is like a little memory recorders on their smartphones or something yeah they could and did play an active role in the composition of the letters and that's okay cuz we know already that they are product often of Paul and his group cuz his whole missionary life and teaching life was done in the community food in a working in advertising for a while this sounds a lot like a client relationship the secretary where your clientele come in and they'll say here's here's what we need to say and so now essentially I'm like a secretary of sorts and so I hear from them like we need
 communicate this test SMS now go and write the first draft and so I know what the client wants but I have to take some Liberty and exact word choice and solve some problems come back to the client and say what do you think of this and then they're like oh yeah this is great missed it here can you fix this yes I can draft their draft office rent that's sort of what I'm just be thinking about there was a spectrum of ways that secretaries could work with the author of the center and that's a no you just described as a very common one there's a core bit of content ideas vocabulary however you can imagine as Paul's in personality emerges from the letters that he would be pretty invested in specific word choice yeah but that would come in the drafting but that would comment in it cuz you're saying if he's not sitting there having him transcribe his thoughts
 how do I have to come through into the editing film editing for yes that's right that's right another factor in this is the comparative length of Paul's letters Paul's letters are some of the longest letters that exist from the ancient world really by far so I think a lot of it has to do with cost of materials so the shortest letter from the ancient world 18 words pick up the boxes in Cicero short letters 22 words Cicero's longest letters 2500 words Paul's shortest letter is 335 words by Lehman it's longer than any of the shortest letters letter which I think is Romans is almost twice the length
 of seneca's longest letter and it's three times the length of Cicero's longest letter so Paul's letter is Paul's letters are two and a half times longer than the average letter length not only just that he have a lot to say the butt at the actual composing of documents that are that long this is not happening while he Paces the room and somebody just transcribe the speech on the spot and they're too well architected and they reflect really careful Arrangement and composition there more of what we would consider literary works right yeah that's the basic point that their well-crafted literary works now there are examples it's a lot of times and letter that feels like Paul just flying by the seat of his pants off and like he'll even later up himself correct and why wouldn't I get pushed out and draft in the drafting process
 finally he didn't he didn't care to like in 1st Corinthians where he's saying hey I found out from Chloe and people of her household told me that you guys are not splitting up into groups and Corinth based on your favorite public speakers and Bible teachers and then he starts talking about oh yeah. Does that one guy and the people in it. And then I have to Cuff that sounds like it was dictated that section I think so so there are parts that he could have dictated yeah I don't think there's a silver bullet I think what we do is we need a bra a whole Spectrum but here's the spectrum of how letters materials were work together what you'll notice in that section of the letter like what you're naming and 1st Corinthians that's in the opening and then right after that we says listen Jesus
 send me the baptized but the preach the gospel in the end of 1st Corinthians chapter one scuse me it's not the 1st Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17 he moves into Verse 18 you didn't just steal it if you're listening to it allowed are they taking all of a sudden feels like he just got up into a Pulpit and it begins the sermon about the foolishness of God is wiser than man's Wisdom and duties got super clever ways that he quotes from the Greek scriptures and it's this incredible sermon feel like if you're all of a sudden have stepped into a sermon it doesn't deal with it at all it feels like a written test first 18 there's 18 at Transitions and the there's no you don't get any more of these two sides here so you can imagine about a dictated opening but then there's 18 begins what Richard was called that a pre-formed material a sermon that he's given condensed some soap all would have had a second
 a group of people are going to write to the Corinthians and you can imagine him on their first session saying here's a sermon of sorts I have and it's about how I felt God's power feels like foolishness after the greeting I want you to take this and put it in there so we're going to have a greeting and I'ma say you guys have talked about their divisions and they ever do this thing we get to the second draft and Paul's reading it and he goes you know what we need to put a note in there about how I I baptize two people and their pants down the first time he had that's right down put it in right here I'm so glad in baptized any of you yes it baptized East to people in this person but Christ assembly baptized can you got that great and then it just now it's kind of inserted in their sure there's like those so both things could be happening I think so both modes that's right they were creative they had a verb
 Lady of means at their disposal but these letters are the some of the longest letters in the ancient world is you read through them some sections feel like he's going off the top of his head other sections feel like really well crafted short sermons and so on so Richards is trying to help us give us a framework to make sense of the letters have to be really pretty fluent in Paul's thoughts because I mean that's that's the hard work of being like a you know this trip paid by someone to like go straight for him essentially it's like you have to really understand what they want to do in Romans yet tertius he was clearly a follower of Jesus but you couldn't necessarily take that for granted that everybody in the guild would be a follower of Jesus so yeah we don't we don't know what we do know is this was a whole profession and Guild of scribes and they did it for money
 I have nothing to say because they love the content you know until those are just untold stories that we have about about the letters letters were expensive we do know that match that's why I almost all of them are so short he was riding the most expensive is the material and time of the secretaries time yeah yeah he did a very rough estimate and he wrote his book in 2004 and estimated that Romans are 1st Corinthians in 2004 with have been composed beginning to end to the tune of about $2,300 is the probably more like 2020 so maybe $5,000 now something oh we've doubled since 2004 I don't know 2,000 thousand something from Richards is you have a whole set
 and where it talks about the rule of people who carried and delivered letters that this was a really important role cuz he didn't have certified mail only people who worked in or had friends related to government work could use the Roman the official Roman postal system so in other words merchants and private letters are all this is all private which means a whole layer of the economy developed about Messengers but it's all private it's all as you say it's called the postal service is only used for the United States United Postal Service or if there was but there was if you were working for the government correct yeah that's right cuz there's a whole private Messenger Service who which meant that letter carriers really important you don't just put in the
 you put it in the hands of somebody who you know and who so this is why at the end of Romans Paul introduces Phoebe and commends her we'll probably doing at the beginning of run 16 is commanding Phoebe as an influential devoted follower of Jesus leader in the Christian Movement and she's going to deliver the letter he also makes a case some people disagreed with Richard's but there are some people who agree with him that very often letter carriers were the ones to read aloud and aurelie perform the letter was received in the letter isn't just carry it but it's actually two then go perform it and be the one to read it aloud in which case it seems likely that's why he's giving Phoebe such a huge boost at beginning around the 16 cuz she's the messenger cuz she's the one
 delivering the letter so a lot of this is scholarly and friends but for me it's really enriched my reading of the letters I don't know if that's the case. You having right now but as we go on and it really helped me begin to make sense of a lot of features in and Apostolic letters
 it is cool to think about Paul or any of these authors in their daily routine really like in a community of people talking the stuff through yeah trying to figure it out and for some reason it feels you can tell you're a new thought that some guy for hire was actually had a massive role in the composition of the letters it's one of those factors that make you have to go back and I think nuanced and form a more robust view what we mean when we say the Bible is inspired this it's a Divine and human word that through these human processes Paul on the road talking about Theology and what should we write the Corinthians in this letter cuz we just got the report
 oh yeah and then over weeks he's ashamed out with Brian of this since Austin is this this mess and then the phone the letter and to imagine God's spirit at work and then through who do they pick his secretary was it just somebody who had Paul do that you know we don't know where I know the secretary was a follower of Jesus or not that can feel intimidating may be threatening maybe to somebody's view of the Bible is God's word but I guess I would invite us to more just to take it on board and then to imagine that it's through these human process is the God has chosen to speak to the church through these letters I think it's beautiful to imagine but it's taking me awhile to get there another thing that I've I'm struggling with is that sometimes these letters
 feel like they could have been even more composed if they had more time for drafts and I almost just felt like when it's a letter of course he was going to do draft after draft after draft and get this into a polished form to it cuz it's the latter but now you're saying like we'll know you actually think of it more like a literary work yeah that was polished and which case I feel like some of the stuff would have been polished out potentially well and again it's a collection so not every letter is identical each letter has its own story and process Romans reads way more polished the 2nd Corinthians but when you're in many sections of 2nd Corinthians there's a little mini sections that seemed really really worked out and check the three movements that are each really coherent some people have posited that it's in fact three different letters cuz they seem independent of each other chapters one through seven chapters 8 and 9 and then chapter 10
 13 or you could posit that these are three preformed B that were brought together in a final composition so I think it's a variety 1st Corinthians feels pretty on polishing certain sections the very polished others so I think it's huge mountains of importance Urology don't hang on this team or getting the feel for how these letters cuz this is not how I write letters I don't even write letters and emails and texts I wrote letters to summer camp I told ya before but this is before email yeah that's right 1st John man it's a work of art 1st John to work of art it hardly feels like a letter feels like a poem things like that so with all that in mind as we step into each of the letters it's having just our imaginations a little more accurately stalked you for
 how we mentioned these letters came into existence where I'd like to go here and this gets us more into form of the letters I think we could summarize all of that in like 30 seconds to just talk about the apostles on the road 4 minutes material The Next Step will be when people write letters they usually are using a template of some kind that they're plugging in the details into that template and for Century letters a template and Paul made good use of it and so did the other Apostles both in using the template and then speaking at in really interesting ways better listening to this episode of Bible project podcast.
