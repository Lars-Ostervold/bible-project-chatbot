all right we have some questions from this series we did ya on the family of God from the family of God is God and so you you went through when you selected some if you haven't to follow along with Family Guy series maybe these will feel I left field maybe not I don't even know we got tons of questions so I try and pick the ones that are repeated the most to make sure we address you know what is are the most common questions also I'm always ambitious that this will finally be the quman are that we get through more than like four questions and then episode I'll move us along okay let's do this okay one is Sarah from England I'm Sarah I'm from England and I live in Bosnia-Herzegovina I enjoyed our discussion on Genesis 10 about the different nations descended from Noah and another episode you talked about the kenites I don't want it to
 ask how they were still descendants of Cain After the flood I've learned so much from your podcast in videos thanks for all you do I didn't bring it up when you and I talked about it and I didn't even think I didn't even think to ask about it I knew that the thing and I knew that somebody would ask it and it was actually the most repeated question out of any qnr we've ever received there were so many questions about the same thing so I love it I knew I was poking poking the bear came in the first generation second generation payments and Abel Brothers murders his brother Abel and then he's goes east and he's and then the he start the city the city see marry his wife out there and build a city full of some population right right so much people talk about that in the next question but his name is actually in Hebrew kind transliterate
 it would be qayin Cayenne Cayenne so what the narrative says is a trace of Seven Generations through him up to a guy named Lemak violent death came guy has two wives in the Bible and you told of three sons from Lemak yacht all you've all to all Kane or to Volcanion the third son has clients name in it and what you're told is that these are the fathers of all these different orally industry the ones the father of those play music once the father of the migrating Shepherd groups and then to call Cayenne was the first metallurgist like the blacksmith insomnio about that is this the narrative is set within before the flat right but yet you're being told that it's from canes
 a sentence that these first practices of industry in culture and civilization started to come from cuz there was supposed to Before the Flood exactly is this from the perspective of the narrator and the readers who are all After the flood to the question is why does that matter I see if they are all wiped out in the flood Noah his descendants are talked about is if they started things that are still going in the reader stay right right and it's worth noticing you know the flood that happened cans descendants are described in a way as if they made a lasting contribution to human civilization but you know they were wiped out and let's say it had to all be then restart restart it through Noah's family and they remember because and they're just giving credit to Canada
 restart it and of course none of us in The Narrative of Genesis 10 or 11:00 so the curiosity is After the flood you get into the book of Exodus rest of him to do if you get in the book of numbers and you start meeting a people group that has cayennes name called the Caney or the kainji in Hebrew and English translated not with the spelling of Cain's name but with k e n Ken nights but it's the same word in Hebrew. So just like you got a lot has two sons from his daughters cuz I'm drunk sex in the case of the mowers and Amin from home come the moabites and appetites are all kinds of people groups will be an ancestor and then the people who come from them are called by that name the same thing here and then come the cainites let's create a roadmap so let's think of him as the ancestor
 of the cainites that you meet on the other side of the flood later on the Bible it seems like you are supposed to think of him that way so let's say we have to say yes to that question of all kinds of evidence that makes sense of that one that's the normal way ancestors and people groups are named in the Bible who in Baylands oracles standing up on the cliff overlooking after He blesses Israel he starts pronouncing other Oracles of other nations and in chapter 24 of numbers East it says he looked at the Caney the cainites and he start speaking about them and then the next time he calls them the straight-up can call the people that he sees I do for Father's name he calls and I happen to know he's the king of Moab Moab Elders of the midianites we're all working together so
 able to come from Cain and then what else makes sense why the through design patterns whenever these figures appear it's where you get a surprising reconciliation of hostile brothers so it's as if the hostility of Kane gets reversed when sibling rivalries are healed or overcome later on in the story to the cainites are mostly like a a good guy group that keeps rejoining Israel on these interesting different ways to Marion Moses or rescuing the Israelites jail and son so that's all on the yes side if these are the cainites come from Cain people do make the argument that they don't come from Cain the main reason being that would be wiped out they would have wiped out in the flood so it just so happens you meet a group of people along the way called cainites there must have been another game you have just some other people do that to happen to have the same name as similar name doesn't mean that the Sara Lee there's a genealogical connection
 answer those are essentially the two choices The Interpreter steak and you can start commentators up on each side pros and cons so related to that first fork in the road is the other question of okay let's say you choose yes they are connected we're just kind of the Assumption you made when you walked us through the table Nation correct and everything which is about how did the descendants of Cain survive the flood so one option you can you not take off the map is that they watched what is the aronofsky's Noah movie together together does Noah oh yeah makes up a really minority view in Jewish legend that to Vulcan which is that third son of lime actually escaped and hid himself on the ark
 so it's nothing about that in the in the Bible that it is a possibility it's a possibility that some juice. Explains why you would need cainites yeah there was a stowaway so one option would be to say did the K9 survive the flood you can answer now in which case the later can I see me and have no connection if you say yes there are some interesting options if you follow that route stowaway during was into the line so that by the time you get to Noah either his wife know his wife or any of the wives of Noah's sons maybe she could come again nothing about this in the biblical text Buddha saying Before the Flood there was a line coming from Seth and a line coming from Kane
 Seth was a third child if a table at minis have one more send Seth the line that leads to Noah yeah I see it wasn't completely separate correct so you're asking will know how do eyes and his sons all have wives yeah what families do they come from OK Google text and say so that's one possibility that the last one is that there's actually a glitch in the it's a glitch in the narrative another word there actually and there's another group of people you meet before the flood that you made after the flat we've talked about this before the Nephilim the Nephilim yet cuz they're a part of the violence on the land that leads to flood and then the Israelites meet definitely him in the promised land in the land so there's actually two groups of people can I reappear after the flood that shouldn't be there for a so that's you just being skeptical you're just
 noticing details in the Bible so there's nothing you could say they just happened to be more on the other side by the same name correctly or the kenites or you can say It's actually an acknowledgement by the biblical authors that the cosmic language of the flood Cosmic being Cosmic go to kill they took over the whole world every crystal and all the mountains were submerged that it's intentionally hyperbolic language to describe a catastrophic flood as an as the undoing of the cosmos from their point of view is so interesting the way all these you pull on one question about Kay and in cases Mendes and you end up with you know classic debates about the flood and you've brought up before that in terms of like another Hot Topic being is real killing other tribes that like
 yes the biblical narrative essay wipe them all out and then later in the story you meet them. Them again that's right and so either so again you would say there's some hyperbole correctly and I see those two examples are related because in the Book of Joshua the Israelites being commissioned to dispossess the tribes of the Canaanites in the Hill Country it's presented in the narrative as another flood as a flood of divine Justice on the generation of Canaanites so that there's no flame in K nights before the flood and after the flood the fact that there's Canaanites before Joshua but then after Joshua even though right in between will left nothing alive here just that gives a clue that both of those narratives are ratcheting up hyperbolic language to make a theological point and so I know that the view that might make some people uncomfortable
 but actually it's a pretty ancient interpretation that's been in both Jewish and Christian Traditions viewing the flood and the conquest of Canaan as using hyperbolic language and it would be the theological point that the hyperbole is making and I probably would be about that it's a decreation moment that the flood is undoing of Genesis 1 right precisely so that God can now begin a new people to restart and carve out a new order eating spot to the hyperbole is is is brushing up this idea of like starting again and that the inventor of cosmic significant way more complex and we can treat in a human are there help of perspectives to say that the landscape of interpretations everybody has to deal with these details in the text and some people prioritize some of the details of our others but there are some just pure Skeptics out there and they just want to debunk the Bible
 make it seem like it's primitive stupid ancient literature but for the most part people of Goodwill for trying to understand the narratives are trying to account for all of these details that are sometimes intention with each other and so the kenites are a great example of a thank you Sarah super perceptive question I hope at least that gives away of the land for the discussions this next question is from Ariel in Canada hi there my name is Air Canada I'm wondering how did Adam and Eve's children continue to procreate Genesis for talks about how after Cain killed Abel he found wife had a son named Enoch and he built cities if Adam and Eve were in the Protestant Tradition at least considered to be the first people here on Earth where did Cain find a wife and how did he build cities
 other another great question I mean this classic classic where did Cain's wife come from totally of this issue with the name of this issue but he built the first city we don't think like New Yorker break you know to buy something here which means a walled you know a collection of homes in the village with a wall around it but even still where did those people those people come from classic question all the way back to ancient Jewish and Christian readers part of the reason why I wanted to dress it Ariel was because one I just listened to a brand new book that's incorporating that question into a bunch of others that I'm actually really excited about like so much from and help me process this question in the new way so that the narrative just presents this as a matter of fact it doesn't give you any explanations as to as the
 and so again you have a fork in the road for interpretation could stay in Genesis 5 you learned Adam and Eve had other children after Seth it says other sons and daughters and so could it be that can married one of the sisters and then some or some other siblings and they went off and you have built the city and so on so that's technically possible however the narrative presents Kane did it says that he went away from the presence of Yahweh and God said you'll be a Wanderer and if he took off on his own from the family murdered his brother he's exiled from his family and you go somewhere else Mary is a wife built a city it's clear that the narrative raises it as a genuine possibility that he meets other people and intermarried with them and
 build a city there that's a real viable possibility raised by the text itself it seems It's hard to imagine that the author didn't know that there was a problem with being raised their many ways could have given details to solve that and clearly that wasn't on the agenda the author so going back in ancient Jewish and Christian tradition and it raises the question of the existence of people outside the garden so one other additional it's not at biblical evidence or anything like that but it is interesting Adam and Eve begin a design pattern of God selecting a couple appointing them in an ideal Eden like situation and then giving them opportunities at Pastor Phil and his wife example of Abraham and Sarah Isaac and Rebekah Jacob and Rachel and Leah it keeps happening over the design pattern and so question is are we meant to take that design pattern and fur
 rack and understand the Adam and Eve are being either a pointed out of a larger population or being created in scholarly conversation didn't know though a Latin phrase meaning brand new without parents will there be there made out of mud of being made of dust which is the correct meaning more Mortal so are we meant to infer the Adam and Eve are appointed or created as a royal priesthood from among the larger population and again there's a genda isn't to talk about that explain where they just don't go there so interesting perspectives and some new research by recently came across that just has me thinking new directions all this I'll just name it one is a scientist whose follower of Jesus his name is Joshua swamidass came out with a A Reason book called the genealogical
 Adam and Eve and all I can do is recommend it or Google it and he's done many interviews now on podcast and shows and listen to one of the interviews will summarize ideas in the book I learned more about genetics I mean of course I just told you I don't know but what I learned was so counterintuitive and surprising okay and what is done is actually made this an interdisciplinary project so he has worked through the content of the book with workshops of scientist Christian and we're not Christian and theologians of the whole Christian tradition and he's crafted the conclusions of the book that are really surprising that's that's all I want to say I want to encourage people to take in the book one of the biblical Scholars that he worked with and developed thing kind of the feces of his book is a scholar the name c John Collins who has a great book on Genesis 12 11 called reading Genesis well
 and both of them are trying to help this modern readers adjust their expectations ancient Jewish literature and the way it's talking about these events is not the same way that we talk about them are conceived of these things and so are y'all your question actually it is addressed in in the work of these two Scholars and if you follow their footnotes you'll find that there to the end even more conversations and so I just want to make sure we brought that up cuz I'm excited about this new work happening in Genesis some good homework this next question is from Angie in Washington state my question is in the discussion of the creation account in Genesis you talk about the Adan being created first and that that stands for Humanity not a male human but in 1st Corinthians 11 Paul seems to state that men were created first in women's
 second is he saying something different here what's going on is there a contradiction thanks for all you do you guys are amazing
 look at all these people just fine in the tale of a little things look like I love it I love it to like another set of brains just kind of keeping us on as yet yeah totally yeah in this was another point where I knew that I was opening the Canada something because that was a bit I mean you really were purposely making that point that it wasn't like there was just human and then he needed a woman that Adam was representing all he made it he was split in half and then email so let's just about that interpretation based on the Genesis narrative itself then there's a question of we have a text in the New Testament that has a diff seems to read it in a different way so let's take an 11 to steps so first let's just retrace real quick if you did the first time the words Adam appears is in Genesis 1
 in the image of God pump whenever there's a dumb and then Hebrew hot a dumb and weird hot as our words though so that the first time I am without the God said let us make a dumb in our dimension on our likeness and then there's after that there's a little Pond and there is high tide on God created Adam and His Image in the image of God he created that is hot dog a vanity and then Haddam is explained for you male and female so your top of page one that the phrase hot dog means male a male and female to bed at the species Turn Turn the Page in Genesis 25 you told the creation story but from a different timeline different angle and it begins saying there was no plants or farming because there was no Haddam to work the ground but there was an ed the first tool
 does of Adam in the river stream stream that came up out of the Altima the dirt in a bed comes from the other so there was no Adam to work the ground but it came up from the other, and water the face of the Optima she got clay and that's what God is that if he works the clay and your forms add-on so they're the word play choice of the word island is also most closely connected to the Audemars which is the ground so Adam has two main nuances now two species term and it's a term describing connection of Origins from the Altima and so in other words the portrait of Adam as a male human doesn't seem at all that's something the author is trying to emphasize or put in front of us to other things of that is
 species tournament Altamonte and then in Genesis 2:18 the first thing that is no no good is that you have the hot Dom is alone and then you get the the deep sleep and The Taking of the side so here's the track once you get the taking of the side and then God builds that side into East Shaw and then the guy wakes up and he says this is Isha cuz she's taken from each so the atom that the residual Adam that's left over calls himself each and each is a Hebrew word for male male female male female man woman and then from that point on in the narrative the female is called a shot in the mail can go be referred to in to West as or as a dumb and so both indominus can then refer to the male human
 I'm and also used to mean a species of humanity as well as can refer to the humanity as a species after that so I threw out the rest of the Bible correct the main point there is the the meaning of the word Adam before the splitting of the atom primarily is connected to the ground connection yeah and that the the gender differentiating only comes after the splitting so that's just a feature of the narrative that I think is really eliminating because then what's going to happen in the next line is about God's ideal Destiny is for those two who were the one was so you could say that prior to the splitting the atom contains both genders both halves and then to split and then and then become one again
 there's also a little detail in Genesis 3 when the snake starts talking to the woman and the snake you know says did God really say this and then what the woman says she repeats the Divine command she says God told us in the narrative in Genesis to that Divine Divine command is given before the atom is split that make sense sorry in Genesis to give the command to not eat from the Tree of feeling good and bad before he split side. But the woman includes herself among those whom God told to not eat from the tree that's pretty wild it's a really it said interesting little detail so that explains a lot of details of the text so if you want to learn more about this the other is a couple Scholars one is in provan Hebrew Bible scholar who wrote a really fun Theology of Genesis 1 through 11 called seriously dangerous real
 this is so fascinating and he walks you through the eaten there to you in a way that really gets you thinking and actually he built into his footnotes a whole lot of Jewish and Christian interpreters to history who have understood this to be what's going on so that's the first step so in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians which is actually the second letter to the Corinthians and that's important for each question so frequencies 11th one of the most complicated texting all of Paul's letters to understand his reasoning is line of thought his choice of vocabulary and the way that he quotes from alludes to Genesis 1 and 2 it's not easy to follow so I'll spare you the details I am persuaded that this is one of those texts where Paul is quoting from the letter the Corinthians wrote to him and dialogue and in
 reacting with it cuz there's a part it has to do with certain men and women were putting their head razors their heads on Waze when they get together in the in the worship Gathering and he finds what the men are doing and what the women are doing to be really inappropriate and distracting and not giving the right picture of the new Humanity to their neighbors it should be the trick is what translation do you read will determine a lot of what you get out of it but you got an iv open yeah so that the key vs. really start in verse 7 but anytime you read any of the Apple paragraph you want you read verses 7 through 12 a man ought not cover his head since he is the image and glory of God the woman is the glory of man
 man did not come from woman but women from man neither was Man created for woman but woman for man is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head because of the Angels because Angel nevertheless in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor his man independent woman for his woman come from man so also man is born of woman but everything comes from God yeah yeah this is this strikes you as a kind of misogynistic text or we go there any happening about how men are doing something with her hair heads and the covering their head putting something over their heads, and women are crazy hats this is backwards not sending all the wrong signals so there's this reflection about
 a male is the image and glory of God but a woman is is the is the image and glory of the male here that's exactly the words that sentence is the opposite of what Genesis 1 26 and 27 opposite Point simple face value reading didn't come from women but women from man that's a conclusion from the energy you can get there from Genesis to neither was Man created for woman but woman for man you could interpret Genesis 2 with that kind of meaning and then the conclusion so for this reason a woman ought to have some sign of authority on her or have authority on her head how you translate that lines extremely complicated so basically two options because of the Angels
 verse 11 comes along and 12 and seems to bring a counter perspective but nevertheless in Greek it's the word playing it means however is the contrasting got it in other words what happens in the next census is meant to contrast with just that good however however in the Lord in Curious which is in the body of the Messiah men and women are not independent of each other and you know that starts to sound a little more like Paul and Genesis to listen woman came from man and man is born of woman and everything comes from God words versus 11 and 12 sounds like they're actually offering a perspective that counter in a sentence
 totally and so this is happens multiple chapters throughout the letter where he quotes from something from the Corinthians letter to him before ya and in that there's no quotation marks in in the Greek cracked so you kind of have to infer where they would be that's right because the way that letters would have been drafted and sent and performed for the audience people would have been given q's and instruction and training of her how to read the letter to know what's Paul's voice was not his voice that's how this device this rhetorical device work easier if they just use quotation marks it doesn't seem like people all over the planet would be respectful but but what you do best whole time we was there a such a device back in the in the original Drafting and then the sending putting it in the hands of some
 it was trained to go and read it out loud and understand how to read it yes I sent you this is how I mean that's a very compelling reading verses 7 8 and 9 you're like what is he getting that it's the most recent and articulate exponent of this view the New Testament scholar Lucy pepiot and her book women and worship at Corinth is a whole bucket on the scripture in 1st Corinthians 11 chapter 14 and she is not just her via do you have a long history but she's the most recent and I think kind of persuasive that versus a multiple lines in the paragraph are not Paul's voice and this is such an easy to spot example I think now they're people really smart food take a different view of and so I respect that but
 part of it is that it's the view of verses 7 through 9 + 10 is counter to the face value reason he goes on to say though about in verse 13 and following the men and women of Corinth far they're pushing the boundaries of the kind of signals their appearances give off in the worship Gathering and he wants the worship Gathering to be a genuine display of a new kind of model for human relationships and of the relationships between men and women and he gets on the mend for having long hair or for the women for not grow their hair long and doing something the vocabulary in the way more complicated than English translations give off a certain seems like you just throw it back at them is good for yourself is it proper for me to pray with her head uncovered
 call back in their court so it's kind of the point is like look you guys have to figure this out it's like Paul wants them to worship and unity and to display Gods had a manifold with him but he doesn't prescribe them the exact thing to do is just he says like is he's trying to help mostly none Israelites learn to inhabit a new cultural narrative based on the story of Jesus and being brought into the story of Israel and then you have to learn how to think messianically think Christian Lee about communal behavior in individual behavior in light of this story and then you figure it out what kinds of behaviors are but then he actually does seem to prescribe something because he says if anyone wants to be contentious about this what's this
 they must be contagious about this we do many other practical totally what's the best the long hair oh about yeah I think about the guidance that he's giving hear the trick is it that in this paragraph he actually alludes to the fact that they've already had conversations about this before he says I want to encourage you for remembering me and everything and holding to the Traditions that I passed on to you the we had lots of conversations about the sun about the worship Gathering how it works there's a lot that you're doing great in but there's a handful of things about how what women and men are doing with their hair and then he starts interacting with quotes from their letter back and forth throughout the whole paragraph and then at the end says listen if you want to be more problematic about this just remembers what I talked about and that we don't have any other practice and here's what the other churches or Demi so here is why
 yeah it was he saying that woman comes from man toilet actually is a real tension explain that is a very specific and new conclusion based on. I guess it's a reinterpretation of the image of God, Genesis one or more likely is that he's quoting from what he sees as a misunderstanding of Genesis 1 and then he offers his own correction to it so anyway check out Lucy's book and her footnotes if you want to I learned about this in more depth this next question is from the Lindsey in Pennsylvania and I'm from Lancaster Pennsylvania and I just listened to the episode on sibling rivalry and biblical election and I was wondering how the conquest narratives fit into this idea it seems the Israelites were given Specific Instructions to completely annihilate and wipe out certain people groups who were
 living in the land are these people groups that are outside of and separate from Abraham's family or is this just a really intense case of sibling rivalry what's going on there and we alerted to this and the question what flood we did briefly address that you raised this question somewhere along the line we had a brief conversation about it but not in-depth you're talking other than today in this is some earlier in the series I think we're in the prophets and you brought up a similar question to Lindsay but we only talked about for a brief moment present all kinds of important growth moments
 growth opportunities for do you mean for me and lots and lots of other people they're challenging many levels challenges from how you put together the character of God from all the stories in the Bible how do you integrate them how do you square them with teaching non-violence in the teachings of Jesus and the narratives about religious-inspired violence are really sensitive topics right now and so finding these narratives you know in the Christian scriptures or do scriptures are challenging so just I'm just acknowledging Lindsay you're not alone so many people send in questions about this and how it fits in so I'm actually still and maybe I will be the rest of my life I'm still working out how to process through the set of questions I do think it is a part of the design pattern
 playing rivalry for sure but an interesting way so maybe one one place to start is the design pattern of the flood that we talked earlier about in this conversation is actually really significant another words what the flood narrative is trying to tell you about how God responds to human communities that have reached the point of such extreme violence and degradation of human dignity what is got to do with human communities like that in this world
 and the Theology of the flood narrative is it's within God's prerogative of God series with Krista forgot to hand Humanity over to the outcome of its decisions and let the cosmos itself collapse in on them and let us see ology of the flood narrative but then what happens after the flood has no offers that sacrifice the intercessor gets up on the high place surrenders everything and What God Says is you know humans haven't changed implication being still evil I could still if I can still do this again but that's cuz I'm not going to do it again do a cosmic collapse but what will happen through the design pattern of the flood is local floods local of divine dental abscess God will hand specific human families are cities are places over to a cosmic collapse that they themselves
 starting tomorrow it's all mapped onto that are similar the rebellion of the tribe of the family of Korah in the wilderness for the Earth splits open so the conquest narrative is all designed on the same analogy to the Canaanites are depicted throughout the pentateuch in the Torah coming from the line of ham and the line of ham itself began with that act of sexual assault that hamdan some foreign to his father or mother difference interpretive use their the point is that the family line has sexual abuse and that keeps repeating the pattern of their ancestors and so the portrait of the Canaanites in the Torah is a super - I mean child sacrifice really distorted sexually abusive practices and so by the time you reach the Book of Joshua they are like unto the generation of the floods filling the Earth with so much violence
 the gods play Abraham says to God wants to judge of all the Earth do justice in the Psalms crying out rise up O Lord indicate the oppressed and so the conquest narrative in that frame is viewed as an act of divine judgment on a generation that's gone past the point of no return so I'm not saying that's comfortable comfortable because what what keeps me from being part of that people that went to the point no returned exactly that was done was born where I was born in the family was born in in the flood I supposes as uncomfortable as problems for the personal problems we have with the same problems raised by the story of the flood there's a different manifestation of it so none of this is solved anything for me is it I'm just trying to understand the narratives on their own terms if the difference between the flood in the narrative
 is that the waters that are the vehicle of God's judgment in the case of the conquest are the Israelites to the next layer of challenges thanks through another correct so and specifically that the way God is dealing with the problem of human violence and evil is to keep committing himself more and more and more to one human family and invest God keep investing himself in the future and security of this one human family and so we talked about this was Abraham when he lies to pharaoh and then got sent plagues on Egypt but Joe did nothing wrong. Sarah what he did is went into Kings do which isn't too just like I want that woman in my harem and you take her like that Zach's not at all sure what the point is is that his motives weren't to steal another man's wife it was he thought she was available because Abraham made him believe that because of Abraham's deceptions
 the one at fault in the store and he does in the second time he really is at fault cuz God comes to the the second time he does that God comes to that king of them black and says you're a dead man and I've been like since what an innocent and I didn't know he lied to me I got to like yeah I know you're innocent you are a god become God standing up for the family he elected whether they are good or bad and they're often bad even worse than their neighbors and so this is another uncomfortable portrait of God and we're back to that thing of will God there's two poles are there's God's justice and there's that's commitment to his promises to somehow workout Redemption through this one family and every time they act even worse he doubles down and finds himself more to this family so by the time you get to Joshua God's fully committed to and invested in the sea
 purity of this Federation of tribes going to inhabit this land has been promised to their ancestor and so there's 7ish people groups in this hill country that are like under the generation of the flood and God wants to dispossess them and put his people in their place and that's how God is going to fulfill his promises to them so that is uncomfortable but that is the logic of the narrative another piece then as you get into the battle narratives and the language of wipe them out leave no one breathing we're back to the hyperbole issue because there are lots of Canaanites still alive and breathing in this very land right after all the narratives of battle there's like a nice place the rest of the story so they didn't actually do what God fully told him to do anyway so the last step where at least I go in this
 is to say if I read the Bible as a unified store at least Jesus whose name is Joshua and his name is Joshua the ultimately where the store is going is that God commits himself to such a degree to this Human family that eventually he himself becomes the victim of the violence that humans have been committing and that God himself has participated in throughout the story God becomes the victim of the story of violence that he's been at work through and take it into himself on the cross and so those are all factors that have helped me process the Book of Joshua isn't the end of the biblical the story comes with a combination in in Jesus's life death and resurrection and somehow all of those works together for me and in a way that's helping me think about the stories but I'm still not I still have lots of questions and I'm sure you do to find Z and w
 how to do I know when you hear all these different angles what do you think John well you know so part of me just thinks are we dancing around this when maybe you know Occam's razor would suggest the simplest solution is that this literature came from a group of people who just thought God was on their side and thought that that's why they needed to go and take you out humans for all of human history have taken each other out tell him I need excuses for why that it's okay so you know that's kind of the NSAID just kind of like yeah but we believe that this new Jesus believed that the scripture was God breathed and lied to him and fits into a story that gives us a portrait of God and so we believe there's something more than just that getting there just this group of people using their daughters in
 Keith Sweat by other people and what you suggested I think two things that feel separate but then together kind of create a way through this one being the out the whole idea of God's Wrath of cosmic he wants humans to be representing him and bringing goodness Tove and instead there's all this violence and Corruption so in his anger he lets Humanity kind of pulled back in and destroy itself and the cosmos full back in and be destroyed and we talked a lot about this in and everything is so you're saying that is part of these conquests which is that there was some level of corruption that God this was done with a while he's not doing it on
 the level of the whole Cosmos like it didn't and Noah's generation that still happens that's one piece and then the second piece you said was that there was this weird almost glitch I don't know how to describe it. Glad there's just this weird kind of like sticky mess that God gets himself into by electing Israel maybe I didn't I didn't quite describe it I think from The Narrative point of view it's a it's a mess that God is putting himself in as a part of the plan yeah yeah the guy says I'm going to choose this one family and I'm going to stand up for them and I'm going to make their name great and now he's he's obligated himself to this people and what happens if they go off the rails it's almost kind of like any parent in their kid it's like you bring this kid in the world and you're obligated yourself to them they go off the rails you know
 still your child and you get the you get this conundrum right at the beginning was Abraham's I mean right out of the gate and so there's the whole this whole issue of God standing up for people that don't really deserve it correct and the Jacob store is make it even more plan cuz he's even worse and he's named Israel the low point is in these two figures Abraham and Jacob you get the whole basic point that this family is they're not good people but God is going to keep committing himself to them which is not great news for them all the time sometimes it's good news depending on what it means is that they are even liable for greater judgment than the Nations around them and so it puts them in a bind as well as God yeah so that doesn't solve all the tension because I think some of the other tension bubbles up from like what about
 disturb the sanctity of human life and I don't know second chance that she has is in Redemption and all these things these apart that if I'm reading this story as a part of Canada is it gone or dead oh I understand Jesus came but they don't care they're dead totally fine with you about if I'm reading this as a unified store is Elisa Jesus what it means now is that I follow Jesus and he's a part of this long complicated story with a lot of casualties along the way that God participated in and that God's climactic statement is a statement where he becomes the victim of the whole violence story as his ultimate response to at all and that I another words I don't take the Book of Joshua as my marching orders right I take the second Joshua's words
 is my marching orders which is The Sermon on the Mount here which tells me that there was a moment when God did that but now what God is saying and has stepped through Jesus's death and I'm a follower of Jesus thats Ground Zero because God has changed I think it would say God operated in different ways so this is this is where Protestant tradition of dispensationalism has a whole history and reputation now normal English words different strategies in different seasons of working with Humanity in the family favorite ham but there's an element of Truth in that perspective because The Sermon on the Mount issues in a different types of behaviors than what he told the first Joshua to you just can't deny that but they're both in the same Bible says question is how did the to Joshua's relate to each other and if you have
 Narrative Approach that was what God did that a moment in the family history but we're at a different moment family history and we take our marching orders from the second Joshua and it doesn't resolve the things that God did in the past you just have to sit with them and I at this point that's where I'm at I know I need to do more processing on this question but that that's where I'm at present we're out of time do Ross's Ross you got in this is from Ross in Virginia hello my name is Ross title from Virginia Beach Virginia my question is about the design pattern of election specifically when Jesus was speaking to the Jewish leadership in Matthew 2143 this is where Jesus said and I quote the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruits what do you think this meant the Jewish leadership then and how do you think we should interpret this today thank you for your thoughts
 yeah that's a great question one of the issues that became even more clear for me working through this theme having these conversations view John was supposed to say shoes related to what in the process and tradition has been given different titles replacement theology how does the church come from Jesus relate to Israel and the problem is a lot of our terms for these things are really blurry what they mean and so you can be using the same language as a top have this conversation but mean really different things you're not using the same words so Ross you talk about a moment where Jesus is critiquing the strata of Israelite leadership in Jerusalem which has been a constant opponent of Jesus in the gospels narratives
 and so what are you saying it is hey y'all had been given a gift of stewardship leadership over God's covenant people over whom the ones over whom God Reigns but you forfeited that chance and the renewal Messianic renewal movement that I'm working on this is the people will that will produce its fruit so one way to think of that is Jesus the saying is really you've blown it too many times I'm taking this the nation's so you could take it to me in there Israel yeah Jesus came to start a new thing that things called The Church yes and that's going to give me my draw but that way of talking about it is so problematic with the actual details of the story cuz Jesus is an Israelite everybody in Jesus movement
 are Israelites yeah so this is not about something replacing Israel this is the same thing that Jeremiah was doing when he stood up in the temple and critiqued the leaders of Jerusalem and said you're going into Exile Badlands coming to take you out and God's going to make a new covenant and raise up a renewed people from within Israel it's the design pattern or it's the idea of the remnants Remnant a smaller group who are faithful to the Covenant with God will use as a seed bad toothache to start over so this is not about anybody replacing Israel it's about a renewed Israel being raised up in the place of a corrupt leadership race with John the Baptist was also doing
 so the story of the gospels is about the creation of a new Messianic renewal of Israel and book of Acts begins with that crew with that Messianic Jewish groups with swelling numbers and then the logic is then none Israelites this was our family, who crafted it are grafted in they become Cowan Heritage is Paul's language from Ephesians coaers covati members but it's not Israelites being brought into Israel right it's not about a group of people replacing Israel yeah is real be made to include non Israelites to become the family of the Messiah is out maybe what when pulse is not as real as Israel he's meeting at there was a Remnant am continuing always have a Remnant line here but the point from the whole Arc of the biblical narrative is for that Remnant to then become open to integrate all
 the others and just wasn't talking about that the opening up to the others he was talking about the Revenant yeah I think what you're talkin about Ross is the mower Jesus is like the leaders of Israel are done yeah I'm doing the newest reason I bought the crew and the new Israel and to bring about the New Covenant renew this real that will become the vehicle of God's blessing to the to the nation's so that's release in the that's how it would fit in something like a comment like that from Jesus rocks would fit in to that so it's just a film it it's a new New Covenant is a real expanded when he says there's like other sheep it was at the end of the other sheets that are not of this fold here in allusion to the inclusion of them than honest tree lights into the equation of the noise when I think so I think so there's some people who think it's reference to the Samaritans were the D Aspera
 exactly okay we got that one in this Ross awesome thanks everybody for your great question. Thank you everybody that's great to hear what you're all thinking and processing we have two interviews that we're going to release in the next two weeks on the podcast and they both are around the theme of the family of God so they fit in really well I'm excited to release those and then after that we are starting a brand new series on the theme of Royal priests priests who are also Kings Kings were priests and this idea how it goes throughout the whole biblical narrative and it was so cool it was such a good conversation that instead of writing one theme video I forced him to write 16 videos about this yeah so we're going to have a series
 so we're doing it again on this thing more priests and so you'll see those videos coming and that conversation coming and everything that we make is to show up and help us expand to buy was unified story that leads to Jesus and everything we make gets to be free because it's been paid for by people like you who generously I've done that and we're incredibly grateful for this show to Spider-Man demo and show notes by Lyndsay Ponder and the theme music by the band intense thanks for being a part of this with us this is a line EK from Nigeria to protect from my boss
 stumbled on one of the videos on YouTube about Bible project from a couple years ago we got me all to the podcast and since then has been a whole lot of time watching the red scriptures series and a lot of the same videos on YouTube as well also during a lockdown time I've been getting up early before the rest of my house all gets out in about an hour. I just let him from the classroom courses and I found was really helpful as well have a project is it makes the Bible easy to understand regardless if it is your first time reading the Bible or if you read the Bible for years I use Bible project the front of my Bible in a year reading plan to give an overview of each book before I delve in my favorite thing about Bible project book of the Bible using engaging animation of everything about our project is how they prevent scripture simply and holistically you know why that really recapture those things long-lost in Christianity I know I've been a Christian myself for a very long time and I just feel
 we're doing the courses and watching videos that when I read the Bible now it's like I'm reading the Bible for the first time we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus or crowdfunded project by people like me
