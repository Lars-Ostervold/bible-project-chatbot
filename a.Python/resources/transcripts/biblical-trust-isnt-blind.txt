Jon Hey, this is Jon at BibleProject. Today is our last episode in what’s 
turned out to be a really long series discussing the character 
of God. We’ve been looking at five attributes that God actually 
gives Himself in a verse in Exodus 34. “Yahweh, Yahweh, a God 
compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loyal love and 
faithfulness. Today, Carissa, Tim, and I are going to look at that fifth 
and final attribute of God—His faithfulness, or in Hebrew Emet. 
Carissa  “Emet” means trust, trustworthy, faith, belief. So it encompasses all of 
those ideas, but it’s rooted around this idea of trust or trustworthiness.
Jon God is faithful and trustworthy.
Carissa  This is a really important word for the Christian faith. If we 
think about what it means to trust in God, that’s usually 
how we define what it means to be a Christian.
Jon Right. If you ask most people what it means to be a Christian, they’d 
likely say to have faith in God or more specifically to have faith in Jesus. 
Sometimes this begins to feel like a cliché. “Just have faith. Just believe.”
Carissa  Something I noticed when looking at this word throughout 
Scripture is that trust is not blind trust. I think a lot of times our 
modern notions of trust or faith involve trusting in something 
despite the evidence, belief despite evidence. But in the biblical 
story, trust or belief relies on evidence of that trustworthiness. 
Jon So today, our final episode on the character of God, God is 
faithful, he’s trustworthy, he’s stable. Or as the Psalmist like to 
say, God is our rock. Thanks for joining us. Here we go. 
 We are going to continue this long journey through Exodus 
34:6 where God describes Himself in five different ways. We’ve 
been looking at all of these and we’re at the last one.
Tim Yes.

00:00:00  2Tim We’ll land the plane. 
Jon Yahweh, Yahweh, compassionate and gracious, slow 
to anger, overflowing with loyal love, and...
Carissa  ...emet. 
Jon Emet. And emet. 
Carissa  And emet. Actually, it’s emet, not emet in Hebrew. So I met means trust, 
trustworthy, faith, belief. So it encompasses all of those ideas. In this verse, 
it was translated as faithfulness, but it’s kind of rooted around this idea of 
trust or trustworthiness. To be honest, this has been kind of a hard script 
for me to write and a hard topic to research because, one, this is a really 
important word for the Christian faith. If we think about what it means to 
trust in God, that’s usually how we define what it means to be a Christian. 
Tim In fact, you used the word Faith.
Carissa  Christian faith, yes. Actually, it can be used that way in it’s New Testament 
Greek translation too, as this like body of belief. So it’s an important word 
for that reason. It’s also an important word in the context of relationships. 
I think, for me, and probably many others, trust can be kind of hard. 
As I’ve been writing this, I’ve just been asking a lot of questions about 
what does it mean for me to trust humans? What does it mean for 
me to trust God? What does it mean for God to be trustworthy? What 
does faith look like? All of those ideas come out of this one word. Is 
it blind faith? What is it based on? All of those kinds of questions?
Tim This is a good example of Christianese. This is a type of idea that 
becomes so common. Look at this matrix of words. Truth, true, 
trust, faith, faithful, and belief are all different English words that 
stem out of this one Hebrew word. And it’s kind of related. 
Carissa  This word also occurs a lot in the Hebrew Bible. 329 times. 
Tim Wow. What did you say for loyal love? 
Tim Oh, loyal love was almost 250.
Carissa  So yeah, similar. This one’s very common. In the New Testament, it’s 
Greek translations “pistis” and “aletheia”. Pistis occurs 604 times. 
Tim That’s the word faith.
Carissa  Yeah, faith or belief or faithfulness. To believe or to trust. 
And then Aletheia Truth, and its related verb. So overall, 
this idea occurs over 1100 times, which is wild.
Tim Wow. Wow. 00:03:00
00:04:00  3Carissa  So I think that’s why it can get flattened out too. It’s like it’s a very 
common word that we’re used to using, so it’s hard to really think 
about what it means to trust or to have faith or to be trustworthy. The 
noun forms, the primary ones are emet and emunah. Those typically 
carry the connotation of trustworthiness, f aithfulness, or truth. 
Then the verb forms can mean a person is trustworthy, either being 
trustworthy, or it can be somebody recognizing somebody else as 
trustworthy or trusting and believing them. So you can kind of see 
the interaction between the noun and the verb. So the noun being 
trustworthy and the verb trusting a person who is trustworthy.
Tim I mean, we actually have a variety of English words that’s doing what this 
variety of Hebrew words is doing all from this root. Because, you know, 
you can intuit that trust, true, trustworthy is all coming from the same...
Carissa  Idea.
Tim And true, right, there’s a T-R-U in all those. So it’s the same way. 
Carissa  Yeah, you can feel the relationship between them. 
Tim Correct.
Carissa  Something is true, it’s trustworthy, so I’m going to trust it. 
Tim That’s right. The same way in Hebrew, what you’re saying is there’s 
a network of Hebrew words that all come from the Hebrew root. 
Emet is just one of those words. There’s a whole network.
Carissa  Another one of these words that we’re probably most familiar with is 
“Amen.” So that’s a particle, a Hebrew particle just meaning That’s true. 
Jon Oh, and it’s from emet. 
Carissa  Yeah.
Jon Wow. 
Carissa  So that makes it easy. 
Jon There it is. 
Tim I think it’s actually the opposite. I think Amen is the three 
letters of the Hebrew root, and then emet...
Jon A derivative.
Tim  A derivative of Amen. 
Carissa  So the three letters are aleph, mem, nun. All of the verb 
forms, all of the nouns and particles come from that.00:05:00
00:06:00  4Tim That’s right. “Amen” means that’s true. 
Jon That is true. I remember learning that early in life, and that felt like a 
little hack. Because it’s just one of those words you only use in prayers 
and you have no idea what it means. And then you learned, like, 
“Oh, that means true.” Then I just thought of Amen as true dat. 
Carissa  Yeah. For some reason, I always had thought it meant “let it be.” Amen—
Let it be. Have you guys heard that? No? I don’t know where that came 
from. But maybe that is a similar idea though. Let it be true. Let it be so.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. 
Jon So in the same way that “amen” is the root, it’s always derivatives. 
In English we have true, trustworthy, all these...
Tim Truths.
Jon Truths. 
Carissa  And trust. Sometimes they’re translated in this verse as 
faithful. It works in a similar way in English. Faith and faithful. 
So if somebody’s faithful, you can have faith in them. 
Jon How much trustworthy you can trust them.
Carissa  Yeah, exactly.
Tim You got it.
Jon And if something’s true, it’s trustworthy. 
Tim Yeah. And if someone is amen, then you can...
Jon Emet.
Tim ...then they display emet. And you can put your amen in them.
Carissa  And then you can say amen at the end of that statement. So emet 
can mean truth. But when it’s applied to people or when it’s used to 
describe a person, it typically means trustworthy, faithful, or reliable.
Tim In English, it’s odd to say that someone is true.
Jon Unless you’re using it for measurements or something. Like, 
“Give me a true line.” Or people use like, is this board true?
Tim Oh, that’s right. For a thing. 
Carissa  So an object. Yeah. I think in the Hebrew Bible too.
Jon Like straight.
Carissa  Yeah. 00:07:00
00:08:00  5Tim But what I’m saying is a person you wouldn’t use true for a person. 
Carissa  At its most basic level, though, this word can be used to talk about 
someone who tells the truth. So not just a faithful or trustworthy person, 
even though this is a component of that, but someone who says the truth, 
who tells the truth. So proverbs 12:19 says, “Truthful lips, or lips of emet 
endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment.”  So part of being 
trustworthy is telling the truth. And that makes somebody worthy of trust.
Jon The truth is dependable and it lasts forever.
Carissa  Right, yeah. It has a stable quality or a reliable quality. That involves 
more than just truth-telling. It also involves that faithfulness, reliability 
of a person that somebody can put their trust in. I have a verse 
here. 2 Kings 20:3. Hezekiah’s second dying, this is a good example 
of emet being more than just truth-telling or truthful. He says to 
God, “Now, O Lord, please remember how I’ve walked before you 
in faithfulness and with a whole heart and have done what is good 
in your sight.” So in other words, he’s continually constantly been 
oriented toward God and his heart he says, and in what he’s done.
Tim You know that metaphorically like, Jon, what you just mentioned, 
if you look at a board, it’s straight, you could say, in common 
English, it’s true. Meaning it’s consistent. Right?
Jon It is how it’s supposed to be. 
Tim Yeah. It’s true.
Jon I’m trying to think. In Old English, I think they 
use the word true that way more.
Tim Yeah. So here in this example, Hezekiah proves true to God. 
Maybe that might be a way we could get the idea .
Carissa  Right. But in English, we would rather say he has been faithful. We wouldn’t 
really use the words trustworthy or trust there. Maybe he trusted God as a 
part of that. But in English, I think the best translation would be faithful.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. So yeah, we rely upon a network of 
two English roots. The T-R-U and the F-A-I-T. 
Jon The true comes from Dutch troost. Trost in High German  means 
trust or fidelity. Germanic root? Is that what you call them? 
Tim Yeah. But in this example of Hezekiah, Charisa, he walked in emet. 
Carissa  Yeah. And that’s defined as his heart’s disposition and also his actions. The 
point is just that it’s more than just telling the truth or a concept being 00:09:00
00:10:00
00:10:25
00:11:00  6true. It’s this quality of a person. And Yahweh is described as this way too, 
as full of emet here in Exodus 34. But the idea is that He’s worthy of being 
trusted. This idea is also found all over the Psalms, just like chesed.
 So there’s just one example I have here. Psalm 136. The psalmist 
says, “Into your hands, I commit my very breath, save me, O 
God of emet.” So the psalmist is saying that God is trustworthy 
and faithful and that he can depend on Him to help him. 
That He’s reliable, He’s consistent, He’s trustworthy. 
Tim Trustworthy. Or faithful. So faithful doesn’t mean full 
of faith if you break the word apart in English. 
Jon It could though. 
Carissa  If it’s referring to like Abraham’s faith and being faithful, 
then it depends how you define faith, I guess. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. If we had an animation studio, to make 
an illustration, there’s a directionality. If I have faith in you, 
it’s about me acting towards you in some way. 
Jon Like you’re stable. 
Tim But in that scenario, you’re the one who’s faithful. If I’m trusting 
in you, it’s because I consider you faithful. But then there’s...
Jon And in that sense, you’re using it as “reliable”.
Tim Correct. That’s right. That’s more about you as the object of my faith. But 
then there’s this other meaning where it’s actually something about me.
Jon That I am putting my faith in the thing that’s reliable.
Tim Oh, well, no. Then there’s the other person’s object. Like Hezekiah is a 
person of truth. So there it’s he’s faithful for God. God can put His trust in 
Hezekiah. The grammar terms I think are subjective versus objective.
Carissa  Yeah. Although I think the thing you’re drying out is that this 
relationship between faith, faithfulness, maybe trustworthiness, 
and trust, these are also describing reciprocal relationships. So if 
somebody is faithful, or let’s say God is faithful, someone wants to 
put their faith in Him, they also simultaneously could be called faithful 
to Him. Like those two concepts shouldn’t be quite separated. 
Jon But it’s different types of faithfulness. One is being the  
dependable person, and the other type of faithfulness is 
being the person who trusts in the dependable person. 00:12:00
00:13:00
00:14:00  7Carissa  But it also has the connotation of consistently or dependably 
acting with faith. So I think there still is...
Jon Consistently trusting someone’s faithfulness is a type of faithfulness.
Carissa  Because you couldn’t be faithful if only sometimes you are faithful.
Tim Oh, okay. Sorry. Let’s make this concrete. Jon, you’re sitting in a chair. 
Jon Yeah.
Tim This is kind of a famous sermon.
Jon I’m putting trust in this chair.
Tim That’s right. So you have faith in the chair.
Jon I have faith in the chair.
Tim So in that scenario, the chair is the faithful one. 
Jon Yes. But I am also the faithful one.
Tim But you demonstrate your faithfulness to the 
chair’s faithfulness by sitting in it. 
Jon Which is an act of faith. 
Tim Which is an act of faith.
Jon So we’re using the same word in three different ways 
there almost. Yeah, that’s too complicated.
Tim I didn’t mean to comp...I just realized that, for me, I always 
have to go through this exercise when it comes to this 
word because there’s these different directions.
Carissa  There are different directions. I think maybe in English we do have too 
many distinctions between the different ways these words express 
meaning. We’re going to do a whole nother video on the Greek meaning 
of the word Faith. But in Hebrew, at least, I think the distinctions 
aren’t as strong. So in other words, being trusting and trustworthy 
maybe describing the same thing. And they both relate to this idea 
of constancy, stability, and they both occur within a relationship.
Section Break  
Carissa  There’s this example that will be in our video on this topic in Exodus 
17 that really highlights this idea of stability or steadiness. It’s when 
the Amalekites are fighting against Israel. In Exodus 17, Moses is 
holding up his hands and he’s trying to keep them steady or emet. 00:15:00
00:16:36  8Tim Oh, yes.
Carissa  And his friends are helping him. So they put a rock under him and 
they support his hands so that they remain emet, they remain 
steady. So the idea is that emet has to do with constancy and 
steadiness. It can also be used to describe a political setting. So 
to say the political situation or this kingdom is steady, it means it’s 
secure and it’s stable and constant. Nothing is threatening it. 
Jon Just so I’m clear then, emet then is about the object being 
reliable. When you put your faith in a reliable object, do 
you also use the word emet?  Or is that different?
Carissa  Yeah, yeah. Usually, it’s the verb form from the 
same root. So ne’eman or…wait. Is it? 
Tim Actually, this narrative gives a great image. So let’s put a pause on it for a 
moment. You have Moses up on a hill. He’s holding his hands for hours...
Jon He’s got to keep them up.
Tim Yeah, he’s tired. So they’re going to become unfaithful.  
Carissa  Not constantly. Maybe wavering or unsteady. 
Tim That’s right. He wants them to stay in the same space, same position. 
Jon But they’re not dependable.
Tim Yeah. So once he has two friends to help him, 
then his hands become emet. True. 
Carissa  Stable. True. 
Tim They become true. So just like the chair that you sit in could 
be said to have emet, his hands have emet.  They’re true. 
Carissa  That’s one quality of what this word group means. And God has 
described this way too, especially when the author describes 
Him as a rock. So you can kind of feel that same idea there.
Jon Rocks are very emet.
Carissa  Yeah, stable and sturdy, reliable, constant.
Tim They don’t really do anything. They just are there. Rocks don’t change. 
Jon Within a Hebrew Bible. 
Tim Yeah. This is kind of...00:17:00
00:18:00  9Carissa  Something I’ve been thinking about is, because faithfulness is the 
last word in this description, so God is compassionate, gracious, 
slow to anger, and then overflowing with loyal love, and faithfulness, 
it almost seems like it’s functioning to say God is this way all the 
time. We can count on His character to always be the same.
Jon I was thinking about that in terms of the pairing of loyal love 
and faithfulness, is that loyal love does have a faithfulness in 
it. The sense of faithfulness in it. It’s the loyalty part of it.
Carissa  And the promise-keeping.
Jon So it almost seems a little redundant to me to add faithfulness after 
loyal love. But when you think of it in terms of like saying a strong period 
in the end of like all of these things about God are trustworthy.
Tim  Yes, they’re true.
Carissa  I’ve been trying to figure out what the difference is between loyal love 
and faithfulness because they both have to do with promise-keeping 
and the steady commitment. They both are covenantal commitment  
type words. and I think that faithfulness really has to do with this reliable, 
stable consistency. Chesed seems to have to do more with generosity...
Tim And promise-keeping.
Carissa  And promise-keeping. But I think faithfulness has to do with promise-
keeping a lot. So maybe it’s the generosity aspect of chesed that’s a 
little bit different. Maybe it has a more emotive aspect. I don’t think 
faithfulness in itself has that emotive aspect. It’s just the stability.
Tim When Moses is up there on that hill and his hand display 
emet, he’s not keeping a promise, he’s not being generous. 
They’re just keeping his hands in the same position. That 
reliable location of his hands is what displays emet.
Jon Again, it makes the rock a great image. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. The rock.
Jon The rock. 
Carissa  So Yahweh, in Deuteronomy 32:4, he’s called the  rock. And one of the 
ways He’s described her is faithful. That’s a great song that occurs at the 
end of the whole Torah just summarizing all of what’s gone before. 
 So I found it really interesting to look at how this word group works 
in the story of the Bible, and how to view the story through this 
lens of emet or its related verbs. So the first time we come across 00:19:00
00:20:00
00:21:00  10these words in the Bible is in the story of Abraham. I think what this 
means is that he’s the paradigm or the example of what it means 
to have trust. That’s also what Paul says in the New Testament.
Tim Yeah, because you could argue in the storyline of Genesis, Adam 
and Eve, there’s a moment, are they going to do what God asked 
them to do? Which is a way of trusting, but that’s not the main focus 
there. It’s kind of trust is implied. But because the word isn’t present, 
it’s not the focus. The story of Noah building a boat, that’s an act of 
trust. You’re saying when the word gets first introduced to develop 
a character,  it’s Abraham. And it becomes a drama of trust.
Carissa  Right. I think because it’s the first place the word is used, we can ask the 
question what it means there, and then how that is developed or used later.
Tim Yeah, that’s good later. 
Carissa  Abraham’s trust becomes really important in the story.
Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Jon Can I back us up to? I want to make sure this is clear in my mind. To me, 
there are two different meanings.  That you’re trustworthy, meaning you 
are the rock, or you’re trusting, which is I rely on the rock. It seems like 
in Exodus 34, God is saying the first. “I am the rock.” Then now we’re 
going to look at Abraham. Are we talking about the other type, which is, 
what does it look like to be the kind of person that relies on the rock?
Carissa  Well, if we change those words, though, too, let’s 
say the rock is faithful, God is faithful...
Jon Okay, the Rock is faithful. 
Carissa  And then Abraham puts his faith in the rock...
Jon He’s full of faith.  
Carissa  And he also acts faithfully. So he demonstrates 
faithfulness. So they’re not totally distinct. 
Jon To me, that feels like the third aspect. So you’ve got the rock that 
is faithful, you’ve got the person relying on the rock, which is full 
of faith, and then you’ve got the person consistently relying on 
the rock over the long term, which means that they are...
Carissa  Faithful over the long term.
Jon Faithful. Almost in the way that the first...00:22:00
00:23:00  11Carissa  Yeah, constant or steady. 
Jon To rely on something true for the long haul makes you true. 
Tim Yeah. 
Carissa  We can just stick with the ideas of trustworthiness and then putting 
trust in the trustworthy object for now. We’ll do a whole nother...
Jon We’re going to focus on...
Carissa  Trustworthiness usually of God...trustworthiness 
and then what it means to trust in God. 
Jon We’re going to talk about those two things.
Carissa  Yeah. Or  trustworthiness and the response of trust. Yeah. 
Jon To go back up to the example you gave of Hezekiah, his faithfulness 
seemed to be that third one, which was he is not the rock but he trusts 
in the rock. And he’s trust so much that his whole life now is full of...
Carissa  Yeah. And maybe it’s just that to really trust actually involves 
action and it involves the whole person. So maybe we don’t 
even need another word for it like faithful again. 
 We can just say like, Hezekiah, he trusted. And what that meant 
was that it wasn’t just that he cognitively trusted; he also did these 
acts throughout his life. He was faithful in many ways throughout 
his life to God. But that’s what it meant that he trusted God. Same 
with Abraham. His trust of God meant that he followed Him. He 
was tested in various ways and eventually passed those tests.
Jon What could be a good third word? I want to get kind of nerdy 
about this and  I want to keep calling the rock Faithful.
Tim The rock is faithful. 
Jon The person who trusts in the rock is full of faith. The person who 
trusts in the rock over the long term making their life true is...
Tim They’re demonstrating faithfulness to the faithful 
thing. But you want a third word.
Jon Just so I know, okay, that’s the category we’re talking in. 
Carissa  Maybe faithful. Maybe just faithful for that third...
Jon So it’s back to faithful?
Carissa  Yeah.00:24:00
00:25:00  12Jon That makes sense. 
Carissa  Because it’s reciprocated. It’s a relational term that 
God wants His people to also show Him. 
Jon But it seems like an important distinction because when we get into—
and I don’t think we’ll get there in this conversation—but when you 
get into pistis, we’re talking about being faithful to something that is 
faithful, and not being faithful because you yourself are a rock.
Carissa  Yeah. This conversation will be like the prequel to the 
question of what faith in the New Testament means. 
Jon Okay.
Carissa  So we’ll have to...
Tim Do a video on that later. 
Carissa  Yeah. Yeah. That’s a big topic and a big question. 
Jon Okay. Thank you for letting me process this.
Section Break  
Carissa  All right. So Abraham. In the story of the Bible, Abraham is the first 
one to have trust in God. So it’s the first time that word is used.
Jon How about human?
Carissa  At all.
Jon The first time in the Bible?
Carissa  Yeah. God had promised to Abraham and Sarah that they’d have 
a big family and that all the nations would be blessed through 
them. But at this point in the story, it seems impossible because 
Abraham and Sarah don’t have any children and it seems like 
they’re too old to have any anyway. But Abraham trusts God, or he 
considers him to be trustworthy in the face of these challenges.
 So Genesis 15:5-6, I think this is the NASB, God takes Abraham outside and 
says, “Look up at the sky and count the stars if indeed you can count them.” 
Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.  Abraham believed the 
Lord.” Here it’s translated as believe. He credited it to him as righteousness. 
Jon That’s it. Believe. That’s the third word, right?
Carissa  Now that’s the second one, isn’t it? To trust or to believe.00:26:00
00:27:00
00:28:00  13Tim To place your trust in a trustworthy thing.
Jon Well, to me “believe” seems more than just “in this 
moment, I’m going to trust this thing.”
Carissa  So it seems more holistic.
Jon It feels like if I believe in something, I’m going to...anyways. Never mind. 
Carissa  Well, I think what you’re saying, well, it’s something that’s true. I 
think belief, trust, and faith should all involve the whole person. 
And if they don’t, in our understanding of them, we should think of 
them that way. So when Abraham believes God, it is more than just 
a momentary thing and it’s more than just a cognitive thing.
Jon Yeah. 
Tim The history of English translations has Believe 
through Genesis 15:6—the first word.
Carissa  And you know why probably is? Because that’s how it’s 
used in Romans when Paul reflects on this. 
Tim Oh, sure. 
Carissa  So it would be really odd to translate it as “Trust.” 
Tim I remember when I was learning Hebrew, this really struck me. 
When this word is used as a verb, the thing that you trust in, the 
thing that you  always has the little preposition “in” attached to it. 
In other words, in Hebrew, you believe in someone. You trust in 
them. In English, we don’t need the “in” if you say I believe you. We 
could say “I believe in you,” but that means something different.
Carissa  Have a different meaning. “I believe that you can do it. 
Jon Or “trust in you.” 
Tim I believe in you. 
Carissa  But to place trust in, you could use that phrase with a preposition.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. I just was looking. The King James has “and he 
believed in the Lord.” So all the rest of our modern translations just  
have “He believed the Lord.” So that “in” does something about that 
directionality of putting your trust in. Yeah, that’s all. I was just noticing.
Carissa  Yeah. This verse in Genesis 15 feels really familiar I think because of 
how it’s used in the New Testament, and because of how Paul reflects 
on this as defining what faith in God is and how the whole human 
family becomes a part of Abraham’s family through this faith.00:29:00
00:29:23
00:30:00  14 In Romans 4:18, he summarizes the story saying, “Against all hope, Abraham 
in hope believed...” That’s the New Testament translation of this word. 
“And so became the father of many nations just as heaven said to him, so 
shall your offspring be...” Talking about the numerous stars in the sky. “...
without weakening in his faith...” So that’s the same word there as well. “...
without weakening in his trust or his faith, he faced the fact that his body 
was as good as dead since he was about 100 years old , and that Sarah’s 
womb was also dead.” Those are very harsh words to describe humans.
Tim Yeah, dead.
Carissa  “He did not waver through unbelief or lack of trust...” So that same word 
again. “...regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his 
faith or trust, and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God 
had the power to do what He had promised.” So Abraham considered 
God to be trustworthy. And Paul goes on to talk about how this is how all 
people enter into the family of God through this kind of trust or belief. 
 Something I noticed when looking at this word throughout Scripture is 
that trust is not blind trust. So I think a lot of times our modern notions 
of trust or faith involve trusting in something despite the evidence.
Jon Typically how we...
Tim Leap of faith. 
Carissa  Yeah, right. Right. 
Jon ...think of it. “I don’t understand it but I’m going to have faith.”
Carissa  Yeah, right. Belief despite evidence.  But in the biblical story, trust or 
belief relies on evidence of that trustworthiness. And you can even see 
that in the form of the word. So God is trustworthy, therefore, people 
trust Him. That’s how the words work. So there’s a relationship there.
Jon There’s a reciprocal relationship.
Tim Think of how the difference in English between saying, I have 
faith in that, or I believe that versus I think that’s trustworthy. That 
makes it sound like I thought about it, I have some reasons....
Jon I might even have an experience. 
Tim I might have an experience. 
Jon I’ve concluded that I could depend on it. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. That’s good. You’re saying that gets 
across more with the biblical meaning of trusting. 00:31:00
00:32:00  15Carissa  Yeah. At least in the Hebrew Bible, though, when we come across 
the words belief or faith or trust, they typically always have 
evidence to support those acts. So here are a few examples . God 
offers evidence to the Israelites to help them believe in Exodus 4 
when He’s talking to Moses and is giving Moses all sorts of signs 
so that the people would believe that word is used there. 
 Then in Exodus 19, at Sinai, God says, “I’ll come down in this cloud and talk 
to you Moses so that the people will believe Me and you.” And at first, the 
people do believe. They believe when they see the signs, they believe in the 
Lord and servant Moses. When they see these signs and then when they 
cross the Red Sea and they experience the power of God, they believe. 
Tim It’s a response.
Carissa  Yeah, it’s a response to what they see and what they experience. 
Then we also see their lack of belief when they see and experience 
these giants in Numbers 14 when they come to the land. So 
the evidence is telling them, “Oh, how can we believe or how 
can we trust God?” So they don’t believe in Numbers 14.
Tim So interesting.  There’s a professor, he’s an atheist. He published a 
book...Oh, here it is. Paul Boghossian arguing that religious belief 
should be categorized as some kind of mental disorder.
Jon Oh.
Carissa  Oh.
Tim It’s essentially this. It’s like there’s no evidence. It’s believing despite 
evidence. I know I’m not doing justice to his actual argument. His argument 
is actually pretty sophisticated when I heard him talk about it once. But 
that was my takeaway was that it’s something wrong with your ability 
to discern truth. Because you’re discerning truth with no evidence.
Jon Or despite evidence.
Tim Or despite evidence. That’s really different than the portrait you’re... 
Carissa  Right. So the biblical answer to that would be, yeah, that would be 
crazy to believe in something without evidence or trustworthiness. 
Tim You shouldn’t do that. Don’t believe in something if there’s no evidence.
Carissa  I think that is instructive to us in our relationships with God  
and with people too. It’s actually unwise to trust anybody 
without evidence of their trustworthiness as a person. 00:33:00
00:34:00
00:35:00  16Tim Yeah, general rule of thumb. That’s very intuitive. It seems silly 
that it needs to be said in one sense, but somehow religious 
belief has come to have this meaning in our culture.
Carissa  Step out in faith.
Tim Yeah, blind faith. 
Jon It might be because while in these stories people are having first-hand 
experiences being rescued from Egypt, all these different stories, then, 
yeah, you’ve seen it, and you know “I can trust this thing.” But in many 
modern religious contexts, there isn’t those kind of events or signs or 
symbols. So I can see why you would start to just go, “Just believe it. I 
know you haven’t experienced the trustworthiness , but you can still believe 
it.” And that’s why it’s called faith. I could see how you would get that. 
Tim I can too. Yeah, I can too.
Carissa  And that’s where I think it’s important to see the trustworthiness 
of God play out through the story, because that does become...
Evidence is kind of the wrong word. But that does become the basis 
for trust when you see how He consistently fulfills his promises, and 
know His character and that sort of thing. Even today, we might not 
experience these events in history. They’re revealed as these acts of 
God in the same way that they were then, but we still would found 
our trust on the story or the character the way God is portrayed.
Section Break 
Carissa  So I mentioned earlier that met is a covenantal word, a lot like loyal love. 
So they occur and these relational contexts or describe the quality of 
the commitment between God and humanity. This has implications for 
us in our own relationship with God and also the commitments we make 
to close people in our lives. With God, with partners, with family.
 So in the Bible, God makes this covenantal commitment with Abraham 
and He desires Abraham to reciprocate that faithfulness. He makes it with 
the people of Israel and desires Israel to reciprocate that faithfulness. 
And He makes it with the king and desires the king to reciprocate that 
faithfulness. Those words are used in all of those covenantal context. 
So you see God’s faithfulness or trustworthiness and the covenant 
partners being called to trust and to be faithful to God in return.
 So I just want to skip down to the king and the covenant that God makes 
with David, because this becomes a significant moment in the story. 
So when we meet David, we meet this young man who trusts Yahweh 00:36:00
00:37:29  17in the face of a giant, Goliath. The story of trusting in the face of the 
giant is meant to contrast with that previous story of the Israelites who 
don’t trust God when they encounter giants at the edge of the land.
 So because David trusts God here, God also chooses David and 
says that He will be faithful  to Him forever. So he makes this 
covenant with him in 2 Samuel 7, and he says, “Your house, David, 
and your kingdom will endure.” And that’s the word ne’eman 
from that same word root as emet. “...forever before me.”
Jon Yeah, that makes sense.
Carissa  It’ll be constant; it’ll be faithful before me.
Tim Like Moses’ hands.
Carissa  Yeah. It’ll be stable, steady. It will have emet.
Jon It’ll last.
Carissa  Your throne will be established forever.
Tim So your house and your kingdom will...NIV does endure, will last.  
Carissa  I think these are all from the NASB. 
Tim NASB. I’m trying to think of is there an English 
word connected to the true, trust? 
Carissa  Will be faithful. 
Tim Your house and your kingdom will something forever.
Carissa  I don’t think we have a good word connected to faithful 
or true. I mean, true is probably the closest.
Tim So yeah, it’s hard in English to see the connection to all this. 
But in Hebrew, it’s clear because it’s from the amen root.
Carissa  So it’s the idea that God is saying He will always be faithful to this 
covenant to David and there will always be a Davidic King on the 
throne whose kingdom is faithful or constant forever. So God 
will be faithful to make the kingdom endure or be faithful.
Tim Yeah, faithful. That’s right. And then it hinges on the people and 
the leaders of that kingdom themselves being faithful.
Carissa  Right. Right. Remember that this is a covenant relationship. So God 
is desiring reciprocation on the faithfulness. But He has made this 
promise. So now there’s attention of God being faithful to His promise, 
what happens when His people aren’t faithful or His king isn’t faithful.00:39:00
00:40:00  18Tim Okay. All right. I’ve got a metaphor. When I was a teenager, my dad 
is a car guy, like hot rod cars. I think we must have had  a new and 
different car every six months to a year. He would trade in cars. 
Anyway, when I was a teenager, my dad was so thrilled to help me 
get my first car. So he helped me get my first car, which was the 
Volkswagen bus that he helped me restore. It was a big project. 
Carissa  That’s a cool car.
Tim It was amazing. It was so awesome.
Carissa  Did you say that was your first car?
Tim Yeah. We restored it. It was awesome. So my dad was demonstrating his 
faithfulness to me through love, generosity, being there. Right? What 
he hoped was that I would reciprocate faithfulness to maintenance 
the car. It was reciprocal. “Hey, I helped you restore this, now take 
care of it,” in the hopes that the car itself would be faithful for me...
Carissa  endure forever. 
Tim ...as a mode of transportation. What I ended up not 
doing was not maintenancing it. I lacked faithfulness, 
therefore the car broke down all the time. 
Jon And it was unreliable.
Tim And it was unreliable. So God’s faithfulness is being shown to David and 
his line. Those people need to show faithfulness for the kingdom to be 
faithful. That is, to last. In Hebrew, you can do this with all one word. 
Carissa  Yeah. Though, I think there’s this element in this promise given by God 
to the king and the people where the people are depending on God to 
be faithful no matter what. That seems like part of their expectation or 
part of the...Maybe it’s part of the promise, that there will be an enduring 
kingdom. Because part of this promise says that if the kings are unfaithful 
to me, I’ll punish them. But there’s still this hope in this one faithful 
King, and I’ll never take my love from Him. It’s almost like if your dad  
would have said, “I will always get you a new car if it breaks down.” 
Tim Yeah, interesting. 
Carissa  “They’ll keep breaking down if you don’t take care of them, but 
there will be one car. And that one car will last you forever.”
Tim Yeah, that’s right. That’s good. 
Carissa  I don’t know if that analogy breaks down.00:41:00
00:42:00
00:43:00  19Section Break
Carissa   David does, for the most part, take care of his VW van. And at the end 
of his life, it said that he did walk in emet before God. But the kings that 
follow Him, none of them trust God the way that David did. So eventually 
this leads to exile from the land. They trust in their own plans, in their 
own wealth, military power or the power of other nations instead of 
God. So, at this point, the Israelites are out of land and out of a king, 
and there’s this memory of a promise that God had made to David that a 
righteous king from among his descendants would reign on the throne 
forever. There’s still this promise of God’s faithfulness. I thought we could 
just look briefly at Psalm 89 because it’s such an interesting psalm.
 Psalm 89, the first half of the psalm recounts God’s faithfulness. 
His chesed too. That He shows chesed and faithfulness to 
His people and recounts the covenant that He made with 
David. The words for faithfulness are used throughout.
Tim So interesting. The representation of what God said to David here in Psalm 
89 is chesed will be built up forever, loyal love will be built up forever, 
in the skies you will establish your emunah. “For you,” God said, “I’ve 
made  a covenant with my chosen one, swearing an oath to David.”
Carissa  Yeah, so God’s faithfulness in the Psalm is really connected to the 
promise to David. The psalmist is saying, “You are faithful God. We 
know you’re faithful. All the way to the heavens you’re faithful. And 
you’ve said that you have established this covenant. You’ve been 
faithful throughout all time.” So it sounds like this praise of God’s 
faithfulness. But then midway through the psalm, the psalm takes 
this turn to the psalmist accusing God of violating His covenant.
Tim Remember that thing happened when Babylon came 
to town and poked up son of David’s eyes?
Carissa  Yeah. So in verse 39, the psalmist says, “You have renounced the 
covenant with your servant. You’ve defiled his crown in the dust.” And 
he goes on to describe the desolation of Israel, and then says, “Where 
is your chesed of old which by your emunah you swore to David?” So 
the psalmist is saying because Israel has been destroyed, has been 
exiled from the land, it looks like God’s promise, His faithfulness no 
longer stands. The Israelis have no dividend king on the throne.
Tim Evidence is now speaking to the contrary.
Carissa  Exactly.
Tim The rock doesn’t seem so trustworthy anymore. 00:44:32
00:46:00
00:47:00  20Carissa  So how can you place your trust in a God who 
doesn’t seem faithful or trustworthy?
Tim Let’s just pause and recognize that the Bible is both advocating Yahweh 
is trustworthy, but then also acknowledging this moment in Israel’s 
experience, where it seemed like God wasn’t trustworthy. There’s a 
poem about somebody who’s struggling to trust God anymore. That’s 
just remarkable to me. Both of these things are in the same scriptures.
Carissa  Yeah, it’s a very human experience of our circumstances 
and how that relates to how we see God. 
Tim I think for anyone who’s had the experience of being in a church 
community and they’re told to just believe, you can also kindly 
respond, “Oh, like the poet of Psalm 89?” He was quite vocal 
about his struggle to not believe. So is it okay if I am too? 
Jon Is it okay if I am confused about whether or not I can trust God right now?
Tim My point is just the biblical story is very sympathetic for 
people who struggle to consider God’s trust.
Carissa  I think the Israel’s exile was very tragic because of what happened 
to the nation and because of what they had to experience. It also 
was a tragedy as far as it was a reflection on God’s character and 
His faithfulness. I think sometimes we don’t think of it that way.
Tim Yeah, it was a crisis of God’s trustworthiness.
Carissa  This story continues in the New Testament. The first page of the 
New Testament in the Gospel of Matthew opens to show that God is 
trustworthy, that He’s faithful, that He will continue to be trustworthy  
to His promises. This is the first line of the New Testament. This is 
the genealogy or the lineage of Jesus Christ or Messiah or King, the 
son of David, the son of Abraham. The claim here is that Jesus is 
the promised Davidic King to come, and He fulfills this promise to 
Abraham as well. In other words, God is faithful through Jesus.
Tim So you’re highlighting the fact that Matthew is highlighting Jesus as God’s 
response to the two great promises in the Hebrew Bible, Abraham?
Carissa  Yeah. 
Tim Where word is used for the first time and then to David, which is a big 
focal point in the Psalms and prophets about the trustworthiness of 
the promise. That’s the links and the chain that you’re looking here. 00:48:00
00:49:00  21Carissa  Right. These are the promises that the nation of Israel was relying 
on. These are promises that were to affect all of humanity. So the 
very first line of the New Testament , the Gospel author is saying 
that Jesus is the fulfillment of these two major promises. 
Tim Maybe it’s because it’s the first line of a genealogy. 
Maybe that doesn’t always land for everyone. 
Carissa  Totally. It’s not exciting.
Tim I mean, it’s a really profound statement being made just by that 
opening sentence linking together Jesus with David and then 
Abraham. But you have to know the story I guess for it to land. 
Carissa  And the tragedy of the unfulfilled promises or the lack of God’s faithfulness 
for that to really land. I think that’s true. In Romans, Paul says that Jesus 
has come on behalf of God’s aletheia—that’s one of the Greek words for 
faithfulness—to confirm these promises, the ones made to Abraham and 
to Israel so that the nations would glorify God. So the New Testament 
authors recognize the continuation of this story of God’s faithfulness in 
Jesus. That He’s trustworthy, that He’s consistent, that He’s reliable.
Tim Okay. I think people are pretty common with there’s a claim in 
the New Testament that Jesus fulfills, like the promises of God. 
But this is keying it into this trustworthiness language. 
Carissa  Yeah, right. That God is trustworthy because of this fulfillment.
Jon This is the way God is being trustworthy. 
Carissa  Yeah, right. It’s not just a cool fact about Jesus fulfilling 
promises, and so it shows that He is the Messiah. It’s actually 
more about the trustworthiness of God I think. 
Tim The thing that we trusted in. But then we have this crisis of 
faith because the line of David and whole kingdom crumbled 
around us made us wonder if God was in fact trustworthy. And 
then think, then for 500 years, you just have tyrants...
Carissa  A long, long time.
Tim ...ruling over these people. And it’s the crisis of trust. So the 
claim here is it’s like a vindication of God’s trustworthiness . 
That’s what Paul is saying here. This is in Romans 15.
Jon In order to confirm the promises given the Patriarch, which during the 
exile and then this whole period before Jesus would have been very easy 
to be like that psalmist and just say, “I don’t know if you’re trustworthy.”00:50:00
00:51:00
00:52:00  22Carissa  Right. And it was all based around that promise that God made to 
David. The problem was that the kings following David weren’t faithful 
to God. So what’s happening here and in the person of Jesus is that he 
is showing Himself to be the true faithful King who fulfills that Davidic 
role. The author of Hebrews makes this connection between 2 Samuel 7 
and Jesus when He says, “But of the son, God says, ‘Your throne, O God, 
is forever and ever.’” So that really echoes the promise made to David 
that there will be a descendant who reigns on your  throne forever.
Tim It would be like my dad becoming me to be the faithful son...
Jon To take care of the car?
Tim To takes care of the car. Because that’s true. If he was me, he would 
have taken care of the car. It would in general make these noises 
and I would just do nothing. I’ll just be like, “It’ll be fine.”
Jon I hate taking care of cars.
Tim And then it would just not work, and it’ll be dead.
Carissa  I feel really convicted right now. 
Tim It doesn’t work. And he’d be like, “Well, what was going on? 
Well, it’s making this noise.” I remember this. He was like, 
“What did you do?” Well, I just drove it the next day. Anyway. 
You’re feeling what? You’re feeling guilty about your car?
Carissa  My engine lights on all the time. Please don’t tell your dad.
Section Break
Carissa  So we’ve been talking through the storyline of God being faithful or 
trustworthy, and how that leads to people putting their trust in Him. So let’s 
talk about trust in the New Testament. Just like in the Hebrew Bible, trust in 
the New Testament is also portrayed as something people do despite great 
obstacles. Remember in the Hebrew Bible, Abraham and Sarah believed...
Jon They were old. Their obstacle was...
Tim It wasn’t blind faith...
Carissa  It wasn’t blind.
Tim ...but it was a struggle of faith.
Jon When you’re 100 years old, having a baby is an obstacle.
Carissa  It’s an obstacle. Or having a great nation come from your body 
when you have no children and you’re 100 years old.00:53:00
00:54:30  23Tim That’s right.
Carissa  Right. In the New Testament, I think the obstacles we can imagine 
people were facing when they saw Jesus were that Jesus doesn’t look 
like a king. So to believe or trust in Him as the Davidic King requires 
this transformed imagination. And then just the practical obstacles 
of illness, of low status, and of the immense amount of trust it would 
take to ask Jesus to heal even the worst diseases to death itself.
 I think we see all of these examples of trust in the New Testament held out to 
us despite great obstacles to inspire and empower readers to do the same. 
So the gospels are full of these people who place their trust in Jesus despite 
great odds. I’ll just list who these people are so we can get an idea of what 
kinds of people are trusting Jesus and what message that communicate. 
 In Matthew 8, a Gentile centurion or a leader asks 
Jesus to heal his paralyzed servant.
Tim That’s surprising in that this is a person of high status.
Carissa  Right. Gentile of high status.
Tim A non-Israelite who is of high status within Roman culture, and then 
coming to a low-status person who’s subject to him. That’s surprising. 
Carissa  It’s surprising and also it communicates that point of trusting in the 
face of obstacles. There’s definitely going to be an obstacle.
Tim Totally. It’s an interesting obstacle because it’s about somebody of 
higher status trusting in somebody of lower status. I guess the whole 
point of the story is what he says is, “I’m not worthy for you to come  
to my house.” So he doesn’t think of himself higher status. Anyway.
Carissa  Or thinks of Jesus as of very high status. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Carissa  Another example here from Mark 5. A Jewish synagogue 
leader. So two leaders now here: a Gentile leader, a Jewish 
synagogue leader. His daughter was dying...
Tim Jesus tells him to trust.
Carissa  Yeah. Jesus says, “Trust.” Then he actually raises the little girl from 
the dead because she had died. In Matthew 9, a woman who would 
have been deemed unclean because of her bleeding for such a 
long period of time reaches out to touch Jesus, and He heals her. 
And the words for faith or trust are used in all of these stories.00:56:00
00:57:00  24 Then this final story in Matthew 9. I really like this one. Two blind men 
who are the only ones in the story to actually see that Jesus is the Davidic 
King. So there’s this irony there. They ask for mercy and he says, “Do 
you believe?” Or “Do you trust?” So these are just a few examples of 
where  people trust Jesus from within their difficult circumstances.
Tim This is striking me. I’ve considered this theme. This is a major 
theme—people trusting in Jesus. Of course, it’s very intuitive 
in a Christianized culture. Trusting in Jesus is kind of...
Jon It’s really central to what Christianity...
Tim When you think about in 1st century, for Jewish people to write these 
stories and compile them, for a culture whose foundation texts of 
the Hebrew Bible are all about stories about whether or not people 
will trust in Yahweh, and then they compose these accounts of 
Jesus, and a major theme is whether or not people trust Jesus, it’s 
very clearly the way that Israel is now going to show their trust in 
Yahweh is by trusting and just showing trust in Jesus name. It’s just 
kind of striking me when you stack up all the stories to each other.
Carissa  And how it just continues the story of trust really.
Tim That’s right. 
Carissa  So these stories are meant to encourage readers to consider  Jesus to be 
the expression of Yahweh, the one who is overflowing with faithfulness or 
trustworthiness, and then to place trust in Him. So yeah, it’s a continuation 
of the story for sure. So it’s not necessarily perfect trust that God is calling 
people to. At one point when a father brings his son to Jesus begging 
for healing from a demon, he says, and this is in Mark 9, “If you can do 
anything, have compassion on us and help us.” And Jesus said to him, 
“If you can, all things are possible for one who believes.” Immediately 
the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe. Help my unbelief.”
 I really resonate with this because I feel that way a lot with God or with 
people. It’s like I trust but I also struggle with not trusting, so help my untrust. 
I resonate that this can be my prayer as well and to not feel guilty about that.  
Tim It’s kind of this guy’s story in the gospels is kind of like an analog to Psalm 
89. The crisis of trust. The Psalm begins celebrating trust. But then at 
the end is like, “And where is your trustworthiness?” There’s a kind of a 
similar dynamic here. I thank God for the story in the Gospels. This is 
like a lifeline to a lot of people. I feel the same way. You do, Carissa.00:58:00
00:59:00
01:00:00  25Carissa  Yeah. And Jesus does heal him I guess I should say. He does heal the son. 
Tim Yes, that’s right. It’s just such an honest acknowledgment. I believe 
but help my unbelief. There isn’t any better way to say it actually.
Carissa  Yeah. It’s also cool to know that belief isn’t absolute. 
It’s not either you do or you don’t.
Tim Oh, you’re saying it’s not binary? 
Carissa  Right.
Tim Yeah.
Jon “I have some but I don’t have enough. Help me out.”
Tim I’ve never thought of this. That’s why it’s beginning he 
says, “Have compassion. ” “I trust you, but it’s hard for 
me to trust in you. So can you give me a little...” 
Jon “Can you empathize with me?”
Carissa  Interesting.
Section Break   
Carissa  So maybe I’ll just end with some takeaways or some things I noticed as 
I was studying this word. One is that relationships revolve around trust. 
We see this in the way the word is used in the covenant relationship. 
So close people and our relationships with God require trust. And trust 
requires trustworthiness . So that goes to that second point of trust being 
based on evidence. Trust in God or trust in humans is not blind trust.
Tim Yeah, if I trust in God, then I will display faithfulness. It’s that dual 
dynamic where if I have faith in God, that He is faithful, in theory, 
my life should be characterized by reciprocal faithfulness. But then 
when you flip it over, it kind of makes me nervous. What does the 
evidence tell about my trustworthiness? When I think about my own life 
choices that way, what do they tell about my faithfulness? Anyway.
Carissa  Even understanding what trustworthiness is from the study, whether 
it’s reliability, it’s truth-telling, it’s consistency, those things I think 
are helpful to even evaluate personally, am I trustworthy? Or are the 
people that I’m around trustworthy?  Am I being faithful to God? But 
also then maybe that’s the moment we just ask for compassion too.01:01:00
01:01:39
01:02:00
01:03:00  26 Two final points here. One from this study is that even when I 
fail, God is faithful. That’s a personal application. But from God’s 
faithfulness extending throughout the story, even though humans 
repeatedly are unfaithful. So that’s comforting takeaway.
Tim Which is probably the common overlap with loyal 
love—God keeping His promises.
Carissa  Keeping His covenant love. Then finally, in the gospels, like 
we just looked at, and actually, all the way back to the story of 
Abraham, even when I face obstacles, or especially when I face 
obstacles, God is calling me to trust and to re-center myself on His 
trustworthiness. So those are the things that I think, as I’ve studied 
this word, make the most sense for me to take away and live out.
Tim As I’m hearing you process, I’m also processing . When I was 
first introduced to Christian faith, the way faith was talked about 
was something that you were doing. And this is really shifting 
the center of gravity, where faith really it’s about what you are 
coming to recognize about the one who is trustworthy.
Carissa  That’s good.
Tim It is about me, but I have to make a choice and recognize something. But 
what I’m recognizing is not something I’m mustering up. It’s coming to see 
someone as trustworthy. That’s helpful. I appreciate the way you set that up. 
Jon Thank you.
Tim Yeah, it’s great. Thank you. That was fun. We should put a just 
a note and pin in the fact that the meaning of having faith in 
someone, and then, therefore, displaying faithfulness to them, this 
is a hot topic in New Testament studies, especially in the study of 
Paul’s letters. We just acted  as if that debate doesn’t exist in this 
conversation. So it does exist. We’ll get to it at some point later.
Jon When we do that word study on pistis.
Tim Yeah, Greek New Testament words. But for now, it was 
good to have this conversation to just focus in on.
Carissa  That’s a good foundation for that conversation.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. Second ending note. This is our last episode 
of our conversation in the character of God series.
Jon So we’ll do one more Q&R. That’ll be next. But otherwise, yeah, 
what a journey. That was a lot of territories to cover.01:04:00
01:05:00  27Tim On one verse of the Bible. 
Jon On one verse of the Bible. 
Carissa  It’s an important one. 
Jon A really important verse. And it’s opened my eyes to how 
much biblical authors riff on those attributes. I mean, it 
just sets the table and you’re off to the races. 
Tim Yeah, totally. 
Jon Thank you guys for unpacking all of that and making that verse really 
meaningful. Thank you for listening along. We’ll do a Q&R next week, 
and then we’ll jump into a whole new series.  Thanks for listening to this 
episode of BibleProject podcast. That’s it. We finished our last conversation 
on this series discussing the five attributes of God in Exodus 34. If you’ve 
enjoyed this series, you will love the videos that we’ve made. We’ve made 
a video for each of these attributes. You could find them on our YouTube 
channel, youtube.com/thebibleproject, and you can find them on our 
website, Bibleproject.com. We’re going to do a final question response 
episode next week, and then we’re going to dive into a brand new series. 
 Today’s show is produced by Dan Gummel, our show notes are 
from Lindsey Ponder, and our theme music is by the band Tents. 
BibleProject is a crowdfunded nonprofit organization. We’re based in 
Portland, Oregon. We make free resources so we can all experience 
the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. And it’s all free because 
of you, and many people like you around the world. It’s such a 
pleasure to work on this. Thank you for being a part of it with us. 01:06:00
