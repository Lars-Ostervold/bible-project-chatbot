the Torah that is the first five books of the Bible are one masterful piece of divine literary Arts the Torah was written on five separate squirrels eat squirrel having its own structure and things but together they talk to each other for example Genesis the first roll and Deuteronomy the last week as book ends mirroring each other and significant ways can I had today we're going to look at the last movement of Deuteronomy and we're going to see any words and ideas that began in the first movements of Genesis if you have like a little Genesis 1 through 11 and it just starts like needles going off again so specifically the last literary movement of Deuteronomy has been coordinated and hyperlink to the first literary movement of Genesis and they occupied the precise opposite location on the Torah the beginning in the end the two words that dominate this section of Deuteronomy are blessing and curse Moses reads a long list of blessing
 for those who keep the Covenant laws and His blessings are amazing but then there's a long list of curses and these can feel really intense like Moses we get it already bad stuff going to happen and it makes you wonder is God going a little bit far to choose to live outside the terms of God's blessing if it's by definition to embrace my own decreation don't choose your own death it's almost as if he always Infinite Source of Life and blessing this is like the inversion of it if you choose to reject internet blessed then he will bring content Kirsten decreation upon yourself and that's what these Covenant curses for a bow at the end of The Scroll of Deuteronomy Moses predicts that Israel will not be able to keep the covenants but as we look forward to the whole story of the Bible what we see is that God's generosity won't be stopped by human failure in a way it's a defense of yahweh's integrity
 say Yahweh was being faithful to the terms of the Covenant is you agree to them which makes the Redemption from Exile even more the brilliant Jim shining in the dark cave because the company of course is not the end of the story The Curse will come but also you already showed mercy so that the Krista at the last word I'm drunk and I talk about blessings and curses in the Deuteronomy scroll it was in the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hey Tim and John hello hello and welcome to the last movement of Deuteronomy we have been spending all year yeah stating our way through the Torah first five Scrolls of the Hebrew Bible wonderful has been really good and I'm glad we did it and I've always wanted to do a read Through the Bible with you which is a very ambitious thing to try the Yeah Yeah Yeahs this is kind of like a fly through this is a fly through Just landing in certain spots but all choreographed and organized by this idea of movements which hopefully have been a meaningful way to think about how a squirrel is divided into its larger section is a lot more work to do in this idea of structure which if you're interested then take a classroom class and you'll see the structure and how the turtles go all the way down as they say with structure that movements is just the first
 kind of Mega Blok yeah yeah what you're saying is the literary design a Biblical text goes from the largest scale down to the smallest scale of the arrangement designed of sentences mind paragraphs in ways that are it's mine boggling really beautiful and cool we're not going to get any geekier and the app or in these conversations but if you want to get Keke a great place to do that so we've been cruising through the Torah and the final on 5th Scroll of the Torah Deuteronomy which is all set as happening in add a whole book and it's a day when Moses is giving his final speeches to the Israelites before they're about to go into the land but big picture this third and final movement of Deuteronomy makes up second half of what we call chapter 26 through the end of the scroll
 and something happens with the language and steam shift here the end of the scroll we start hearing specifically the language of the 7-Day creation story and the Eden story and of the stories leading up to the flood narrative in the scattering of Babylon in other words the themes of language of Genesis 1 through 11 is like you know if you have a like a little Genesis 1 through 11 me like a little metal detector it just starts like this it's like vibrating needles going off scalp so specifically the last literary movement of Deuteronomy has been coordinated and hyperlink to the first literary movement of Genesis and they occupied the precise opposite locations on the Torah the bookends beginning in the end or woven together tightly it's not just the beginning of Genesis and
 Deuteronomy it's actually the beginning and the end of Genesis are linked together we did wrong to me so both the language of Genesis 1 through 11 but also the end of Genesis to find a literary movement of Genesis does Jacob on his deathbed he gathers his sons together let me tell you what will happen at the end of days and he pronounces blessings or curses on the different 12 Stones so here in Deuteronomy he is announcing the blessing and the curse has the life in the death that lay before them in the new Eden land does gen one through eleven stuff but Moses is on his deathbed and he other is too long Poetic speeches that doubles Jacob's death bed speech Moses us to one of them is blessings on the Twelve Tribes Twelve Tribes from Jacob and then the other one Deuteronomy 32 is a long prophetic forecast of the disaster in Doom that awaits Israel because of their treachery
 so Deuteronomy and Genesis are the true book ends around the Torah and the spinal movement of Jeremy's where all the themes of the Torah come together crashing into each other it's really pretty awesome we are going to be tracing the theme of blessing and curse that specifically the blessings and cursings that will happen as a result of what Israel does with the Covenant how they respond to the Covenant relationship and Misfortune and disaster or blessing and abundance hang in the balance of the decision that Moses is forcing them to make the way you just said that makes it sound like some sort of divine karma in other words the way blessing is introduced in the 7-Day creation narrative is it when God blesses the animals in the waters or He blesses the humans in the land creatures
 we blessed the seventh day he's calling out inviting living things to multiply and experience this gift of regeneration in multiplication which before that point just issued from God's word God's own self sustaining power and potential and you give that as a gift so not sense to experience blessing is always borrowed you don't have to do something to get the blessing work the idea of karma as you do good and something good happens to got it yeah it's defined as abundance and multiplying life and then in a harmonious secure environment is the Eden blessing over does come with a command yeah that's right it's a gift that is to be received and it's a gift that can be forfeited if you make choices that will create the conditions that oppose blasting or bring those compromise and dangerous
 blessings and so when Adam and Eve break the Divine command and choose to no good and bad by their own wisdom and that's the choice that God says will lead to death which is the opposite of life so in Genesis 1 and 2 blessing and goodness and life are all paired ideas and words and that you have an opposite curse bad or evil and death and so when the humans don't obey the Divine command they find knowledge of good and bad on their own terms God then exiled them into a state of death for the cut off from the source of life and source of life and then God does present curses yeah not to the humans got to ground the land itself is now working against the humans is not dislike Cooperative abundance just happening in like this Garden State but their
 I like actually enslaved by the land that will absorb them upon their death which will eventually went to that consume them yeah so the curse is about cursed is the ground because of you so the humans were placed where they were created the human was created outside the garden in the land of Dustin. The placed within the proximity of life and harmonious abundance when the land is blessed and that the Blessed land but the humans for fits that blessing and Security in abundance and finds themselves exiled into a land of curse that will lead to death and so in both cases God is the initiator god is the provider and source of all blessing and dad is also the one who initiates the movement of the humans away from the source of blessing into the land of deprivation but the land of deprivation
 Exile thorns and thistles it's all about absence of blessing for the counter of blessing and the way that you did narrative work this is what the humans actually have chose for themselves they didn't fully know what they were doing when they chose the Forbidden tree but it's what their choices lead to know they knew it would lead to death and they were told they were told they but they didn't trust they didn't trust that it would or they didn't trust that they thought that death was apparently a risk worth taking so that's the portrait and so is you go throughout the rest of the Genesis scroll God keeps choosing one out from among the many to renew this promise to restore the Eden blessing to all the families of the earth and so it continues to be a gift in the land of famines and wars and
 siblings and tribes in conflict with each other God will give the gift of Eden blessing to guy named Abraham and you have abundance in the time of famine or to his son Isaac who has a huge Harvest and keeps finding Wells the freshwater when there's a food shortage in the family of Joseph down in Egypt when there's a famine and he keeps them seven years of a bunch of this kind of thing so God is countering the curse so actually escaped all the way back fundamental to the first sentences of Genesis the non creation State the state of non potential non being depicted as dark chaotic Waters that are called A wilderness or form lesson boys and what is language for the pre-creation state which is important because
 it's saying that whatever creation is it something that arises out of a state of non-being non creation and so when God hands humans over to curse its creation and humans sinking back in to the state at which creation was before I mean creation is by definition something that arises up out of here cuz of the creative will and purpose of what you're saying which I think is very significant is it's not like God is saying I can bless you or I can curse you and that my initiative in those are the same or similar when I bless you I'm actually bringing order out of chaos and a curse is just me not doing that anymore which means it's going to just create back into chaos being exiled from the place of blessing or withholding blessing because it's been forfeited
 what somebody losing blessing is yeah making a choice to live and non creation to embrace chaos in my own demise and decreation I think of cursing as retribution or like I'm out to get you yeah exactly and it is definitely God giving people the consequences of the choices but what God is handing people over to is the thing that their choices lead to it was also presented as a mercy that's right yeah and that what God wants of humanity which is to be in the Holy Sacred Space with access to eternal life that doing that in a corrupted way actually is danger yeah so dangerous that it would be better just to get exiled in that state I figured out that state and then let's bring you back in that's a mercy yep that's right
 yeah I think it just changes the portrait of like God could give you a blessing or curse and what are you going to choose but it's more saying that it's the nature of reality that blessing is state of order and life in contrast to a state of disorder turn on creation and non-existence and so to choose to live outside the terms of God's blessing is by definition to embrace my own decreation and that's definitely the portrait here and this is why I've been the prophets and in Paul's letters in particular he uses this language of God's judgment is being handing people over to the consequences of their choices which weeds to death so that's the portrait of blessing and curse in these early chapters of Genesis and so the biblical story is God continues to create Outpost of Eden blessing among a specific people so that
 do they make it spread to others even though it rarely or only occasionally does so by the time we get to Israel sitting on the other side of the Torah by The Plains of Moab at the Jordan River there in a covenant relationship with you all the way and God wants to give them blessing and life and goodness as they cross the river to go into the eaten like land that was promised Abraham so they can become a source of blessing to the nation's if you came to the priest just like Adam and Eve were called today and I have a choice but they have a choice it's so the choice that lay before this generation of Israel through hyperlinks in repetition of the Eden vocabulary is setting this generation of Israel on analogy to Adam and Eve when they were in the garden except now this is real outside the garden about to go in and Adam and Eve were in the garden and to the choices they had to go out we never did conversation like this around the blessing and curse
 do you know it man I don't think we did one kind of intro conversation of the blessing in my early chapters of Genesis or we did and then we just started tracing it in the story of Jacob I'm curious if you think curse is a good English word I know yeah I hear that could so tied to like kind of a Cool Tech like finding people with a power thing is that is overlap with I think the origin of these Hebrew words there's actually a variety of words three Hebrew words one of them in particular is connected to incantation Bell the king of Moab hires phelim the sorcerer to just one of the words so it comes from that round but I think it's a good example of how Israelites adopted language from the cultural context but the words mean different things in light of
 who Yahweh Yahweh is the words have been reworked around the Biblical Portrait doesn't seem to use it as an incantation and then you said it's an expression of if you are living in Harmony and Covenant bond with the creator of all that is the source of all life that's the blessing but to distance yourself to betray or make choices to separate from the source of all life puts you in the land of curse stepped on
 so that's one whole piece going on here also significant at this point in a biblical story is that the conditions of the relationship between God and Israel are all media to through this Covenant is formalized relationship so that it's spelled out very clearly what decisions lead the blessing in life and goodness what decisions lead to curse and fatness and death and so we've been in this context of the Covenant since the book of Acts of that but we're going to meditate on in these next three conversations are this focus on the blessing and the curse I mean the words blessing and curse go off the charts in the spinal movement of Deuteronomy and I thought it might be useful to do something I don't think we've ever done before which is read or the survey some ancient near Eastern Covenant treaties because Scholars have long observed
 the language figures of speech and even the rough literary flow of the Deuteronomy scroll follows or has parallels with ancient near Eastern Covenant tree you read someone we went to the LA conversation I thought we just read re-read I don't know what it's called but it was the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi Code of Hammurabi was a king who came in to rule and he said these are the wise laws by which I will govern the land because I'm talking here is about two Nations entering into coming out with each other we have actually I don't know if we have but I have read these okay the macro flow of Deuteronomy is the first movement chapters 1 through 11 is Moses retelling the past history of the relationship between Yahweh and then Israel
 between the cabinet maker and the one receiving the Covenant weary tells the story of the relationship and then he summons them to be faithful to her I want to 11 your army 12 then are all of the laws that are like the stipulation the terms of his relationship and then you get in the last movement warnings about the consequences of Covenant loyalty or betrayal Moses is going to call God is a witness these two poems as a witness and Heaven and Earth as a witness to the Covenant and so on so that same basic flow is exactly the flow of these ancient near Eastern Covenant treaties begins with a prologue but here's the story of our relationship begins with a legal agreement here's the stipulation that we're going to live by list of the blessings and curses and then something Witnesses want to text him out here from a three-volume collection
 edited by a scholar William Halo just called the context of scripture that's a comprehensive collection in English translation of every kind of ancient near Eastern document that's relevant to studying the Old Testament it's a really good for stuff like this one of the first Men Collection the missionaries entreaties comes from actually this roughly the same time period of Moses and Israel somewhere in the 14th to 13th centuries and these are all Covenant treaties where the powerful figure was the hittite Empire that existed actually in kind of Southeastern area what we call modern-day turkey I'm not super familiar with that Empire if it bites yeah they were a thing they were think and they exercised influence over all of today we would call syria-lebanon I like the northern
 Tigris and Euphrates exactly yeah yeah some modern-day turkey a half but civilizations kind of her all along that River bad correct in this kind of century and a half. 14th May 13th the Hittites were running the show up there but down below them would have been planted or in the Babylonians they just wear out of powerful at this point and the people living down there are called The amou Drew more what are known in the Hebrew Bible is the amorites in the emirate's covers all who will later be known as Babylon riots are the people's inhabiting the land of what today we would call Syria and also israel-palestine oh I'm sorry the Canaanites are overlapping terms with Emirates the amorites refers to the different than the Babylonians and I guess what I was asking is are the Babylonians around at this point
 play their way to the east their way to the East and they're not a big player right now not right now this tree is up and do them a bunch of trees so the politics spreading their influence and so they ended up making alliances with all of these Amorite City Regents and so the trees come from here so here's one that's my favorite one just because of the names involved so one it's between choopulu Leona and a zebra with the two gangs involved that's right chew Luli soupy Numa Numa Numa full version of the Earth are six duplicate the best preserved in the akkadian language which is the cousin Semitic language of Hebrew
 so the superior figures should be losing, so it begins the says my Majesty chuppi movie, The Great king the king of hot tea hero beloved by the storm God I my Majesty have taken you in vassalage sebasol is the term for like the inferior Covenant partner and I have seated you upon the throne of your father and if you a zebra that's the imperior king from this day on do not protect the king of haughty which is stupid, your lord and if you don't protect the land of hot tea then he's going to go on some terrible things are going to happen to you so this Covenant agreement between shoe glue and my Majesty here oh great king and you you know lowly Asia ra who I put you on your throne anyway your puppet King Of Me
 what's going to go on he's going to retell the story in days past there was hostility in the land but I came in to keep the peace and established you do on your father's throne and you need to pay tribute to me he's going to then move on to like historical background is going to retail the history of the two kingdoms how they related in the past but how a zebra rose up and submitted himself to suppiluliuma and began paying him tribute and they establish an alliance that protected them from these other things that are round that's the section after that begins all of these stipulations like the laws so whoever is my Majesty's friend should also be your friend whoever is my Majesty the enemy should be your enemy
 if the king of haughty goes to the land of the Ori hurrying or to the land of Egypt or to the land of Babylon or to the land of ashitaka were the land all these lands close to your border and they are hostile to my Majesty so basically if anyone's coming and giving us trouble yeah and if you zerra don't mobilize wholeheartedly with troops and chariots and fight the enemies with your whole heart and then okay. Then that's a one-paragraph the next paragraph paint the whole another case study OK Google as the event for your help so whether or not I've called for your help or like you see the battles going on we need help and then he ends his paragraph by saying if you don't send troops to come help me you will have broken the off he goes on if some other enemy Rises up
 the king of hot tea then I'm going to come knocking at your door if someone else oppresses you a zebra then I will come to your help this really long long section yeah it's giving summarizes like we got each other's back if anyone speaks and evil word to you about my Majesty shoot people and you do not seize him and send him to the king of hunting you will have broken your oath okay so conspirators if anyone Rises up to the land of a zero and speaks unfavorable things before them and you don't report them to me then you know you will have broken your off okay so this section is really long after all of the you no stipulations then shoot me a message I have summoned the Thousand Gods to assemble around this Earth and I call them as witness
 I need behan's the name then comes the curses of the words of the treaty and of the oath which are inscribed on this tablet if a zero does not keep the words of this treaty and of the oath and if he breaks the oath then let these old gods destroy a zebra together with his head his wives his son's his grandson's his house this town has land all his possessions keeps the words of the treaty that those Gods protect and it goes through the list again you get the basic idea okay let me just show you one more why is there some of this and brackets and some of the other six duplicates and so the main base duplicate is what they call the a tablet and then if there's gaps or broken spots in that one they still in from the other one and so they kind of Mark that was brackets
 everyone this one comes from a different time. This is a Canaanite scription so this is a treaty between two Canaanite Kings one up in the north called the severe a description was discovered in Punta de Siria it dates from 740 b c so this is 500 years later that the one that's between two kings one of the king's is bar guy on the other kings name is multi L A says this is the tree I had to do a whole project on the Scrabble score that many years ago so well let me just get it follows the same out like a the Covenant curses are the best so when you get to the Covenant curses he says now if Marty is one of the Kings this is an inferior king the king of our pod should prove unfaithful to Bar guy
 the children that mate all should be unfaithful to the children of barangay off then if seven Rams go up Upon A you may she not conceive and 7 nurses anoint their breasts to nurse young boys made that youngboy not have his fill it's kind of like a taunting almost yeah if 7 Mares suckle a cult may it not be satisfied feels like it feels like school ground taunting you wishing to Master on a covenant violator better go getter is 7 cows are nursing their calves may it not have it spill the seven use chocolate lamb may it not be satisfied if seven hens go looking for food may they find and kill nothing I was working on this with my colleagues in grad school was like what's up with the
 killer chicken there's a box at the end of the is mate all should be unfaithful to his kingdom become a kingdom of sand for the rhetoric are high. Which is the patron God of this relationship pour out on it every sort of evil that exists on the earth and in heaven every sort of trouble and he's shower at the pond r-pod for seven years May the Locust of our first seven years May the worms eat absolutely yeah I wasn't just an Israeli thing and also because again the letters of the word 7 or spelled with the same letters in Semitic languages is the word complete your fault May the grass not come forth May there be no green beer made of vegetation not be seen a python sketch which one the one where that like Fred
 guard is taunting the like this is like that I totally get that there be no sound of heart for liar among the people only crying and lamentation May the gods send devours against r-pod May the mouth of the snake the mouth of the Scorpion the mouth of the bear the mouth of the panther devour May r-pod become a ruined Heap for the gazelle in the fox in the desert creatures in the hair and the wildcat in The Owl and the magpie The Magpie at the bird bird living in the ruins of an ancient city May the city be mentioned no more among the names the other cities are like
 here's my point is that long list of Covenant curses are part and parcel this is part of the rhetoric of the rhetoric of these agreements yeah and so when we come to in the next conversation we have about this the long list of Covenant curses in Deuteronomy 28 long long lest it feels excessive okay and it is excessive and that's the rhetorical Point okay that's how these treaties worked and it's how these trees worked so it's just another layer where do you need to know this to understand the Covenant curses Deuteronomy but it does help explain why they have the literary form in the intensity they do cuz it's imitating Moses and the framer of author Deuteronomy is adopting this kind of cultural format as the medium of Israel's Covenant relationship with y'all if you would say and you have said before that they're not adopting you know I like that's why I
 but these were too. Yeah and I just heard you say before like they're not adopting this is just their language this is the way that they that's right when the biblical authors that are the vehicle of God's word to his people before was of black when you talk about the cosmos and you talk about black holes and you talk about dark energy and whatever you're not adopting or imitating astrophysicists you're just like this is just the way I see the world you see the world I cut it the way that we understand the world and so I think the same things happening with the Covenant old literary form of Deuteronomy in it yeah so you always depicted and imagined here as a entering into a covenant with a baffle that the god rescued and that wants to give life and blessings to and the red Rex really turned up
 Eric turned up because the vassal King and their people need to like really I mean this is something to take some real serious swallow this pill I take this serious yeah yes the points for the rhetoric is this is business this is business Stakes are high stakes are there also seems to be maybe something in the culture of it almost seems with a Canaanite one that you had it feels like almost like there was as levity to it maybe that's cuz I was laughing about the killer check-ins but still it just kind of like it just feels like there's almost a celebratory nature of how extreme this is to where there seems to be this sense of like when you're doing a treaty this is a big beautiful moment right because there's peace now and there's an alignment of
 in a way that should bring prosperity to both people entering the treating it's a moment of great kind of like honor and right I think most of these the king and Superior position you know it's definitely not hiding that fact is turning up the volume on that fact totally yeah there is someone with more power politics politics and I wonder if the vassal Kingdom If part of this is kind of like you bring it like we're like we're in and it's almost like kind of like this rally it's just I know I mean if somebody made this green with me I'd be quaking in my boots she like chicken tonight come take my children
 The Magpie reside in my roof I don't know I think this is meant to be intimidation and I think it's silly not to cuz I was laughing but it's like a Garrison appears that your gate you know with tablets and there's like a Harold reading this allowed you know and there's four hundred soldiers holding Spears you could like turn this into a ruin everyone's quiet yeah yeah okay so the modern equivalent is like this is kind of like what like Liam Neeson says to the guy that likes to his daughter he's like I'm going to get you your money taken you know like I got a special set of skills now I will hunt you down and I will kill everything that you think is important in life I will burn it all to the ground well-liked and not mess around ya got that tone with some diplomacy thrown in
 I mean it's to Kings one's more powerful than the other you're trying to make this less powerful King to get them to submit to give you the monetary tribute to become your Ally and you want to turn up the volume on the consequences for betraying the relationship and that's the same purpose and reason for the intensity of the rhetoric in Deuteronomy as well don't choose your own death it's almost as if he always Infinite Source of Life and blessing this is like the inversion of it if you choose to reject infinite blessing you will bring you no intent Kirsten decreation upon yourself and that's what this Covenant curses are about okay to the closest you're saying when we get into the curses in Deuteronomy with separating them if you have this in your mind that there is this format of a treaty
 but then you also keep in mind that what's going on here is using that format but then embedding it into the greater story which is God saying I have created blessing I am gifting blessing I did it originally for all Humanity I'm doing it again for you guys so that you can bring it to all humanity and when you don't listen to my voice and when you go and you do as good in your own eyes you're going to miss out on the blessing and you're going to experience curse and the curse is death and let me help you understand the death is not a good thing let me remind you let's let it sink in case it wasn't clear the literary form to communicate with Stakes is very similar to ancient near Eastern Covenant
what's up with all that in mind let's turn to Deuteronomy 27 and full of ancient cultural can a covenant form gets woven into the themes of the biblical story right here the Moses and the Elders of Israel charged all the people saying keep all of the commands that I command you today and it should be on the day when you all cross the Jordan to the land Yahweh you God's giving you and you will set up for yourselves large Stones coat them with plaster lime to find some huge rocks coat them with plaster why is it's a lime lime I think was the actual like chemical substance is used to plaster The Rock Blaster The Rock listen to record stand
 then you shall write or like inscribe into the plaster all of the words of this Torah when you cross over so you can enter the land Yahweh God is giving you make a big public tour yeah a land flowing with milk and honey instead of this emblem the entry point into the land is marked by the words of the Covenant stipulations I forgot about this we have a video in the how to read the Bible series where we have a big kind of stones and I was just thought that was just some exaggerated the stationary version of the tablets that Moses was he knows Karen around 4 so it shall be when you cross the Jordan you shall set up on a ball these Stones as I'm commanding you today and cut them with lime and build an altar there to Yahweh your God and altar of stones don't use any iron tools on them just like he pups
 build an altar offer of going up offerings to Yahweh your God sacrificed peace offerings and have a party we named where this is happening mount a ball
 then what they're told is then line up the tribes on two mountains on Mount gerizim lineup six of the tribes to pronounce blessing other people and then line up six other tribes on Mount a ball to pronounce the curse and we're going to do this in some Legrand trying to get these stones have written on them the command and then I'm going to take those up to mount a ball cuz that's the amount of curse and then you're going to have half the other tribes, but I'm not crazy not to check this out I'm going to show you a picture so these are two very tall Hills with a town down in between the me know where these Hills are the towns called him I said the town of Shazam modern-day second second and then this is in Israel Palestine today and you can see you so you're if you're looking West
 there's a valley between the two hills and Hounds in the valley and then flanking the town I could South looking West the south is not good as name to the south of the blessings and then to the Northwest mounted ball you take the rocks with the curses in the Los totora on not a pain and then they would yell we're looking at is Hills and I wouldn't imagine being able to really hear someone that well yelling from one side to the other like you might be able to but it would be it would be difficult about it that there is a natural Amphitheater like shape to data Hills you can imagine it's possible at this scale you could yell at the other hell Joshua is the Joshua does this Joshua's 8 he gets the stones and then Joshua 24 23 24 you actually do do they do this
 Bible so rad so the book of Deuteronomy has three large movements we're just in the first paragraph of the third movement the book itself has all these cool symmetrical features to it and so the center movement of Deuteronomy is all about the laws and the last paragraph before the laws begin another Words the book and around the lost its chapter 11 Deuteronomy and now we're in chapter 27 and these two are the two paragraphs write before and after the laws at the center of the book so this thing about the two mountains was actually introduced in chapter 11 back here this matching partir
 except when you compare them there's one little extra detail that you were supposed to have noticed so Deuteronomy 11 the same yep thing is talked about Deuteronomy 11 verse 26 look I am setting before you today blessing and curse blessing if you listen to the commands the curse if you don't listen to the commands and it shall come about when you always brings you into the land you shall put the blessing on Mount gerizim the curse on Mount a ball aren't these across the Jordan west of the way towards the sun set in the land of the Canaanites who live in the audible opposite gilgal you know the two hills by The Oaks of more at 2 Mountain that's interesting what about those Oaks at Mora
 oh yes this is first place where Abram set up a worship center when he went into the land this is red and you remember the whole story of Abraham and the stories of his test of trust in Failure begins in chapter 12 at the Oaks at Mora which corresponds to his last great test of faith which is that the mountain of Moria and there that these two mountains he built altars that become the emblems of his loyalty and commitment to the God who called him and so isn't it interesting now that the descendants of Abraham are called to the same place with the two mountains one blessing one curse with the trees so you're saying and Deuteronomy 11 Moses is eluding wait what is he say just go to the mountains I'm not guaranteeing Blessing about guys named Chris I might be able to mountains across the Jordan
 beside the Oaks of moreth besides Oaks of Mora so The Oaks of Mora we're honored mountain in Genesis 12 where they are not where Abraham goes first when Abraham's given the promise of blessing you goes into the land and you goes to chicken down at the middle of the hills to the Oak of Mora and then we get to promise from there he goes to a hillside then run and then he builds another altering but it's the mountain in the tree this is all Garden of Eden imagery to Moses and this is the place where poor Father Abraham had his encounters with the Seed of Abraham being given a choice by the trees near the mountains a blessing and the mountains curse and remember Eden is a high place
 trees of testing right center and what school is that this paragraph at the end of Deuteronomy 11 is hyper linked to the first paragraph on the other side of the laws in Deuteronomy 27 and hear the Israelites are supposed to go divided themselves at the two high places by the tree and pronounced it themselves whether or not they will listen to the command at least the life or break the command that leads to death so this whole thing is replaying the Adam and Eve moment at the tree on the eating mouth but here to Hills School so the singular command that God gave the Adam and Eve is now the whole list of commands that are etched on the Rocks okay yeah and don't forget when they first go up to the mountains the first thing they do is build alter have the sacrifices in to have a huge party
 Eaton Rejoice before y'all leave. Which is one of the sacrifices offerings write a peace offering is a sign for that all is well and you celebrate the abundance of God's Eaton blessing and so on the tablet is the Torah itself written or just the Covenant commands of the Torah you will write on the stones all the words of this Torah now remembered we don't know what they have is it the laws that we have before us and do army 12226 certainly some of them were in there but remember that was a selection by the author of Deuteronomy and so yeah yeah whatever they had the framers of the Torah putting stuff together it seems like we're just imagine them is obeying the Torah that we've just been reading through even though that's not what they would have had a really but the blurriness is intentional here cuz the Pooh
 it is the author of the final shape of the Torah that's connected to the final shape of the prophets and it's not is that again this is main theme every generation is to see itself as the generation that came up out of Egypt that entered into the Covenant and so we the readers of the Hebrew Bible that's not our to see ourselves in these Israelites standing at the base of the Jordan River about to do this when they go in their protetora is our complete Torah so to speak so once they go up to these two mountains then what follows is they begin to pronounce kind of like these like summary curses and what's funny is remember there's two mountains Mountain a blessing the mountains curse you can pick for a team here then the Levites will answer and say to all the men of Israel
 I'm in the mountains Simeon Levi Judah issachar Joseph and Benjamin they get the blessing mountain and then team curse on t.v. actually was cursed by stat Gad Asher's Evelyn Dan and naftali the Levites Wilderness to the B Squad oh yeah now it's just true the Levites will then answer and say it's all the men of Israel with a loud voice
 so yeah it doesn't say where the Levites are standing well they got to be on the mountain of blessing oh oh I'm so sorry yes they are the Levites are there and then and then with a prestigious pronounce 12 curses of course cuz there's Twelve Tribes and every one of these kind of is adapting one of the laws from earlier in the collection cursed is the man who makes an idol or molten image and all the people shall say truly I meant is the one who dishonors father and mother in the people say amen
 cursed is the one who moves his neighbors boundary marker is the one who leads the blind one on the road cursed is the one who distorts Justice do an immigrant orphan or Widow cursed is the one who lays down with his father's wife cursed does the one who lays down with any animal cursed is the one who lays down with his sister cursed is the one that lays down with his mother in law cursed is the one who strikes his neighbor in secret and I can talk about is being cursed is the one who accept a bribe to strike down the innocent cursed is the one who doesn't confirm the words of the store up by doing them
 and all the people should say I'm in so you start to feel that rhetorical intensity you're adding up here and it's about to get more intense which will explore in the next conversation but there's a lot of Covenant cursing going on here at the end of Deuteronomy and I was just trying to help us both see how it ties into the Eden story but also how it ties into its cultural context and that's just what it means the rate of the Hebrew Bible as ancient and unified literature and nothing for it would be pretty wild liturgy to experience things are marks and call and response yeah I think part of it again remember this is all crafted with an eye towards. There's no where the story went that the people weren't faithful to the Covenant and the day ended up in Exile in the land of curse and so in a way I think this Covenant form of Deuteronomy
 is helping the generations of the X-Files see that they didn't end up being conquered by Babylon because Marjorie was more powerful they didn't end up in Babylon because God was asleep on the job it was the results of their own decisions they were fully warned ahead of time and that in a way it's a defense of you always Integrity to say Yahweh was being faithful to the terms of the Covenant is you agree to them which if you choose curse than he was faithful to deliver you to curse which makes the Redemption from Exile even more kind of a brilliant Jim shining in the dark cave because the Covenant curse is not the end story just like for Adam and Eve when God said cursed is the ground and Krista snake but that cursing of the snake is in anticipation of the seed of the woman who will crush the snake and so its judgment and mercy at the same time and Moses is going to
 anticipate both to let the curse will come but also y'all live show mercy so that the curse doesn't get the last word so that's the opening section of this we're going to take the next couple episodes to dive deeper into this future forecasting of blessing and curse for Israel and then after that we'll check out the final words of Moses thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue in the last movement of the Deuteronomy scroll and we're going to talk about Moses has horrible pep talk right before Israel enter the promised land Moses predicts Israel's going to reject their Covenant with Yahweh and Yahweh is going to have to rescue them from the very things that they thought they wanted the bar the door is diagnosis of The Human Condition is about a misdirected or distorted desire the most deceptive ones are is when people actually think they're doing the right thing and what they end up doing is
 pain and death a circumcision of the heart is something that needs to be removed so that it died so that the real heart that Yahweh knows humans are both capable of and will bring True Lies so that that can live today's episode was produced by Cooper pelts with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Dan Campbell Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza had to whoop by the invitations for annotated podcast in our app Bible project was scrapped by the nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as one unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make is free because it's already been paid for by thousands of people just like you said thank you so much for being a part of this with us and I'm from Los Angeles California that was baptized into baby only really started following Jesus for the last three years of my life I first heard about the Bible project by bumping into accident with a Jonah YouTube video
