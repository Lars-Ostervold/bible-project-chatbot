God is spirit and Hebrew the word spirit is ruach the basic image of ruoff is breath is an invisible energy that I breathe in and breathe out that's raw and then I look out in the world and I see the real off blowing in the trees and the grass and that's an an amazing energy and it's the very thing that I take in when I inhale calling God's invisible energizing presents ruoff is a metaphor whatever Beautiful Mind is behind all of this the first uncaused cause so to speak that generates and animates all of this since the things that this must be a result of that beings Rock
 hey this is Jonah Bible project and today we begin a New Journey we're going to read through the Bible slowly Movement by movement tracing biblical theme this is our attempt to learn how to read the Bible while we read the Bible these conversations are a companion to the reading Journey that you can do in our house so if you haven't downloaded the Bible project that I recommend you do so no movement of scripture is a large section of chapters and stories that all together make it. Beautiful whole every scroll in the Hebrew Bible generally has three or four movements and while we read through movement of scripture we're going to trace one biblical thing we're going to find where the peers and its key words and synonyms and when you use those words those links that help us uncover that theme
 this is the beginning of our journey so we're going to begin in the first movement of the Bible which is roughly Genesis chapter 1 through 11 and in these Pages we're going to trace the theme of God's Will and won't take long for us to find him. Who shows up in the third line the Earth was formless and empty Darkness was over the surface of the deep Abyss but the ruach of God hovered over the waters when darkness has over the face of the chaotic ocean it's called to home which was the Hebrew word for the abysmal chaotic ocean waters at the moment that elims ruha life giving presents and breath is there you don't refer to that deep Abyss as to how many more you refer to it with the more neutral term the waters the waters can also give life in the form of wells and streams and rivers so it's as if already there's a transformation that
 chaos into order by the presents through off of Bell and the life-giving energizing spirit of God in the first movement of scripture thanks for joining us.
 all right we are starting something new I'm sitting here with Tim and Chrissa hey hello good morning good morning and this new thing that we're doing is we're walking through the Bible Movement by movement tracing one theme in that movement and this conversation is going to be on the movement Genesis 1 through 11 which is the first movement of the first goal of the Bible and we're going to be tracing the theme of Holy Spirit or gods are you off but this is why we are practicing our skills of reading with we are practicing yes this idea is let's go through the Bible Movement by movement begins to come on board the idea that the Bible is presented in movements and try to kind of like read the Bible and movements even bigger picture it's a collection of Scrolls better themselves organized into big group
 Scrolls like the Torah or the prophets right but then when you zoom in to like to Torah Scrolls and then each of those girls is not broken up into chapters that was our last conversation chapters are not the original literary organization given to the Scrolls rather than biblical authors gave a design to this and what we're calling movements and those movements are signal to the reader by all these layers of repetition and moments of beginning enclosure and and so on and then within each movement parts and then within each parts their sections and it's all arranged in beautiful patterns of repetition and then symmetry to help your mind trace the themes that link all the way through of some kind of like the movements are the way it's organized into parts and then when replacing a theme really just tracing or tracking a repeated word or image through
 particular movement and that the muscle you got to develop and reading biblical literature and once you develop it as you start to notice all kinds of cool stuff and reading them is meant for me at least can be helpful because you can see the structure of a whole section that's United incoherent and that contributes to how we understand the meaning of a section of texts and also because the main things are going to change for movement to my focusing on Holy Spirit and Genesis 1 through 11 and that comes up later but isn't as prominent as a theme as it is there in fact the gentle scroll has four large literary movements God's spirit only is mentioned in the first wasn't Genesis 1 to 11 and then in the last movement in the justice story both God's spirit I think that occurs once in that movement and then the human Spirit forever marked by the presence of God's spirit which gives him
 wisdom to be a ruler come on it's a meaningful kind of envelope frame around the whole book of Genesis Joseph becomes the first narrative image of a supercharged human whose ruling by the spirit in the wisdom of God which is what Genesis 1 set you up till 4 anyway we're getting ahead of ourselves but the point is that this is why we're reading and movements not chapters and this is why we're tracing words through and we're going to just go through the Torah doing this Movement by movement you will get to the Torah in 2022 is the idea and then we'll keep going from there it's a long you're like man we spent a lot of time to Genesis well here we are again also we have an app that is coming out in January 2022 and lots of cool things in the app but one of them is going to be this habit this
 muscle of reading movements and tracing a theme and an interactive way so that you could actually read find the themes unlock the themes so this podcast conversation has been a company that Journey correct which will be a really cool thing to do a great way to read the Bible so right now the mission for us we could trace me through Genesis 1 through 11 which is the first literary movement actually is Genesis 1:1 through 11 chapter 11 verse 26 and there's three parts to it doesn't count of three steps each introduces Keys set of figures onto the stage one is the first part of Adam and Eve has chapters 1 through 5 then you have the story of Noah Noah and his sons chapter 6 through 10 and then Abraham comes onto the scene a little moment in the sun it's a story of a mother and father
 who is children makeup Three Sons three sets of parents and three sons and each one of these is a little variation similar but yet different from each other and then in different ways and God's spirit is right in the thick of it leaving the store together so that's movement one and then just so you know where this is heading in Genesis movement to is a story of Abraham and then Movement 3 is a story of Isaac and Jacob Isaac's father and son get their stories merge together Genesis 25:18 37:1 which would be there in the top stories from the store or the story of Joseph yeah it's the story of Jacob's sons or otherwise known as story of Joseph and his brothers Joseph 11 Brothers
 and so that's the girl Genesis four movements as just a quick summary if you hadn't listened to move a conversation we're borrowing movements from the language they come from Symphonies and it's a great way to think about how these scrolls are designed that you get this melody these themes ideas and then they repeated in these large blocks so nothing in jeopardy with any movements to the movements are connected like the Book of Genesis has four movements and those movements are even connected to each other by these repeating pattern repeated stories
all right so Genesis 1 through 11 and God's spirit let's jump in all right so we are going to start in once again the first sentences with Genesis cross in the last episode we already camped out on these opening to where is actually three lines for a few lines here but we'll just revisit again we're going to get a total of think it's 8 if you're looking for the theme of God spirit in the first literary movement you're going to come across eight passages that link it all together I think all of these eight passengers use the word Spirit or ruach except for the one in Genesis too but it's a really strong seeing there anyway how you can't just get out of concordance and look for the same word that's one thing you need to do but you also need to pay attention to the way a synonym or a similar image can get repeated so
 teaching example when we get to Genesis too but just to bring us back he's through the opening lines of the first creation narrative has one and two Chris I hope that you have the honors in the beginning Elohim created the skies and the land now the land was wild and waste and darkness was over the face of the deep but the spirit wind the roof of Elohim was over the face of the waters probably talk about these two verses with more than any other two verses in the Holy Bible over the seven years on this project so to summarize past discussions these opening lines are set out in three parts the opening and closing Parts mention Elohim involvement in creation and then the center to Lyons refer to the pre-creation state trying to imagine
 the blank canvas of nothingness which which team started and Elohim is just the general word for a Divine being yes in English is God and I've just gotten into the habit of transliterating the Hebrew word another spelling the Hebrew word Elohim letters I just come get you to think about it so I told him it's a generic title in Hebrew and English boards deity so we begin with a summary statement I will he created everything up there everything down here what was the beginning state wild and waste yeah and the chaotic deep Waters that's right so it's a state of chaos Darkness decreation stay or pre-creation of pre so the last line in the mention of the ruach it's the Hebrew word that gets translated a spirit or wind John why do I have spiritwind there
 yeah because in Hebrew rock is translated spirit it's also translated wind-tossed translate breath those three ideas I have three separate words in English that one word in Hebrew which is Rock so and Hebrew you don't really think of those things as separate ideas have one idea cuz if a rock is blowing in the trees you don't think of it as a person's breath but in the biblical imagination you think of it as God's breath is very Enchanted Way you see the world it's the invisible Life Energy person or of God but Spirit Wind and breadth are all United by that idea so the interesting image is that in the middle of disorder and darkness before there was order Elohim preceded that
 and the way that Elohim is present with in darkness and disorder is in the invisible form of his real and also important we talk about this in the past that when darkness has over the face of the chaotic ocean it's called to home which was the Hebrew word for the abysmal chaotic ocean waters but the moment that Elohim threw off his life giving presents and breath is there you don't refer to that deep Abyss as to how many more you refer to it with the more neutral term the waters because the water's to home is almost always negative it'll swallow you up make you drown in it deep but the water's can do that but the water is can also give life in the form of wells and streams and rivers so it's as if already there's a transformation of the chaos in to order by the presents
 the real off of Ellen so you have opening portrait is the ruach Elohim is the way of the name is present in the midst of dark chaotic places bringing about and setting things in motion that will result in the emergence of a garden from these Waters and life and fruit trees and people and family is in peace with the animal sense blessing on the 7th day so how is saying that Elohim Zorua is present different than just saying Elohim present right cuz an Elohim is a spiritual being right so Elohim is spirit I suppose so French Haitian why not why would this verse just say in God was over the family. Take this aspect of God I suppose of his
 that's what was their first he was there so I guess I think we talked about this years ago when we went through the the spirit of God conversations cement for the basic image of Rue off of our experience for which we have a word is breath or wind for a sew-in invisible animating energy there's an invisible energy that I breathe in and breathe out that's raw and then I look out in the world and I see the real off blowing in the trees and the grass and that's an an amazing energy and it's the very thing that I take in what I am so calling God's invisible energizing presents ruoff is a metaphor it's taking my through physical experience Human Experience of in and out and seeing real off at work in the world and coming to the conclusion that who at whatever Beautiful Mind is behind all of this the first uncaused cause so to speak the general
 it's an anime it's all of this since the stains that this must be a result of that beings who are the beings animating energy in invisible life energizing animating presents for the Rocks is all about animating life so to describe God's Rock here means that the reader we're thinking like life is about to happen at least that Association is made when you keep reading it also seems like it's connected to the next verse where God speaks because God's breath and speech really similar yeah that's right yeah the next sentence in Genesis after the spirit of Elohim over the face of the waters is an Elam set he speaks yeah but you're saying we speak you breathe out if you use your breath to say a word so yeah I mean all of our language about a transcendent
 being who isn't a part of creation but rather is the ground and source of all existence and being in creation it's always going to be metaphorical because all language is based on experience and then I use that experience to go out and create paradigms for how I see the world so I have invisible breath that animates me but I receive it I don't give it to anybody else I receive it and then it's so you're imagining that the Beautiful Mind that sustains everything must be to give her a breath in the source of all I think that's how they met reworks yeah that sustaining life which is with the next link is all about is how the roof animates humans number calling from years ago when we had this conversation we were trying to find maybe I'm more in our way of seeing the world trying to find a category 4 it for I think for a while we camped out on the concept of bias
 principal and then I think we ended on energy just call the energy because your breath is connected to this idea of of the energy energizes me and you the wind is energizing the air and your spirits this idea of your life horse yeah what's animating you was here and those are all connected ideas and it's right so maybe just one we got trouble calling your energy because once you start getting into the Theology of the Holy Spirit holy spirit is more than just an animating like for real that's right the holy spirit is that's right and even though it's God's personal energizing presents people were still a little dismayed that we use the word energy cuz you weren't trying to say It's Just Energy but it's like an energetic it's personal
 a small straight to work I love to be a personal energizing presents that picks up this imagery and language of the Ross in Genesis chapter 1 verse Psalm 104 is hold meditation on the nature of creation using language and imagery of Genesis chapter one and it's this great a section of the of the song starts a 27 where the poet's talking about all the animals in creation about how they wait for Elohim to give them food at the proper time and whenever you see a deer grazing in the field you are watching Elohim give food to them and you're looking at Ellen's open hand to satisfy his creatures verse 29 when you Elohim hide your face they are dismayed when you take away their ruwa
 fire and return to the dust so that is what brought this is all the creatures out of the ground in Genesis one so when there is goes away they go back to the dust you send forth your ruler they are created and you renew the face of the ground great meditation are in Genesis 1 When God says let creatures emerged out of the ground it doesn't say let my ruoff bring the creatures out of the ground what it says is let them come out of the ground but you know from Reading Genesis one that all anything comes out of anything because of the roloffs all the way back out there in that pivot first first two and so also hear you can talk about a creature being born a deer being born as the sending out of God's Rudolph and create
 and then when the relock is withdrawn that decreation for an undoing of creation so that's the idea here and sounds still mystical and English to me to say their spirit is taken from them but to make that connection with their breath and their life that's connected to their breath and that God's spirit is what sustains that. Just feel so much more of a cohesive idea to the second appearance of the steam engine 2011 Genesis chapter 2
so Genesis 2 verse 4 Begins the next litter a unit after the 7-Day Christian narrative and it's the Garden of Eden story and that goes from chapter 2 verse 42 3:24 so from the creation of Eden and then humans in Eden that's the opening scenes and then the Exile from Eden at the end of chapter three of its kind of a beginning and an end and we were told at the beginning of the Eden story is that there were no shrubs and no plants in the land because there had not been any water and there were no humans so no water the plants to humans but wasn't God hovering over the waters could be a lot of waters okay when the opening two lines that describe the disorder in the pre-creation chaos remember their conflicting images if you take them literally you cuz those describing the land as a waste
 yeah one way to Desert and then the next line describes as a dark chaotic ocean where the land in the desert go to coordinated images deserts are usually lands that don't have enough water in Calico shouldn't have much has too much water so the rest of Genesis 1 takes off with that image of too much water rights in Seattle and emerges out of the water separating the waters Landing roaches out of the water the eaten there are two picks up that Wasteland idea and turns it into a whole narrative for the land doesn't have enough water now we start with land as the starting point but the land without water out of you mean in Genesis 2 4 2 4 and following yeah that's right so the first creation Narrative of the seven days begins with too much water
 Eden narrative begins with too much land and the water and again depending on your assumptions that you bring the Bible you know you're going to find a way to maybe harmonizer make those work into a linear sequence so you can construct the historical processes by which Christina marriage or are you you might bring a different assumption to say the goal of narratives is to set two perspectives on creation to what is ancient Israelites could talk about creation creation out of water or creation of the desert and they're both ways of describing the same thing in different images so we have no plans no water and no humans so what God precedes to do is first bring up water out of the ground with little spring that gives you mud and then Yahweh Elohim is able to form Adam from The edema from the ground
 yeah grab the thread even though you have a dime from the other mama just got a pile of mud or like a statue beginning stages of an idle threat you but to turn that into a image image of Elohim you need to give it life and so these These are the important lines Genesis 24/7 Yahweh Elohim breathed into the nostrils the breath of life and it's not the word root miss your mommy smart same as later and paired with ruoff I think when After the flood getting that in the 7-Day creation narrative it's got threw off that brings about life that culminates in the images of God the humans in the evening there it is it's God's
 mama is exhalation the passes into the mud to give it life and now you got two images for God's spirit to have the word and you have to wear an estimate and then later narratives are going to just pick up both of those and connect them together cuz there's two ways of talking about the same thing so you go from Dirt 2 animated creature and the transition from Adam from the other Mama to become a living being and what happened between the two of those God breathed the Breath of Life in this way our spirit is just God's spirit kind of being given to us the breath of breath our spirit is God's Barbara back to Psalm 104 that line Psalm 104 verse 29 when you take away their roof their breath when you take away the roofs of the animals die
 every living creature within this world via is living on borrowed borrowed Mishima you send forth your spirit and they're created if you take us to in parallel their spirit and death is parallel with God spirit and life but the parallels between their spirit and God's spirit as the same thing when animal has it they're alive when they don't die there's an interesting way to think about human breath I mean that's you're saying it's God's painting life correct that is our spirit Spirit then doesn't make us different than the animals because the animals are also given God's end rating for a star called the breath of life I think is also given to animals and one of these creation passages
 being called the image of God doesn't have to do with having a spirit correct has to do something else is animated by God's spirit in the biblical story that's really fascinating and it's I think it's why these ideas developed later there's a human ruwa humans ever go off my car animating breath but they're developed the usage that I can also come to talk about not just the life principle but also the driving forces of our minds and our desires so Isaiah will say who can know the rules of the Lord and what he means is who can understand the purposes of plans cuz purposes are also invisible yeah but they make things happen in the world I see you when you have an idea and I'm not trying to get into like the mind-body problem
 there is no point of view you know I have an idea to like go make an omelette and you know and all the sudden this idea that exists invisibly results in like an actual physical reality the creation of an omelette and so God has invisible purposes that could have physical results and so humans have a box of rock can come to me in the mind as well in certain contexts and that seems like in the New Testament it often means that especially in the writings of Paul Hill use the word ruach to refer to life principle but also your mental principal to the language is flexible got it but I kind of want to sit for second still with this idea that I think my assumption would be all the reason why humans are special is because we have this we have this thing and maybe an English I would use the word Soul more and that's
 another one other thing that word is used right here in Genesis 2:7 translation translated being but it's the phrase nefesh living a life and then this is the word nefesh we've made a witch that a video which is often translated as soul in your later yeah let's go so this is I'm looking at The New American Standard Version translation of Genesis 2 verse 7 the human became a living being but even that is exactly what the animals are called in the same chapter what translation I think it must be in the King James Genesis 2 verse 7
 yeah so Genesis 2 verse 7 comparing multiple translations here and Ivy is living being a living being and he has to be living being interested in an RSV living being is it is quick word study on nefesh is it refers to the whole whole in body living creature your living thing you living being so including your invisible animating energy almost always primarily your embodiment that's a physical creature almost the opposite of what we think of as a soul at least I think those are English it can I have this so what you're talkin about Chrissa is that earlier in Genesis 1 the creatures are called
 living beings twin Genesis 1 verse 21 the creatures the birds and the fish are all called nefesh Kaya living living creatures actually the animals are first called this our first called living Souls is it in the names is that called a soul but I bet you it's not go there. Translated moving creature that part of it this what follows to that hath life creature and raised in Hebrew here they translated creatures with life and then when it's applied to humans they translate it living Soul pixel chance to show in English because again what I'm trying to land on here is what makes humans special in the biblical narrative
 that they have real and it's not there and it's not that they haven't all the animals have Spirits often translated but in the biblical narrative God takes humans and says you are my image and in my mind that was always connected to some like special disembodied part of me whether you want to call at school or Spirit or something but it's not it's something else that's right so yeah when we're getting 26 up in Genesis the description of the creation of humans comes in three parts and what sets them apart from the animals is not that they have a life or Brethren are living creatures it's that they are given God's authority to rule and it stated twice in a nice little chiasm where the humans are told to rule God said let them Rule and then he calls them His Image in a little pain Genesis 1 verse 2
 7 and then you repeat that let them rule so it's representation and Rule what makes the humans differ in the narrative and why us and not the deer are and it's not because of nethys not because of rock it's because of something else in the Bible doesn't say like what what is about humans Anatomy are busy out whatever you know and for a long time we just wanted to limit it to say was just go for what the biblical authors were saying but you know we can't stop there we have two others are opening the door for us to ponder and meditate on man will it's not just that we represent God how do we represent capacities and faculties are we different from the Animal World in the plant world that we are Gods represented and so that opens the door to kind of more classic answers to this a rationality or intelligence or
 and people debate all these Banks relationship the bill making relay with a stewardship and responsibility to rule the rule in a way the mirrors and represents got through that's the kind of bass line so as to the second appearance just to recap what we do and we see these links if you're reading through and you you read in Genesis one through I have God is hovering over the waters and then Genesis to the Breath of God gives life to humans when you see a link like that the authors asking you to pair those things together and look at them and compare them and see how maybe the stories moving forward and actually you're a question about the spirit and the Soul was bringing up for me that when you do pair those two things together there supposed to be seen as consistent in the sense that that same spirit that was animating all creation that was giving life to the trees
 and the land in the water was the Same Spirit that that gives life to humanity and animals so it's almost the opposite of what we typically think of when we think of the spirit or Soul differentiating humans from all creation it's like not the point being made is actually that humans are so United with the created order and God's breath was breathing all that exists and humans to he sustains it all it's like that the analogy is drying those things even closer and further apart of the very thing that connects us to everything else that would make it would make sense that's the second appearance
 the steamer all pretty similar the next time that the word ruach appears is after the humans disobey the Divine command to take from the Tree of nine go to Bath
 so we're still in the Eden literary units yeah so what happens is that God puts the human in the garden gives the human to come and I want to give you eternal life you're not eat from the Tree of eternal life it's all yours but there's one tree it's reasonably good bad it'll kill you if you eat from it just don't take from that tree will just step around the rabbit hole so then God split the human into so that the one becomes too so that those two who are different can become one through Covenant and then what happens is that an animal over which the humans are supposed to rule but there's this animal that doesn't like the humans ruling wants to usurp visible snake and this is the snake and the backstory to where we're at the humans tricks them into thinking that choosing death is actually the way it's a life and tricks that humans into thinking that they're not the images
 Liam says you can become a love him if you just take this knowledge for yourself that's better than being an image but nothing that you're everything and the humans break God's command and take from the tree that weren't supposed to and the first thing that happens Genesis 3 or 7 is that their eyes are opened and they realize that they are naked they're all the room which is the word play cuz you're told that the serpent was Autumn crappy true. True. True. Quick thinking and so because of the Autumn of the snake that humans aren't up for him that's the tree so the first thing they do is hide from each other by their bodies from each other second thing is they hear the sound of Yahweh Elohim it was walking about in the garden at the rueck I am at the wind of the day there it is
 relax wind wind and Hebrew can mean Spirit breath or when it's wet the sun's translated as cool right in the cooler day comparing the NIV translate sit as the cool of the day that's not translating or interpreting that option is wind refers to the temperature at maybe this was a way to talk about a certain time of day or something yes Vehicles there same direction nasb at the time of the evening Breeze
 so they're saying not just all so they got the breeze in there though the wind but they infer refer to a time of the day and send for me is when we come across this are we supposed to see a real it can also just be use this other way to talk about a certain kind of weather or is it that we're supposed to see a link between this and Genesis 2 rated from God's life Bradley life even if it's just talking with the weather it's not the longer I thought about this I think it's one of these images of one of these examples of a super-dense image that's capable of kind of multiple nuances so they're in a garden with trees so how would they hear the sound of Yahweh walking in a garden
 in a wind blowing in the trees that's actually pretty good way to imagine it also what time of wind especially not part of the world does the wind Austin Bluff it is often in the afternoons to do with the fact that it's so dang hot scene with the Columbia River that's when the winds come up a sandwich this afternoon wins the question is is there more here and here I'm going to just look at the the fact that there's a structure to this verse here to hear the sound of the whale him it was walking in the garden at the windy time of day and they hit so there's this connection of images there's a sound that's walking and that's sound is coordinated with when it was walking because it's referring to the sound the sound was walking
 ambiguous so happy he could be the hear the sound of Yahweh Elohim minutes that was walking or sound could be the subject of the walking and it's the sound walking I think that's also an exceptional too so the point is that when the sound shows up in this kind of like physical some sort manifestation there's wind so what this is laying tracks for is a really important design pattern that's going to appear so here's just a quick nerdy thing there's going to appear a whole repetition of the voice for the sound of the Lord showing up especially at Key moments when people have failed a test and three example at Mount Sinai when on the third day the Israelites fail to go up the mountain when they're invited to on the third day what shows up our sounds and lightning and thick clouds and a trumpet sound and the people are freaked out
 just like in the garden the sound of you always shows up and the people are afraid this time it's not the sound of wind in the trees in the same way will you learn about the sound of Yahweh when you shows up you know personally is that the same personal presence of Yahweh that takes up residence in the tent and Israel's Tabernacle so that when Moses goes into the Tabernacle he hears the sound speaking to him from above the Ark of the Covenant and then as you trace just do a word study on the sound of the voice of Yahweh It's associated with storms and wind so we could do a lot more here but the point is is what where is it kind of the seed of that the seed of that idea of the personal appearance of y'all would that is as frightening This Is A Storm of Swords. I'm in the storm so I think we'll
 today doesn't give you the sense of a gardener store for the evening Breeze whatever this appearance of the sound of Yahweh coming and blowing through the garden it's clearly makes them afraid because they hide and then when God says why are you hiding he said I was freaked out by imagine it though like humans in the garden and they start to hear this like three Wrestling coming from far away and it's this invisible life force that they can hear in the leaves that it was pretty scary I freaked out and the wind is all connected sequence there and and nakedness to is in there that's right but the reason that he is afraid because I was naked was because because the only reason I know I'm naked cuz I did the thing you told me not to do here so this is you always showing up like you know like a like a storm like yeah
 parent yeah you know showing up I have had this experience so many times with my kids since you're staying and you not even if I come in and I'm not angry they'll be a like a somber time do you know when I come in and the kids are fighting over something and then you know me and Jessica comes in here it's like Yahweh or Elohim storming in where it can that same life giving presents they can whip up order out of disorder can also be a storm is very intimidating you think it might destroy creation but it can also be created and and I can't and it can sometimes it does life and yes
 the storm would be a better translation here in a way walking in the garden at a storm during the day or that gets more of the idea that were talking about yeah it's interesting it's also the case that the day in the biblical prophets of the Lord is always depicted as coming of a great storm the day of Yahweh day of actually here look at a great example so here's a Bellator biblical author is totally got Genesis 3:8 on the brain left my one I'm going to completely remove all things from the face of the land says he has a lot of things slow and noticed he's going to move right through the list of animals from Genesis 10 remove human Beast birds of the sky fish of the Sea The Ruins along with the wicked I'll cut off humans from the face of the land of decrease
 yeah your undo creation then very specifically he's going to own in Judah and Jerusalem because they're worshipping Baal Baal they're bowing down to the host of heavens and yet they swear the Yahweh as if I'm there God but then they'll swear buy milk from the name of another God and this whole thing is called the day of y'all at the day so that whole motifs it will become the day of Yahweh in the storm and decreation is kind of embedded here embedded right in this number three
 so that's the first three appearances of the theme of the spirit and not just one 11 and we got chapter 31 in this kind of pre-creation state of Chaos in order to bring life in order and then we see God's ruach not called Rock book called what's a breath breath animating humans the human mud statues to become living things living Souls live nefesh similar to its role in Genesis on the third one after the humans who are meant to be God's Representatives decide they'd rather be God and side Good and Evil on their own terms after that decision the ruach a in the garden along with
 sound of God and really supposed to be thinking kind of a storm so that same life-giving energy that brings order all the sudden when you're on the wrong side of it it's actually is intimidating will be your undoing it can be your undoing invisible Life Energy or invisible energy that animates life gives life animating energy and D creates more you take away life Genesis to passage the breath of life he breathes into their nostrils the breath of life and then the Genesis three passage you were just talking about when there's the stormy wind I'm thinking about an Angry God and the way that God's anger is described as long of nostril that it's like this breath coming out of the nostrils that signifies anger you know I wonder if there's a connection there between like the Breath of God it can be like giving it can also be this
 what does anger piano studying The Crossing through the sea narrative in Exodus and in the poem in Exodus 15:2 describes the story it says you blew your roof through your nostrils and it's a child the water at in their hot anger you blew out of your nostrils on the waters but for everyone who's not following along in Hebrew angry yeah is a Hebrew ATM to be long of nostril it has to be patient anger is long enough straw to be angry is to that story God's truth comes out of his nose brings death and destruction to Farah the oppressor in the Tyrant but it brings it separates the wall
 where's the great dry land for the liberated slaves described both as in terms of anger the breath is being like that's really interesting the creation and decoration at the same time and creating a new opportunity for Life the ruach from God's nostrils so it's a cool example of how these later narratives will develop the images and invite you in a really profound insight into the character of God that you need to sit with but it does so by picking up the thread of earlier links from his words so we just looked at 3 biblical passages and see how they took a long time and weird now thinking about the na spot nostrils a guy yes we are all right so we'll the next episode then we'll look at there's five more hits
