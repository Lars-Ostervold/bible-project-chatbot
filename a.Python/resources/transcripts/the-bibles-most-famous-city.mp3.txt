in the storyline of the Bible cities are mostly bad news came city is full of violence Babylon is full of arrogance Sodom and Gomorrah full of Injustice and wickedness everywhere you turn cities are problem except the one bright spots the ancient Kingdom of Egypt under the leadership of Joseph which becomes a place of Salvation in a time of famine two cities can be a place of justice and peace and that's what we'll look at it today the second time city is viewed positively in the Bible this is the most iconic Central City in the Bible the city on a hill the city of Zion Jerusalem becomes the closest image to like a Eden heaven on Earth spot through the narrative imagery and through later poetic depictions on the meaning of Jerusalem in the Psalms scroll today we look at the founding of Jerusalem in particular we look at how David brings the Ark of the Covenant with
 Tabernacle up to Jerusalem and it is a strange story The Ark is put on a cart and along the way the cart stumbles into a man named Boozer reaches out to keep the ark from falling because he touches it dies we tend to psychologize the story and we're just like Isaac I was just trying to be helpful the narrator just trying to depict this whole scene as a replay of Humanity's foolish violation of God's command at the tree of knowing good and bad Drew slum is the image the Bible has four what a city of God can be but from the earliest moments of the founding of Jerusalem is clear that even this city has its problems so what will it take for a city to truly become like the Garden of Eden you always presence isn't just your trophy that you can bring in your city and boom you're protected now forever and always you have to relate to Yahweh by his terms and wisdom now in Jerusalem if you want this to become the evening you hope it will B
 today to Mackey and I talked about the Golden Era of the city of Jerusalem I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 hey John good morning good morning this morning for us right now yeah usually morning when we do this so we're in the middle of our discussions on the steam study of the city yes we are and we're going to jump into a discussion on Jerusalem the kind of main city in the Bible in a way or the the Pinnacle City in Israel's nation state history and so I'm excited about that meet you along the way we recap where we've been we've had a pause in our conversation since we last meeting real time we've had a couple weeks since yeah it's been like the last conversations we've had a couple weeks ago and Christmas and New Year's in here we are here we are so I could definitely use a recap so why don't you give me a recap from your perspective that this is the seventh episode
 and we are getting to Jerusalem and the arrival of the Ark and the Tabernacle and Jerusalem being coming the new Eden in the 7th episode which you know always find a meaning for meeting for the Bible tells me to do that right now so we begin with will be called the surprise of the city in the storyline of the Bible namely that the ideal location or setting for humans to be images and representatives of God
 living in Union with God having an earther one that environment is described in Pages 1 and 2 of The Bible at the Garden and I pushed back on this a little bit just saying well yeah because there's not enough humans for so you know it's been a while since our ancient near Eastern cosmology Series so I would need to go back cuz there are founding mythologies in Canaanite and Babylonian literature that begin with the gods you know legitimating a kingdom at least maybe that's not relevant for this conversation so but it seems like what you're saying is you're creating a tension between this idea of the environment that humans will flourish in and there's one which is what you call I suppose a cultivated nature where it's like you've got trees what part of what makes it the ideal that it is I said his son Colton
 it's something that you mince didn't make it snow. God cultivated it and it's something humans just wake up and bring God cultivates nature just make sure I think so yeah seems like it's more than that you know that's right because it's actually a natural setting that is conducive design reservation for life that's why there's peace between humans and the animals and plants are all living in harmony providing for one another that kind and then God asks the humans to work and keep it so that I can continue to need filtration exactly right so so so so the surprise is why would you ever need a city if that's all you need yeah so the surprise of the city is that when cities get introduced its after humans are foolishly rebelled against the Divine command cuz they were deceived rebelled against God's wisdom than outside the garden they began
 spiral of murder and hostility and it's in that environment that the city comes into the story line so we're not to the surprises right at that. That's the direction of the city the city in the Bible refers to a walled enclosure around a number of dwellings a few or many are very very very many and it's precisely to protect from hostile creatures namely other humans want to kill you or animals I want to eat you so you had a garden where this was already taken care of there was peace you didn't need to create walls you just had peace between humanity and itself humanity and animals and now outside of the garden we need another way to create peace and that way is to create a city with a wall so many typical plot arcs few. Using the classical like you know like the graph of a plot you know it goes from peaceful Beginnings are
 Conflict by fighting incident the inciting incident and usually we have Cold podcast series on this from our how to read the Bible series smilers to go usually that conflict escalates until it's so problematic and so intense there's some climactic conflicts that resulted and you return to some new state of the ideal right from where the conflict is resolved so what's interesting is the end of the biblical story doesn't simply go back to a garden ideal rather the story of the Bible resolves in a Garden City is very clearly the garden and the human City that have been merged together but it's the city recreated and redeemed of all of its negative elements and what makes a surprise is because the city is depicted is almost entirely negative for the moment just introduced and every city that's the focus and any biblical story
 is -13 the story of the Bible is a civilization kind of sucks yes I mean and it's at the same time amazing and we've been expressed intention of the city that is the tension can you imagine the living during the Bronze Age and like you just any single day like some Acadian King could just roll in I just wipe you out and I say hey like I'm in charge now take your kids whatever like that's the miserable that stuff happened and it still happens today on different local and Regional levels around our world today it's the US human nature man look at the history of all of that it's just one person at a time don't you know what I'm going to be in charge and I'm going to expand my territory and just battle battle battle battle and coming out of cities 45 from cities and it's just like
 yeah it's not hard to understand why the biblical authors take the posture they do towards human cities as being what do you say breeding ground of deception violence oppression for the first cities that are seducing the Bible are associated with violence yeah I'm rod in his City with Babylon and Pharaoh in the cities of Egypt that Israelite slaves all these oppressive like what we would call Global Empires at the time who are the guys are like the just a gnarly I'm going to go be had some people feed some cities start people just so I could be more powerful if I don't have enough self-aggrandizement whatever megalomania there is a part however for the people that live in that City if your cities on the winning team if I stayed your history your building library is your building
 just to make edibles and palaces and this is a part of why I think I don't think we talked about in the series but one of the most famous palaces from the ancient Assyrian Empire are there actual carvings of it at the center by the Royal Palace king Oscar Bonaparte created a garden that was meant to look like the cosmic Mountain garden with rivers of Heaven flying out of it and so what he was claiming was that his city was the connection point of having a nurse and so if you lived in Nineveh your living high tide during a during a specific like couple hundred year. That's right and unless you're among the end of the slave class or I'm not up to speed on the role of women or children in their status in Winchendon but likely certainly at what is high status has a nose for emails so but the point is the city didn't just benefit you know the emperor at 1 King
 I said some group but at the expense of many others and that's why the biblical authors authors are trying to highlight that over and over and over again yeah but remember the story of Joseph that we touched upon back in our last conversation that there's a portrait of the cities of Egypt when the Pharaoh recognizes chosen image whose wisdom can rescue the Nations and is elevated to a place a rule then the city becomes a storehouse of life for the nation this is in the famine when Justice wisdom stockpiles all the screen so cities can be a source of life for everybody right but then in the just a few Generations later that same city can become a source of death is in the the Pharaoh in the time of Moses than the enslaved bright lights so when the Pharaoh acknowledged God's wisdom and got spirit in Joseph
 put him in a position of power the city became a place that could sustain life if we're looking for a core thread here it is and I'm going to bring us back to the second episode of our conversation cuz there's an important point that I've emphasized there that I I realized I haven't followed through on the last couple of conversations remember there was a important analogy in the the design of the narrative in the garden in between the story of Adam and Eve in the garden and then Kane and his wife and the building of the city in the garden God provided Woman as a laser does the Hebrew word for delivering a lie and God built its the word built yeah I noticed that word cuz it's weird is an architectural term weird in Hebrew is weird in Hebrew. They got built the woman cuz it's the word you used to describe the construction of buildings here and then there's a whole series of play on words right yes the whole series of play on words the word
 weather looks almost graphically identical to the Hebrew word e r which is the word City so when Cain is exiled and God says hey I'm going to protect your life and place a sign on you and can ends up not wanting to take out at his word what we're told is outside of Eden he finds a wife he knows her that is a sex with her they have a child together and then he builds the city what God provided for Adam now Canyon provides for himself God built the laser now kayn builds the ear and which means a contrast were supposed to pay attention and wanted to provide was a partner for the human so that the humans can be too but also one
 and specifically the delivering a lie that God provided would be the womb that continues the preservation of the hosting in the preservation of Life the mother and that's what Adam call zeev M Cohan she is the mother of all living does Genesis 3021 is like hey this is woman she came from man and woman when they're outside the garden there's one little note in Genesis 3:21 put up here and the man called the name of his wife,
 because she was a cool guy and have a same word which is life so God build delivering a lie who is the mother of all life Kane builds his own delivering help in the form of the city and I think this is this analogy between even the city is what's underneath of really prominent theme is that City's when they're depicted metaphorically in biblical poetry are always depicted as mother's the city as a mother the city as a mother the city is Eve
 but just like Adam and Eve in the image of God can become a source of life in the world or source of falling in death and so in the same way cities and cities are set on an allergy to eat if cities can become a source of life in the world of womb out of which life is preserved in America's or they can become a source of the following death is an analogy between cities and humans they can be good they can go bad and me I think this is our core thing about cities desert point is that the city is a human creation and as an extension of human it's our shell it's a chef yeah it can be used for good or for bad and the biblical authors wanted primarily highlight how it's for bad but they'll occasionally highlight how it becomes a womb or a source of Life the Joseph story does that
 supposed to see the video of animals eat today Jerusalem becomes the primary mother of all living at least for a time how far can we push this analogy between the woman and the city well I think it's set up in the design of the early Genesis stories so they're trying to stoke our imaginations but the city is like the city to humanity is like the woman to man yes that's right so Eve was given to Adam as a delivering Ally the Acer Adam by himself would die and not be able to multiply and subdue the Earth and Rule he just would just be gone and so he needs this essential other and God
 creates woman builds bills builds the delivering a life out of him so we talked about how cities do come out of us no mention of him out of the human imagination I mean I even made the silly kind of analogy of like a snail grow that she'll like we're kind of growing this exoskeleton of sorts and ancient definition of sea which is about a protective encasing okay that's interesting so the woman comes to man and now they can become United and then multiply and create life that's right by the man offering his seed that gets planted in the womb that creates fruit there's also an analogy but I can come in as in the ground and the room is also like the fertile ground but in this case the womb is also like this environment where New Life is both Preserve
 and then out of which new life is generated
do you know we meditated a lot on the idea that When God says don't eat of the tree of the knowing good and bad the subtext there is I will give you the knowledge of good and bad and yes we talked about that a lot and you don't get that subtext by just reading a story but by reading the whole that's right he revived and later store is that reflect back and meditate on the Garden of Eden story and so now you're introducing another layer of Skeptics of When God says the cane I'm going to protect you and the King goes and builds his own city is part of that subjects going God would have created the environment Payne needed for life and it's interesting that Zane builds the city
 in the next sentence after he marries a wife and has a child yet but instead of accepting whatever it is that God's going to provide for him for the preservation of his life what he does he builds his own is on the Acer is on delivering a lie in the form of the city it was a big deal for me to realize wow God wanted to give Adam and even though it's because of that his terms through his wisdom and so I'm wondering if this is landing same way God wanted to build a city thing is the idea of God give Kane a sign so that his life would be preserved because whoever Finds Me will kill me because I'm a murderer all of that language is the same language used to describe a network of cities that God instructs the Israelites to make when they go into the promised land this happens in numbers and then it they're built in Joshua
 Nicole the Cities of Refuge to which a human a person can flee if they have accidentally killed somebody and the language and if the Avenger of blood or the you know is like Family Feud language the Avenger of blood may find them and kill them in the field with the end of numbers and so what God provides for Israel is cities of protection for the murderer in case someone finds them that's a good example of the Cities of Refuge in Israel all right with God wanted to give Kane a reflection back on the thing that came for. So was God going to build the city what does that even mean to say the city is not built by humans but by God for where we're going right now
 the microphone on it's been awhile that we've been in this series of conversations in real-time it's been a couple weeks since we talked and so we were talking about how what's the core idea here so that's why I'm focusing us here I want to remind us of this chord image the city was introduced in this analogy to what God built for the preservation of life versus Kane builds for the preservation of his life
 and also that because of that cities are in the Knology to humans and humans so I can be a source of life or source of death in cities I think the dynamic is right that he has to pick it along the same lie because a city technically is a place where humans live that has a wall Technically when we fast-forward to the new Heaven and new earth and the New Jerusalem there's a wall but it doesn't act as a wall at Zach's is like a museum piece of sorts yeah cuz if the gates are always open the gate was open and it just as jeweled spectacle in just a minute and it's drawing all the nations into it so yeah it's more attracting and repelling so a city while technically isn't a walled enclosure that man's idea of a city have the claw ride okay I think we're on to something here yeah God's idea of the city is that it's a protected environment
 for the generation and preservation of life right like the garden like the ark like the house on the night of passover and so on so I think this is where man and God would agree yes we want to preserve life in the city but it's almost like the tactic you know how are we going to make this a place of Refuge let's build a wall spilled of wasp build a lot of wealth and then let's actually all of our neighboring cities will just make sure they're allied with us if that's what was forcing them to be allied with us keep growing that and then this will be the true place of security and refuge Batman strategy and like I said earlier that's a miserable existence from most people in contrast to God strategy which is to create a cultivated environment where life can multiply but where there's so much abundance that people aren't freaked out
 scarcity and resources which is mostly why humans kill each other or exclude each other cuz I'm afraid that if you are around being a different version of human that you are than me that's what what Pharaoh said about the Hebrews multiplying like they're very healthy and hardworking and it's an enemy attacks us they'll join our enemies and turn off yes so God strategy is to provide abundance so that humans can trust that there's enough so that as we multiply
 this environment will provide by Gus generosity what we all need to share the unified Scott's vision of a city is one where there's an abundance and there's a sharing and the gates can be opened yeah people could come in and out of cities because like we're actually benefiting each other right which is why it's depicted as a garden why is it fixes her cuz I don't need the wall it's just it's around for the preservation of generation of life no wall needed but in that Garden you might build some really cool Library totally build some cool channels in ports and water parks and that's just my childhood imagination I got to visit like Mega water parks maybe four or five times in my whole childhood and those are standout moments I grew up right next to Wild Waves
 didn't Seattle yeah yeah all the time oh yeah there was a series of Summers where we had like the summer pass in the wave pool everyday remind Diner on imagination that is hat on Earth that would have been having on Earth anyway environment for the generation and the preservation of life does the womb also has a protective encasement sure so cities do need to protect you that's interesting because well I mean the kisses back to the nature of what Paradise in a like a Garden of Eden it was good but there are you know Eden isn't out post is it what you earn all creation yeah like could have was outside of Eden was there something dangerous the Wilderness because we're Genesis one begins is
 Darkness Tokugawa who wild and waste in darkness and in that environment God calls forth the dry land and a garden out of that trial and Genesis to images of not enough water
 let the disordered wild and waste a tooth out of a desert a waterless Desert Inn in that water the desert Gods steaks out I have another spot that's the garden like fighting water so the garden is this little Refuge of divinely provided life in the midst of the wild and waste and end so it's protecting the humans from the chaotic Wilderness and what would you imagine is in the garden like so what's the real danger the danger is no water and no food and there's wild animals out there which is so you think that's part of the the kind of I mean that isn't explicit in the story of this is too of like he all the animals here it's safe cuz they're here I see I see and actually in my Sunday school cannot bring it's like
 all the animals of the world are there are there and it's good versus this idea of like what are some creatures out there that are still yeah, well when I say there's creatures out there I guess I'm in I'm looking towards later repetitions of this Divine pattern so the danger of wild animals in the land is a big Motif for example in depictions of the promised land this is why it's going into it in Exodus numbers and Deuteronomy the threat that one of the Covenant curses if Israel disobeys the loss of the Covenant is the God will allow wild animals to coming into your towns and eat you and your children are so the beasts of the field
 so that's a threat so I guess I'm inferring backwards
 from those into the garden are there then maybe I shouldn't do that because in the Eden narrative your animals are introduced as potential companions for the human so that the human can discern that what he needs is not an animal but another partner like yeah that's the rule that kind of leaves a big mystery of the Wilderness why is that dangerous what would happen if the least dangerous because out there there's no water and there's no food which is Young Thug tell you to give enclosure but do you need a wall for it to be protective and what way is the protective well it's keeping the Wilderness out and what way is keeping Alanis out by creating a garden within the protectiveness the protective layer of the city is in a wall it's the abundance within the city that it is cultivated
 and then yep that's right but given that humans have taken it into their own power to discern good and bad by their own wisdom instead of receiving a trusting God for that wisdom as humans go out from the Eden cities become little
 human eating Alternatives or humanly Maiden which I think why all these stories that we've been describing the are packed with Eaton imagery when these cities get introduced this truth cane City to Babylon true of Sodom and Gomorrah and it's true of the cities of Egypt so I'm very skeptical as to whether or not humans could ever create that kind of city right in fact so skeptical if someone came and said I'm going to create the city of God I'd be like let's run for the hell yes me too because I know how this is going to end this is played out many times a human history yes it has and I come from a tradition that's like Hey we're going to just go to heaven one day like that's the real thing like let's not build like the city let's wait to go to heaven and I think well in the macro Arc of the business
 we're outside of Eden we're dying so any thing that we build out here will have is its main underlying subconscious am is the preservation of our current mode of life
 which is going to at some point lead me to the limit of my generosity out quite a bit we can be generous and really self-sacrificial but at some point you're like I got to look out for me and mine I'm tired cuz that's the nature of life outside of Eden with her Immortal existence and scarcity of resources so I think that's what the biblical authors I think I assume is that any thing we're ever going to build as a group of people outside of Eden can only become a symbol a picture of the new creation that only God can build it into that then because
 it seems to me that in the Hebrew Bible Jerusalem actual city was depicted as he guys were doing it the city of God has come to Earth it's happening Jerusalem becomes the closest image to like a Eaton heaven on Earth spot through the narrative imagery and through later poetic depictions on the meaning of Jerusalem in the the Psalms scroll so with that long they have been summary but I think we needed that to the kind of distill the key points that were after I and I think that'll help us make sense of the meaning of Jerusalem as the city the city of god so let's take the rest of our conversation we're going to survey the story of Jerusalem being founded by David as the capital city of the tribes of Israel and then we'll read a Psalm maybe two probably just one about
 Jerusalem Avenue Eden
it's up in the story of David we haven't spent a lot of time the story of David so David is the second king of Israel is real story preserved in Joshua Judges Samuel and Kings so Israel is just shifted from being a Federation of tribal rulers yep to an actual like what you would call and what would ya do in Joshua and judges God raises up Holy Spirit empowered leaders male and female for the needs of the moment for a generation usually in moments of Crisis but eventually that ruler that was that leader dies and then some new crisis emerges and so I'm in these leaders come from all of the different types of these are the judges in English and Hebrew but during the life of one of those judges whose name is Samuel the people come
 2 Samuel and say what we want we want to level up level up to become like all the other nations who have a monarchy hereditary monarchy where the rulership is Consolidated in one family from One Tribe cuz you really well seen some of those is the L going to come from this generation is just like one family that we just keep it civil standing army centralized the economy it's just let's just that way so the first came on the scene gun and shot will solve his name means the one who has asked for and he doesn't work out well King number 2
 so when David is elevated as king there's a section of chapter that the literary unit and what we call second Samuel chapters 5 through 8 depict the golden years of David this is where he is appointed as King by all of the tribes come and appointing mr. King in 2nd Samuel chapter 5 and the first two things that he does is a point to Capital City and then which is going to mean securing it from the sneaky inhabitants of the land I'm using even if he's got here but the all the hyperlinks in the story are depicting David as a new Adam going into a a new Garden going back into a garden
 and removing the Hostile inhabitants so he can establish it as a new Eden so the first thing he does is engaged the Hostile inhabitants of an area and establish the city as the capital of Jerusalem and then he brings the Ark in the Tabernacle of yahweh's dwelling planted in the middle of the city so just right there those two moves are undoing the Exile of Adam and Eve from Eden in a local way I saw the imagery work cuz the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle were saying hey we're outside of Eden but hey we have God's presence with us yet we're still outside of you. We're just cruising around bring it into the city is saying we've made it back that's right so the story of David defeating the inhabitants of Jerusalem and establishing the city as the capital of this happens in 2nd Samuel chapter 5 so the King David and his men
 to yerushalayim that's how you say in Hebrew yerushalayim to the jebusites the inhabitants of the land so yeah boosts is actually the Canaanite name a true Slim So Jerusalem is the Hebrew word people debate on the original meaning most likely it's formed of something like inheritance of peace or possession of Peace feel I'm being piece by piece but that's his real name is Canaanite name was and the people who inhabited that city were called the other sites for the jebusites so complicated and how he takes the city but the jebusites are mocking David saying like you couldn't even you can't get in here even the Blind and lame people of our city
 like people who can't see or have disabled limbs even they could fight you off like we're so we're so for 25 yeah so what happens is that David most likely what happens the Hebrews lot more complicated than the English translations into what most likely happens is that David and his soldiers crawl up a water shaft to get in by the walls and then attack City from within but in verse 9 David took up residence in the Fortress and he called it either David City of David
 David means beloved one city of the Beloved kind of like Philadelphia but he built up the area around it from The Terraces in word. It's a near a city and he's building there's a key words but they're from the Cain and Abel story and it's called by his name so that's we know it's not called that it's called Jerusalem but he called it city of David Foster this is suspicious the saw is the Hebrew Bible now it's always a Twist never completely good he built up all the area around it and he became more and more powerful because Yahweh God Almighty was with him so yeah you read that you like okay well it's good that he's after him and his bill
 I must be good. So there is That's So now Jerusalem's Capital chapter 6 David together all the able young men of Israel 30,000 and he and all his men went to in Judah to bring up from there The Arc of. But just pretend about the golden box so the ark which is called by the name the name of Yahweh of armies
 the Yahweh of heavenly host he's the one in throned between the cherubim on the ark Des Ark is a throne the Arkansas Throne golden box on which there's these two golden care of him and this is a great example of a hyperlink to the Eden story so what we want to do is eat in portable now with the Tabernacle Tabernacle a portable eating and remember those two Caribbean who guarded the way back in the back into eating here for now guarding the throne and so they are guarding the throne and they are the footstool as aware of the divine presence which is invisible hovering above so we're just told you I hear the portable eating that's guarded by the chair beam David's going to take it upon himself to move it move it into the city
 so they set the Ark of God on a new cart
 and they brought it from the house of the demidov which was on the hill now that's a hyperlink right there to all series of passages in the Torah that say never use a cart to transport the art exactly. Don't ever put it on a cart well
 so there was a guy named Boozer and Ocotillo who were the sons of a minute. The van is out of is the most likely Priestly house that's been hosting the arc on the property for a while and they were guiding the new cart so now you have like the people who are the Priestly Guardians are using like transporting the card but in exactly the way I got said not to do it back in the Torah wow so it's a lot of tension here I didn't realize which pays off when like the guy touches the cart and you're just about to happen so David Noel Israel were celebrating with all their power before y'all with our dancing the power power power choir I mean they had castanets and hearts and liars and timbrels and systems and so simple I don't know it cast of That So I think I might be a little ride or what I'm going to do them is I don't know what that is so I guess what a timbrel is
 I like a tambourine when they came to the threshing floor of Nakhon reached out and he took
 who's this one of the kids who says one of the two Sleepy Kids Priestly Sons who's guiding so I sent out his hand and he took okay that's what he does we are exactly the same price and took another hyperlink he reached out and he took I'll protect this the Ark of God because the oxen stumbled and that makes you think like he was just trying to be helpful just trying to be helpful but so what did the woman do she reached out her hand and she took because it looked good and rest of the tree of my represents my ability to discern between what's good and bad so the ark is about to slip off this cart
 but the reason it's in that position is because we took it upon ourselves to do things a certain way but just the way God told us not to do it you're supposed to be carrying this thing on the sticks and the ox want to stumble if you would have done it the way God said it it wouldn't be about to fall off this car to mechanic and remember he never heard the story explains about to take hold of the Ark of God and never what's the act of God or do we just tell the Ark of God is guarded by to Champion trying we tend to psychologize the story and we're just trying to be helpful the narrator is trying to depict this whole scene as a replay of Humanity's foolish violation of God's command at the tree of knowing good and bad witches so hidden because you read the story and it's like David's stabbed washing Jerusalem but this is good in the subtext of all this is like this is a
 this is a problem look at all these problems they're taking God's Throne on their own terms and establishing it it okay to God not to do with also important is this is not the first time this has happened in the Samuel story that Israelites treated the ark like a little military trophy on another battle with the Philistines all the way back and God allowed to are to be stolen because they Dishonored dark in that way so this is already a theme in the Samuel Scroll of people using the ark has like a trophy piece
 so you're right but the point is is you only get the narrator's actual message if you follow the hyperlinks otherwise I think you'll miss the point here so is depicted as somebody who's trying to storm back in pass the chair beam and enter eating on his own terms however innocent he might be the narrator was painting the picture of human Folly so the Lord's anger Burns against us because of his act and God struck him down and he died right there right at the foot of the two cherubim so in the language of Eden story he got struck down by the fiery sword and David was angry because of yahweh's anger the broken we're going to my party here in fact to this very day that spot is called outbreak against Susa
 so David was afraid of Yahweh that day and he said what how can the Arc of Yahweh ever come to my new capital city so he wouldn't take the Ark of the Lord and then he said he took it to the house of Obed Edom the get tight and the Ark remained there for 3 months a period of three is often a testing Motif but here's the thing as Yahweh bless the house of pyke just became that became a little Garden of Eden so David was told you I was blessing ring about eating that already comes house maybe we should try it again so David went to bring up the Ark of God from the house of Obed Edom to the city of David with rejoicing
 okay Party part 2 Party part to get the timbrels out now I'm going to switch to the literary design of the paragraph is he so there's 12 they brought up the Arc of gods in the house of Obed Edom into the city with gladness and so it was when the bearers the carriers of the Arc of Yahweh went six Paces he would sacrifice an ox and a fatling careful if you go six steps and if you're if you're sacrificing an oxen every 6 that you're offering the animal in front of you which is on your 7th step right if you're we take 6. One two three four five six then you Slaughter an animal in front of you in the place where you would take your 7. I think it's the inference or not so it's another imagery of a cow
 pushing the completion of Heaven on Earth David was dancing before y'all way with all his power before he was just celebrating with instruments now he's full on dancing and David was wearing a linen ephod
 which is the Priestly garment right now he stressed the way that the priests are dressed when they operate in the temple you make a sacrifice against and we have we have talked about this story we made whole video about it and I really appreciate serious so the king is depicted as the priests and this is a part of the atom imagery cuz Adam and Eve as the human are the Royal Priestly image of God in the garden so now we're going to rule so David and all House of Israel were bringing up our kitty Highway was shouting and trumpet they brought in the Arc of Yahweh they said it and its place in the tent the David pitched for it
 David offered burnt offerings peace offerings he's finished offering the burnt offerings in the peace offerings he blessed the people he gave all the people cakes of bread and dates and David return to bless his house so now every six steps the seventh step is a sacrifice you always presents with the cherubim comes in it's been a lot of sacrifice sacrifice and offerings resulting in blessing and a bunch of food for all the people
so here's what's interesting you could try and put yourself in the mindset of the characters and say okay Drew slums the new Eaton heaven on Earth that's what I was doing when Solomon upgrades 10th to a temple it's all this Eden imagery all over again and he has a seven-part prayer that culminates in a blessing saying this house become a source of blessing for all the nations may all the nations look to it and know the one true God so it seems like Israelites took on the same in that time. The Jerusalem became the source of a storyline that was a story that also ashurbanipal would tell one day about Nineveh the meeting place of Heaven and Earth the source of protection and preservation of Life Heavenly life here on Earth however we come across this story and a scroll
 who's narrator
 is the manga set of authors foodnet this whole story together all the way forward to the story of Solomon and then to the kings of Jerusalem who began introducing worship of Idols in the courtyard of the temple start using it as a bank to hire other nations to protect Jerusalem and eventually the same city and building will get overthrown by the king of Babylon and burnt to a crisp so the question is what does this story mean now in light of authors who know that this Heaven on their spot got destroyed cup that makes sense so what's interesting is when you come across Jerusalem as it's described in the prophets who foretold the destruction of this heaven on Earth spot but then maintained hope
 the gods have it on their spot didn't get destroyed when the spot the City Jerusalem got destroyed in other words for the prophets and The Poets of the Psalms the destruction of Jerusalem didn't mean the end of the city of the Heavenly city so we begin the series with looking at Psalm 46 so I don't want to read it again but just to remind us it begins by describing how God is our refuge and our strength and ever-present Heiser delivering protective Ally and help in trouble therefore even if the land
 melts away even if the mountains fall into the heart of the Sea and the waters Roar and foam in the mountains Quake Genesis creation even if creation is undone God himself will become more protective Refuge what does how how so will because there's a river whose streams make glad the city of Elohim
 and so true slim is actually never named in this time but rather God and the City of God are the Divine Refuge so there's that whatever now where are we singing the song This is the title superscription for this Psalm 46 is for the director of music of the sons of Korah
 so this is a Priestly choir who would sing this in the Jerusalem Temple but they are singing this in the temple saying God and the City of God is the ultimate Transcendent City of Refuge so it seems like it's really viewed Jerusalem as an image or a touchdown point the correspondence is a Transcendent city that is God's got himself for the city of God himself so I could try to move will need to make a Nvidia it back you're saying that yes the city of Jerusalem
 was this High Point with David and his son Solomon ruled it but you called the Golden Age this was like there was prosperity and peace to Unity amongst all the tribes they were flawed but they were seeking after God's wisdom and that story we just read about Lusa is telling us that God taking up residence in the city however like the same conditions of Eden still apply this isn't you always presence isn't just your trophy that you can bring into your city and you're protected now forever and always you have to relate to Yahweh yes by his terms and wisdom right now in Jerusalem if you want this to become the Eden you hope it will be there when you said the person the authors who are narrating the scroll compiled the stories all these toys together where they're going to take us to is to David's
 great-grandsons just making a mess of the exits right basically replaying Adam and Eve and Jerusalem getting sieged and then later like actually destroyed is the Exile of humanity of Israel set an analogy to the Exile of humanity that's right so why we are seeing David how to restore Eden it's recognizing that this is not the new creation New Creation it was a step in that direction but the problem is is we still have humans who want to take it's right on our own terms of the founding story of Jerusalem becoming like a new Eden is set on an LG to the failure of Adam and Eve so when we read a Psalm where people are celebrating will there is a city of God this holy place and the people
 celebrating it are the Priestly choirs who lives in that city is Arthur singing the song in the center Temple of that City from a very just plain Central I cut the talking about Jerusalem this is their city and they wanted to be great this is protecting them from the evil like Siri and Empire with Babylonian Empire like they think that this city is the city of God but what you're saying is it's more nuanced than that that they're very aware book A Night Like This song too so I get it that those who crafted The Scroll of Samuel like they're doing that and they have this their place the story in a very specific way but correct me again you're saying sending the prophets who later reflect on Jerusalem in the poet's who arranged the storm scroll yeah they would have done that
 Jerusalem was an exile it's the same Dynamic is in the narratives so for the prophets who lived before the structure of Jerusalem or these priests requires you for Psalm 46 they lived in Jerusalem before
 it was just right there so if we're trying to get into their mind-set they lived in Jerusalem and experienced it it will let it depends on what was happening in the time the prophets mostly lived in times and it was crap that's we're going to talk about in our next conversation conversation but this song clearly the sons of Korah are singing the song on a day when the protection and preservation of life in Jerusalem
 Derek waiting for setting on an elegy to the ultimate preserver and protection of life even if all creation fell apart there is still a city of God of which Jerusalem is like an incarnation in their current experience it's a symbol now that's for the people who wrote the song as a standalone could you make the case that they wrote the song to celebrate Jerusalem as not just a simple but as actual city of God who knows I mean I think there were asking a similar question of like did the biblical authors think the world was a flat disk edges or did they think the stars were actually Spiritual Beings or just symbols of spiritual they imagine the world as such that haven't had these touch points with Earth and that they describe Jerusalem in their poetry
 and here I just Psalms 46 47 48 and then Psalms 84 through 89 are all use this language to I want to look at more one more song for me. Yeah yeah that will just keep our focus on the same question
text Psalm 87 also of the sons of Korah he has founded his City on the Holy Mountain or talk about Jerusalem Yahweh loves the gates of Zion
 more than all the other dwellings of Jacob when I bring up the gate through the gates the gates part of the wall oh yeah I think it's a part for hole in the tree like when you say that I'm at the p21 part of something refer to the hole but the gates are like behind the wall that opens the part of the wall out of which it's kind of like the same way that the words are I wrote in Hebrew nefesh came in image of the whole person the entryway so in the same way the entry key entry way is to channel key thing is you always found it a city on the Holy Mountain Yahweh loves the gates of Zion to know Zion city is like a which is another term for Jerusalem yes Zion yes most likely means Rock
 so now you always relating to Zion like a spouse you always loves the city more than all the other dwellings of Jacob glorious things are said of you of city of God first of all the opening of this Pond is Yahweh is in love with this one city more than all the others he has one Beloved the city of Zion and here are the Glorious things that are said of the city of God I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who know me
 this is what the god saying about the cities are glorious things that are said about the city of God I will I hear is I think the I hear is meant to be referring to the Divine voice God's voice is a nickname for Egypt in the prophets and the Psalms Egypt and Babylon are among those who know Yahweh that's surprising
 philistia to and also Tire along with Kush they will all say this one was born in Zion this one was indeed of Zion it will be said this one and that one were born in her
 the most high himself will establish her
 Yahweh will write it in the register of the Nations the people's and here's what you were right this one was born in Zion
 and as they all make music they will sing all my fountains are in you
I love the look on your face so it'll be well damn it this is a meditation this such as a riddle the stones are red oh well you know the last line I feel like I get my hands around you know all the fountains the springs is the rivers that come out of Eden and they're and they're bringing life to all the land and so I mean what a surprise Egypt and Babylon acknowledging our way yes but that's what the whole story the Bible is trying to prepare before it is like the Eden blessing flowing out you had a nation and Jonah do Jonah Diva Nineveh can like turn and repent of the Philistines like they were the snakes enemies in the days of David and Saul Tire do read ezekiel's prophets tirade do the snake in the garden
 and also these are we just wait around the the compass the points of the compass Egypt in the South Babylon in the East philistia and the West Tire to the north to the South OK Google where are we going really confused as when he says that this one was born in Zion so God is saying I'm looking at Egypt this Egyptian or the Babylonian stand OST norred yet I'm considering them to have their origin citizenship their citizenship they are in the city register I see that's what that means consensus line coach are ancient census like where are you from where is your name written in what book has your name written all my goodness
 okay so all of the Nations have their citizenship in this city that Yahweh loves
 found it on the Holy Mountain out of which flows of river and all of the nations are written as being born from in in from the city so the city is a woman the city is depicted as a mother who gives birth to all living Out of This Woman's that he comes all the nations whose ultimate identity and citizenship flows from the mountains River of the city of God so you know I can see a king
 reading this poem and saying cool let's make that happen let's go conquer all those people who are all those people they been to need to me I'll put them in the book and Global Peace yeah yeah and now the city of God has been established so the dynamic is exactly the dynamic at work in the stories of Samuel and Kings about kingship in the story of Israel but just like the city can become an instrument of life or death depending on how people relate to the wisdom of God so this is clearly a dream of a city of God becoming the Empire of God over all the nations and the question is was historical Jerusalem ever the touchdown focal point of this hope well it seems like the characters depicted in the story
 may have held out hope but did the biblical authors ever actually think that food narrate and buy big lies I mean the final Shapers of the Tanakh to the former prophets yeah the people who compiled the song scroll compiled the saddest poem and shaped it to belong where it is centuries after the City was destroyed by Babylon the spinal shape the song scroll you know comes from just a few centuries before Jesus so here's what's interesting is that in the second temple. And we know this that second temple Israelites read these poems as referring to something greater than the city of Jerusalem and one body of the second temple texts are found in the collection we call the New Testament so why is it the Paw like in the letter to Galatians
 can start talking on in Galatians chapter 4 about what he calls the Jerusalem above who is our mother oh my goodness and he corresponds the Heavenly Jerusalem to start the mother of Isaac and we know from Romans that Paul considered the birth of Isaac to Abraham and Sarah as being an Act of Creation a new creation act creating life where there was no life as he says in Romans chapter 4 and hearing Galatians 4 he quotes from a poem in Isaiah 54 that's about a infertile woman who has no children who is going to give birth to a whole family and he says that that's a problem about the Heavenly Jerusalem who is our mother
 and he saying this to Gentiles not as Reliance who have been brought into the family of God through the Messiah in the letter two equations I just connected bunch of things and I got lost but my point is Paul red when you came across Jerusalem in his Bible he saw Jerusalem the city as a symbol for something much more Transcendent the Jerusalem above what he called the Jerusalem above who is our mother that is the mother of the multi-ethnic family of the Messiah I see the city is the mother Sidious mother so and then he quotes from Isaiah and the quotation of Isaiah is about a barren woman who will not only have one child but will have so many children numerous children that was a weird sense it isn't yours your translation know it's not my translation Isaiah 54 we could have Isaiah 54 which is about a woman who's never been able to have children but then God is going to give
 that woman a huge family such a huge family that their 1/10 isn't going to be big enough so they're going to have to widen the curtains in the polls of the tent there comes so huge that it will be able to actually fit all the nations that's a big tent and then. That woman was up not just infertile but also she was divorced and exiled from her husband and her husband is going to come back and remarry her and then we're going to learn is that this whole thing is like the flood these are like the days of Noah so it's hard to have as a safety for this whole Palm is a digest of Genesis 1 through 11 using this imagery to describe the Jerusalem above
 that God will build took it birth to a new Humanity so for the Jerusalem was both historically a place where God took up residence among his people put in their eyes it was a place that was compromised from the beginning the day David brought it in
 and the ultimate hope for biblical authors is not actually in an Earthly City the end the Israelites built but that Earthly city was a pointer to the city of God will call the city above the Jerusalem resolve of thread in Hebrews it will be called The Heavenly Jerusalem in Hebrews chapter 12 and actually this is great the author to the Hebrews says if you're a follower of Jesus you can go right now to Mount Zion the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem in fact anytime you get together to worship and do this bread in the cup in the Liturgy you're there you're joining the Heavenly assembly who's there right now
 and in the Revelation the Risen Jesus says listen if you overcome your fear of death by remaining faithful to me I will make that person a pillar in the temple and give them a new name which is the name of the city of my God the New Jerusalem that comes out of heaven
 so either these guys are just kind of weird or they actually understood what the Hebrew Bible is trying to say about the city of God in the city of man which is that they're coming one way of saying is it is spiritualizing it cuz we've been talking about real cities real walls enclosures real places of refuge and now they're saying now they're saying they also think the Heavenly Jerusalem as a real City in fact they think it's more real than any City that we could ever built well okay I think they really think this is a real place this is It's a real thing city of gods are real place otherwise none of us would be here right now thinking you're talking cuz it's that City that makes possible all of life so we really just putting it in an allergy of like the kingdom of God or the like the rule of God where the God can create and sustain life and the ID
 the fountain This Is The Life Of God spilling out into all of creation but then let's connect it back to the actual reality of creating yeah yeah City so I guess that brings us all the way back to Kane which is God is the ultimate source of all of life flows out of the Heavenly Eden by the river
 and we're outside of eating and we're called to trust in the protection and presents the God wants to provide for us but we so easily twist that into a human city of our own making that we use as a substitute for what God wants to offer and I think that's the fundamental drama at work here is the Jerusalem could have become a city of refuge and it was at moment but from its beginning it was compromised as a very human cane like City and that's what it ultimately became so in a way people in cities
 I like people and the tree in the Garden of Eden every the treat knowing good and bad if it's test every city you build will present you with a set of choices about whether you will trust God's wisdom or live by your own which is why cities can sometimes be a source of good and sometimes be a source of bad that's interesting city is like an extension of that tree so the city faces humans with a set of choices and they're the same choice that humans sad when they are the tree was God saying are you going to take the wisdom on your own terms you can trust me and the Temptation is the guy got this
 and the problem is we don't and chaos and death and violence and greed and Envy in all the things so that's a very almost like situating the choice on a very personal level I was like me what do I need in this moment she is it's much it's me and us together and what do we need to thrive and have the good life and our place on Earth and so it's the decision to design that which is saying how am I going to discern between good and bad on a much larger level so it's like that personal personal choice except to scaled-up scaled up and so you must imagine a city being the tree of knowledge of good and bad it says one tree it's like a city tree
 the fruit is everywhere it's like everywhere you go is that fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad ending itself saying how you going to handle that so I can do that but what's interesting also is that city is our creative environments so they also embody choices that have already been made by people who stood at the tree when they built this or that part of the city right there so cities are these accumulating
 environments that are shaped by every generation set of choices that the tree of knowing good and bad right which makes them even greater forces of good or greater forces Bruins compounding we've talked about in the series so far this right now but where the seems to all go in my mind is the so what like I'm in a city I as an American I get to like elect be apart of electing who's going to run the city's yeah sure I get to participate in my city and well what happened
 would invite followers of Jesus by key dozen Philippians to say our citizenship is in heaven as he doesn't flipping chapter three are citizenships in and I think by that he means in the Jerusalem above so in the city of God which isn't determined or limited by the values or storyline of the Cities we inhabit however what he says is and from there we await our deliverer who will come and transform our humble bodies and this world into the new creation When Heaven on Earth become one but in the meantime we inhabit these Earthly cities and in the meantime we can inhabit the city of God by participating together in these rituals in the Assembly Church so Impalas mine the Assembly of Jesus followers is The Outpost of the city of God
 never him he's not these Outpost aren't saying we're going to rebuilding the city it's saying we get to somehow enter the city that's yet to come we are called to live and organize ourselves as a sub culture and Community according to a different narrative and Narrative of Eden abundance we're still waiting we're waiting for the city wait for our delivery as he says in Philippians while we get to them in some way also participate in it so It's Tricky is it you know Paul's the apostles lived environment was that of A persecuted
 religious minority so he's not going to have a lot of explicit guidance about how to vote there was no voting for the early Christians in the Roman Empire and this is a long-standing issue and debate throughout church history because the church has found itself in his many types of social political environments as I have ever existed sure you know and so what a particular Outpost of the city of God called the church is supposed to do living in communist socialist Democratic tribal anarchic whatever is going to look have to look different in the express differently but the core I think morally ethical
 values the course narrative that underlies whatever those expressions are I think I found it out of the story of Jesus which is I think that's what you was doing what you and he said the Empire of God has arrived the kingdom of God is the city of God actually we're going to go in a couple of conversations in Jesus most famous collection of teachings he called a group of poor people gathered on a hillside after he blessed them nine times over he called them the salt of the earth the light and the city on because I'm a city he calls them the city of which for sure what you mean is y'all are the Heavenly City that's out posted here up and Galilee and the revolution starts today
 so the city of God is the heavenly mother of a new humanity and it is the place from which the news Manatee is reversed but it's God's creation
 which humans receive it's not something we can dream up here outside of Eden
 because inevitably up the way our dreams will be compromised by our mortality and our lack of imagination because of our fear of scarcity in death why I guess that's why I was latching onto pause sentiment of we wait because it's either we wait and we build what you said was likely may not be mutually exclusive yeah there's a long-standing debate see you know that are above my paygrade who should we talk to I don't know I meant to say I'm thinking like I'm afraid to say anything cuz I just have limited knowledge there's been many famous experiments especially in you know fairly recent that is five hundred years ago in the post-reformation era there are many attempts at building cities of God you know in early reformed you're up K G neva end up being an example and you know
 they weren't good for everybody so that's a bonus it's a complicated history of algae's followers they've tried to embody the city of God here in human cities and I think it's more of a not a problem that can be solved the side of the new creation it's I think it's attention that every generation has to face in its own unique way well okay we have a lot more conversation so I think that'll be a threat I want to chase down is like what is Lonnie wants there it's like okay we can't we can't solve it on our own but we are now brothers and sisters of Jesus that's right power through his Spirit who is the one who can't found the city you do when our citizenship is the is in that Heavenly settings so let's get building but then there's a sentiment of and it's reality of like we're screwed up just look at our track record
 and the fact that even though we are citizens and we have the spirit of God we still have this problem that Paul calls of the Flesh and it turns us against each other so how many of us have ever does dreamed of like buying some land and starting a little Community with our friends taking the form of seclusion and the monastic turn which is basically get go live in the country
 create a small community of gardeners self-sustaining and learn how to pray and serve the poor and prepare yourself for the arrival of the new creation and then the other extreme that is also burst out of the wisdom of the devil story is but in our short mortal lives we can create and build into the lives of our City's let's build a community center let's elect the leader who will make us prosper and it will likes it is being a mix of good and bad some of the intentional some of the unintentional but that's what that's what it is to be human outside of Eden which is full on let's just build the Christian City
 whatever that means but both of those extremes could potentially be space for responses to the story given the unique sets of times and circumstances would people laugh and it doesn't seem like the two one-size-fits-all and all of every possibility could be a faithful response in a certain spot you're going to go out maybe secluded and pray and serve the poor be careful because the snake will still show up the city of God popped into existence in Surprise places that you might miss it if you want to build the city of God and reinvent your city as a city of God there's a great intuition there some good can happen but be careful yeah yeah because it could turn into just another example of Oppression and despite one's own personal
 Rugrats best intentions to be continued continued so we will continue to cycle around but next where I'd like to go is to a couple moments where the narrator's of historical Jerusalem that is in the books of Samuel and kings are going to show how could have been potentially was that eating on Earth in Jerusalem becomes the Jerusalem made city of man and we'll look at some stories about Solomon and Ahab can I have to show how that works out where Jerusalem becomes the new Babylon satellite
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to look at the words of the prophet Micah who tells us that the city of Jerusalem has become like the city of Kane the point here in Micah is that clearly the cities of Jerusalem is Samaria have become the opposite of the Garden of Eden here this you leaders of Jacob you rulers of Israel who despise Justice and distort what is right you build Zion with Bloodshed and Jerusalem with wickedness
