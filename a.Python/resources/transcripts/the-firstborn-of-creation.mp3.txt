we've come to the end of our series exploring the theme of the firstborn we started and Genesis that we worked our way through the biblical story and today we land the plane in the New Testament letters in Colossians Paul calls Jesus the image of the invisible God the firstborn over all creation which is a cool title for what does it mean when he says the firstborn of creation and he's doesn't have in mind that Jesus was born that is came into existence of some point first born here is describing status for an identity he doesn't say Jesus is in the image of God what he saying is when he read Genesis one he sees the pre incarnate pre-human Jesus as being D image that humans are the image of Jesus the firstborn of all creation is the image of the invisible God and the image humans were made to be which means that Jesus shows us who God is and the Jesus reveals to us what it means to be truly human even though
 he's like a new Adam he's actually the first real human it what it means to be human is to be one with the love of the Divine father then there actually wasn't ever any humans before Jesus
 that's putting it provocatively but I think to say Jesus is the image of God the second Adam who was actually like the first staff Paul says that Jesus is the firstborn among many civil which means we have the opportunity to claim a new identities for ourselves that people who are loved by God dignified and chosen by God regardless of any Merit other seeing us or we see ourselves Jesus unique identity as the cosmic Eternal Divine first born son is he is that one God is that one got the most special unique thing in all of reality but what if being special in love is not a zero-sum game what if we are all in bottom of that Divine image and worthy of cosmic ticket and love we are all invited to see who we really are
 God's special children
 today Tim Mackie and I are talking about how the identity of Jesus as the cosmic firstborn defines what it means to be human under Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 hello Tim hello is this the last episode in the series could be but you never know I have like three or four things that we could talk about but we might only get through one I don't know we're going to say all right we'll see what happens yeah we are do at the tail end of the series were calling the firstborn which in some ways is not helpful title but in some ways it is especially as we maybe have this conversation today yeah you did a couple some reason last few episodes maybe I'll give it a shot wonderful so God the god of the universe who created everything has shared his dominion and power with his creatures namely the spiritual being Sunday for we will the sky
 the more important so maybe Austin are lived experience on day 6 God creates human cause us these dark creatures His Image to rule the land and the creatures of the land in the sky and the Sea and this is a pretty like big deal to be the image of God in fact it's such a big deal that the Spiritual Beings who are more glorious creatures I mean these are like the host of Heaven the Angels there like their Divine majestic creatures are not sure if this is kind of the right move it away and this is a lot of subtext but this is something we walk through in episode 2 of the series is that there's a sibling rivalry and as you read through the whole Bible not only is like a lot of the problems that happen because of this rivalry between Spiritual Beings and humans but then there's a kind of Unholy Alliance that happens
 Rebellion between rebellious Spiritual Beings and humans but at the heart of it is that the ones who were first the Spiritual Beings the first born in a sense are scandalized that God would show his generosity and favor and his attention to a more lowly creature humans what the first the most powerful like they get the best seat in the house what is it about God that he undermines that from the very beginning and then spiritual being in the form of the serpent deceived the humans to not trust God and His generosity and now we've got the problem under green the whole story of the Bible is how can we ask you who on God's behalf when were in Rebellion against him and we can't trust him we can't trust his generosity and And We crave violence and so that's where God says look I'm going to solve this through a seed of humanity a seed of the woman is going to come
 Crush evil set things right and so now as we're waiting for the seed we're wondering where is human going to come from what family and God is going to continue to to winnow down and choosing families from which this Messiah the seed is going to come and he always chooses and counter-intuitive way he doesn't choose the firstborn he doesn't choose the most powerful he chooses the latecomer the least expected and while doing this the same underlying issue and Sue's Humanity doesn't know what to do with God's mode of dispensing his generosity powerful the firstborn is like hey why did you overlook me I'm the one who's the latecomer the one who should have been chosen it is chosen often doesn't live up to what they should have done with that response of
 and a lot of the conflict in the Bible comes from these essentially sibling rivalries the human conflicts contact list their mirror of this more Cosmic conflict it's a while we're all here like in this mess of who should be first and who should God be blessing and can I trust God and do I need to build my own kingdom and where's my lands can be as we're just doing that whole thing God shows up and says you want to know who's first it's this guy is Jesus who is the glory
 the Eternal Word the one who's from the beginning everything was made through this person he has the most power in the whole universe and in some mysterious way he is both distinct from God and God the Troopers born and as we revealed Jesus's status his identity in the gospels as this Son of God the first born we see then what does it look like actually use God's power and it's what we could have been trained to see that God will go to the least likely the oppressed the poor and want to elevate them and it's not so that like they get favoritism over everyone else just cuz there's enough generosity for everyone and that mode is now being displayed in a new beautiful way through the true power of the universe to True first born and then not only that but because Jesus is now the human knee
 image of God that we are meant to be he is also creating the path for us to then reclaim that title be United with him which means being united with God and this wonderful John 17 trippy being one with each other kind of thing so yeah I think that's kind of where we're at a job yeah and just maybe one little kind of as you say double click on the second to last point is he's both the model for how to be a child of God who trust God generosity so he both models the way to do that but then actually he is the way like he's the one who is who creates the way to reconnect estranged children from the father that they don't trust anymore and so he is the one who rebuilds the way keep both models
 play Annie It's the way to use that metaphor in John John goes all the way back to God wanting to elevate Humanity to be his image like he is the way back to that exactly that something really fascinating at the end of our last conversation which is you said as I think about my ability to now through Jesus commune with God Like Jesus I now have a special identity that like eating uses language like God Treasures me and so thinking about that what's interesting is they're talking we've been talking about this impulsive wanted to make ourselves important right and who's first in like who has the authority in the power
 and where the conversation ended last was you kind of going man I'm important I have significant then came saying like why are you showing me favor yeah it's like I don't know what's there one way to think about inequities in the human Community this is woven into like the structure in the fabric of how we organize life and whether that's in a small human communities like family or slightly bigger right extended family or neighborhood but it's Who special here like you show up on the senior like who should I be paying attention to who are the power Brokers here you know it's like when you introduce yourself at a conference just like you say like what your job is I'm trying to tell people like why should you care about me yeah yeah
 mints are exactly yes so human communities just universally tend to organize themselves in ways that elevate certain things as being the most special for the most valuable and then the end of rank find themselves sorting ourselves into ranks and so this happens in a million ways cuz human cultures are different but this is a universal there's something about the human psyche that we're all just deeply come into the world with a sense of who am I like where do I fit and what makes me valuable or important and so the way in equities get created is certain things get chosen as the valuable thing and the people who set that slot end up getting whatever more success more resources and so on and so that's the subtext of the drama of the biblical story is just taking
 after granted a life outside of Eden for his human family and what Jesus his unique identity as the cosmic Eternal Divine first born son is he is that one God is that one got the most special unique thing in all of reality but what if being special and loved is not a zero-sum game what if we are all embodiments of that Divine image and worthy of cosmic dignity and love and I think that is what the whole story leading to Jesus and what Jesus was trying to do and say and what the apostles believe happened and it can spread through Jesus in the presence and power of His spirit is that we are all invited to see who we really are as Gods specialed children
 which is why we can talk about it right now right now but I appreciate your kind of putting your finger on that cuz that is the personal impact of this and it's why John who lived longer than all the other Apostles so he got to reflect on it and one lifetime the most
 right and think of like the letter of First John which is what that simple little sentence of God is love like to say something like that is his simplest explainer of like what this means for all of us so powerful man to I feel like eating right now I just need to pause and go take a walk and so I will do that afterwards but let's meditate on some more scripture that unfolds the theme
so I just thought we would touch down at a few points where the seam of Jesus's identity of the Sun or the first born son and then what that means for those who recognize and trust with Jesus, flushed that we get brought into our status as Sons and Daughters I want to look at this and letters of Paul and then in the letter to the Hebrews I think we can do that in the time that are named OK Google, said that we could do a whole conversation on this but we already did years ago in the gods series it's an odd section of Paul's letters in the letter of 1 Corinthians chapter 8 and he's having this discussion about how the Corinthians who are new followers of Jesus turn on Israelites and they're finding it really difficult how to navigate their previous life and Greek and Roman society where the temple is everywhere you get invited to the sacrificial
 Feast to honor Apollo or a Scorpius or Aphrodite and
 Ryan is all these ways that you can interface with the gods Are Spiritual Beings in a way that could be really detrimental and so he's trying to walk the fine line and say listen we have our allegiance to the one God
 and that's primary but you're going to have to find a way to navigate life in your city as you have that confession so in First Corinthians 5 and 6 it begins talking about the identity of the one God that these followers of Jesus are called to do inverse pie he says listen even if there are so-called gods in heaven and on Earth and there are many gods and there are many lords submitting Spiritual Beings and principalities and powers out their spiritual forces that are not the one true God he says 6:00 yet for us there is one God the Father
 from whom are all things and we are for him and there is one Lord Jesus the Messiah through whom are all things and we are through him so lots of cool stuff here you know if you put this into a math formula he's essentially saying one plus one equals one we have one God the father and one Lord Jesus Messiah and they are the one got and this cool poetic parallelism but he's taking the line of the Shema hear o Israel the Lord Our God the Lord is one
 and he's taken the words Lord and God that refers to one and he split them into and he's put parallel God the father and the Lord Jesus Messiah as the one God and what's cool is that that's cool that itself school but then these little lines about both God the father and the one Lord Jesus Messiah he doesn't say the word son but that's what you mean both of them are responsible for all reality you do so but in like a different way in their own distinct way it seems like a subtly exactly so the father is like the fundamental ground he's the source of all reality from whom are all things
 and we are for him we're on a journey back to the source from which we came to connect to it
 and there is one Lord Jesus Messiah through whom are all things so who is the agent the one through whom the Eternal source of all things the agent through whom all creation came into physical existence it's the one lordsun the first born and we are through him so I have this this poem so great as like this is an eternal mystery about the besson's and identity of God and the only language to capture it is poetry which is what is constructed here a little short poem rest of meditate on the mystery of creation of God of Who We Are
 and
 there's a father-son assumption here this kind of at the core of his conception of God so that's kind of step one this is fundamental to Paul stinking so fundamental he can like write a little poem about it in his mind is super clear and I think it is clear on one level but we made years ago where it's like even though we can't understand this aristippus level we can better understand the parts that are hard to understand or we can better understand what it is we don't understand and I think this poem is a good example of them okay so that's like foundation for Paul's thinking about the father and the son
 very similar to what we saw in the gospels so let's watch him do it in another Palm
 and this poem is longer more complex and it's a poem found in on the first chapter of his letter to the Colossians and I don't think we've meditated on this bomb ever together that like yeah it is cool its status as a poem actually the study of this passage has a long prehistory and New Testament studies because it's often called a him many scholars think that Paul has adapted and worked in either a poem or him that was sung that either he wrote or is that was sung in early Christian communities and he's kind of brought it into the letter corporated is in but it's a poem that works into Cycles or think of it like a poem in two halves
 and they are both are about the identity of Jesus as this could have been an early Christian hymn to Paul's reciting correct yeah it's definitely a structure to it let's see I have meaning it would have been sunk out loud yeah if anyone's interested in this there's a reason twerk that summarizes the long history of this which is a book by scholarmatch to Gordon Lee called New Testament christological hymns exploring text context and significance so what you find embedded in the New Testament letters are sections were Paul will often just kind of like it really poetic and so people have wondered if these aren't
 Snippets of early Christian hymns that would have been sung, and early Christian Gatherings so there's the poem in Philippians chapter 2
 it's also 11 Paul's letters people have thought that's about the opening to The Gospel of John the prologue if it reflects Snippets of early Christian him and has lots of others but Matthew cordless book is a great great place to intersection of poetry theology music
 it's a nerdy book for like people who serve as worship leaders in the church communities to read but actually could really enriched especially if you're interested in songwriting is like release Christian song so maybe that's cool I kind of background of this poem what makes it less helpful is you know why are you are about to just read this and anytime you hear someone else read up on you know I am always likes her I can I look at it I find poetry hard to just listen to on its own for the first time cuz the point is you're supposed to be like here at many many times and sing it and so there's a lot going on but Colossians 1:15 and read it out loud
 it's a poem about the son who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of all creation for in him all things were created in the heavens and on the earth things visible and invisible whether Thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things have been created through him and to him for him
 and he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the Assembly Church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so that he might have first place in all things for in him God was pleased that all of the fullness would dwell
 and through him to reconcile all things to himself things on earth and things in heaven having made peace through the blood of his cross the pond. I'm showing you right now a picture of It kind of laid out and formatted to show the symmetries cuz if it's two halves and each one is the up symmetry design into itself and then the two halves mirror each other through repetition of identical words and ideas pirate what you're noticing is he here and then kind of look at it okay so there's two sections of the poem and the first is
 looking at the sun is the image of the invisible God and Roofing on like what we talked about to John Wan through Luke's narratives of the baptism and Transfiguration isn't he is the firstborn here we're giving very kind of really clean language I feel like that we didn't get in like loose gospel or just the different literary style Luke was more implicit right through hyperlink and narrative implication this is poetry that's very explicit the image of the invisible God that's interesting the word image is parallel to the word firstborn son in these first two lines he's the image of the invisible God he's the firstborn over all creation so image and firstborn are in parallelism to each other yeah
 and image that's connected to the idea of humanity being God's image but this is saying more than that this is saying yeah maybe what Paul says even more explicitly and another passage where he calls Jesus like the the something image the like is this the passage you thinking of don't think so it's almost like the exact image or they like the opening of the letter to the Hebrews which will look at it later so what is significant if he doesn't say Jesus is in the image of God
 what he saying is when he reads Genesis one he sees humans as being made in the image or according to a like and he is the likeness exactly when he read Genesis one he sees the pre incarnate pre-human Jesus as being the image that humans are the image of the Divine one who is the image that humans are an image of the invisible God cool that's really helpful and then that's parallel to the idea of the firstborn over creation and so his identity is so closely tied to God that he and this way you described as the image and Hurstbourne which so if you take for granted first Paul's deepest conviction about Jesus
 is not that he is a creature
 rather he is the Creator and he is one with the father and because there is Father and Son there's a distinction between them but also they are one so when he says the first born of creation he's doesn't have in mind that Jesus was born that is came into existence at some point it's first born here is describing a status or an identity
 and this was actually a subject of huge debate in the first centuries of the Jesus movement and it was this passage was at the Centre of many of those debates because the word firstborn was taken to literally mean he was a creature brought into existence as the first of anything that God ever created and this was what was at stake in the debates that led to the nicean council in 90 and created so on so that the whole Rabbit Hole to go in but I just think for Paul his deepest conviction is the Jesus is one with the Father the Son and father are the one God that's why I started with 1 Corinthians 8 now when we were looking at was it John one yes and the translation of mono mono connects the one in our base daughter only that kind of smooth it out this idea of Jesus being the begotten cuz it's not mono guineo right which has its form from the Latin Vulgate
 correct in Greek it's my token a switch is 11 of its one and only one of its category but hear different word Paul's using the word first born exactly why well cuz that's the word most deeply connected to the steam in the Hebrew Bible the first name of the name of the firstborn correct ends trying to connect to the thing we've been talking about which is who gets to rule who does God choose to have authority is a status within a family in other words the word in emphasizing the origin of the one in the family it's a describing not once you have a fit when you have a family
 there's two ways to talk about the identity of the leaders of the family there's the father and then there's the one in the status of the firstborn and not it's that data present status that is the focus of Paul's usage here because he goes on to say that Jesus is the one in the next line is in him all things were created and so that kind of puts Jesus on the Divine sides of creation as opposed to on the creative side of God in creation that makes sense makes sense I mean you can make an argument that God creates Jesus and then partnering with Jesus to create everything else is the argument that was brought to the table in the earliest Christian debates and so what the Nicene Creed irons out is like actually no using the word firstborn was not to say juice was created it's connected to the steam of status and yep. Plenty of other
 images and ideas to help us realize that Jesus was not created he was from the beginning that's right and so what happened in those early centuries was new language got developed to clarify this and it would have been great if the Apostle's have done this for us what developed out of this was a way of clarifying Jesus as the eternally begotten one or the Eternal generation of the sun meaning that there was never a moment where the sun was not right but for there to be truly one God within whom there is an eternal father and an eternal Sun there is some relationship between them
 what is that relationship well the best we can do is use human language and then ratcheted up to a Divine level in there with that again it's better clarifying what ultimately we can't comprehend if anyone wants to actually I'll recommend a great book I was going to do it at the end but the book end to this is very helpful for me is by Matthew Bates called the birth of the Trinity something about New Testament and early Christian interpretation of the Old Testament he traces the history of these types of pathogen has the Old Testament hyperlinks there depending on and how early Christian
 conversations about the identity of Father and Son developed in the early centuries into the first Creed's very helpful if you want to trace that path so some translations come to Fashions 116 and translate the firstborn over all creation when they do that they're trying to clarify that this is the first born means status not working so I prefer that at the translation the firstborn over all creation which is the legitimate translation of the poem is about that status and identity yes and then what packs after that is that through him
 in him all things were created and through him all things were created and
 for him all things for him and filling out what he said in 1 Corinthians 8 which is there is one Lord through whom are all things and we are through him yeah yeah he's got this line all things hold together in him that's enough.
 Like wow what a status totally he is the rationale yeah this is reflecting an Insight we're actually early Christians were like you know if they're hanging out at the pub on Friday night they're like jamming with their Neil platonist friends are there that's like philosopher buddies cuz they've all agree with a hollow hold in common is that the reality of held together in a logical rational order to log us and that we have rational Minds that our minds somehow can connect to it can actually reach out of our heads and conceive of that order and rationally comprehend it and then studying in ways that we can predict things about reality and how it will behave based on the order it out there but that's from an imagined order in my mind
 must not be imaginary cuz it's real I mean it's like it actually this is the stuff of yeah we live in such a crazy reality how is any of this impossible and so Paul can jam out with a is like whatever whiteness buddy I seen a chorus or something and be like you know where we agree where we agree is that all reality is being held together and you think it's through an impersonal force or energy where I deal and I'm telling you that that energy is a person and it's a person who was crucified by the Romans State as a criminal but God Vindicated him by raising him from the dead and he absorbed all the sin and death of our world into himself and he loves you at the Anacortes I think that's how it would go anyway
so in Greek thought the log house was very depersonalized I mean because of nature were like everything was deified write all these powers and stuff are like clearly I forgot about just like the God of Thunder were the god of fertility we're talking about the fundamental order that transcends and makes possible humans or Zeus ordering reality within which Zeus or humans or Aphrodite to hear the gods exist things in heaven and things in their correct Powers Thrones rulers and authorities and he's both referring to the Roman state but also to the principalities the Spiritual Beings that the Romans State claims that they're in jail
 exactly how are they being sustained exactly what's holding this all together it's the firstborn over creation yep Cosmic man so they have is a ripped open we see the firstborn of all creation the second half of this poem he's not talking about the relationship we have to the firstborn right has a body but came Among Us what's implied here is the firstborn became a human came Among Us and is actually connected and brought together a new humanity and he calls that the body of the Sun that is the assembly for that calicia which gets translated as church and then he wants to come back to the firstborn language but bring out a new Nuance of it which is a fascinating we haven't talked about yet it is this phrase the firstborn from the dead yeah can we repeat again he's from the beginning
 nothing is this new thing it somehow it's connected to being the head of the body do we please hear that he's the firstborn from the dad yeah so there's implied the storyline here where he's the firstborn of all creation so he's author that agent through them all creation his post was created in the past and has been sustained every moment since but also there's a lot of death in the world like things are not okay here and so what's the Sun Also is is the head of a new human family that is a new creation that is transcending the enemy in the barrier that is death and decay in mortality to have resurrected from the dead in the story The Bible Well if by Resurrection you just mean resuscitation from the dead yes so that you'll die just a little later but in terms of like
 the Conqueror of death who has a reversed it and over whom death has no hold that's what he means there doesn't mean he was resurrected you defeated death so just cuz he has a status over all creation of the firstborn so he has the status of being the firstborn over a whole new creation Human family overcome death has no power that's what he means by the firstborn from the dead so that he might have first place and he's ripping off the word first again and actually it's a great example of his commenting on what he means by the word firstborn not in terms of the origin that he came into existence but rather he has the status of first place in all the things he gets to sit at the right hand or he gets his first and then he fills out the narrative a little more will how is it that there is a body
 call the assembly around this first born of a whole new creation that transcends death like what how did that happen well in him God's faithfulness and here is eluding all the temple Glory filling the temple The Glory Glory Cloud that dwells in the temple that's the fullness the sun was that phone in a human hand through that human son that is the fullness of the defective all things are reconciled through him to God the Father things on the land and things in the sky and how did that happen all came crashing into the moment of what happened in his death and Resurrection it so when we talk from the very beginning this project about the story the Bible is about the reunification that Union of having a nurse from the horse's mouth
 here it is all things reconciled on Earth and in heaven on the land in the sky and there's peace now with the union mean piece yeah and it's through what happened on the cross and implied and his resurrection because that is what he was implied with being the firstborn from the death he died on the cross but he overcame the power of death in the resurrection and in that death and Resurrection reconciliation and peace was accomplished when we looked at the suffering servant poem I don't remember which one but it does call the servants like a I don't know if these were the Tony sacrifice or purification sacrifice a sacrifice to cover over since the effect of consequences of sin that's right here the blood
 that whole thing so dense the word blood signals everything in the Torah about the meaning of sacrifice and atonement yeah but then you got to not in there you got Circle back to the beginning of this half of the poem which is that he's also the first born from the dead he didn't just die as an atonement yes but I conquered death through that life conquered death and through that life a dying Cosmos was reconciled to the Living God this is an amazing Palm Coast unstated here
 okay Scott McKnight New Testament scholar whose huge influence on me and on the whole field a new testament studies that he wrote a commentary on Colossians it's just about 45 years old can I read through kind of how he try to summarize the pain has any time trying to summarize a poem you're creating something other than the poem anytime you make an explainer video about the Bible is here exactly right not no longer reading the Bible double usage of the word first born in this time so he says the term firstborn is used throughout the Septuagint that's the Greek translation of the Old Testament for the temporal first born child from a mother
 and the same sense is found in the New Testament use of firstborn to but the term also indicates the status of preeminence when speaking of Israel is God's firstborn when speaking of the Future King from the line of David or when speaking and we didn't talk about this of God's wisdom herself in Proverbs 8 she described them as call the first one yes yes yeah that's a whole rabbit hole we didn't go down in the New Testament Jesus is the firstborn and the Greek word is pro Tanto cause he's the firstborn in that he is the one
 into whose image all are being conformed Romans chapter 8 he is the one to be worshipped by all that stuff first born gets used in Hebrews chapter one which will end with the whole church absorbed his identity in the letter to the Hebrews the whole assembly of Jesus followers is called the Assembly of the firstborn in Hebrews chapter 12 and he is also the firstborn from among the dead which is what Paul says and it's also a phrase used in the first chapter of the Book of Revelation in all of these references they refer to his status not birth origin Arbor sword to his superiority is in view more than
 temporality his status is superior cuz he is before all things
 hierarchical he is above all things and ontologically means in terms of assets or being he sustains all things
 so he goes on to talk about the Adam imagery here I don't know if we want to go into that but just that statement I found really helpful yeah he's a buzz he's before he's through and in all things so amazing and it really brings together kind of the deepest themes of the biblical story but also I think the deepest seems about what Paul is trying to communicate about Jesus in in all of his letters which then leads to one other key aspect of Paul spot which is how we get brought into the party mostly that poem is about Jesus but he also had developed his Theology and thinking about what that means for humans for our status so this aspect of the stock comes out in Romans and we'll just look at one passage here this is in Romans 8:14 where he says everyone who is being
 play it around by the spirit of God and he's got here in the background the Israelites being led through the Wilderness out of Egypt by the pillar of cloud and fire at least you'll see that the subtext here so those who are being led around by the spirit of God these are the children of God
 for you have not received a spirit of slavery that would lead you to be afraid again
 rather you have received the spirit of adoption
 as Sons by which we can cry out Abba Potter
 this is an Aramaic word and then a Greek word Abba Father father father father father so let's stop right there so by talking about slavery Liberation being late about this is Exodus language and so it's the idea that humanity is like been in slavery to a cruel Farah that is the evil one and death and threw the first born we've been let out through like a new Moses
 and the ones that God is leading out of death and slavery are God's children
 and if you have God's spirit in you than you are able to embrace your status as a child of God and then he uses Jesus's Aramaic word to talk about his father and says that can be our cry to
 suppose he's he's a rabbi a multicultural and multilingual Rabbi Jesus is and he's writing to followers of Jesus in Rome but he's never visited and he knows they're made up of Israelite non-israelite people he assumes that these followers of Jesus imagine God
 as father and that they use both Greek and Aramaic to call Godfather and specifically this is all about that we can adopt and identity for ourselves that is the identity of the Jesus offered himself which is the Beloved adopted child of Abba Zaba was Jesus's word for father really profound
 okay so the stories about begins with God calling Humanity His Image and there that's very close to say idea of being a Son of God yes that's right now what is happening here is where the image of God but Jesus we are kin made in the image of God and now here in Romans Paul sang Hey Jesus is the image and in the same way he can say to God father we can say godfather is this
 is this something new then what was happening with being limited God in Genesis one is this like a deepening of that relationship or is this just a reclaiming of it oh I see well it's a realization of something that was possible but never was realized in a way within this framework of father and with the strange children for example the Adam and Eve were paying the rest of the Human family in the story never truly believes that they are the children of a generous father who wants to invite them all into the party as it were so like the idea is by eating of the tree of life and not eating of the tree of knowledge of good and bad Adam and Eve Humanity will learn to call God Abba in this way and be connected in this way it's new in that Jesus was the first human to respond with
 Trend to the love of the father even though he's like a new Adam he's actually the first real human is what it means to be human is to be one with the love of the Divine father then there actually wasn't ever any humans before Jesus kind of 56 million provocatively but I think to say Jesus is the image of God and humans you know I'm starting with Adam and Eve are made in the image or according to the likeness yeah me and said there was some
 distance that was able to be bridged or able to be connected through love and trust but that never was and so Jesus is the second Adam who was actually like the first atom is the first truly human one to be United to the Divine love okay Go's isn't like the parallel universe where Adam and Eve sure you don't eat of the tree and then how are they going to meet Jesus and commune with God and how do they be actually become the true he of the first humans were the apostles all take for granted that the pre incarnate Jesus is right there in Genesis one that he is the image is the image after which the humans were made that made me wonder yeah I like when they're walking with God in the garden like are they whipped Jesus
 and when they're told to eat of the Tree of Life are they being taught to commune with Jesus like is that what's going on I think you can demonstrate that that is how all the apostles read and understood the stories in the Old Testament which is why John when he's describing the one Isaiah saw in his vision for example is in John chapter 12 and he's retailing story of Isaiah seeing the glory of Yahweh in the temple is for counting the story from Isaiah chapter 6 and just straight-up says he saw Jesus is Glory so in this isn't just that they are reading Jesus back into the Old Testament they're actually tracking with the theme within the Hebrew Bible which is God has a nuanced identity is the father who is above all in overall no man can see me and live but
 God himself within God's Own Self has bridged the Gap and is made visible within creation another angel of Yahweh through the fire and the glory and the wisdom and what they're saying is that is the one that became human and that we met named Jesus of Nazareth and he is the image after which Humanity was made by the image and so in that sense on your imaginative retelling Jesus well it's a boy and yeah I think we've said enough because then it starts to get I don't know whether to get pretty speculative because the biblical story is trying to give an account of what is actually happened because Jesus and how we met Jesus is something new I mean it's the word become flesh and that hadn't happened in the garden correct right that's right the war did not become Flash that's right in the way that it had with g
 yeah and so that doesn't mean Jesus was not new Jesus was from the beginning but being united with Humanity in that way yes it's all here and it is now that is no Market leading cause of the hidden Mystery who's hidden throughout the ages until it's been revealed through the apostles and Prophets and we made a video in the spiritual being serious on the angel of the Lord I think this was your phrasing or maybe we hammered up together but I was really happy about it we just talked about the angel of Yahweh in the glory in the fire is Yahweh appearing as the human figure and what makes what's the leap forward in the Incarnation is the Gloria Galloway actually becoming human yeah that's right and that's been really helpful way for me to think about it ever since we made that video so it's Jesus it's the word appearing to Adam and Eve in the garden was there
 and every present the wind that came to walk with them in the garden because they were afraid of because of its intensity once they knew they had blown it and so then as their exiled it's like God tells them guys you think you're being exiled you cuz you are but I'm going to come with you get ready I'm coming and he doesn't see it that explicitly he just has a seat of the woman's going to come and we think okay human and what it turns out to be as God become human do the mystery of the wisdom of God says at the end of the right way to reflect on that overnight all talking about like our identity back is being children of God and so is his about we're meant to be in the likeness we are made of
 according to the image in the likeness 4 in the image according to the likeness is quite like this and we can reclaim that by being connected to the one who is the image the image the first born the son and we receive that and this is where I and we don't have time to get into this but this is a whole this is the whole theology around the Holy Spirit how are you yeah yeah I can access it communicated the Divine love the paternal love in the baptism of Jesus it was the spirit that brought that voice and love to write between the father and the son the spirit like a dove to send that same Spirit can be received
 by us and it's a spirit of adoption to Spirit is that same love towards the Sun the first born is the same love that can come and fold me in to that Eternal family of love that allows me to adopt the posture of Jesus which is to call God my Abba Father goes on he says the spirit testifies with our spirit another word for in this is not just about Doctrine this is about a personal experience of its like we are all Kane raw Lisa and coming to realize like there is a blessing for me to and once you experience that love through the presence of God in one's life you realize that we are the children of God and if we're children well there's way more in store because we are The Heirs of the new creation
 inheritors and we are Heirs of God we're fellow heirs with our brother in the Messiah
 and lest you think that this is all just glory in Paradise now that inheritance is going to take us through the suffering and death of the world as we know it so that we can be glorified in the resurrection with him into the new creation
 tell them not finish this yeah so powerful so we're still working with the Exodus team we are LED about by the spirit Spirit adopts Us in the gods family out of Slavery to the cruel pharaoh
 and then we become inheritors of the Promised Land
 that's what the word are means you can air out the blessing which in the Hebrew Bible is land and abundance and security and Shalom I don't know why this hasn't landed for me the way it is right now as you've been tracing God's choosing keeps choosing someone sees going to come from you and it's always still the one you would affect that choosing comes to Jesus and so that the choosing is over of like we're fodera Wing down-filled to Jesus and is now opening it back up and saying like I've conquered death I've purified
 and I want you to be adopted in now back to what was lost yeah and it's going to be a new reboot of Creation in which you can rule as inheritors with me in other words what does allows us to go back and re-read like the story of Cain and Abel and to see God's offer was really genuine can yeah if you do good there's exaltation for you to like my choice of Abel doesn't exclude you in the long run but it doesn't force you to make a choice in the present of if you're going to trust me and he doesn't trust and it leads to murder. So it's like the Jesus fulfillment of all of these Cycles really tells the truth about book on this up to all along which was to choose the one for the sake of the many
 okay and we didn't talk about suffering but that's a whole nother thing yeah how does this connect to suffering then this is all be about like wow Victory Paradise a new creation the moment the stone rolled away from the Tim story has that God really has launched the new creation through the birth of the new Humanity created the family of the firstborn but the way that's going to be realized in reality it's going to be through a continual process that's like the playing out of the process that led up to the arrival of the first part which is every generation having to choose to trust and endure life outside of Eden as we wait for the reunions of Heaven and Earth and to go through the past and yeah the ghost version of what
 that's real and so on or what Jesus went through so let's landed here I mean there's more we could do throughout the New Testament we could session this in Hebrews you can session in the Revelation you can session this then the letters are Jon will the one passage we didn't go to which we landed in the script as we wrote the script because we've actually already finished this was the poem in flip Ian's where Paul appeals to be to live this out in the way that Jesus lived out his power of the first born he says have this mindset among yourselves that was also the mindset of Messiah Jesus
 yeah and what is that mindset the whole point of the poem he says was even though he was what he says as he was in his nature Divine God
 he was the first one truly but he didn't regard that status as something to be used or grabbed and exploited for his own Advantage rather he emptied himself of that status by going to the bottom and dying as a slave on behalf of others so that they can have his license. Love and status as the firstborn so we're back to that upside down the way God uses his status and privilege it is to divest itself of the scrimmages to bring others up at 8 that the Paul's calling us to is to accept the status with Jesus as now part of the family the first born but to then not let that become a way for us to try to yeah just have power yet and protect ourselves
 but to then serve others the way Jesus served others out with examples when he says it's like Timothy who's you know you're a church leader with you and you know what he never prioritizes his own interest
 he prioritizes the interests of others and of Jesus it looks like a Packard itis who endured sickness and almost death to try and keep our communication between us through letters and that you could send me guess while I'm in prison he says it looks like those two women that he mentioned in chapter 4 you rodia and soon 2K it means like they really need to settle their conflict and learn how to get along in their house to help these women work out whatever difference they have it becomes really practical real quick which is the whole point of course the whole point well so that's where we end is this idea of being invited into the family of the firstborn the reboot of humanity
 to actually rule and guide the path which is going to look like serving and is going to come with suffering and hardship and potentially death mean when he wrote that poem in Philippians 2 he was imprisoned not sure if he would live to see another week yeah man this has been a wonderful conversation and Survey of this damn I'm feeling so many things right now we're both like left brand so like yeah yeah like I think that's what's supposed to happen but at the same time
 I'm stinging about all these people and situations in my life where I need I really need to live as if this is true well thank you John yeah thanks Tim I'm really excited about the video like real time you know we are watching this video in production actually in real time at the point this conversation without the video should be in the world you have already seen the video to this conversation the visual language that the artist we're working with came up with to like communicate the high and the low and status and this inversion of authority in value that happens it's really cool I'm really excited for this video to try and bundle all of this since you know a five-minute complainer
 we're planning on doing a Q and R that should be coming out soon and then we'll turn our attention to something new for pain along next to him yeah thank you John thank you everybody for your enthusiasm and support for what we're done
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're starting a new series exploring a thing called the anointed which might not sound like an obvious being to choose the first but it's the title most commonly applied to Jesus in the New Testament the anointed one it's a Greek word Creole which when you talk about a person who has been poured or smeared with oil the title of that figure is increased just the title and that is a Jewish Greek way of describing in ancient Israelite practice of pouring oil on certain people and places and the Hebrew word for that it's my shock and what you call someone who's had oil smeared report over them is my GI which we get the word Messiah today's episode is brought to you by our podcast team with a producer Cooper Health associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor Dan Campbell and editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey also makes the episode and Hannah Who provided the annotations for the annotated podcast
