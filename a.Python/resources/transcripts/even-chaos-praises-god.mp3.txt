it is a Jonah Bible project next week we're going to continue our episodes on the ancient cosmology Series be released a new video in our visual Commentary series videos on Psalm 148 and so this week we're going to release a discussion on Psalm 148 with Tim and krissia the Book of Psalms has 150 lb or what we call Salt in the last five of these together are called the helela Psalms short for Hallelujah songs because all five of these begin and end with the same refrain praise Allah that is praise Yahweh or in Hebrew Hallelujah sounds familiar right now right in the middle of these last five hilal Psalms is Psalm 148 really tightly structured it begins and ends with Hallelujah so it has this includes Geo and then it's
 going up into two parts focusing on the skies in the first half and the land in the second half as guards in the way of in the beginning God created the skies in the way of it so Psalm 148 is really inviting the entire Cosmos to praise God it is a cosmic praise song a praise song reveling in the creative work of God and both spaces and their inhabitants or their creatures are mentioned so this is exactly what happens in Genesis 1 and the words that are used here are recalling specific days from Genesis 1 Psalm 148 has all the cosmic features of the sky praising God the angels and Heavenly Host then that kind of you know make sense you can picture angels praising God but then the song goes on to have the cosmic creatures of the land the great sea creatures of the depth and the cosmic forces of lightning hail and snow and throw me win having
 all of these praise Yahweh as well but what does that mean are the forces specifically of decreation and we're in this creation narrative World talking about the skies in the land and these are the ones that might be a threat to that order the wildest craziest most chaotic thing we see or experience if we look up there's a thunder and lightning storm in the sky that Yahweh is the creator above that and that even that has a lesser power than he does as the Creator the full moons with one final reason why people should praise Yahweh and the reason that he has raised up for his people a horn what is this horn All About is an image of an ox's or a bull's horn lifted in Victory after a battle all of this and More in today's discussion on Psalm 148 thanks for joining us here we go
we've been doing a new type of video called visual commentary where we can look at a portion of scripture in a video which is really cool and today we're going to be preparing for one of those videos and we'll be looking at Psalm 148 and we have a Tim Mackie item and also today we get to have Krista Quinn as well because of you did this research and then they're going to be running the scripture Psalm 148 so walk us through this song okay so I'm writing on Psalm 148 I've been studying through it reading through it and Hebrew Tim and I went through it last week and Hebrew and just looked at what stood out in the structure and as I'm writing I'm just thinking about what stands out the most in the song what is most important what's interesting about it so there's two things that stand out to me as far as helping us understand what the song is all about
 the first one is where the song occurs in the context of the whole Salter so I can talk a little bit about that but then a second thing is this horn and at the end of Psalm 148 the reason for praise is given as he's lifted up the Horn of his people the praise of all his loyal ones and so I figured this is probably the most interesting place to start a script or video because it's the Horan what's the deal with the horn you know it's kind of a mysterious image your main our research so far in Hebrew Bible has been in the Book of Psalms was about a section and you contributed to a whole a growing movement say within the last few decades about Scholars paying attention to the organization and ordering of the song that's being just as significant for a Psalms meaning as the actual song itself so that's something
 you're into that's where I'm coming from so maybe you want to unpack that more just as a big picture cuz for maybe a lot of people the songs with more like a hymnbook totally like a well-ordered progression of of Palms both in the academy among Scholars and on the church level and as individuals we tend to be most familiar with reading the Psalms as isolated units so I might open the songs and read Psalm 89 or some 15 just as the unit itself and that's great we can totally read psalms as isolated units and learn a lot about them but scholars in my field my Fields called shape of the psalter study so its shape of the book of Psalms as a whole we've been saying that the Psalms are actually arranged to tell a story and some of the markers that Scholars see for the Book of Psalms being arranged as a story are it has an introduction and a conclusion and it has five bucks
 set each end with this repeated phrase praise Yahweh amen and amen or praise Yahweh forever and then individual songs are connected by all of these links words and phrases and so on and there are chiasm and all sorts of repeating structure so scholars in my field are saying that the Psalms are intentionally arranged and then the question is what story do they tell her what's the purpose of this design so Psalm 148 comes at the very end of a five-song conclusion 5 songs of the whole Salter make a five-part conclusion Phillips in these little star via universes but I still remember being in one of my early classes at Multnomah and bible college and hearing the word Salter
 guess I could name you to refer to the Book of Psalms here but ever since the first time I heard it I just thought of a big salt shaker Belhurst I heard it in a class lecture and I was like a Salter why is he calling the book of Psalms assaulted but it's a PS starts with p s the psalter so I stopped using that we're all on board now Book of Psalms then and there are five bucks with in the Book of Psalms and then their individual songs of salt is it's the way you started calling in the series books and Scrolls and the scroll of Psalms which is it which is weird sounds
 better assess is kind of hard to say I'll do it maybe we should have you do a reading of this song so we can all get on the same page and then we can talk about where it fits in the softball
Psalm 148 a reading dr. praise yah that's the shortened form for Yahweh it's hallelujah praise ye praise ye away from the skies Praise Him in the Heights praise him all his Messengers praise him all his hosts Praise Him sun and moon Praise Him stars of light Praise Him Skies of skies and the waters that are above the skies let them praise the name of Yahweh for he has commanded and they were created and he has established them forever and ever and decree he gave and it will not pass praise Yahweh from the land sea monsters and the deep fryer and hail snow and smoke stormy wind doing his word
 mountains and all hell's fruit trees and all theaters wild animals and all cattle creeping things & Wings Birds Kings of the land and all people princess and all judges of the land young men and also young women Elders with children let them praise the name of Yahweh for exalted is his name alone his majesty above the land and Sky's he has lifted up the Horn of his people the praise of all his loyal ones of Israel a people near to him praise yeah so is hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise ye the summons to a group of people that they should offer praises to our so am I translation this is a Hallelujah
 I say we praise the Lord English translations underneath all that just for like I wonder if spelling Hallelujah well I've got the King James 1900 North the original 1611 King James does hallelujah just spelled the Hebrew word with English letters I'm going to look up started somewhere but that's cool no Hallelujah and you said that this is part of a five-part collection at the very end it's called the final Hollow or the final praise and it's called that because each of these five songs starts with a and ends with Hallelujah so they're grouped together as this final section of praise
 interesting I'm actually member one of my Hebrew Bible profs missing about Hallelujah in English when you say hallelujah if there's a song that says hallelujah like you're saying the Hebrew for asking some of the praise God in English the word hallelujah has become depressed becomes the prey is going to say to the lawyer and write praising the Lord in Hebrew Hallelujah is actually summoning somebody other than you some other group that they should praise the Lord will how do you praise the Lord not by saying hallelujah but by singing the song we're telling the story of The Exodus the call to praise in Hebrew has become the content of the prison in English and the King James 1611 I looked it up translate Hallelujah as praise ye the Lord hallelujah you still get the year you know that praise the Lord
 is he the Lord and of course wants to see the Lord that straight from the King James 1611 to know that crazy in the Lord which is the translation of the phrase Hallelujah but in that song Hallelujah has become the way to print song is a call to praise and then what follows is the praise or I guess in this case though the calls yeah the whole thing is a call to praise us so praise yeah it's just the introduction to what the whole song is about because then yeah all creation is called to price one by one so I wasn't sure whether to start with the horn or the story of the Psalms both here and in the script you know what strikes me actually is is a place to start is dias's a pretty simple song to fall out
 play Psalm in August that took a couple of Corners that I wasn't following but I got through it this one it's like a cool praise Yahweh from the skies and then here's a list of a bunch of Sky stuff and then a little aside about that and then praise Yahweh from the land here is a bunch of land stuff and then in a side room simple because he's like the simplest visual commentary will have to write structure structure has a lot of cool stuff to pull out of that but just to kind of just did a thousand of you we've got two parts praise Yahweh from the skies and he's all the heavenly host from the land and I'm just to Bible reader now fixed you guys and this is about creation in Genesis 1 and God creating Scott sandland so that seems really straightforward what I noticed in your notes as you take us back when you go how does this fit into the entire collection of songs
 go there because now we've got we got the song we get it we know what it's about before we get into the weeds of the song that's Orient ourselves at the whole book of Psalms one is just how does this Psalm 148 fit in the story line but the second one is in particular what is the horn about in does looking at the whole story help us understand what the Hornets how does it look kind of mystery at the end for you you lifted up the Horn of his people what was that all about of the reason for praise there are two sections of the reason yeah and the first section follows the skies to the skies praise let them pray is because you always be exalted Creator really he's the king and there's a section with the land prey's and let them praise he is exalted as a Creator and he's raised up a horn significant piece it's in the reason
 reasons given by having a nurse and everything in it praise Yahweh there two reasons given one after the sky praise and then one reason is given after the land prey's and that reason for the land phrase has to do with this horn the Horn of his people and means nothing probably the most people have it to me it strikes a little bit of a sense of oil for that before I haven't gone to church the whole point of Salvation by blush blush what's the horn come from there you want to start with the story of his fits in I think if we start with a horn that can take us right into the song to figure
 so at the most basic level erased Hornet I did a word study on our phrase study on Ray's Hornets two words together through exalted and then Karen is the word for horn horn in Hebrew and at the most basic level or raised horn is is an image of an ox's or a bull's horn lifted in Victory after a battle for his heart it's yeah after a battle that's probably all bloody battle in you lift up the Horn of an animal in Victory the animal itself lifting a torn right after it wins a battle just trampled or gored something and then list its horns super high in the air the song that that is just using that very literal sense Psalms 92:10 says you have exulted my horn like that of a wild ox so it is
 it was like the ox is like a proud horn that he raises his head horny blow for battle or they can be the same way and it's the same ones that are in the corner of the alter Victorious ox horn where we get the like imagery of the horns in Nebuchadnezzar's dream I just doesn't know the word this Hebrew word for horn Karen is not the common Hebrew word for trumpet or horn. I didn't know that I just looked up while you were talking the dictionary
 checkers one time in the Book of Joshua has a musical horn exactly every other time it's an animal's heart rate the horn here in Psalm 148 correct is a Karen called Karen and then it only shows up one of their time only used out of the just look it's used 75 times in the Hebrew Bible only one of those times does it refer to the musical horn horn the AC so every other time it refers to an animal an animal horn or something that looks like an animal or a metaphorical horn yeah like the song says he has a horn correct right so I think that's probably the way it gets used the most when it's applied to people it means Victory and in particular it means god bringing Victory to the person especially for The Afflicted and the oppressed and that's how you see it in the Psalms so a lot of times when we do word or phrase studies we look at the near
 places that that word or phrase is used so the nearest place to Psalm 148 that this exalted horn is used is Psalm 89 and their the horn it's the Horn of the people that exalted in Victory so it's just like in Psalm 148 the Horn of the people and the reason given in Psalm 89 is because the Kings horn is exalted in Victory so there's this really close relationship between the victory of the king and then the victory of the people I think what we see is that throughout the songs it's a symbol of victory for a person usually God bringing the victory when it's a human bring in their own victory at sometimes called boastful or arrogantly in Psalm 75 if you haven't been usually it's God who does the exulting of the horn and if God isn't the one who's exalting the Horn of the person by bringing in Victory then it's it seems like an arrogant thing which might be what's happening in Daniel
 sure that the Horn of the Super Mutant beasts Daniel cuz it has a mouth the horn has a mouse speaking Eric a thing so yeah another second significant passage that I was looking out for the horn was 1st Samuel 1 and 2 where Hannah sings her song about the horn because she uses to she is afraid she is raising the horn here twice so Hannah she's bullied for not being able to have a child and then when she finally gives birth to a son so she's Afflicted and then when she finally does give birth she sings about how God has raised up her horn over her enemies so she's become Victorious the wife was bullying her so she was afflicted but now is praising God for his Deliverance saying he has exalted my horn and then at the end of her songs she says that God will also raise up the horn
 what is Messiah his King and he will be victorious over the oppressors of his people so she's talking about this Victorious King to come so Victory and you can do this in a boastful way kind of like just kind of hot on your own power raising your own horn the horn which in in the context of Hannah was about someone who was being oppressed being dignified was pregnant and gives birth to a son that's her horn being lifted High yeah and then that son becomes an interesting connection already that's happening with Hannah where the horn is being connected to Deliverance of the people and that's coming through a king a specific person
 so she says at the end of her song so I think the horn can mean an ox's horn it can broadly mean Victory or it can mean specifically Victory through the Messiah King word study yeah yeah yeah so the question is then the horn and Psalm 148 what's that referring to is God providing to and who's one of the raising up here he hasn't lifted up a horn for his people or it could be translated he is lifted up the Horn of his people to question is is it Israel Soren or is the horn referred to somebody else who's raising up will benefit the people of this and whether it says realtor in or somebody who will benefit is real is that person the King has been lifted up Godless up the horn
 is it the Horn of the people or is it the horn for the people and it is someone else's phone and if it's Israel's horn all we're talking about is Israel victory yeah so is God providing victory for Israel yes God is lifting up someone else's horn for Israel then the idea is what who is the horn what is the horn yes but before we even have to talk more about that distinction I did a little words study on the horn and when it occurs with a person and whether it's for that person or of that person so yeah and every time that I found it it's the Horn of the person so I think the best translation is the Horn of Israel so when Hannah pray and she says my horn is exalted at the end of her prayer she says he will give strength to his King and will exalt the Horn of his anointed so she's not saying hello exalt the horn
 for his anointed but it's the Horn of his anointed and then same with Psalms 75 do not lift up your horn on high the horns of the wicked forces the horns of the righteous so I think the best translation is of so that means at the end of Psalm 148 it should be he has lifted up the Horn of his people for the question still is what does that mean if it's it's somehow victory for his people but what does it mean to exalt their horn what's success for this meeting so I think that actually gets us into the story of the songs because that's the context that there and that's defining the kind of Victory they're looking for
so we meet the Victorious King actually in Psalm to an introduction of the songs to the songs begin with this two-part introduction songs 1 and 2 and the first song is describing this blessing for those who follow Yahweh and there's this picture of an ideal creation I think the author's recalling the Genesis 1 narrative hear God's ideal the garden and flourishing for those who follow Yahweh and then the second so I'm revealed how this idea we'll come about and it's through this Victorious King Messiah so this description in some to has really strong verbal and thematic links with 2nd Samuel 7 I promise that God made to King David that one of his descendants would Reign on the throne forever and establish God's kingdom forever you'd be like a son to God and then some to says this king is like a son he's the Messiah will be victorious over the powerful rulers that Senator against you always say this is this is the same key
 that Hannah was talking about the Victorious King to come so the book The we called 1st and 2nd Samuel 1 book in the Hebrew Bible the introductory story is about this woman Hannah who herself has her horn exalted by going from infertile to fertile and shamed to a place of honor and what she says in her Palm is what just happened to me is going to be repeated in the story you're about to read as God raises up the Horn of an anointed king and sweep that set you up as a reader to be like oh I'm looking for a king the God is going to vindicate from some sort of low stayed up till like a king who brings victory for a story about Saul and that definitely doesn't happen to him falls from a high place and then you read the story of David so I'm just kind of trying to link their so David becomes the anointed king whose horn is exalted that Hannah spoke about and his story is set
 analogy to hers because her poem says my horn was a closet you always going to exalt somebody else's horn in the story about to read of the king to read David story and David goes from low to high and then his David tight God makes his promise of one of your descendants will come and I'll make give him an eternal Kingdom and that's who were introduced to and saw two and this is who you're dishing up for us and some to doesn't identify as a superscript so that this introductory title that says it doesn't actually Psalms 1 and 2 don't have a title but book one of the Psalms say these are Psalms of David so we have it the davidic figure in mind when we're reading it but it's really just a description of this Messiah King in Psalm to that matches the description of the davidic king in the promise that God made to David so what's interesting about the story of the Psalms is that it traces the story of the Kingdom
 of Israel and if you always came to him so it traces the rise of the Kingdom the fall of the kingdom and then renewed trust in your way and re-establishment of the Kingdom so book one of The psalter this is Psalms 1341 this is the rise of the Kingdom so it's where God rescues David from his Affliction there are a lot of laments in the section of the Psalms and God raised him up as king then books two and three of the Kingdom Falls to enemy Nations and the people are left without a king and without a home there are going into Exile so this section at the end of book 3 Psalms 88 and 89 are some of the darkest Psalms in the sulter and we've talked about that before I think I have heard you guys talk about the structure of the Psalms in the books but let me ask question when you say like book one is about the what do you say the rise of
 it's not like it's a story right here's the rise of the Kingdom so in what way is it about the rise of the ocean it is United by this emphasis this focus on David the king and then it's also there are these collections that stand at least significant structural points and book one that are emphasizing the kingdom of Yahweh being established through his righteous King so so I'm 15 to 24 this is the section that I worked on for my dissertation it's right in the middle of book one and right at the center of that collection at yahweh's King is delivered and Victorious and successful see you see that as the emphasis of that section that the human King being exalted and being raised up metaphor is it it's less like a narrative the way you might write a linear narrative and more like a symphony exactly two of the most difficult books but it sounds wanted to give you
 the opening theme of the we're shooting for a to spread the Eden the wife and blessing of Eden through the arrival in the hope of the king who will bring God's kingdom of all the nations and then you're going to just cycle through those themes with little individual songs that start sticking together a little subgroups of Psalms and that the other bikie repeated word and I'll send you be like all these three Psalms keep repeating this idea and then you'd read the next group and then all the sudden you're replying over and over again with new variations that the melody that's what that's what you're saying in maybe another helpful way to think about it is when I say the Psalms are a story I don't mean their narrative but they are the prayers of the people when they're going through these things for the prayers of the king that become the prayers of the people as they're experiencing the store has a reflecting on this event
 any of the people places or things are in these poems is because in theory you have read The Narrative from Genesis just have a little less when he did that sending your mind you're supposed to go back to the story it's a symphony anchored in the movie completely clear straightforward but it's something that I think as you read the Psalms is a hole over and over maybe it becomes more and more clear so because some Psalms in book one are lemons and they sound the same as some of the women's handbook 2 or 3 so I think it's zooming out to this this overarching narrative that gives us that big framework and then we can reread the songs within that framework so here's a clear marker those Psalm 89 88 and 89 at the end of book 3 they are Psalms 88 is just this deep lament with no hope or no
 confidence and it's a lemon over the the lack of God's faithfulness for the people and Psalm 89 is the same it's saying you made this promise to David but it doesn't look like you're being faithful to your promise so when we read that we can see clearly something's happening to the davidic king in this moment and the people are lamenting it there lamenting God's seeming lack of faithfulness the Exile is a marker where you're saying Psalm 89 talks about the collapse of the line of David and fall of the Kingdom book one about the establishment of Kingdom Book 2 and 3 are both about the fall of the Kingdom book 4 and 5 and in books 1 through 3 there's this really strong contrast between what we saw an introduction this Garden like I deal people being blessed and the Messianic King whose ruling and then the limits of the people and they're still looks
 I think hope and not ideal but I think that's attention you feel when you're reading the Psalms when you get to book for after the collapse of the Kingdom what's really interesting is booked for starts with a Psalm of Moses and it's the only song that's titled that way so I'm going to some 90s and I think the point is that Israel they're realizing that God Yahweh he was our King even before we had a human King before we had David he was King and a Psalm of Moses reminds them of that that you always King and there's a huge section there so I'm 90 included that is all about Yahweh has King so there's this renewal of trust and in yahweh's the king but not just that as you get into book 5 there's also this re-establishment of the davidic king so then you have both celebration of Yahweh as king and of his faithfulness to his promise to restore his davidic King so that's the overarching story of The Book of Psalms and that story is important to a concert
 where do you stay at in because we're talking about the horn what's the victory that he's giving Israel overcome and and if we've read the whole narrative problems really clear god dammit Kevin it to Abraham who became Israel who now Bears this Covenant and they can't do it and became focused in on the king in the line of David they ask for a king and you get David and David this figure who actually does it in a way that he unites the kingdom everything's looking awesome but then the kingdom Falls his grandkids around everything is ruined everything and then there's Exile and then there's this prophetic hope of re-establishing trust in your way and for a new thing to happen in Israel that's the story and that's exactly how the book of Psalms Psalms grow strip
 through that story is interesting because it really is the story of the entire Hebrew Bible that Nautilus give Israel Victorious King that so this is where you at when we come back to the horn and Psalm 148 should we just look through some 148 even in more detail at this point I'd like to but we got the big picture individual song and get it on a first reading but then you'll notice puzzles interesting things in one place to go to ask what's this thing about in this particular song is to see where it fits into the hole so you just did like the whole whole but I think we're going with this is once you get with the whole book of Psalms about the fact that there be this little puzzle at the end of the third to the last time that the whole book of Psalms can actually give us some leverage on how to understand
 at the Hornets what the horn is
 so back to this final Halal this final praise this is the conclusion of the whole book of Psalms the whole Salter Psalms 146 to 150 and Psalm 148 is right in the center of this final praise and it's a call for all creation to praise Yahweh and now we we understand why because they have this renewed hope and Yahweh the king and in the human came to this makes sense if we just understand if we just read or we understand the story of the psalter so Psalm 48 we've looked at the structure a little bit it's really tightly structured it begins and ends with Hallelujah so it has this includes Theo and then it's broken up into two parts focusing on the skies in the first half and the land in the second half and the first half 11 Indian God created this is a part of five Hollows at the end of the
 story of our the whole scroll that's telling the story and right in the center of those five and Evelyn contention to centers is this song and the song is so tightly organized to Genesis 1:1 of God the Creator everything and so like right in the center of praising God is this very persuasive very almost extremely like on the nose like this is why we're talking about creation because God or real-world it's such a big thing it refers back to the structure of Genesis 1 even is pretty cool so I'll show you what I'm thinking here we start with the skies praising from the skies and both spaces and their inhabitants or their creatures are mentioned so this is exactly what happens in
 this one and the words that are used here are recalling specific days from Genesis 1 day is 12 and 4 of The Genesis story so the word light is used from day one the words skies and Waters above are used from day two and then sun moon and stars from day for and that's the section from Genesis one that's talking about the skies or the heavens are and what's interesting is we're going to see the rest of those days filled in when the poem talks about the land is just such an interesting recall at the Genesis one structure I always have to kind of we are in myself we're not just talking about plasma balls in the sky like there's this sense of these are The Two Hosts yeah this all makes it really clear actually that there's a parallel relationship between these words because after the skies are called to praise these are the creatures that are
 the praise their his angels or his Messengers and then his hosts which are also called the sun moon and stars of light so see this relationship between those two elements of those two creatures so I guess flag back to podcast we didn't bring up Psalm 148 and those discussions know but here it is but now it is it's also reflecting the this view of the starry Host this guy he's not just thinking about just what I do when I like look at the nice guy and I just think of the vastness of the universe and I feel small there's a different sense of looking up at it and and see in the spiritual realm on display the Heavenly hosts and so here he is in like let's get this guy and just be like overwhelmed by the size of the universe it's so let's
 let's actually asked what's tell the creatures up there to praise Yahweh to print their maker maker creator yeah that's a good price I find that really interesting yeah that's real that you always created weather and space itself out and there's a side here after after all those people in the skies all the creatures in the skies let them praise the name of y'all waited for you commanded and they were created and he established them forever and ever at the creek he gave and it will not pass this is the reason for the skies to praise and it's all about Yahweh as the ruling creator
 King Landing says something do this it gets done that's y'all way and what does it mean that he established the skies in the house forever and ever yeah it seems like that's talking about stability and also maybe recalling even some of the covenants that he's made that will last forever but just the stability of yahweh's creation of his decrees what do you think the other that phrase he established a decree will not pass away that same little line is used in two other times in the Hebrew Bible one of its just to talk about the boundary of the Dryland don't have the sea doesn't cross it so enjoy and Proverbs 8 God talks about making a decree that the Dryland there's a line at the crease the word that we don't use anymore but it's just something you say
 where did the word for law so the creation obeys God's laws and ironically that language is still adopted into a course of the laws of nature of the law of thermodynamics it's a pattern that work in the creation that so reliable you can infer there must be someone who intended it to be that way. That's the mindset so the forever and ever is about it's so why did but they all the same path all the time they never deviate except for a few planets which is the Greek word for AJ like they're all over the place so the stars in this reliable course that you can tell the seasons by the other than their own synchronized dance
 published and they just they don't deviate their following orders that's the name of the following the orders of their maker and so that's why there's some in the price such a cool way to imagine the skies yeah like a big army that follows orders exactly all the time that's why the sky is in the sky creatures
Play Angels
 Praise Him
yeah and this section mirrors the call for all us guys to praise and that that same line is echoed praise Yahweh from the and now it's the land this is again I'm thinking about movement and I don't know if this is how you guys are thinking that's too but I think it's the outer limits of the Earthly realm that our first called the price you have the deepest depths and the highest Heights of the land so these are the sea monsters and the D or Tuesday yeah he doesn't start like because when the trees he goes down in slike let's check out the CMOS resource to the highest part of the Earthly realm so the the fire the hell the snow and smoke and stormy wind is that would be I'm in Salt Lake campfires drop out of the sky
 hello and these are these are the things in the land call at the praise God intends things why is it called them to praise Yahweh I think the point is that Yahweh is King over at all so these are the forces specifically of decreation and we're in this creation narrative World talking about the skies in the land and these are the ones that might be a threat to that order we're talking a lot about order in this home and so the point is that y'all way he's the king over at all and they praise hymns are called to price him similar mindset of the the gods peaches in the Book of Job Leviathan and Behemoth rip your hand off and that doesn't mean they're evil they may D create but God has ultimate control over them and he set boundaries around them
 think of it as chaos and big problems even those things are subservient subservient to in the way that the Angels Above are moving in order there is an order to what to me feels like just in chaos Thunder and hail and is that the point like there is God has it under control and some head in order to our years of consultations on Genesis the way Jen's one begins with non ordered realm images Darkness ocean water and the Wilderness and so those are not created Goods creation meaning something that's ordered and given a purpose for flourishing life so these things are anti that sends their purpose is to deconstruct that's right however on day one God doesn't eliminate the darkness he permeates the cosmos
 light and he contains the darkness and makes it now serve okay. Same way that when he sets the boundary give the the Sea and the land he lets the sea creature the crazy sea creature exists now what does it mean that they praise Yahweh so connect that real quick yeah it seems like it means that the wildest craziest most chaotic thing we see or experience if we look up there's a thunder and lightning storm in the sky that Yahweh is the creator above that and that even that has a lesser power than he does as the Creator yeah you could go to directions here and actually in history of Christian theology this is where the fork in the road moment cuz to say that chaos and creation things are subservient to Yahweh you could take that to me
 and their subservient to them and they do his will which is actually what but it says it's right at the end they do his wealth so does that mean that forces of death and anti creation are actually ultimately a part of God's Will and so you'll get done the road of real fire and hail snow and smoke wind of a storm doing his word or term is deterministic heavy on God's Sovereign Rule and we'll ordering all things big and small sets One Direction you could go and many Traditions go that way another tradition or Direction you could say is simply that they are of lesser power and rank and Status so they have to give honor to the one who is above them and I have to call the phrase means and it means the evil can't for the purposes of God but that doesn't mean that
 add Wills is not orchestrating all their whatever you need everything that destroys people that there is there is an idea in Genesis one that their powers contained their powers contained and it's s in s resin abolished still exist and they can still reek Havoc but they're still so ultimately served subservience running is helpful here is that the reason for praise is given in verse 13 so if you imagine there's a call to praise to these creatures of chaos or his forces of chaos and then the reason later on is for exalted is yahweh's name alone his majesty above the land and the sky's so it really is about him being exalted as the king over all of these forces even if even if they're against his will praise him because he's over them
 yeah that's the kind of really addresses yeah and you that he's lifted up the horn which that's that's interesting to that all creation is looking to this horn and praising horn but there's nothing on the land creatures are they so we start at those outer limits of the land creation and then we move inward to the actual and the mountains the hills the fruit trees and the Cedars and that recall some of the Genesis narrative there with the word fruit trees or the phrase fruit trees that's interesting and then we move even and hills and fruit trees and Tiaras you praise Yahweh the spaces of the land just like where the space isn't the skies and then we zoom in even closer to the land's inhabitants they imagine that I mean that the hill is crazy there are a lot of songs that have creation praising Yahweh in it is an interesting image
 doing their thing they do their thing if you don't have to tell it you don't have to come and it praise Yahweh that way it just does so like when they're actually like looking at the hill and saying you help raise your way there just like saying hey. Keep doing your thing yeah yeah yeah it's a way of imagining that you are alongside the hill as a choir is going to sing the Praises of the Creator so your song sounds your way in the Hills song found its way in the unity of all creation toward its purpose you know if all creation is almost like a hyperbole it's an exaggeration of growing grass and inhabitants we see the animals and the humans and what stands out here is the description of the humans because it takes up the most space and it's really inclusive so this is in versus
 11 and 12 you have Kings of the land and All Peoples so this means all the nations and their peoples princes and all judges of the land young men and also young women Elders with children and a lot of times in Hebrew poetry you know you see these pairs of things Elders with children and it's it's called a marathon and that idea is it's not just old people and young people it's everybody in between two so yeah this description exactly everybody on myself in this exactly why I didn't think about this when we worked on this earlier Crystal but looking at verse 11 and 12 you almost go from the highest-ranked to the lowest rank Kings Prince's two judges like for tribal leaders then to you know healthy still healthy strong and young people and then too
 at least physically strong members the elderly and children appears to be the most powerful and influential to the least this part of the song has like three like little Moon and all the crazies and then the creature itself as the trees oh and then creature and then the land creatures starting with the animals knees are straight out of Genesis 14 humans rule over and then this list that we went through it's a three-part list and the third part has three parts yeah they sure do something about this list here is again it's recalling vocabulary from Genesis one but nowadays 35 + 603
 is that we haven't seen words from yet in the poem so the land in the trees are from day three the fish and the birds or the sea monsters are from day 5 and then the animals oh no this isn't sea monster this is fish and the winged birds from day 5 and then the animals and humans from day6 so the point is that all that Yahweh has created is invited. So yeah it's a very tight structure and begins with praise Yahweh or praise yah Hallelujah and ends with Hallelujah and then in the middle Praise Him from the skies with a reason Praise Him from the land and a reason and then this reason part we get to the reason the horn he is going to bring victory for Israel and we've gone through the whole Narrative of the Psalms then this is the point where they've gone to the deepest Abyss Exile coming out in this restored hope for Galloway and he
 is this this hope that they're exclaiming which is like we we will be victorious think about the whole story of the Psalms it's a story that begins in the hope of an ideal davidic King to come and then it traces the rise and fall of that Kingdom and then ends with a renewed hope that God will still fulfill his promises and so this song right at the end I think it's confirming that God will raise up his mess and it came from Psalm to so it's this as a conclusion it's recalling the introduction of the Psalms so he will bring victory for the oppressed he will raise up the Horn of his people so it's a little bit different than somebody would say it was a horn is a Messianic King what you're saying is it's the one of those people that's a common metaphor for God granting Victory is a victory Israel defeated by Babylon in Persia now and so on so on
 Psalms what does it look like for God to raise up the Horn of his people well that's the macro story about everything up of the Messianic cuz there are some Scholars who will say that that the translation should be lifted up a horn for his people and the horn is the Messianic King you are one of such Scholars totally but I think you've persuaded me about the metaphor that it works slightly differently than I thought lately difference what I think I think you would still say lift up the Horn of his people in other words he will lift up his Messianic King so think you can still make that really direct connection because of the story of the songs is just going through the whole storyline yes so it's for this reason that all creation the skies the Earth from the highest to the lowest is called to praise Yahweh Cosmos is called to pray
 is the creator because he made promises to a small ancient near Eastern people group on the Eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea and raised up a man to become king for them yeah I'm going to get it done before their enemies pretty Bible in this song Praise Yahweh because he's made a comment he made me made everything and part of him being exalted Creator is a second reason to praise Yahweh that he will raise up this Middle Eastern now if the created order creating everything and also raising up a king are really related and I'm wondering that in light of Psalms one and two Bean
 added together someone being about this ideal blessed nest of those who follow Yahweh and they're like trees are like Garden like people who are flourishing there everything that they're supposed to be but then the way this comes about is through the ideal King who restores creation to what it's supposed to be so here in the song that's like I don't know is this is this horn this ideal King the one who restores the order of all creation you could even go one step back to the logic of Genesis 1 is that all of creation is ordered towards the climax of day6 which is humans images of God Rule Rule and and if we fast-forward it when we talk about this King being Jesus who is the image of God is the one who a trend not only is the king of Israel but then the king of the cosmos, representing what humans are meant to be
 so creation and the kingly ruler are two things that are tied together a lot
