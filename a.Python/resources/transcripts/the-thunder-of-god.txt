 The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Hi, this is Jon at The Bible Project. Today on the podcast, we have a conversation 
about biblical poetry. Did  you know that one out of three pages in your Bible are 
poetry? Specifically,  ancient Hebrew poetry, it's all over the place. That's why in this 
podcast episode, we're going to talk about appreciating the art of biblical poetry.  
To do that, we're going to  spend a lot of time today reading Psalm 29. So if you 
have the option, I'd recommend that you pull that Psalm up on your phone or turn 
to it in your Bible. It'd be nice to follow along. If you're driving or something, just 
take it all in. So in the spirit  of poetry, let me offer you a poem. Roses are red, violets 
are blue. Poem spark, the imagination.  
Tim: That's what poetry is meant to do.  
Jon: Thanks for joining us. Here we go.  
We're in a series on how to read the Bible, and we've done like eight vide os so far. 
We finished off Narrative and we're going into poetry, which is a large part of the 
Bible. A lot of poetry in the Bible.  
Tim: Yeah, about one -third of the Bible is poetry.  
Jon: That's a lot.  
Tim: It's a significant amount.  
Jon: One out of thr ee verses?  
Tim: One out of three pages.  
Jon: Pages?  
Tim: Pages.  
Jon: That's a lot of poetry.  
Tim: Yeah, it is a lot of poetry, an enormous amount. And it all shares in a part of one 
specific cultural heritage of a way of writing in poetry at the Israel ite Jewish poetry 
tradition.  
Jon: Yeah, it sounds like the Dr. Seuss way of writing poetry.  
Tim: Yeah, that's a whole interesting thing I think we should talk about is that every 
culture has its own categories of what constitutes poetry. And it differs f rom culture The Thunder of God  
 
to culture. That's been actually one of the really interesting things about the history 
of biblical poetry, as it's been studied in the last few hundred years is spent a lot of 
the arguing and debates that scholars love to do is whether it's po etry or not.  
Jon: Whether was in the Bible is poetry?  
Tim: Correct, yeah. Whether it should receive the title "Poetry"? Or how do you tell...  
Jon: I didn't know that was a debate.  
Tim: ...what is poetry versus non -poetry because it's blurry? But what ends  up being the 
case is half the time, it's people really what they're arguing over is their conceptions 
of what makes something poetic. Those are really relative categories because they're 
shaped by wherever you happen to grow up.  
Jon: I do remember when I  was really young, well, maybe in high school or something, 
thinking about what is it that makes something poetry. Because it's all the same 
words, but there is something you can you can tell when something is poetry.  
Tim: Yeah, you can often feel it befo re you can define it or talk it.  
Jon: And it weirded me out that you could take the same words in the same language 
and talk plainly, but then you can also then use it to talk in some fundamentally 
different way. It was always elusive as to how that actual ly came to be.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. There's a whole part of this conversation, especially what this video 
will be about. We going to have two videos planned on reading biblical poetry. The 
first one is just on the artistry of the language of biblical poetry.  
 A lot of these categories won't be unique to Hebrew or Bible poetry. They're kind of 
universal qualities, but each culture puts them into practice in different ways. So it's 
both kind of a universal conversation we're having about what makes some  
language more functional and some language more artistic. What is that?  
 I've at least boiled down to some categories that are helpful for me. Then there are 
some unique things about biblical poetry that once you can see them for what they 
are, they real ly enrich your experience of one -third of the Bible. So I think it's helpful 
too.  
Jon: Cool.  
Tim: I thought we could begin by reading a poem from the book of Psalms, Psalms 29. I 
remember reading this poem for the first time in, I don't know, somewhere in  my The Thunder of God  
 
first year or two, as a follower of Jesus, and I remember just reading the poem, and 
just going, "What? What is going on right now?"  
 Now, I've come to love this poem. It's beautiful. It has going on inside of it all of the 
dynamics that make Hebrew po etry what it is. Do you want to read it? Do you want 
me to read it? Because reading it's half the thing.  
 Also just for the listener on the podcast, this might be a challenging conversation to 
listen to because half of what makes really reflecting on bibl ical poetry is being able 
to see it on a page and ponder it that way, and linger over the words, and read, and 
reread and read slowly.  
Jon: These notes will be in the show notes. If they want, they can — 
Tim: Link to them?  
Jon: No, it's actually in the sho w notes.  
Tim: That's cool. Great. So how about this? Since I've come to love this poem? I would like 
to perform a reading of Psalm 29.  
Jon: Yeah, great. And am I allowed to interrupt or should I just take it in?  
Tim: Just take it in.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: This is an experiment for you and whoever's listening. I'll do a reading, and then I 
want you to reflect on what just happened. I want us to try and give words to what 
just happened, and then the rest of our conversation will be giving form to that 
feeling th at you have.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: One preface to note, and we'll talk about this at length, is that poetry often presses 
words into unusual settings to make them mean more than they would often mean 
in normal speech. There's a Hebrew word that's at the center of this poem gets 
repeated more than any other word. It gets translated in our English translations as 
"voice". It's the Hebrew word "qol".  
 So it's kind of like “Ruach” a nd that “Ruach ” can refer to just invisible energy. So it 
can be impersonal like win d, but it can also be personal like spirit. And we call that 
breath or spirit. In the same way, Hebrew "qol" can be impersonal, in which case — The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: A sound?  
Tim: Yes, it gets translated as sound. Whenever you see the word "sound" in the Bible, 
99%, it's th e word "qol".  When it's a personal qol, it gets translated as voice.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: When it's referring to natural qol, qol that happen in nature —  
Jon: Like the sound of stream or something?  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. And one of the most common ways th at gets used to describe the 
qol of a storm, namely Thunder. There are some rare words for thunder, but the 
most common word for thunder is qol. In my reading of Psalm 29, I'm not going to 
use the English translations. I'm just going to say the word qol. B ut for you to know, 
it's a word that can be used to mean sound, voice, or thunder.  
Jon: So it's thunder, even if it's just...it's not qol of the storm, it's just qol and sometimes it 
means thunder? Tim:  Correct.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: All right. Psalm 29 "Give t o Yahweh, O sons of God, give to Yahweh glory and 
strength. Give to Yahweh the glory due his name; worship Yahweh in the splendor of 
holiness. The qol of Yahweh is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, Yahweh 
thunders over the mighty waters. The qol of Yahweh is powerful; the call of Yahweh 
is majestic. The qol of Yahweh breaks the cedars; Yahweh breaks in pieces the cedars 
of Lebanon. He makes Lebanon leap like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox. The qol of 
Yahweh strikes with flashes of lightning. The qol of Yahweh shakes the desert; 
Yahweh shakes the desert of Kadesh. The qol of Yahweh twists the Oaks, it strips the 
forest bare. And everything in his temple cries out, "Glory!" Yahweh sits in thrown 
over the flood; Yahweh is enthroned as King foreve r. Yahweh gives strength to his 
people; Yahweh bless His people with shalom." With peace. So good.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Psalm 29.  
Jon: Now the word "thunder" is in there, and that's the word "qol" too that you said 
thunder?  
Tim: It's actually the less common  verb. It's a verb for the thunder. To make thunder.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Okay. And it's not qol?  
Tim: It's not qol there. It's actually the word for thunder.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: So if I were to ask you, this just like on an intellectual or rational level, what is this 
poem  about?  
Jon: This poem is about comparing God's power to that of thunder. Yeah?  
Tim: You tell me. Why do you think that?  
Jon: Well, you gave the big hint. I mean, all of the metaphors are you can just imagine 
thunder doing all these things: Breaking cedar s into pieces, making animals jump, 
striking with flashes of lightning.  
Tim: Actually, making mountain ranges jump like animals.  
Jon: That was what it says?  
Tim: Do you set that? He makes Lebanon leap like a calf. It's Sirion is mount Lebanon.  
Jon: And L ebanon is a mountain. It's a hill.  
Tim: Yeah, it's a forest at mountain range. Sirion is Mount Hermon. The tallest mountain 
in the region.  
Jon: Wow.  
Tim: So even more so turns up the volume on that theme.  
Jon: Yeah. Shakes the desert, flashes of lightni ng, twisting oaks, strips the forest bare. I 
mean, yeah, that's all you can just imagine lightning doing everything.  
Tim: Yeah. So at one level, the center of the poem is describing a thunderstorm. A 
thunder and lightning storm. It has flames, shatters tr ees, shoots them apart, makes 
earthquake.  
Jon: It's a good image.  
Tim: Notice the movement of the qol. It begins with over the waters, so it's rolling in off 
the Mediterranean.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: You can see the storm coming.  
Tim: Yeah. So it's a poet sitting up on M ount Carmel or something, where Elijah had the 
showdown with the prophets and he's watching. You can be there and just look at 
the Mediterranean qol and watch the storm come in.  
Jon: To watch the thunder come in.  
Tim: It goes up north Lebanon, then it move s over the hill country south to Kadesh, the 
desert of Kadesh.  
Jon: Where's that?  
Tim: Near the staging area where the spies went to go enter into the land. Kadesh Barnea 
or desert Kadesh. So it moves from North, all way to South. Earthquake blasting 
trees apart. That's the center of the poem is describing a thunderstorm.  
 But every single time the word "qol" appears, it's someone's qol. It's Yahweh's qol. 
So we're equating the power of a thunderstorm with the power of the cloud writer. 
It's creation theo logy. That's what the poet's doing here.  
Jon: You wouldn't know that. Most translations I'm sure just say the voice of the Lord?  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. But you could pick up from the poetry that it's describing a 
thunderstorm.  
Jon: Sure.  
Tim: But yeah , the fact that it's the voice of the Lord instead of the just the sound or the 
thunder. If you're just listening to it, you also can't see...I have highlighted color 
patterns, all the key repeated words. And if you see it, they kind of appear in groups.  
 Note the first four lines had that repetition. "Give to Yahweh" "Give glory" "Give 
glory to His name." So you have a description of a thunderstorm who is being called 
in the opening line to give glory to Yahweh.  
Jon: The sons of God.  
Tim: The sons of God.  
Jon: The angels?  
Tim: Or spiritual being.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Spiritual beings?  
Tim: The sons have Elin or a variation of Elohim. It's actually the subordinate gods who 
are being called to recognize they've been — 
Jon: Lowercase g, gods.  
Tim: Lowercase g, gods.  
Jon: Spiritual beings.  
Tim: Spiritual beings. It's not even a human audience at first that's implied or addressed. 
That's fascinating.  
Yeah.   
Tim: And notice the triple address, "give, give, give," all three in the beginning. You could 
have just said it once, bu t you say it three times.  
Jon: That's a big part of poetry is repetition.  
Tim: Repetition. Yeah, repetition. Notice also there's a word used only in the opening pair 
of lines and in the last pair of lines. I have it in yellow there. It's the word "streng th." 
In the opening lines, the spiritual world is being called to recognize Yahweh is more 
powerful, and to recognize He has strength. Acknowledge that He has strength.  
 Actually, look at these closing lines. "Yahweh sits enthroned over the flood." Why ar e 
we talking about the flood?  
Jon: Yeah, that seemed to jump out of nowhere. But I guess a thunderstorm comes with a 
lot of water.  
Tim: Yes. Look at verse 3, the storm began in the poem over the waters.  
Jon: Yeah. It's like sucking up the waters and bri nging them on the land.  
Tim: Yeah. So if Yahweh's power, if the thunderstorm is this image of the creator's power, 
He's obviously even more powerful. And if it moves over with the chaotic sea, and 
overland, He has power over both. So this final lines are like drawing these 
theological implications of if the storm is powerful overwater and land, how much 
more Yahweh? But it uses the word flood. It uses the precise word that's used in the 
book of Genesis to describe the flood. Now, we're talking about the ch aos waters of 
Genesis 1. So he's King over chaos.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: He's King over chaos.  
Tim: He King, over chaos. That's right. Chaos is powerful, but Yahweh is more powerful. 
He also is enthroned as King. Kings aren't just powerful. They're powerful over a 
people. A nd then that's the next line. "The Lord gives strength to his people."  
 So the opening line is spiritual beings recognizing the strength of Yahweh. But now 
Yahweh's power and strength overall chaotic forces is relevant specifically to the 
people over whic h He rules and Yahweh gives His strength to them. And then the 
last word of the poem is shalom. He blesses them with shalom.  
Jon: And that comes out of nowhere, too, because everything's so chaotic and 
destructive, and unruly. Then the last line is "Blessi ng with shalom.  
Tim: It's calming. It's calming, isn't it? After all, the thunder, He gives strength to His 
people blessing them with shalom, with peace.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Actually, that last line, "the Lord blesses His people with peace" is riffing off o f the 
blessing of Aaron in Number Chapter 6. But "Bay he bless you and keep you, cause 
his face sh ine on you," and then it ends as  "May He give you shalom."  
 Psalm 29, you can dissect it, and it's kind of like killing the butterfly on the 
examination tabl e. But it's worth really reflecting on how it works as a poem. So you 
named repetition and you immediately clued into the imagery. I'm just curious what 
else stood out to you or stands out to you?  
Jon: The whole midsection of this poem is just one metapho r after the next of the voice 
being like thunder in different scenarios. And it's very repetitive. "The voice of the 
Lord is powerful." "The voice of the Lord, majestic." Voice of the Lord, break cedars." 
It's like gets you in a little bit of a trance ther e in a way.  
Tim: Yeah, sure. You're really just thinking about one core thing - the power of a 
thunderstorm.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: The technique is, there are some realities that we encounter, that thinking about 
them from one perspective won't be sufficient.  You need to turn it over and look at 
it again through a different way of talking about it. And then again, and again. I 
mean, how many lines? There's like 16 lines here basically making the same point 
that a thunderstorm is really powerful and that it's Y ahweh's power. So repetition.  The Thunder of God  
 
But it's not just free for all. It's a structured repetition.  
 There's a rhythm. There's a rhythm to it, which is easier to see when you look at it. 
Even just what we noted, the center of the poem is 16 lines. How do you kno w they 
are lines? What's a line?  
Jon: What's a line?  
Tim: I've broken the poem up into lines.  
Jon: Oh, but it wasn't originally that way?  
Tim: Well, it begs the question of, "How do I know that it is consist of lines? What are the 
clues?"  
Jon: I just im agined in Hebrew it was also in lines.  
Tim: Oh, that's very interesting. Among the dead sea scrolls, there are a number of 
biblical poems that are broken up into their poetic lines.  
Jon: But that's not normal?  
Tim: It's a really ancient practice.  
Jon: Oh, okay.  
Tim: I'm just saying if you were just to throw words on a page, how do you recognize 
something as a poetic line?  
Jon: Oh, right.  
Tim: What a poet does is give very clear indications that this language isn't just free -
flowing, it's following a pa ttern, a rhythm.  
Jon: When I write poetry, or when I have, the line is kind of when I get to the end of my 
page. It's like, "Oh, I got to switch." But there's more thought than that.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. So that I think, can transition us into, as we t hink about this poem, 
all the poems in the Bible, what are some of the universal characteristics that mark 
the kind of speech that is poetry that is able to take entities or realities of our 
experience, put them under our view, but in a way that doesn't ju st think about it 
from one perspective and the languages and drawing attention to itself as 
intentionally artistic?  The Thunder of God  
 
 Actually, I have a good quote here. This is from Adele Berlin, who in our narrative 
conversations I quoted from her excellent book on bibli cal narrative. And she has a 
great book on biblical poetry.  
 She says, "Poetry conveys thought. There is something the poet wants to 
communicate. Poetry conveys that thought in a self -conscious manner through a 
special structuring of the language that cal ls attention to the "how" of the message 
as well as the "what". In fact, in good poetry, the how and the what are 
indistinguishable. As Robert Alter puts it, poetry isn't just a set of techniques for 
saying impressively what you could say otherwise, rather , it's a particular way of 
imagining the world. So Psalm 29 is talking about the power of God as creator 
through a poetic exploration of a thunderstorm, but it's structure the language 
about the thunderstorm, she says, in a self -conscious way."  
Jon: It's being very plain about what it's doing?  
Tim: Yeah, it just repeats the same word like 12 times. Half the lines are about shattering 
trees. Wouldn't one line have satisfied about the trees? Apparently not because the 
goal isn't just to communicate informati on, it's to invite you into an experience.  
Jon: I think I know what she means by good poetry the "how" and the "what" become 
indistinguishable." I don't know if I do know what it means actually. Help me 
understand what she means?  
Tim: Biblical poetry is a lways about something. There's a message.  
Jon: There's a what.  
Tim: There's a what that the poem's about.  
Jon: This poem is about the power of God?  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. It's about the power of God that should make spiritual beings bow 
their knee to Ya hweh and should make God's people feel shalom. That's what it's 
about.  
Jon: And you could have just said that.  
Tim: Yeah, you could just write a short statement, "Oh, sons of God, bow the knee to 
Yahweh. He's very powerful and He blesses his people. Amen. " 
Jon: "Dear sons of God."  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: So very clearly, this long poem is saying something through what she calls a self -
conscious how.  
Jon: And the how, then is all the metaphor, it's all the repetition — 
Tim:  The rhythm, the dense, overlapping repetitions. It' s self -conscious. Somebody sat 
down and crafted all those lines very carefully. Again, it's easier seeing it in color, but 
there is key repeated words right at the beginning, right at the end that link different 
things together. So someone worked for days and days on this thing. And that's 
what she means the how. In good poetry, the how it's self -communicates the what, 
along with the what.  
Jon: Because the poet could have easily just written a statement, but that wasn't enough 
for the poet. The poet wanted  you to experience the statement in a way that made 
the statement come to life in a new way.  
Tim: So in this case, repeating all of these scenes of thunderstorms shaking things, 
breaking them apart, shattering and twisting trees, it's all of a sudden the words are 
doing to you what a shaking, and a quaking and why winds are going to end.  
Jon: It's a little exhilarating too.  
Tim: Yeah, it has the energy. Literally, the poetic techniques become a part of the what of 
the message. They become indistinguishabl e.  
Jon: Becomes a way to experience the what.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: That's cool.  
Tim: It is cool.  
Jon: I would like to make a note that I don't know what a young wild ox is like.  
Tim: Oh, man.  
Jon: "Sirion like a young wild ox leaps."  
Tim: That' s because these [inaudible 00:24:39] is extinct species.  
Jon: It's gone.  
Tim: The auroch.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: The auroch.  
Tim: The auroch. Do you know these?  
Jon: No, I don't know what they are.  
Tim: A-u-r-o-c-h.  
Jon: It looks like a cow, like a bull.  
Tim: But if yo u see it in comparison to something, it's...  
Jon: It's pretty big.  
Tim: ...like the size of the short bus or a big 15 passenger bus.  
Jon: It's massive.  
Tim: I mean, they're like the size of elephant body.  
Jon: There's one in here that has like a mane li ke old lion.  
Tim: The wild ox, massive, massive creatures.  
Jon: Wonderful. Scientists are thinking about bringing these back.  
Tim: I mean, I think, I don't know, Texas Longhorn, those can get pretty big, but I think 
these things were bigger.  
Jon: And t hese are wild animals.  
Tim: Actually, the most dangerous animals in the Bible aside from like crazy [inaudible 
00:25:34] in job. The human, the Leviathan is always a lion or the wild ox.  
Jon: And they were always referring to these guys?  
Tim: Yeah, yeah.  It's massive, massive horn creatures. That fits into the strategy of the 
poem too. He makes a young calf leap and the ultimate of that species leap. The 
Wild ox. He makes them the babies leap and the most powerful wild ox leap.  
Jon: Like a young wild ox w ould be like a full grown but still scrappy and ready to 
dominate? Has something to prove?  
Tim: Yeah, yeah.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Like the older ones they like are tired of charging people and stuff. So you're not as 
afraid of those. But the young ones, don't mess with t hose.  
Tim: That's exactly right. The way I think would be helpful, the role of these videos is to 
introduce people to Biblical Poetry 1. I want to give people some handles on just the 
basic things to look for in the communication techniques the biblical p oetry is 
specifically just with language. That's what video one's about. The art of biblical 
poetry. Then video two will invite people in just the wild imagination of these 
authors, and how they use metaphors and imagery.  
 To begin the video, we might wan t to think about how to invite people into more 
familiar ways of poetry. Poetry is a language that has a "what" communicate, but it's 
intentionally pouring energy into the "how." The artistic use of language.  
 All cultures have ways of doing this, and you  could call them poetic conventions, 
right? So every human culture develops a functional useful language, and then it 
develops this other...Some cultures develop this other type of language that's more 
reflective, artistic, emotive, we call e caught poetry . But it can happen through many 
types of techniques.  
 The way it happens in the West, mostly, is through rhyme and meter. That's how we 
typically think of poetry. I just put the silly classic here, but it's such a great example. 
"Roses are red, violets a re blue." "Sugar is sweet, and so are you."  
Jon: Thank you.  
Tim: You are welcome. I did look you in the eye as I said that. So there are four short 
lines, each consists of three words, except the last. The fourth has four words. Look 
at right there. Three lines have three words, the fourth has four words.  
Jon: Yeah, the cadences.  
Tim: That's good.  
Jon: Pa, pa, pa, pam. Pa, pa, pa, pam. Pa, pa, pa, pam. Pam, pa, pam. So the fourth one's 
different.  
Tim: That's right. There are multiple conventions coming t ogether there. There's rhyme: 
Blue and you. There are overlapping metaphors: flowers and sugar. There's 
wordplays: Sugar, sweet. You are sweet. A person is sweet in a really different way. 
There's all that. Then there's what's called the meter, which is th e syllable patterning.  
Jon: Right.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: That's the heritage that in the West, we get, I think, primarily through the English 
poetic tradition that translated or mediated the ancient Greek lyric poetry tradition. 
That's like from way back, from the late Ki ngdom period in Israel the Greeks were up. 
In like the 600, 700 BC, the Greeks were up.  
Jon: These were like the Odyssey and Elliot [SP] kind of things.  
Tim: Yes. So origins of that system I still don't quite understand called iambic pentameter.  
Jon: Wow,  you know the word.  
Tim: Slots are different. Because Shakespeare  was mediating a form of iambic pentameter 
into English poetry. A lot of his plays are structured by — 
Jon: Part of the reason is to help memorize these stories, right?  
Tim: Yeah, that's rig ht. Poetry is the type of literature that is originated for sure as an oral 
art form - composed orally, and performed orally. And once it' s written, it takes on a 
whole other set of characteristics. That's interesting. But then you get Haiku poetry, 
which isn't about rhyme, but it is about syllables, the 5 -7-5 pattern.  
Jon: Very terse.  
Tim: Yeah. So let's think there. Why would you write in Haiku poetry? The poet is you're 
taking upon yourself some practice that your culture has, and actually sets limits on 
you. 
Jon: Right, yeah. Try to say a lot...  
Tim: Through a little.  
Jon: ...through very little.  
Tim: That's right.  
Jon: And in this case, that little in whatever your cultural practice is, you also have to 
structure the language to match these patterns . That is the way you do it. Some case 
like Shakespeare's, you see his true brilliance, it seems to me, if you could 
understand the metrical system that he was working within, then you're just like, "His 
vocabulary was off the charts. He didn't have like t hesource.com.  
Jon: Yeah, yeah.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: I really think  you're taking on limitations through which you will express something 
more profound than the normal.  
Jon: Well, it forces you to search for options that you wouldn't first think to search for.  
Tim: That' s right.  
Jon: Because I've written songs and the same thing happens because you're like, "Oh, I 
need a two syllable word here instead," or "I need something that rhymes." So you 
have to start searching for other ideas. Then that makes you go, "Oh, I never  really 
thought about this, this way." But that's a good way of putting it. It structures your 
own understanding of the topic.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. So the writing of poetry becomes a discovery process. You're 
discovering your own language, which then helps you put ideas together and new 
combinations. Then all of that together creates a dense, artistic statement that...Oh, 
this is a quote that I read when we first got together. It's a classic introduction of 
poetry by Lawrence Perrine called "Sound and Sense." It's not a technical definition 
of poetry, but I like it.  
 He says, "Poetry is a kind of human language that says more and says it more 
intensely than does ordinary language." So he's not talking about form or meter or 
anything. He's just saying, "The net effect is language that does more than language 
normally does."  
 I think at the heart, that's what I want this video to be about. I want to introduce 
people to some of the conventions and practices, these limits that the poet's take on 
themselves  constructing speech in a rhythm. But the net effect of it is that through 
these new combinations, poetry carries a surplus of meaning and overabundance of 
meaning. For me, that's the driving core concept.  
Jon: So what's the overabundance of meaning for yo u in Psalm 29 with the thunder and 
God's voice?  
Tim: I think what captures my imagination is it's somebody meditating on the most 
powerful, again for 3,000 years ago. And still, today, to be in the middle of a 
thunderstorm is one of the most humbling exper iences. You're puny, you're 
powerless.  
 So experiencing a thunderstorm is a window into my own nature as a human and to 
the powers at work that rule and providentially rule over creation, which in Israelite is The Thunder of God  
 
Yahweh. It's all of a sudden, this powerful, frightening existential experience of a 
poet trying to translate that.  
 So this poetic medium becomes a way of inviting the reader into an emotional 
existential experience of their mortality of Yahweh's repetitive, driving unavoidable 
nature of these lines  over and over again. There's an overabundance of meaning that 
you could never communicate any other way except through this form, which does it 
beautifully.  
 I mean, I'm not in the habit of doing my theology by looking at rain clouds. We live 
in Portland  and we look at a lot of rain clouds. This poet's a Bible nerd, for sure. He's 
one of the bibilical authors, but he also apparently thinks you should read the rain 
clouds.  
Jon: You should just enjoy a storm rolling through and think about the power of God .  
Tim: Do some theological reflection in light of a powerful rainstorm.  
Jon: Now, when they're thinking about the voice of God, is that connected to the Word 
of God?  
Tim: Totally. The other thing this poem is a hyperlink to is the appearance of Yahweh in 
the Garden of Eden in interrogation scene after the humans take from the tree. And 
it says, "The qol, the voice of Yahweh; they heard the voice of Yahweh, the sounds of 
Yahweh in the wind of the day." It usually it gets translated as the qol of the day, th e 
breezy time. But it doesn't say that. It says in the wind.  
 So it's like, yeah, always voice showed up with the wind. It's a storm scene.  
Jon: Oh, it's a storm.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. It's a preview. It's a design pattern. It's previewing when Yahweh will  
show up with Israel at Mount Sinai. And what they see is the qol - the voice. They 
see the voice of Yahweh.  
Jon: At Sinai?  
Tim: Mm-hmm. It's very odd.  
Jon: I thought they saw the glory?  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Oh, they do in chapter 24, but in Exodus 19, they look up at the storm cloud coming 
over that mountain. And what it says is, "They saw the voice of Yahweh, which is 
thunder. But it's such a visceral experience, they see it.  
 So this poem is tapping into a whole design pattern in the biblical narratives about 
Yahweh  showing up when his voice, his command as the creator, it's powerful and 
inspiring. The poem communicates that. I think when you get into it, the poem does 
that. That's what I mean the overabundance of meaning.  
 We've already developed the impressionist painting aesthetic, and I'm kind of 
excited about that visual medium to unpack that somehow, as we talked about 
different techniques of biblical poetry, it'd be cool if we have lines of poetry that we 
can ponder together in the video, talk about the techni que, but then stuff is growing 
out of the words. Such things. That's just one idea.  
Jon: Right.   
Tim: But the idea is the words communicate more. They grow stuff out of them that you 
can't quite analyze. You just experience it. Experience the poetry.  
 We know the biblical authors knew when they were writing in poetry because they 
had words for these compositions. There's at least three. There's few more, but the 
three most common ones, they called them a "shir", which is translated as "song".  
Jon: This i s what they would call their poetry?  
Tim: Yeah. They actually had vocabulary to describe this kind of artistic speech. They call 
it "shirah". It's the word for "sing".  
Jon: Is it because a lot of these were sung?  
Tim: Totally. Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: So they would be melodies?  
Tim: That's right.  
Jon: Same thing with the Odyssey and Elliot, I think they thought those were song.  
Tim: I think that's right. That makes perfect sense. Same thing with music then. When you 
set poetry to music, your words are im itating the conventions of the music, which set 
limitations on you within a tradition but also create opportunities for you to create 
new meanings.  The Thunder of God  
 
 So yeah, "song" is one of the ancient Hebrew terms for poetry. Another word 
"mizmor" it's the word "Psalm."  It gets translated as "Psalm"  
Jon: And this is a word I only know because of the Bible.  
Tim: Yeah, totally.  
Jon: So I don't even really know what that means.  
Jon: What is a Psalm?  
Tim: Well, it comes from a verb "zamar", which is another word for to play music. To play 
a song.  
Jon: Oh, to play?  
Tim:  It's a synonym for song. "Psalm" simply means "song." Sung poetry.  
Jon: What's the difference then? "Song" is related to the word "Sing for us," but "Psalm" 
is also the word for "Sing."  
Tim: In other wo rds, "Psalm" is a verb in Hebrew. You can refer to something you do and 
then the end result — 
Jon: You're Psalming?  
Tim: Yeah, you psalm. And then what you have at the end of that is a Psalm. A sang 
poem. These words aren't used enough and we don't know eno ugh about the choir 
system in ancient Israel. We just don't know enough to be able to distinguish these 
words like, a "shir" was this type of song and a "mizmor" more was this type of song"  
 The next term, we do know about this one. It's a "qinah" and it' s a song of grief or 
lament. So the book of Lamentations, there's a qinah that David sings when Saul and 
Jonathan are dead. So this was a type of song. Just a grief song. That was a whole 
cultural tradition. This long poems  of grief.  
 These labels are give n a lot to poetry in the Bible. So we know the biblical authors 
knew — 
Jon: Thought in these categories.  
Tim: Yeah, they knew when they were entering this mode of writing.  
Jon: Sure.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Then the question is, "Okay, what was the little menu list?" Like w hen you're working 
on your computer, and you go up to the menu at top or what I guess — 
Jon: What are the tools?  
Tim: What are the toolset? I guess that could be a dated metaphor in a few years here.  
Jon: The menu list?  
Tim: Yeah, what's the toolset? And t his has become a huge area of debate for going on 
all over 200 years.  
Jon: What tools they had?  
Tim: Yeah. There are Bible nerds arguing about the nature of ancient Hebrew poetry. My 
favorite description is a poem written by Bible nerd, it's a poem about Hebrew 
poetry, how it works.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: I don't fully agree with it, but I agree with most of it. But it's clever. It's by John 
Hollander. He says, "The verse of Hebrew Bible is strange, the meter of Psalms and 
proverbs plexus. It's not a matter of number, no counting of beats or syllables. Its 
song is a music of matching, its rhythm, a kind of paralleling. One line makes an 
assertion. The other part expresses in other words, sometimes a third part will vary 
yet again.  
Jon: Yeah, clever.  
Tim: Yes, it's clever. Bible nerds. So Hollander's claim is, no meter, no syllable counting.  
Jon: Which makes it difficult for singing.  
Tim: It could.  
Jon: It would.  
Tim: It could.  
Jon: I mean, if there's a set melody — 
Tim: Oh, I see.  
Jon: I guess I just imagine what would happen.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Well, it makes it difficult for, I guess, a Westerner to imagine singing. But you 
probably had this experience if you travel internationally and you hear other cultures 
like traditional music, and sometimes it sounds off to somebod y from other culture. 
It sounds like it's not in harmony, and it's just not your culture. So it doesn't sound 
like biblical authors experienced this as a problem because they have vocabulary for 
poetry.  
Jon: Well, I can understand it feeling weird because  of the melodies in a different...I don't 
know you call it, but keys. If I'm going to introduce a new poem to you, and I want 
you to be able to sing it, either I have to give you a new melody that you're going to 
know it by, or I just say, "Hey, we're goin g to use this commonly known melody, and 
we're going to use my new psalm."  
 I guess I always imagined that because that's a lot of the way that some of famous 
hymns were put together was through common melodies that we just changed the 
words to. At least that's what I've been told.  
Tim: Yeah, interesting.  
Jon: And that just makes it a lot easier for people to go, "Oh, cool. I could sing it on this 
because I know the melody already." But if you're going to do that, you have to 
adhere to the structure of t he meter of that melody?  
Tim: Yeah. Part of the challenge is the poetry in the Bible represents a long history. Some 
of these are very ancient poems, but some of them are poems that have been taken 
up into literary texts, and then edited or new parts are c omposed to make them fit 
into the written medium.  
 Even the book of Psalms is a great example of this. It's not a hymn book. It's very 
much now in the form that it's in a written literary composition that's meant to be 
read. And you can just see it by the  editorial structures, the headings. There's really 
interesting. There's like poems like Psalm 14. Half of it gets repeated in half of 
another Psalm. I think it's Psalm 70.  
 So you can tell there was a mode at which these are being sung and were studied 
and treasured and written and reflected on as written text. In which case the meter 
thing, like maybe way back in Moses days they were singing this, but by the time 
they've reached the stage they are at in the Bible, the meter doesn't matter, which 
makes se nse of the lack of any syllable rhythms.  
Jon: So the point is, in Hebrew poetry, the meter and the syllable count?  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Yeah. Meter and rhyming.  
Jon: And rhyming.  
Tim: Roses are red, violets are blue.  
Jon: Yeah, they're not rhyming. I remember being told  in Hebrew you don't rhyme words, 
you rhyme thoughts.  
Tim: Right, I've heard that too.  
Jon: That's not helpful?  
Tim: I don't think it's helpful.  
Jon: You don't think that's helpful?  
Tim: I want to head a different direction in how we got people.  
Jon: Okay. Get us in that.  
Tim: All right. The first thing is the rhythm. There is a rhythm. There's a whole bunch of 
Bible nerds who are using the phrase "free verse" to describe the rhythm. And free 
verse means essentially, my goal is to write short, dense line s.  
 And there is some guiding rules. The line consists almost always of three to five 
words in Hebrew. Not in English. Oh, yeah, this is interesting. If I write a sentence in 
English "he picked him up" or "he picked it up," subject, verb, direct object, t hose are 
always in English at least three separate words.  
Jon: Four words "He picked him up."  
Tim: Oh, yeah, four words. There you go. In Hebrew, that's one word.  
Jon: How?  
Tim: Viakahehu [SP]. So the "he" is built into the verb. Then you have the verb, and then 
you can attach the direct object to the verb itself in one word.  
Jon: This is like German, you're just like cramming words together?  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. So words can have many syllables, but you can have a whole sentence in 
one word in Hebrew. The w ord "and" attaches itself to the beginning of a word. So The Thunder of God  
 
you can have the sentence "and he picked him up," Viakahehu, is one word in 
Hebrew.  
 So it's the perfect language to make dense statements in. You can pack a lot of 
meaning into one word. And if you 've got three those suckers to work with, then you 
could have three sentences in a single line.  
Jon: Well, it's one word, but it's really a word that's four words.  
Tim: Correct? In terms of its grammatical makeup, it's four — 
Jon: Because in English, we ca n make it "he picked him up" one word. Hepickedhimup.  
Tim: You can say it quickly.  
Jon: He picked him up. I can write it without any — 
Tim: Andhepickedhimup.  
Jon: That kind of sounds like — 
Tim: In Hebrew poetry, a poetic line, usually it's pairs of lines, pairs of short lines, three to 
five words, usually, the first line is a complete sentence or a complete clause. The 
second line is either a subordinate clause, a parallel clause. But you've always got a 
complete sentence in the line. And usually they're in  pairs, so people call them to A 
line and the B line.  
 This is universal, but very often, the A line will be a main clause or a complete 
sentence, and then the B line is either a full parallel clause or its subordinate on the 
first one.  
Jon: Subordinate m eaning?  
Tim: The A line "and he picked him up" "With strong arms of might" will be the B line.  
Jon: Okay. So it could be "And he picked him up // he lifted him high."  
Tim: That's correct.  
Jon: That would be a parallel line?  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. But no t all lines are parallel lines.  
Jon: But not all lines are parallel lines.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: That's why thought rhymes aren't helpful.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: So rhythm. There's a cadence in the rhythm, but it has to do with number of words. 
And there's a pretty big free dom. About three to five words on average.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: Hebrew has a way of removing unnecessary words. They'll remove the words "the". 
Like in English the word "the" or "a" or "and" there was a way to have a stripping the 
speech down of what to cal l pros parts of speech. So they can do that in Hebrew, 
strip the thing down. And some English poetry works like that too sometimes.  
Jon: Sure. So this is just one writing poetry or is this also in speaking?  
Tim: It's a characteristic of biblical poetry. Rh ythm, that's the first thing. There is a rhythm, 
but it's a free verse rhythm. Free verse is a technical category that literary nerds use, 
where you have in mind some basic parameters but within those parameters, do 
anything you want.  
Jon: Freeform jazz.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. It's a thing. There are many cultural traditions that have a free verse 
tradition.  
Jon: For us, it's more like spoken word poetry. It's very free verse.  
Tim: Yeah, that's a great example. Good job. It's a great example. Which means, ju st 
because it doesn't rhyme with meter the way English does, it doesn't mean there 
isn't wordplay and rhyming going on just not in a metered way. So Hebrew poetry, 
totally.  
Jon: There's lots of rhyming. There are lots of words that sound similar.  
Tim: Yeah, exactly. They'll have whole poems that play with certain letters, repeating 
certain letters, and so on.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: One of my favorite poems in Isaiah is Isaiah 5 called "The song in the vineyard." The 
metaphor of God planting Israel. It says, " God waited for the vineyard to produce 
grapes, but all it produced was stinky grapes."  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Stinky grapes?  
Tim: Rotten grapes.  
Jon: Rotten grapes, okay.  
Tim: Grapes that are immediately rotten. It's the grapes that it produces are the grapes 
that are al ready rotten.  
Jon: It sounds like a bad dream.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. Oh, and you'll get this because of the Justice video. So God says, He 
was looking for "mishpat" but what he saw was "mispagh." Bloodshed.  
Jon: Mispagh.  
Tim: Mispagh is bloodshed. Looking  for mishpat, what He sees, mispagh. He was looking 
for tsedaka but what he saw was tse -aka - the cries of the oppressed. That's a great 
example. It's straight up rhyming. It just doesn't follow meter.  
Jon: It's a type of rhyming.  
Tim: It's a type of rhy ming. You're using words that rhyme.  
Jon: That sound very similar.  
Tim: It sounds mishpat, mispagh.  
Jon: It's not rhyming like English.  
Tim: I understand. It's not rhyming by our standards. In Hebrew, that's — 
Jon: But poet's do that. We understand that  kind of rhyming.  
Tim: Yeah, totally.  
Jon: It's not the classic rhyme.  
Tim: Yeah. I wasn't taught to look for this a ton when I learned Hebrew. But man, I've just 
worked through a couple studies recently on wordplay in the Hebrew Bible, it's off 
the char ts. They're doing it everywhere. I had no idea. It's really remarkable. It just 
one of the things you can't quite translate. Rhyming doesn't translate — 
Jon: Word playing being rhyming of words and stuff?  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: So is [tohu  vo vohu? 00:53:10] an example of that?  
Tim: Oh, yeah. Sure, that's an example. Or there's the whole story the building of Babylon 
in Genesis. All the vocabulary centers around words that have the letters B an L.  
Jon: Oh, really?  
Tim: Yeah, totally. If you just rea d aloud in Hebrew, the whole thing was like, "[Habu, 
nible, lanu, ir? 00:53:33]  "  
Jon: Lots of Ls and Bs.  
Tim: Ls and Bs, all leading up to him calling him bololeng [SP], BLL, the language and 
calling it barvel. BBL.  
Jon: That's my favorite thing about p oetry is when there's a repetition of sounds.  
Tim: Yeah, super common. Yeah, super common in many kinds of poetry. If it's not rhyme, 
it's the how of the speech that it creates the surplus, the overabundance of meaning. 
That isn't about a concept, it's ab out a feeling that you get when you hear it.  
Jon: Now, it gets discouraging to know that this is happening in the Hebrew. I don't 
speak Hebrew or read it and I can see that being discouraging to other people.  
Tim: Yeah, totally.  
Jon: Well, here's another thing. If God knew that this was going to be the poetry and 
language in which for many people groups throughout history were going to use as 
their Scriptures — 
Tim: Their basic instructions before leaving — 
Jon: No, not even that, though. Like their way to u nderstand the story of God, and for 
their imagination to be shaped by what God's doing in the world and who He is and 
who we are.  
Tim: Yeah, sure.  
Jon: So much of this now is then buried in the Hebrew.  
Tim: Or Greek?  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Did God think, "Oh, everyone wil l just learn Hebrew and Greek." Or just like, "Well, 
those little treats are extra for the people who want to do extra work."  
Tim: Well, after all we talked about in terms of the sophistication and the multi -layers of 
depth to the stories, that is for sure  going on. Even if you read it in Hebrew. There 
are stories and these stories and poems full depth isn't available to somebody on 
the first reading. That's built into just the style of communication.  
Jon: I could get there. I get there.  
Tim: But the Hebr ew thing. Here, we're back to, I don't know, a core thing that we keep 
coming around that the Christian Jewish confession is God choose to reveal Himself 
through a historical medium of a people, and a culture, and their language and their 
text.  
Jon: Like the poet, He restrained himself to certain limitations.  
Tim: Yeah. God's poet accepting limitations to communicate through humanity. I mean, 
what is the incarnation? The same questions in principle come with the incarnation 
of Jesus. I never got to hear J esus speak in Aramaic. I only get to hear him in Greek 
translation through apostles. I am nowhere near Israel Palestine right now.  
 So that's more of a theological reality that's built into the Jewish and Christian 
tradition is this God weaves Himself int o human history, which means that when He 
reveals Himself, it's in the categories of the people He's communicating through.  
Jon: Do you think every Christian community needs their resident Bible nerd to read the 
Bible with?  
Tim: Oh, I think a healthy Chr istian community, yeah, needs Bible nerds. At least if that 
community is interested in keeping itself anchored in something other than just 
what's perpetually new.  
Jon: So how many Bible nerds do we need per capita then?  
Tim: That's a great question. And b y nerds, I don't mean degrees, but somebody who's 
really — 
Jon: Yeah, someone who I could sit down with and they can tell me and they could say, 
"Hey, you won't see this, but look at the rhyming of the words here."  
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: I mean, her e's the thing is I would love to be able to do that, but I just know, I'm not 
going to be able to. I would love to play the violin. I'm not going to.  
Tim: Sure.  
Jon: But the more we have these conversations like this, I'm like, "Oh, maybe I do need 
to."  
Tim: No, no, I don't think so. Look how much we did on that poem on Psalm 29 just in 
English.  
Jon: Yeah. But you had to tell me about qol.  
Tim: I had to tell you about one Hebrew word that helps unlock the wordplay. But that's 
it. That's all I had to say.  It's all you need somebody who...I mean, I'm with you, but 
this is just the reality. The apostles knew this. This is why Paul said, 'A healthy, 
complete body of the Messiah has an apostle, prophet, pastor, teacher, and 
evangelist.  
Jon: Yeah, the many part s. 
Tim: Right?  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: And the spiritual gifts, all that. And teacher, a nerd is on the list. Of course, you need 
to teacher. Look at our sacred texts. They're really hard to understand a lot of the 
time. Thank you for raising that important ques tion, Jon.  
Jon: You are welcome.  
Tim: The companion to rhythm in biblical poetic style is a phenomenon that's come to 
have the term parallelism. You gave it another phrase earlier - thought rhyming.  
Jon: Thought rhyming.  
Tim: I mean, we saw it in Psalm 2 9. Yahweh's voice shatters the trees. It twists the oaks. It 
makes the mountain skip like a young calf. It makes another mountain skip like a 
wild ox.  
Jon: So two similar thoughts, one after another.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Yeah. Though, look at the opening. The opening, f our lines of Psalm 29, it's a triple 
repetition with a fourth variation. "Give to Yahweh or sons of God, Give to Yahweh 
glory and strength. Give to Yahweh glory, worship the Lord."  
Jon: Those are three subordinate one — 
Tim: You would say it's three parall el lines with the last one coming in as a little sub.  
Jon: Oh, those are three parallel lines with the fourth subordinate kind of surprise?  
Tim: Yeah. Here it's following the classic like 1 -2-3 twist. You set the pattern.  
Jon: Actually, the classic is 1 -2 twist.  
Tim: Oh, 1 -2 twist. That's right. This is the 1 -2-3 twist. In biblical poetry, oftentimes, it's 
the 1 -2 twist or it's just the 1 -2.  
Jon: Yeah, the 1 -2 punch.  
Tim: This is called parallelism. There's a guy named Robert Lowth, Englishman who was a  
divine.  
Jon: A divine?  
Tim: Yeah, it's an old English term for scholar.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: He's credited with writing the first systematic dissertation on biblical poetry. It's 
called "Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews" in the new year 1753. Here 's 
how he put it. Would do you noticed this feature of parallel repetition?  
 He says, "There is a certain conformation of the sentences, which is chiefly 
observable in those passages which frequently occur in Hebrew poetry, in which 
they treat one subject  in many different ways, and dwell upon the same sentiment: - 
so the voice  of Yahweh in Psalm 29 - when they express the same thing in different 
words, or different things in a similar form of words: and since this artifice of 
composition seldom fails to produce an agreeable and measured cadence, we can 
scarcely doubt it must have imparted to their poetry an exquisite degree of beauty 
and grace.” That was all one sentence.  
Jon: His sentence has a lot of beauty and grace as well.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Yeah, right. His othe r major contribution was he wrote a commentary on the whole 
book of Isaiah just commenting on the nature of the poetry. So it's not a theological 
commentary, it's a commentary on poetic style.  
Jon: When I read like old English like this or older English, it sounds like that people were 
so much smarter than we are right now.  
Tim: Like this guy.  
Jon: "The artifice of composition." Would that be something that just a normal 
Englishman would say?  
Tim: It is. He is writing. Literally, when you write, you tend to be a little more articulate. 
When people write.  
Jon: Yeah, sure. I don't know. Nowadays, when someone writes, and they're doing that, it 
almost feels like they're trying to show off.  
Tim: Or being fancy. That's true. That's a good point. But that's jus t our becoming 
acclimated to the email, texting, scratch out your thoughts in bad grammar type of 
English.  
Jon: And just add an emoji so everything's fun.  
Tim: It's the idiocrasy . So he's got to sum on something. And pretty much everybody 
writing in poetr y since him has been just developing and filling out what he intuited 
and tried to — 
Jon: He wouldn't be the first one to notice that.  
Tim: No. 
Jon: I mean, it's not like a hidden feature.  
Tim: No. He's the first one who wrote a systematic dissertation an d he created categories 
of parallelism. We called some synonymous - basically, the same idea through 
multiple lines. He called some antithetical - where to contrast.  
Jon: And that would be, say, "Express the same thing in different words synonymous or 
different things and similar form of words.  
Tim: Correct, something too opposite. We looked at a couple of proverbs. That's how 
most of Proverbs are cast. But he also created a big middle default junk drawer The Thunder of God  
 
which he just called synthetic parallelism, which ju st means the second line doesn't 
say the same thing and doesn't say the opposite thing. It's just another thing.  
 What most of biblical scholars has tried to figure out, is how many of those things 
are there and why? And there's been lots of debate. Now th ere are people who are 
just saying, "Let's just stop trying to categorize them. Let's just paint a spectrum." 
They just have its free verse, so they can do virtually anything they want with these 
two lines. The point isn't to categorize it. The point is to  just experience it.  
 So this is something interesting. This is down at the bottom of Page 4. Almost all the 
proverbs in the book of Proverbs are cast in these little parallel mostly two liners. 
The word for proverb in Hebrews "mashal" it means to compare . A comparison of 
two things.  
Jon: Proverbs means to compare.  
Tim: A comparison.  
Jon: Interesting. So I can rename "Psalms" in my Bible as "song" and "Proverb as 
"compare"?  
Tim: Yeah. Proverbs is comparisons.  
Jon: Comparisons.  
Tim: Comparisons. Through this poetic medium, the two lines put two things together.  
Jon: Because proverbs are generally just two lines, oftentimes.  
Tim: Yes. Sometimes it's triple. Triplets comes along, but they're most often two. Here's 
just some classics and you can just see th e potential is on the form here.  
 Proverbs 16:32 "Being slow to anger is better than being a warrior, and one who 
rules their passions, than one who captures the city." So the "slow to anger" is 
compared to somebody who can rule their passion. Then the ad vantages of "being a 
worrier," being able to chop someone's head off is compared to somebody who can 
capture a city. Pretty simple.  
 So you would say there are two corresponding elements being compared here? 
Actually, it's multiple. There's one thing, some body who has self -control.  
Jon: This makes you think that to the author of the proverb here, dealing with your 
passions is like a brawl. It's like a fight.  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Oh, yeah.  
Jon: It's a war in and of itself.  
Tim: Yeah. The metaphor creates this surplus of meaning that you now reflect on.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Your anger and your passions can make you powerful. But if being able to control 
your passions to some degree is better, it means that strength can be really 
destructive. So here it's a warrior or somebody who captures a city, I guess that can 
be good. Of course, that can be good if you're the one who wins.  
Jon: Capturing a city?  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: So it's like the point is capturing a city is hard, but — 
Jon: Takes a lot of passion.  
Jon: Yeah, I mean, it takes  a lot of warring.  
Tim: Warring, yeah.  
Jon: And the same degree of the fight you have to put up to capture a city is a fight you 
have to put up to rule over your own passion.  
Tim: Got it, yeah.  
Jon: And so the city that you are controlling is your own i nternal passion.  
Tim: Yes, that's right.  
Jon: So in the same way, if you want to capture a city, you need to be a warrior. But if you 
want to capture your passion, you got to be slow to anger.  
Tim: You need to be more than warrior almost. It's saying bett er. More powerful.  
Jon: You're going to be more work. There's more work to control the chaos inside of you 
than it is to capture a city.  
Tim: Than it is to capture a city, yeah. What's great about this example is, this isn't just 
thought rhyming in terms of "Oh, I just want to add extra line to this." The second The Thunder of God  
 
line really enriches the meaning, the depth of this proverb. Being slow to anger is 
better than being a warrior.  
Jon: In itself, that line makes you think, "Oh, it wants me to not to be this crazy  guy who 
runs around and tries to control things with my power. It wants me to be a subdued, 
thoughtful, slow, and intentional kind of person." That by itself, you're like, "Okay, 
that makes sense." But then the second line makes you realize doing that is actually 
a lot more warring.  
Tim: There's a battle involved.  
Jon: There's a battle involved.  
Tim: You need to rule that's chaotic. And if you're able to do that, you're actually better 
than somebody who can capture a city.  
Jon: I can imagine the capturin g of a city is not easy.  
Tim: I've never had to do that.  
Jon: Never had to do it. Never been in that situation.  
Tim: And I am certain I never will.  
Jon: Well, not too many generations ago our ancestors were capturing cities.  
Tim: No, you can't take th at for granted. That's a good example. These are two parallel 
lines, but they're not just saying the same thing, though they are exploring one core 
idea.  
 Again, overabundance. When you pair slow to anger and ruling passion with warrior 
and city, you have  four components there. It's like an example where one plus one 
plus one plus one equals 18. It's just all of a sudden you put those four things next 
to each other. The poetic form — 
Jon: We call that synergy.  
Tim: Yeah. It's poetry. It's the nature of poe try. It's the art that you can communicate 
more by choosing these limitations to say less. It's awesome. It's great.  
 Here's one where they're opposites. Proverbs 13:3. "One who guards his mouth 
preserves this life. One who opens wide his lips comes to rui n." The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: It's another self -control proverb.  
Tim: Yes, it is.  
Jon: "One who guards his mouth preserves his life. One who opens wide his lips comes to 
ruin." It's saying the same thing in the opposite way.  
Tim: Yes. This is what Lowth was saying you can s ay different thing with similar form of 
words, or the same thing through different form of words. But each one begins with 
"one". There are two contrasting ones - one that guards his mouth. One who opens 
his lips - with opposite outcomes. And it's obviousl y not promoting opening wide 
your lips. Also notice just opening your lips is a metaphor for talking too much.  
Jon: Talking, yeah.  
Tim: Talking with no — 
Jon: And it's sometimes by eating.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: For me, though these kind of probl ems are hard for me because I'm the guy who will 
guard my mouth. But it's not because of self -control, it's because of like fear. I need 
to be more like, I don't know, like Peter.  
Tim: That's a good point. This proverb is aimed at more certain temperament s I guess. I 
the same. I would rather observe what's going on in a room than contribute to it.  
Jon: I need a proverb that's like, "Better is the man who..." You know that...it's a poem or 
something of your dance like no one's watching and love like you'll  never get hurt. 
That's the poem I need. Not like, "Don't open your mouth, you'll make a fool of 
yourself."  
Tim: I expect to see on someone's screensavers or something.  
Jon: Totally. That's classic.  
Tim: That's funny. Michael Fox, my Hebrew advisor at the  University of Wisconsin, he used 
the metaphor "Proverbs are like a pocket of change. No one coin is right for 
everyone situation. Different ones for different circumstances and different 
combinations at different times." So that's totally true. This prove rb isn't the right 
thing for everyone to hear every moment, but it's probably right for everybody at 
some moment.  The Thunder of God  
 
 The point is, poetic form, this is an example where he uses the same grammar form. 
"One who guards his mouth, one who opens his lips," but t hey have opposite points.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: The third proverb, just looking at three, it fits into that category in the middle that 
Robert Lowth called synthetic. Here's Proverbs 19:17. "One who lends to the Lord is 
one gracious to the poor. He will repay  him for his good deed." This is actually an 
astounding proverb.  
Jon: How so?  
Tim: It's promoting being generous.  
Jon: Yeah, charity.  
Tim: But it begins by saying, "One who lends to Yahweh." You're actually donating to 
Yahweh. One who donates to Yahweh,  that's the one who donates to the poor. 
That's the first line. In Hebrew, this is one of these things where most of those 
English words fit into a single Hebrew word.  
Jon: So that's like two Hebrew words?  
Tim: That's actually four.  
Jon: Four Hebrew word s.  
Tim: Then the B line doesn't tell you a parallel thought. That would be "One who lends 
the Lord is one who is gracious to the poor."  
Jon: One who gives to...  
Tim: Yeah, people in time of need or something like that.  
Jon: ...Elohim.   
Tim: Oh, yeah, it  would be like that. Here, the B line just comes and gives a result. As a 
consequence, the Lord will repay the one who is gracious. So it's just a consequence. 
It's the thing that happens because of the reality of that. So you can see this from is 
really p lastic. Poets can use this parallel line.  
Jon: But the things that are always in common are two lines, a couple of lines.  
Tim: Two lines, sometimes three.  The Thunder of God  
 
Jon: Sometimes three and sometimes four.  
Tim: Very rarely, four. Like, in the opening of Psalm 29.  
Jon: Psalm 29 is four?  
Tim: Yeah. But standards to and the relationship of the two can take on all these 
variations. That's why the free verse category I think is helpful. It's just you're 
freestyling — 
Jon: You're trying to create structure where there is  actually little structure.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: But there is structure.  
Tim: Yeah, there's a rhythm. The rhythm is one thing, the next thing.  
Jon: Sometimes the third.  
Tim: And there's even a biblical poem that draws attention to this in Psa lm 62. This is 
fascinating. I love this. It's so good. "One thing God has spoken;  two things I have 
heard. That power belongs to God, and covenant loyalty is yours, O, Lord, for you'll 
recompense each person according to their deed.  
 The two parallel lines  are drawing attention to themselves. God is saying one thing 
in this little poem, but what the poet hears is two things. Then he goes on to give 
you two parallel lines — 
Jon: That one thought.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. Isn't that's good.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: It's go od. He’s playing  with the form.  
Jon: He knows what he's doing.  
Tim: He knows exactly what he's doing. So God's powerful, God's also loyal to his 
covenant. Two statements, one thing. And what is the outcome of that thing? If 
God's powerful, and He is loya l to His promises — 
Jon: Then those who are loyal to him, we'll see the goodness of his —  The Thunder of God  
 
Tim: Everybody will get what they deserve. That's the point. But I love just opening draws 
attention to the idea that the poet's aware that he's got a core thing that he wants 
to communicate, and he's using more than one poetic line and to describe it. There 
you go.  
 You can just go through, and if you start reading these poems slowly, what you'll 
notice is that this back and forth of usually two line. The second line often 
intensifying or it's creating some subtle juxtaposition of something. This is comic. 
Like a warrior paralleled with capturing a city. "Wow, okay." Then that gets your 
imagination firing. That's what this poetry is meant to do is put one thing, one li ne 
next to another line to fire your imagination to say more than could have been said 
otherwise.
