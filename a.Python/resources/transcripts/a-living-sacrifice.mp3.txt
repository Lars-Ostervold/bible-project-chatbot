hey this is John at bible project in today Tim and I bring to you part two of our live conversation in Dallas Texas discussing how to read the letters of the New Testament New Testament letters is like listening to one side of a phone conversation this phone conversations going to make a lot more sense when we understand its contact with the people on the other side of the line are dealing with thinking about day-to-day one important piece of context it's how the Jesus movement was bringing together a multi-ethnic group of people all to be United as one is mostly ethnic group is following a Jewish leader beside himself feeling is real story so how can a movement that's been so centered around Israel story become multi-ethnic and so what you going to see the apostles see themselves in the moment painted for us by the ending of the book of Isaiah
 they see themselves acting out the script of the last page of the Isaiah scroll and bringing in the nation's as an offering so that they can join the priesthood and it's not just the expansion of Israel it's the realization of God's promise to Abraham all along that he would be the father of multitude of nation who will experience the blessings of the new creation when we see this theme emerge in all of the letters something should pop out at us while we don't live in the same situation as first century Christians dealing with the things that they dealt with in particular we as Christians still called to be United in love despite all of our differences and so it seems to me understanding how the letters fit in this has immense potential I think for the followers of Jesus today because this isn't just about theology in ethics this is about getting people to elevate their allegiance to Jesus over there so she
 economic National ethnic gender boundary line that's all I had today on this episode thanks for joining us here we go
 all right everybody here we are back yeah so where we're going we are talking about how to read the New Testament letters and what we established I hope in our last conversation was simply they are actually letters not contacts into contacts so in a way that is more heightened even than other parts of the Bible context is everything for making sense of of these letters some people have used the metaphor of hearing one end of a phone conversation because people walk around with a little speakers in their ears talking when they're really tiny bluetooth microphone and they look like they're talking to themselves
 and you look crazy and then those came out and I'll just put this in and everything so think think of that Dynamic when you're in like a coffee shop or if it's somebody you know this happen with you and I before where you'll take a phone call I don't know who it is but I'm listening to your tone of voice your body language and your words and I'm trying to guess if I know who it is and I cannot even guess based on what you're talking about and those kinds of things I want to talk about the letters that way that we're reading one end of a correspondence but we only are getting one in a speaker and so we have to do is infer and look at the letter as a contact but then get all these other layers of context to to understand what's being said it's a basic point but it needs to be mad
 who is begin exploring I guess call him what four layers of context just as a technical note I think we can do these first three in one in the first video and then I think the second video can explore the Dynamics of the fourth literary context but we can talk about right now is where the letters fit in the overall story line and that might seem self-evident but actually if you drill down and look at some things a lot of new things the pot from the letters when you look at how they fit into the story so let's go real big picture here where does the storyline of the Bible begin page one right answer
 dear God speaks and ordered an inhabited world into being and he appoints is image bearing representatives to rule it on his behalf as his partner we talked about this at length but this is the drama this is the drama and fundamental conflict driving the whole Bible how are humans going to partner with God right to rule creation story God's purpose is that humans rule the world as his pristine faithful Divine Images in the world ruling together kings and queens of creation you get a little poem here in Genesis when God created human in his own image and the image of God he created him and that singular refers to the collective species human and then the next line of the poem spells out what the him consist of mainly Humanity consists of male and female he created them
 somebody rabbit holes we're not going to do what we normally do humans are more importantly what there's their stupidity comes out of misdirected desire in Genesis 3 the fundamental portrait of what's wrong with the humans is misdirected desire she looks at the gift of God Genesis 36 and what ignited in her is desire for wisdom but in a way that doesn't honor God's Own wisdom and instruction story misdirected desire that results in Exile and death so God's long-term solution to this problem is to pick one family among the families of the land and to appoint them as His conduit a vehicle
 blessing and all the good to eat and stuff to all all of the nation's this is the family Abraham father Abraham father Abraham use typical moment in the overall biblical story cuz what it means is that the primary plot conflict of stupid misdirected human beings who Embrace their own self-destruction and think that it's good that's the man that it has to be going to get these humans to be faithful Covenant Partners the main sub plot for the heat for the Hebrew Bible and then in the New Testament is he chooses one family threw him to do the rescue plan and so with the opening words of Genesis 12 we have the that program set out the Lord said to Abram his name is Abram when he starts this be important for the thing we're going to do next
 and it's not heard his name gets changed to Abraham Abraham and we are understanding why Paul is doing and saying a lot of what he's doing in the letters
 from your country from your relatives from your father's house to the land will show you the forest from your country and then two more lines fill that out from your relatives from your father's house back out go forth to wear to the land of show you I'll make you a great nation and I'll bless I'll make your name great you'll be a blessing I will bless those who bless you the one who curses you I'll curse and then this little line at the end comes like a punch line like what for what's the purpose why is God selecting I'm going to make this guy great nation so that all the families of the earth will be blessed review that opens up this plotline God's purpose is to restore All Nations but he's doing it through one particular Nation glass is activating what we saw in the garden.
 yes God bless the humans and appointed them is his image before that and now he's making one family the vehicle of that Eden blessing cuz last is a very fairly common kind of thing we say and Christian God bless you God bless you or I guess some people sneeze you also said but is that the only I don't know we live in Portland no one says the word blessed
 do you guys stay blessed and texted left
 God blessed Texas that's really interesting but does it does it sound religious to you is it is it a word that's connected to religious vocabulary know we got to know if you got it sorta says that to you good tidings I hope I hope life goes well for you alright Christmas is the keyword that you supposed to upload the whole Eden image of God humans ruling in the abundance by God's grace when someone says God bless you I'm supposed to be thinking about ya I want to be an image of a human
 who rules the world of God and abundance specifically within about Garden abundance as a gift of God Is Not What goes through my mind 17 this is where Abraham's name gets changed to Abraham and here's the contact that you actually read it was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abraham and said to him I am God Almighty El Shaddai Amy Grant have a song
 walk before me and be blameless I will establish my Covenant between me and you and I will multiply you exceedingly Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with you and you will be the father of a multitude of Nations no longer shall your name be called Abram but your names of the Abraham or I will make you the father of a multitude of Nations I have made you exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of you I wonder what the main plant of the speeches I noticed the two key words of the Eden blessing what God said in Genesis 1 be fruitful and multiply so notice the word blessing is not used but the content of the Eden blessing is used explicitly be fruitful and multiply that will come from Abraham that the whole
 storyline of the Hebrew Bible is going to focus on through Isaac and then through Isaac Jacob whose names changed to Israel so not just on one sub Nation from him Abraham is being appointed to hear as the father of the nation's many nations of you is that a specific translation I will kind of symmetry here I'll make you a father of the multitude of Nations no longer avram you are awesome the father of the multitude of Nations to see it's a little time so guess what school is that this word multitude down here it's the word Harmon Harmon and it's that it's the key to the
 play at work in his name cuz his name is changed from of wrong which is to Hebrew words obviously with father and then ROM is the word exalted that's a pretty sweet man exalted father is name is changed to rod and he says is your name is change who I am because you'll be a hum of Nations to get it it's good it's good so yeah God takes the harm of Jamon and then takes the on the basically all it results in for English is putting a check in there but it creates time which rhymes with Jamon in the next line of work I do that salted father yeah that's right many of multitude so then it becomes
 becomes is kind of a mix between both of them where are what you hear in context is exalted father of a multitude of Nations the storyline of the Hebrew Bible is about how God is going to restore Humanity to be his faithful Christine Divine image being Partners through the family of Abraham which includes more than Israel
 actually that's not the case it's about God and humanity and God through Abraham to include all of the nations in the narrative focuses then going to focus in on one strand of Abraham's family and that the Covenant promise uniquely gets attached to and that Covenant promise ends up in the Covenant partnership with that one particular subfamily of Abraham but the whole package is always about all of the nation's that's what the whole movement of the story is going towards in the Hebrew Bible it's okay if it's not a significant know I didn't think we've talked about a lot but you actually just recently filmed a class on introductory Bible and you talked about how the main plot if you think of a story you've got a main plot and then there's like a lot of subplots and stories yes like a really good really good stories
 with like long serial episode egg dramas with all these like subplots and stuff and the subplots really interesting but they all filled up to the main plot in you kind of showed how the main flies got in humanity you get the Genesis 12 here and we begin a subplot that is going to continue for a long time and it's about God and the nation's through God and one particular Nation the family this real this at length before and got invites this one family of Israel which is one sub families Abraham into a covenant partnership and specifically these are the lines from Exodus chapter 19 or actually can I get so sorry don't be sorry Genesis 17 then I'll make nations of you do some people interpret that as he's going to have you know cuz he has that's right
 different nations dude develop from Abraham where does he go live in the East and then you have all these other Jacob has his 12 sons what happened to those guys will they become the 12-step 43 the end up or two and a half Ruben God and the half tribe of Manasseh the ended up on the east side of the Jordan and so what happens is that you keep having this West and East Division number of a video on setting in the how to read the Bible series and so the East and the West the East becomes this conglomerate of like the kind of add-ons or the extra families and then they become in the prophets important narrative images about how in the Messianic Kingdom you have the reintegration not just of the tribes of Israel
 incorporation of all of the nations of the East into the family of Abraham which is larger than the family of Israel fall thought this was important to fall in and all of this is one family just give me he doesn't use my family he appoints the family of Israel as his Covenant Partners if you listen listen this is twice as good Hebrew way of really really listening I am as they don't has the English word obey there's no word for obey in Hebrew it's the word for All Day in Hebrew Shema Shema Shema Israel will be God's special possession listen all the land is mine I have a lot of Nations I can work with here but you are appointed as the kingdom of priests how does the family of Israel
 Hangouts faithful Covenant partners
 not awesome so then what God has to do is pick one particular Clan out of the family of Israel namely the family of David and in the an important speech to David God says I'm going to raise up your seed after you from the Royal Line and God will establish his kingdom the seed will build a house and he's going to sit on the divine's around forever and ever sit on a throne of spring to Abraham to Israel to David and then to wants his huge narrowing in the subplot of the Bible and then how does David do at the in God's image ruling Israel Solomon comes along how does he do and you just why it's like every every one of the seed of David steps up to the plate and strikes out they had some like they said Cinema
 that's right Solomon Hezekiah is going to come he's at least going to be like how David was on a good day and a good day yeah that's kind of good day but ultimately that they'll fail and so ends with the exile to Babylon and you left with this whole history of promises that's left hanging and so what you start getting in the prophets and The Poets of the Hebrew Bible they reflect back on this story and they're studying it and then they begin to project out into the future of what this new human this new seed this new Abraham new David will be like and you get things like so I made that we talked about before trust me for getting to the New Testament letters
 so you get things like some it which we talked about at length it's a meditation on Genesis 1 in the image of God So It Begins by How Majestic is God's name in the heavens when I look up at the skies and I think about the rulers above that you appointed what is human that you even think about him the son of human that you take care of him you made him lower than the Elohim is the Hebrew word Elohim have you guys listen to God serious at all. Yeah so I think the New American Standard puts in a little note that says it could mean Spiritual Beings here and I think that's correct cuz he just talked about them there the sun moon is tired and anyway the biblical David so you made them a little lower and otherwise they're not they don't rule from the sky is yellow
 those are the ones whom he has the elevated to be the Divine image ruling in the west the whole point here to rule over everything and then it goes on to give the list of creatures from Genesis one that's crucial another crucial portrait of this future seed comes from the most quoted and alluded to Old Testament text in the whole new testament Miller is if you did like a popularity vote important get the whole thing together they would all say Psalm 110 quoted and alluded to in almost every day in every Apostle and then all the gospels Jesus himself did a whole session on this with the Pharisees in the passion narrative and it's a farm about David's and you know what Yahweh one day I overheard you always speaking to my Lord
 some figure always said to my Lord yeah because it's the first Lord is the all-caps first Lord and the speaker is the voice of David which raises the question of how who does David think is his Lord what is separate from Yahweh
 when when Jesus brought this up to the leaders in Jerusalem what he landed. He thinks it's been the seed of David, that part but the snake Crusher forward to the coming of the future seed who will sit and share God's Divine rule by sitting at the right hand of the Divine Throne whose enemies are I put under his feet and who rules from Zion in the midst of his enemies this is one of the most quoted lines in the New Testament appears like a drum beats rather woman testing
 twin go through the line of David and when this future see this is called the servant can't just one point to register here and Isaiah 49 this servant figure is given to do a mission by god named late too as he has a Mission to Israel to raise up the tribes of Israel and restore the preserved ones with the tribes of Jacob preserved ones of Israel so his mission is to family this real but then also to be a light to the nation so that God's you sure his name is the Hebrew word for salvation so that my Jesus and the last paragraph of the book of Isaiah
 vision of when the Messianic seed in the servant has done his thing to get his wife to restore Israel and the and the nation and Zion is exalted is the cosmic Temple and so on this is Ian being the New Jerusalem New Jerusalem Jerusalem being with the temple that I had a devil and that Temple was a symbol of God's Heavenly throne in the whole Cosmos which is on the back of that will marry Heaven and Earth on the last page of the Bible and God speaking he says because of what they have planned and done and that's the previous contacts do I have time to talk about it God says I am about to come
 and gather the people of all Nations and languages and they will come see my glory that image of all the nations streaming up to the New Jerusalem ruled by the Messianic King I will set a sign among them I'm going to install the Messianic King and all the nations will come and see and then I'm going to send some of those with come out to the remnant of the nation's we've been reared here we have this list of Nations that comes from Genesis chapter 10 table of Nations go to my fan and see my glory so out of the Jerusalem when the Messianic King is installed there will be sent out those who talk about God's payment glory and what they're going to do those who go out is Proclaim my glory among the Nations and then they will begin to bring your people from all the nations back to Jerusalem as a no
 bring to the Lord live in the New Jerusalem the Messianic King is ruling these go out it's like they're a bunch of Nations have come in already but not everybody knows so this other groups going to go out and tell everybody about the ruling king of creation and then bring in these nations not Gentiles as an offering the sacrificial language images. So not to kill them they constitute an offering us their bodies are a Living Sacrifice
 and I'm not joking about that I think that's actually the Nations become a thank-you offering the come give their homage and allegiance to the Messianic King exalted over creation and what is also going to do is Select some of those non Israelites to join the priesthood of the family of Israel people group is called the kingdom of priests yeah but now the nations are coming in to give their allegiance to the Messianic King and they are going to join the priesthood of the kingdom of priests when Peter and write a letter to Gentiles is First Peter to Gentiles Peters a representative of Jesus Messiah
 and he's writing to the followers of Jesus spread throughout Asia Minor which is today equivalent kind of to the boundaries of modern-day turkey and he can in chapter to start talking to these mixed audiences Jew and Gentile and talk about how y'all are living stones
 being built up as a spiritual house house Meats temple temple oh you left cuz I said it's cool but it's not funny I just saw y'all are both being built as a temple and as a priesthood you're the priest in the temple these Gentiles are the Jews are the temple where you're offering up spiritual sacrifice is acceptable to God through Jesus Messiah and he's going to go on and talk about how y'all are a chosen people the royal priesthood a holy night is he is quoting from that passage in Exodus to be ready earlier so far is the whole point is that for God to have Royal Priestly image bearing humans ruling Stewart in the world on his behalf and that program gets narrow down
 to the Messianic seed of David in the storyline of the Hebrew Bible and then projected back out to include all the nations that's what the whole book like this about and so what you going to see the apostles see themselves in the moment painted for us by the ending of the book of Isaiah they see themselves acting out the script of the last page of the Isaiah scroll down for claiming the glory and bringing in the nation's as an offering and so that they can join the priesthood and it's not just the expansion of Israel it's the realization of God's promise to Abraham all along that he would be the father of multitude of nation who will experience the the blessings of the new the new creation okay great so for example go to the opening paragraph of Paul's letter to the Romans set apart for the the good news the royal
 compliment from God what is that well I just read the Hebrew Bible he says his promise beforehand through the prophets in the Holy scriptures read the Hebrew Bible and the gospel it's about God son who comes from the line of David according to the flesh but did he was declared publicly for step forward as God Son with power by his resurrection from the dead according to the holy spirit's Jesus Messiah our Lord and through him we have received the gift Grace means gift we have received a gift of apostleship we'll talk about that later in these conversations being just as Deputy is representative has appointed representative so we are the point of Representatives of Jesus Messiah and look what he says we're bringing about literally Greek is
 word obedience and then look the word faith different translations like The New American Standard is verse five that obedience that comes from face I forget there's a scholar Matthew Bates has been very helpful book on the meaning of Faith Justice and beliefs and vocabulary and Paul makes a strong argument that it would means is I believe in loyalty or Allegiance here another words they believe they are actually believing loyalty would be a good translation of The Obedience of Fame for his namesake among the Gentiles okay so watch this thread through we'll talk about Romans in the series I think Romans would be a great example in this video that we can work as an illustration of a Roman says that famous wine that I alluded to in Romans chapter 12 famous bible verse I heard you brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy to off
 your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy and pleasing to God was very interesting this your is a texting you is that right hold on hold on
 yes okay so this is significant so by the mercy of God that all y'all that you present all y'all's bodies
 is that right
 it's been right in that's grammatically correct Texan
 you don't just say 2% y'alls bodies all y'all
 all right okay no this is acting this is so wonderful this is none of this will make it a point to 2% all y'all's body as a singular sacrifice body is a singular body's yours plural bodies is plural or singular
 singular I think it's a hugely important this is a good example where we want to view these letters Dropped Out of Heaven A Divine word to me right in the 21st century about so we have to respect what he is talking about is the United house churches of Rome
 are to be unified together as a singular sacrifice because the whole point is that there's division in fracture in this house churches of room and the as far as we can tell from the last chapter of Romans there's five or six house churches in room maybe two hundred followers of Jesus in the room they're divided into about half-a-dozen house churches and they started fighting over ethnic boundary lines Jewish and non-jewish talk about this more later this is a hugely important context for understanding the letter to the Romans and so what the Theology and argument of the letter to the Romans is trying to get them to see that they are one family in the Messiah and so he's calling especially on these churches to unify to present themselves as a sacrifice wait for it if you rise to these churches that he's trying to unify so that they will together offer themselves as a singular sacrifice
 to God he starts telling them about Hey listen I want to come I want to come to you because I've written you very boldly on some points to remind you again because of the grace that was giving me to God to be a minister of Messiah Jesus to the Gentiles ministering as a priest the good news of God uses the language like is in the courts of the temple as he's doing his Priestly duties that's what he's doing is announcing the good news to the nation's
 so that my offering of the non-jews the nations may be acceptable and Sanctified by the Holy Spirit and what is going to go on to say is listen member of the guests that is a ranging from all of the non-jewish churches to bring to the poor dear is collecting money from all the churches of Gentile non-jewish leaders from all these churches to go with him to the offering of the non-jewish churches to the Messianic Jews in Jerusalem he's going to bring all of these non-jewish people to Jerusalem and he calls them and offering they are the sacrifice you can also plan out Isaiah 66 this is the context of the letters all of these letters were written in the first decade of the Jesus movement expanding
 cross cultural and ethnic boundary lines into Greek and Roman territory in the whole vision and what the apostles are trying to enact is the script of the story of when the Messianic King is installed in Zion his emissaries go out and bring in the Gentiles so that all Humanity can become the kingdom of priests and the new image of God and so this is why the letters are going to be all about tackling the cultural conflicts and the ethnic conflicts that come up as a family of Abraham gets reintegrated into a lot of these problem verses about slaves about gender about what people wear how people should behave when they're gathering in the churches this is all related to trying to create one new family that gets along despite their cultural ethnic and gender differences and so it seems to me understanding how
 letters fit in this has immense potential I think for the followers of Jesus today because this isn't just about Theology and ethics this is about creating next door and it's about getting people to elevate their allegiance to Jesus over their socio-economic National ethnic gender boundary lines anybody
 animal
 I cannot imagine a more important message and we lose all of that when we don't honor the biblical narrative text so I really hope we can get the least capture some of this in the video so great
 all rise again my name is Andrew in the pastor here and I get the privilege of asking some great question so here's Gabe's question Tim which is related to what you just close with these days we are not immersed in the Hebrew Bible if we missed some of these important points of the letters but neither were the Gentile Christians immersed in the Hebrew Bible when they first came to faith in Christ so how did the letters function them and hat and then to us who are not yet experts in the Hebrew Bible how do we know what we don't know and how do we approach it in that way yep yep yeah yeah you know I've used this before but it's like when you know when I don't listen to a ton of classical music but I try it when I'm studying because I feel smarter
 fire in your mind I'm really hoping for a really deep levels and I can't explain to you almost anything that's going on in terms of composition music theory and all that kind of stuff but I do have some friends who are really in the music history in music theory and we can both sit in the room and listen to the same Beethoven piece and I'm like having much shallower experience but I still experience it and it's beautiful and what they experience is like genius and it's not that one of them's wrong it's just cultivate the awareness in the skill set and so that's how that's how I think it is with Paul he doesn't let the biblical illiteracy of his audience to term and how he talked yeah he talks as a Jew whose immersed in the text of the scripture is still really a cool image
 if you and be important correct but then you can go deeper level and suspend you or Paul's drawing that and invited just bring me like two and a half with these people and so he's taught them like how to read the scriptures and how to listen to them and how the stories all work together so even non-jewish audiences that didn't grow up with the scriptures one of the main ways that the New Testament didn't exist yet and it's early. So the scriptures that they're teaching from our Old Testament but I think we should look at the limitations of the audience become a limitation of the authors cuz they clearly are on the next level terms of their understanding of the Old Testament other parts of the Bible there's a lot of questions here about composition and the distribution of these letters and even is the scriptural nature as they're being written it's obvious that would
 I think that whoever had a hand in giving us the final form of the Torah you can tell these are going to be waiting for a long time how much do you think the authors of the letters assume that there were to be being read and posterity maybe not thousands of years later but surely Generations later Thunder there isn't necessarily did Paul and vision a thousand years later people around the world reading his letters who knows did he think that he was a moment in the cosmic story when the story of Israel through its of the Messianic King was now expanding its reach to include all of the Nations and so what he had to say didn't just have to do with one people at one time anymore it was a part of the expanse of reach of the Messianic Kingdom and I do think that's what you thought it just comes out everywhere
 and so it's not quite did they know they're riding the Bible I don't know I don't think so however Paul did think of his Apostolic instruction and by Apostolic I mean Representatives appointed by Jesus to expand the kingdom I do think that's how the apostles thought of themselves for example this is why I like the word deputies
 is the famous line from the last census of the Gospel of Matthew called the Great Commission Jesus is talking to the actual disciples the small crew on Hilltop and Jesus came up to them and spoke and said all authority has been given to me and Heaven on Earth that's the whole Son of Man story of the lion and theme video right there an exalted human ruling over having an ass so what he does is then deputized this group to go represent him to all of the nation's making disciples baptizing them and instructing them to live by The Sermon on the Mount to teach all that I have commanded to you this is in the gospel of Matthew where do I go to know where Jesus teaches something called the apostles are being commissioned as his Representatives with his authority to go create the expanded family of Abraham and Sao Paulo
 who sings that sounds kind of intense to us yeah this from 1st Thessalonians so he would you got to be here for like a month and Cecil are okay had to run out of town he writes a letter back and he reflects back on the first week or so of when they were there and look what he says he says we thank God continually because when you received the word of God which you heard from us you accepted it not as a human word but as it actually is a word of God which is at work among you who believe and then at the end of that very letter he says I charge you before the Lord read this letter to everybody all the other house churches that are spreading and spreading look at this line This is in 2nd Peter chapter 3 be right to his audience I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the prophets Old Testament
 I also want you to recall the command given by our Lord and savior through the apostles and here is talking about the teaching of the Apostles and then he says now bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation and listen our dear brother Paul is so into that scene in his teachings and he writes to you with the wisdom that God gave him he writes the same way and all of his letters speaking about these things and let's be honest his letters contain things that are hard to understand he's really unclear sometimes and here's the thing is when Paul is unclear guess what people take his words they misunderstand him and they misrepresented him this is a warning in the New Testament to read Paul and context because if you don't you'll misunderstand and misrepresent him as they do with the rest of the Bible so I know this is a long answer but I'm trying to say
 Apostles are very aware that they are representing Jesus has Authority that when they are announcing the good news about Jesus they don't see it as just like I was thinking it's a Divine word summon in the nation's to believe in loyalty into Jesus so I do think the apostles had a sense that the letters that they were riding we're apart of Jesus divine Authority and whether they thought it would get collected all together one day I don't know it's interesting to think about that to me that's not the most important question it's did they think that they were writing words from God and it seems to me that they did see themselves
 Clayton wants to know this is a fascinating question I think many scholars say that certainly some of the letters predate the gospels on this podcast I heard a I'd say that he thinks maybe Galatians is the earliest documents written down the question is did the New Testament letters ever influence the gospels get right and those hyperlinks going that way we should have another question related to that is and we just had a direct illusion from Peter about Paul do the letters contain hyperlinks to each other These Quiet indirect Illusions the first one is about the letters influence the gospels the second one to the letters reference each other in an indirect way yeah it's really interesting so you're just In this passage of 2nd Peter 1st Peter reflecting on the collections of Paul's letters being distributed around the early church really interesting area there's a scholar named David drobish
 a German scholar but he's his Works have been translated into English and he's probably represents kind of The Cutting Edge of that conversation about when things started being collected in relation to each other and who was aware of whom and how are they connected together as far as hyperlinks that's the way of the New Testaments a bit different than the Hebrew Bible is all these letters are truly coming into existence in different circumstances from each other and the collection happens at a later stage think of it it's kind of like think of a garden nursery each of the letters is like a potted plant and then as the more potted plants are brought into the nursery like the letters they get collected together next to each other the Hebrew Bible is not like that the Hebrew Bible is much more like in Aspen Grove that is one RuPaul underneath that gives birth to a whole Forest
 and even though there's an older part of the forest the Torah it is also simultaneously growing and interconnected with the other trees of the forest and that's why the hyperlink in nature of the Hebrew Bible is of a different nature than in the New Testament or something interesting The crucial issues at work in the New Testament letters are all related to what we just looked at the related to the culture clashes happening and so huge focus on circumcision and food diets and calendars if people are living by this like a major issue the laws of the Torah how do you say them how much how many ants are when you get into the gospels which posed a the letters the events predate the letters the compositions post a the letters those issues are not the issues what's an issue there is Jesus and there are Sabbath issues the Sabbath controversies but the way the Sabbath functions in the gospels is different than the debate and that's
 because what it tells us is that the gospels as work compositions aren't just written in light of the controversies happening in the early church cuz we would expect to see Jesus in controversies about food laws and circumcision then so on and he's not and so what that I think that gives us some leverage to see the gospels are genuinely preserving these stories and teachings about Jesus from the period before those were the issues that doesn't make any sense but it's close on this one I love this question this is about referencing Colossians 4:15 Paul says give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at laodicea antonym for and the church in her house so the question is what was a new testament House Church like
 yeah I know Wonderful historical fiction novel buy a new testament scholar Bruce Longnecker it's called The Lost letters of pergamum it's entertaining you learn so much about the first century and it's all set in a handful of first-century churches in pergamum it's the Lord's day so it's your meeting on Resurrection Sunday and yeah he's pulled together the benefactor or host so let's say nympha who knows he's a merchant something like that and so she's got an Atrium in her house that can fit maybe twenty-five people she probably on some slaves and so the slaves will come and maybe one of her slaves is married and they have some kids then she has some co-workers maybe another Merchant wealthy but maybe
 she is a Clawson but the southern merchants in Macedonia and he moved here cuz the purple fabric trade off the charts right now and whatever it's then so but then you're going to have some like Craftsman and then you can have some Messianic Jews and then they're going to bring a couple of Jewish friends who don't know what they think yet but they say they will do you know they like the free food. That into the family of this other maybe some like some tentmakers or whatever they worked on in the market So the plan is socioeconomically ethnically diverse and then they all come together and they sit at the same table and when nympha invites another Merchant whose comes to the gathering this other Merchants let's just call her seriously or something she is freaking out because she has never once in her life eating at the same table as a slave
 cuz you eat at the same table with somebody that means that they're your equal and never has she's sitting at the same table with orphans who were like letting you know abandoned by their parents and so they have a meal together they sing hymns nympha maybe offers a prayer or a prophecy were teaching from retelling the story and then you have maybe some other Elders in the community and they made for an afternoon and sing hymns and tell stories about Jesus and share and teach each other and then they kiss each other as they leave
 I want to go to that but anyway I think but it can all go terribly wrong read the letter to the Corinthians and you can have the wealthy people start separating himself off and sitting at different tables or even worse the wealthy people eat all of the food before the people of the lower class for the slaves can come because they actually had to do a day's work before they come in the missing the point and then you got some people who is there like recent converts from the Dionysus occult they're used to speaking in tongues all right and so they're being their learning how to channel their experience of speaking in other languages but now and allegiance to Jesus but they interrupt each other all the time and it becomes this contest and so Paul has to write what do you write in the letter to Corinthians in Saint anyway I think I think about you I got it thank you thank you Kim
