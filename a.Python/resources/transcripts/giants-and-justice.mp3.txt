today on the podcast exploring a heavy topic Hot Topic many people call Divine violence be in Deuteronomy and some of the Scrolls that follow Deuteronomy in the Hebrew Bible instructs Israel to move into the land of Canaan and conquer the people who live there the theme of Israel's entering into the land where another group of people is living dispossessing them engaging them in war killing them and that all of this is at God's command This is highly disturbing every person I know reading the stories in the Bible including myself this is really uncomfortable it's hard enough that humans are violence against other humans why would God ever condone violence we're not going to make excuses for it we're going to try to seek in understanding the Biblical narrative is trying to tell her that it's humans who are taking life and
 God is doing is accelerating to its natural end this thing that humans have already set in motion humans were ruining the land they were going to undo what God had created all life on a course towards death you see Deuteronomy employees language which hyperlinks it to the Genesis School comparing the people who live in the land of Canaan to the Giants in Genesis 6 the Nephilim that evil human demon hybrids who are so violent and corrupt that God had to bring a flood of Justice upon the Earth to wipe them out when a human culture gives itself over to death and practices that lead to death which they think are good that's Genesis 3 through 11 but the portrait there so here's these people groups in the land are portrayed as a people group that are too far gone like the generation of fly to today to Mackey and I tackle the fine
 portion of the first movement of the Deuteronomy scroll I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us
 play Tim hey John where in Deuteronomy yes we are and we are more exactly in the first movement of Deuteronomy which is chapters 1 through 11 here we are Israel is at the Jordan River ready to enter into the promised land the land of milk and honey the good eatin land where there will live long lives if they adhere to the Divine command and wisdom that here as a new word cling to word I suppose it is the Geico that means yeah yeah yeah or to cling on to war to listen the main theme of our previous conversation last episode now what we want to talk about today I was just get right into it okay is there's another theme in these three sermons in the first movement of Deuteronomy
 about Giants and just real quick there's actually multiple kind of subservience three big Hood River unit in this opening movement will be call chapters 1 through 34 is the center and then chapters 5 through 11 or like speeches within sub speeches and so on so there's actually multiple little sermon Nets woven together until like a mega 3 part was out just to clarify yeah that's good I was in the picture in my mind
 and throughout it is a lot of discussion about the Giants they're going to run into in the land and yeah these big old humans Emirates and so you can set this up relaxation thing you know we haven't yet talked much about this thing happens a lot in the Bible and we're going to run into a lot in Joshua but it happens if these specific store is in Deuteronomy and Joshua is worth mainly brought up brought up a little bit before this but because it is so disturbing to what for lots of reasons the steam of Israel's entering into the land where another group of people is living just possessing them engaging Diamond War killing them and that all of this is at God's command This is highly disturbing to every person I know reading the stories in the Bible
 shooting myself so I've four years have been pondering and try reading way too many books on the topic but also am wanting to learn how to read the stories on their own terms but also honoring the challenges that they presented me and my friends and everybody I know so I want to begin to move towards that as we go through to draw me here cuz this section is Rodney contains the first commands to go into the Landon kick out the king of it so we'll full-on as we move forward into Joshua one day God willing will have to explore those narratives but I want to explore the steam here and honor in that it's a part of Moses's speeches here and the Giants Steve with the Giants actually really keen understanding what it all means let's first go to where Moses first brings up the Giants
 and it's in Deuteronomy chapter one he's going to recount how they got from there slavery in Egypt up till right now standing by the River Jordan about going to the land is going to be tell that story and they specifically he's going to focus on how we set out from horrabin that or up is another name for Mount Sinai and then 1:20 Moses says I said to you hate we've come to the Hill Country of the amorites so I'm riots is kind of a meta category or a people group that's already living in the land of Canaan land promised to Abraham so the amorites so what you owe your God has placed before you go take possession of It Don't Be Afraid don't be the Smith
 so you all approached me and said who let send spies and here we go this is the story of the spies that Moses is recalling so we talked about how we took 12 Spies sent them into the lands they went in they took from the fruit of the land they brought it back and we saw it and they said it's good the land they always given to us but there's 26 you were not willing to go up you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God
 and you grumbled in your tents saying he brought us out of Egypt to give us into the hands of the amorites and they're going to destroy us where can we go or brothers that does the spies have melted Our Hearts by saying this is a report that spies brought back the people are bigger and taller than we are there cities are large and fortified they reach up to the skies and in addition we saw the sons of the Hannah came there the owner came on again I guess we got em rights yeah and them right there connected to people who are huge and they live in huge City the cities are so huge the city's reach up to the skies yeah which is a hyperlink to Tower of Babylon so just hold that cuz that's important connect a whole bunch of other hyperlinks back to
 1311 so cities that we took to the skies connected to people that are huge and they're called amorites and on Hakeem so this whole section of Deuteronomy is like a hyperlink trail of bread crumbs and you just got to keep following all the way back. Anakin is a reference to the sons of anak and in the actual narrative the Moses retelling a story here the actual narrative is told in the previous Scrolls of the Torah in Numbers Chapter 13 and in that story the spies go in and it says they saw the three sons of anak their their names are awesome on Shea and Tall my the seed of a knock and then they say they see more of the earth is called the seed of a knock and then the narrator this interesting in numbers in numbers 13 the narrator has the people say the narrator has the
 what's the numbers 1333 we also saw their the Nephilim and then the narrator causes the story that says Dear reader if you confuse the sons of anak the huge giant sons of anak there from the Nephilim and then the people keep speaking again and we were like grasshoppers in their eyes and they were huge so now we've got the Nephilim from Genesis chapter 6 The Warrior like spiritual Being Human hybrid voyeurs who Unleashed violence in the land is all being connected together and this is actually really significant for understanding what it is that you always asking is real to do as they enter in the lamps the first artist to focus on there's these inhabitants of the land who are already there and they are called amorites they're huge to call Donna came in the Hanukkah game to send from the Nephilim trail of breadcrumbs up to this moment and to upload the
 flame from Genesis 5 that's the story of the sons of God are the sons of God the son developing the essence of Elohim the Spiritual Beings are false narrative anything that that woman human women are good and wanted to take them and then cream is awesome like you called it a human Define Elohim hybrid that seems to be with the narrative implies in Genesis but it actually is a combination of a hybrid creature boasts human but also more than human who is also a giant who are often the kings of vampires and their powerful and they're important and they are like this close to God as you can get and so they're like honored but here in this narrative it's actually this kind of new twist which is those giant
 Warrior kings that everyone's all on about their problem yeah they're mutants they represent an invasion of chaos and death into the land and their Altima and is returning to the chaos from which they emerged okay so we're like jumping into a right here so both in Deuteronomy and in Genesis these hyperlinks a really strong between the inhabitants of the land and the set of Rebel figures from Genesis 1 through 11 so what I want to do finish painting their portrait in Moses the speeches so we fully understand like the role that they play in Moses's Beach and then go back and see that the role of the Giants and how they are intertwined with the Canaanites in the on Hakeem in the Giants and cities that reach up to the skies they are all set on clothes analogy to the explosion of evil
 and of the seed of the snake and a human violence and Evil
 spiraling out of control in Genesis 1 through 11 requiring a great Act of D creation that will reset the land so that God can replant it as a place of Eden blessing in other words the portrait of evil spiraling out of control in Genesis 12 11 that leads from the snake to Kane to Lemak to the Nephilim to Nimrod to the building of Babylon reaching up the sky is that whole sequence right there is being replayed and recalled in Moses the speeches and Deuteronomy 1 through 11 of us a fusion of spiritual level and manatee together that's manifesting in Cheyenne Warriors before we walked through maybe more text the show it but I'm just giving you certain of this works is that the amorites anakites in the Canaanites living in the land are presented on analogy to.
 Spiral of evil and violence polluting the land with the blood of the innocent from Genesis 1 through 11 requiring a flood a new flat and got two judgment and that is precisely how Israel's conquest of the land is presented is as a human sled of divine judgment on the snake diet inhabitants of the land
so this raises all kinds of alarms for me and I've all kinds of problems with that it's personally challenges that that raises for me but I want I'm trying to do is you know that the discipline in biblical scholarship in biblical studies is before I react to the Bible I at least want to First understand what it's saying on its own terms and so that's been a big part in the effort in trying to understand this team and this has helped me at least understand what the narratives are doing on their own terms so I guess I just told you my conclusion normally what I do is just lead you on the trail through a bunch of Google text for an hour and then like I tried some time but I guess I just gave you my son me right there so tell me what you hear in that summary and then maybe we can hop into some particular difficult text yeah and Genesis 1 through 11 we've established an idea which is that there are two rulers
 and God's creation. The room is above the hosts of Heaven that I love him and they have their place and then there's a ruler is below the humans and the humans are then given this task to be God's image to rule the cosmos in the garden land in the garden and then you get this Narrative of a snake who is a beast of the garden land who is not happy with this setup yeah it seems to kind of know about the way God works yeah Banks and he deceives the humans to not want to partner with God and particularly to take what will lead them to death and presented as the way to Lifan Liberation & Power yeah you can become a Lavigne the snake says take from the Tree of knowing good and bad the tree of understanding and take it out on your own terms God's command is not the way till you become a
 do you truly made to be you can have it without you can do it by taking it for yourself and then they're exiled and then we get the story where Cain and Abel two brothers want to come back into the garden and possum went out of any wrecks out on the garden Joy God tells woman there's going to be two seed coming out of this lineage has the seed of the woman and the seed of the snake like a scrappy snake and there's going to be Perpetual hostility between these two seeds is your lineage has is two powers powers and ultimately a seed will come from the woman that will crush the head of the snake that snake is going to be grabbing after the heel and that's near the woman that strike it swell
 so when you walk into the next narrative about two seeds of the woman can and Abel Kan is presented with a choice because of what God does which favors Brothers offering and Cain is tempted to be angry and jealous and what God says is that temptation is sin which is like a crouching animal at the door and it wants you so the same animal that tempted his parents is reappearing now before can but in the form called send and this is the narrator's way of saying this is Kane's moment at the tree with his choice like his parents and so the moment he murders his brother
 he's a seed of the woman but he becomes he comes under the influence of the snake as it were and it's the Nerdist way of saying that anybody can become a snake lying through their choices and so Kayon begins a lineage of the snake he becomes see the snake and then you have two lines after that you have the next son of Adam and Eve and Seth and then you have the line of kin and both have genealogy is in the line of can just gets out of control with violence and chopping heads off for you yeah yeah that's great so yeah you got this interplay between the Spiritual Beings and how they've kind of injected their ways and their power into the humans spiritual being who works through the lie and The Lure of doing what's good in your own eye
 got that established by the time you get to Genesis 5 and that line leads to the building of the first city okay in line. The building of the first city and then there's lots of violence and then you get to a King whose like just boasting yeah in his vile about his violent a compliment on how like then the power of the snake is in has corrupted Humanity to a degree where he just posting and just like killing his fellow humans sweat and God says the blood of the innocent cries out from the ground which becomes than the through-line to why there needs to be a flood correct to wash its rightful and then that you get the story about the sons of elegant it before the Todd you get a story and it's framed in the story frame now in the time of violence or has it has it framed will just begins it just says when men began when a dumb
 begin to multiply on the land daughters were born to the humans and the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of human that they were good and they took for themselves this is linking now this idea of Adam and Eve seeing the fruit was good and taking that led to their Exile and fall here is now more Spiritual Beings and then more Spiritual Beings seeing that humans are good and it's kind of ripping on this idea of this contention between the two and their fall is to mix to try to like what God separate has his two powers and was good I was above as below they're coming to mix together they see that the women are good it takes me to take them and they let their children elicit
 joining of Sky rulers and land rulers but for some devious purpose so what you always says is well we have whole podcast episodes on the song called I just want to refer back to them but what God does is he essentially says like nope not down for this human is a flesh creature and the clock starts ticking today 120 years could refer to limited life span like more likely refers to setting the clock before the great decreation that's going to I'm going to happen Scotland months all this and then you know it's really interesting in the day of the that whole thing went down Genesis 6:4 you know who just happened to be in the land in those days the Giants the Nephilim were there in those days and also afterwards cuz they're going to reappear in numbers and Deuteronomy dear reader so just
 beware beware the Genesis 6 verse 4 is written from the perspective of someone who knows the first flood that these creatures are going to also be in the land when the Israelites get there in the days of Noah so Nephilim were there these were the gibberish game
 Mighty violent Warriors of old men of the name men who gained a reputation through a military prowess than violent glory and again these are often the revered like Warrior Kings yeah basically this little bit right here Genesis 6 1 through 4 is like the Saturday Night Live on a political agenda propaganda down in Egypt over in this area and over in Babylon famously the Gilgamesh epic which is fascinating things unto itself but presents its main hero as Gilgamesh the king of these ancient Mesopotamian Empires as 2/3 human and 1/3 / but he's Offspring spiritual being in any human and he's the founder of you know the great Empires that were found in the same place that will lead the Babylon do if so that's the motif
 that the store is satirizing and saying no this is not the birth of the heroes and honorable ones evolved this is another invasion of evil and Chaos in trying to introduce death into the Human family which God has destined for Life yeah so this is a Biblical way of thinking about when she Manatee become so corrupted by the power of sin and transformed by it that we've learned that can get to a point where God says like the Injustice is so great I need to wash the earth clean of it is not angry in the story he's grieved and what he sees is that Genesis 6 verse 11 the land is corrupted
 implied through the whole chain and all the innocent blood the land was filled with violence so God looks upon an already ruined Creation in the flood is the means of purging it of evil and recreating it so that you can plant the seed of a new Remnant see his woman and restart the Eden Mission and that's a yeah that's the story so God accelerates and brings to its natural end a course of self ruin that creation was set upon by the seed of snake which is can Lemak and the Nephilim in the pilot words fall out human life story in fact I was watching these kind of social commentator comic people they go on the street with protesters and everything to try to make them look silly but in a very kind of ironic way
 and one of the things I saw them do was go to people at pro-life Rally's we're also Christians and talk about it was the Bible pro-life and they were saying that I was short and then they've got yeah you know except for that story where God kills everybody in the world by flood and they do a couple different times and then there's cuss speechless there's no yeah like I guess that's pretty gnarly yeah it is gnarly and it is normally yeah but it's also interesting when you look at this the way that the story is presented it's because humans become so violent and infected with like violent killing each other that God does he takes away life isn't interested like it's something really hard to deal with but then also there's a layer deeper of getting into like there is some justice and also wanted to protect the opportunity for life
 so one fundamental difference that I think the biblical authors have from maybe how we see the world in our social location is they presume that God is the author of life has the authority certainly the authority and power to take my life just one piece and whatever we might do that is offensive or power Tripper but that's just how they saw the world second is that the biblical narrative is trying to tell us that it's humans who are taking life up to this point it's the humans they're taking why and what God is doing is accelerating to its natural end the thing that humans have already set in motion which is to kill each other which is to kill each other and so God brings that to its natural end which is the humans are all going to destroy each other
 if that's the Natural end of humans is maybe not everyone is going to kill everyone sure I thought there was something so corrupted the story was painting it that humans were ruining the land they were going to undo what God had created and set all life on a course towards death that's the point of the story so I'm just thinking about you know this technique was trying to use the Bible to defeat the Bible of thing very clear point of the narrative is that it's human Humanity's fault for ruining each other and leading out of course what's a thing God is sort of like the one you know who's just making the hard call was just saying listen like this game is over I'm just going to call her tomorrow instead of like you play five more Innings where they're just pointless so I think that's the point of the story and that God would
 take one out of the money and restart creation with that one it's you as Gods generous Mercy this music is for life so that's different than how we perceive what it means to be for life right cuz I'm not setting the assumption is well if I'm For Life what it means is there would never be any death but I think ideally that's true but what Biblical story is trying to tell us is that we're not working in the world of ideals we're working in the real world where things are complex and so in a situation where there's no ideal options here what is an option that can lead to the preservation of life well that's how the flood is presented
 the weirdest person in Genesis 12 Aladdin trust me this is all in a payoff for understanding Deuteronomy 1 through 11 so after knowing his family get off the boat no offers a sacrifice that God accepts as a sacrifice of atonement for everything that's gone wrong at this point God says you know no more of these Cosmic D Creations here maybe some localized ones if they're necessary but no more Cosmic decreation I'm going to work out to eat and blessing right here on the way and so Noah gets off that's that and they plant the garden sweet he can send through the garden get naked now I've been here before
 and his son named Tom takes advantage of his father's nakedness by going into his tent something happens in there is very shameful and it results in a curse coming upon hams lineage but not him but upon one of his sons named Canaan father of the Canaanites the future and Deuteronomy 1:11 so now all of a sudden just like you had the illicit or inappropriate mixing of the sons of a human the Dodgers have human leading to the birth of the Nephilim in the Violet Warriors now you have the illicit Union
 son and his father's nakedness which is more than likely a reference to Noah's wife in this really interesting cuz the one who Bears the curse after whatever happens in the tent isn't him it's his son into Canaan which I think is the Nerdist way of saying he's The Offspring of that Union so now the Canaanites are set on analogy to The Offspring of both illicit unions verbal hyperlinks reset on an LG to each other and then interesting how you follow the lineage from Ham through Canaan and it's going to lead you down the line to a guy named Nimrod who becomes he is a Gible or a man of the name cuz people use his name and he's the founder of the kingdoms of Babylon and Assyria and then you read the story about building of the city of Babylon and they say let's build a city in a tower or just in the sky
 we just have to decide and God D creates that not through a flood but through a scattering so my whole point is that Genesis 12 11 narrative patterning is building a portrait of human and spiritual level of humans and embrace the law of this illicit mixing we're human cultural Creations family and society and City and Empire are infused with lies such that these families and societies are structured in a way that glorifies violence that legitimizes its Empire and economy and Military in the name of Scott Wright elevating up to the skies and introduce his death into the world and that's the portrait here and so low and behold when Moses
 what's to describe the people groups they're going to meet living in the land it's all of these words and these characters right here and there's no coincidence that's why but that's a line of thought so Deuteronomy 1:11 depends heavily on this depiction in Genesis 1 through 11:00 so we can kind of process that and then maybe take a step back into Deuteronomy 1:11 to come see how that works but it is that picture kind of from Genesis wind 11 fairly clear at least for the moment and feel how it all works together and I think how you describe this illicit kind of mixing to where there's a corruption where two things that weren't supposed to be together cuz when they come together at least in the way that they're coming together create something so corrupt that leads to that and the people who are doing that think that they are doing what's good you have it is good in their eyes
 this becomes an indictment on just human Empire and human power structures that lead to oppression and violence and death. So at that scale it's kind of cool I get that I mean we've seen that on play in history over and over and over and you wouldn't want a flood to wipe out you know whatever just gnarly regime that was all about that and so you kind of conditioner really feel that and then also if he comes this really humbling indictment Under The Human Condition that were all like taking in power in a way that interrupting us yeah the fact that this whole chain in Genesis 3 through 11:00 begins with two individuals human in life and then two individuals children
 Sun then we start to spread out to the fate of cities tribes and people groups and then an Empire but it is very personal and just as for where God says like sin is crouching at the door and you at the Triton must Master yeah that's exactly right another words that have a robust view of the way that human evil is expressed in human history that is as both individual and corporate it's both personal and structural and that the two are just different aspects of each other and it just as many periods of history in the development of political thought in all of that often the individual or the corporate are played off of each other it's well it's mainly about individuals or it's mainly about structures and the biblical authors like why would we see those of opposites like completely intertwined with each other I think that's kind of them especially Adam and Eve
 can they were very I mean they're like Windows in the human soul that all of our lives and then the portrait of Babylon and of nimrod are portraits of the Societies in which we all inhabit and much later Israel's going to encounter Babylon and they're going to be an oppressive nation that brings a lot of violence and that's probably the people who this book the squirrel Deuteronomy has been composed talk to some people in countering in terms of its final shape has its pension in the whole of the Hebrew Bible yeah it's to an audience that has lived through the horrors of Babylonian oppression in Exile and where did Babylon come from in the story just as with 11 came to the line of Canaan this guy who was the kind of carries his curse
 of something sketchy that happened so it's interesting that when we get to the stories of Israel entering the land the people there I mean the land of Canaan land is called Kayden Ray and so the people there are Canaanites but isn't it true also that there's many different like types of Canaanites there one is amorites you're the one that's Canaanites and then often well actually Deuteronomy chapter 7 brings you into the land that you're entering to possess and clears away many nations before you the girgashites 3M rights for Canaanites 5 parasites 6 / 7/8
 in case you weren't counting on that Moses says the Seven Nations that are greater and stronger than you so notice here amorites and Canaanites appear within a list just sounds like a bunch of try when y'all were your God delivers them before you and you strike them strike them like the the seed striking the snake like that different word but yes it's related but specifically this word strike the word from the root NACA but this was used to describe the Waters of a flood in Genesis 8 God says the Waters of the flood struck all life here he always delivers them before you and you are going to strike them so what the floodwaters did to the Nephilim in that generation Yahweh will use Israel to do
 then you shall utterly destroy them make no Covenant with them and show them no favor so even right there while I don't know what you tell me what you noticed their defeat them totally destroy them don't make any covenants with them right yeah you wouldn't need that last bit if you totally destroy him he has no one to make a covenant with you gone and don't intermarry with them don't give your daughters to their sons don't take their daughters for your son's
 if it was just like simply just destroy them then it would be. Destroy them yeah exactly the destruction language is being used in a way that I don't know how else to Sarah its rhetoric because what it is soon as is even after you defeat them and utterly destroyed them they're going to be around because don't make having it to myself and don't intermarry with them and then goes on to civically this is what you shall do pteranodons the altars smash the sacred pillars you down there Ashura poles and burn their Idol images of idolatry we using the cosmic language of the flood to describe that this is a people group that has Steve itself and practices and is giving allegiance to powers and hears all those tools for that the create cultures that lead to death
 and you are people that are destined or at least called to be a hub of Eden life and you can go and the Temptation will be too like fine Union with them and kind of like mix in a way that the Elohim were mixing with the humans exactly yeah that's right and don't mix with them that's right the mixing here don't intermarry with them is Deuteronomy way of saying you want none of this like sons of Elohim and Daughters of humanity thing that happens like don't mix with that power structure that power is going to be tempting and you're going to want to like bring it in because it's going to be like I can have our this way don't mix with it so again right now at this stage we're just trying to do a sympathetic hearing of the text you without personally be acting the first so and personal reactions are very important and one personal reaction though is when it says don't show favor to them
 is it must also be part of that rhetoric of like don't destroy them okay when they're still around if they're still around do Mary I'm okay, just don't let her mix with them but they don't show favor to them like don't be nice to that we can get back to that but whatever ya in other words it's trying to portray that when a human culture gives itself over to death the practices that lead to death which they think are good right that's what Genesis 3 through 11 but the portrait there so here these people groups seven of them in the land are portrayed as a people group that are too far gone like the generation of the fly however this is the land that you always marked out to be a hub in life for the rest of the nation but it's inhabited by snakes and buy Nephilim and give her a ring and a bunch of little nimrods
 so the rhetoric of it is just total separation and total total separation total removal and that removal or separation is depicted with lots of different kinds of language that seem to conflict on the surface. The One is using flud language to strike an utterly destroy the language from the flood but then it's using language from the sons of God don't intermarry with them then it's using language all connected from snake which is about worshipping other gods and Spiritual Beings just don't forget the word snake is also the same three letters as the Hebrew word for sorcery definition of channel the power and presence of other Spiritual Beings the same way I did forget yeah yeah that's the word for sorcery and divination and the harsh
 can read in Hebrew the whole story through and every time you read snake you can read sorcerer or Chandler of Spiritual Beings and actually later in Deuteronomy 30 Moses will actually call start to warn people about Ben ice or witch or Sorceress in Spiritual Beings who have given their allegiance and channel do you know their life and power to the power of a spiritual being so I just want to quit for me this is so eliminating right here in Deuteronomy 7 were using the language of the flood Story the sons of God and Nephilim story and of the snake as a sorcerer diviner to describe the seven people groups and having the land so all the way back out this generation of Israel is presented as a new Adam and Eve being put into the garden
 and being called to exercise God's authority over the creatures and interesting little insight Genesis one where this is the original God said how to make human in our image let them rule over the creatures then verse 28 God bless them and said be fruitful and multiply still the land and do it that which subdues kind of aggressive it is an aggressive word yeah yeah what do you need to subdue it presumes there's going to be some kind of resistance a conflict and you take that word you like okay I guess we're that in the first creature you need who represents some kind of hostile intention is the snake in Genesis 3 and so I think
 this is Deuteronomy is wave pattern and after that is to say listen you are going to face a whole new culture and generation of snakes and you need to do to them what Adam and he failed to do to that snake which is to run it out name and authority of not at the meditation the back reflection that Israel is called to succeed where Adam and he failed in relationship to the snake interesting just already in the garden you know you don't like what's it doing there and how to get there and it's kind of like saying will what are the Canaanites doing there and how they get their well they were there and they represent death
 not the mixed perfect sense and it helps you kind of sympathetically, and go okay I see what's going on and if this was just fiction you would go great yes I did it's a beautiful kind of symptomatic patterning reflection but then if you go this also history men were they all of that bad or you know like where they really this people so corrupted that they need to be wiped out in a flood of Justice or you could say man this is as good political propaganda like a justification to go and take a land of course they would frame the inhabitants of the land is like the Incarnation of evil I was telling me to take that land totally okay yeah so now we're beginning to surface are personal reactions which is good and right I mean I want to emphasize that enough like it's okay we can react to this yes
 must be if we're not the brains on a stick you know we must so once on that and then this is clearly something that occurred to Israelites themselves which is a part of why these texts are framing at this way so just one way the there's another chapter in the Torah different scroll back in Leviticus chapter 18 which opens by saying Hey listen you know people lived in Egypt in a certain way and you live there and I don't want you to live that way anymore and the way of Egypt is epitomises by the oppression and slavery and exploitation of immigrants in the name of their gods and in the power of the king
 Samosa says so the way that Egypt bike operated and lived and you live there yeah don't do don't live that way and then also then Moses says nor are you to do what they do in the land of Canaan where I'm bringing you like they also live in a culture that leads to death and so Leviticus 18 begins a whole way of depicting like this alternative Community they always wants to create and then it begins there's a concluding frame around that we always says Hey listen don't defile yourself don't make yourselves don't let death infect you by any of these ways of life for by means of these ways of life the Nations that I'm casting out before you have become infected with death
 in the land has become infected with death so I'm making its the word defiled make MPR yeah but to be a is to be to catch the death virus other way so he says the Nations that live in the land of Canaan have that infection in the land itself has been infected with death therefore I have brought its punishment upon it in the land has vomited out its inhabitants and as for you all you keep my statutes that leads to life and then Moses concludes and if you don't the land will vomit you all out just as it vomited out the nation's before you sent another words God has destined creation for life and when people's as individuals and families many villages and cities and Empires set themselves on a course towards death thinking that it's good
 right they defiled themselves in the land with death the reach these flood like moments and here it's vomiting
 and that's the portrait and so once we get here to Deuteronomy that's the logic here what's interesting is that it's the land itself that's reacting and that's connected to the flood so I think back to all the bring it all the way back to your point what makes this hard what makes the Israelites enduring insulin particularly hard is it's not creation reacting to the humans in the flood or in this image of the land vomiting right about God has appointed his human images were meant to be a blessing to all the nations of the world but to these seven that have given themselves over to the ways of the snake Gods human images become agents of death destruction flood the creation and it's easier to picture of that with Adam and Eve
 so doing a snake the snake out of the garden snake has been infused with fellow humans like how do you totally how do you get the snake that's right of the humans that's right you got to kill the human that's right and we cannot forget that the Genesis scroll taught us that even God's chosen ones can become the seat of the snake and that was the story of Jacob was born grabbing the hill and lying like a snake right and got to take someone a painful journey to transform him into an image for a card every so many stories in the numbers and accidents I love that's right. Having to bring judgment on his own people and actually the fact that Israel will itself become seat of the snake over the course of its history leading to Exile in Babylon means that Israel itself became the Nephilim Giants Nimrod Babylon Egypt itself
 it was purely just political propaganda to give them permission to go and take a land from the people was purely that and it kind of stopped short of being really good propaganda because then that same line of thought brings them to them needing to also be taken out of the land through Justice because they've become corrupted yes really good propaganda be like and whatever we do is going to be awesome because we're awesome they're bad we're awesome. There's a lot of really critical self-reflection another words Deuteronomy its presentation of the Canaanites as a people given over to the snake is one part of a story that you have to keep reading and if you keep reading the story the people that are right now being called the stump out snakes in the land of Canaan are themselves going to become snakes and themselves stomped out of the land
 find even bigger snake that is Babylon and so I love what you just said no birds the whole story is actually an indictment on all human communities and the portrait of God here is both troubling but it's also realistic because it's showing that if God is going to do anything in this world in and through humans it's God partnering with snakes right or at least people yeah people infected by the power of the people infected with the power of the snake that's it that's important that's actually crucially important. Doesn't partner with snakes are partners with humans who are constantly giving themselves over to the power snake and which means that
 for God to truly partner with humans in the real world will involve God messy messy situations where there are no good options and I think that's where that's the framework within which I'm trying to sit with my own discomfort at God's choice has your back to what we were ripping on with pharaoh and the god hardened his heart and in Reading Romans 9 is it which is just this really uncomfortable thing that you put your finger on just now which is why is it that some humans or if I could part of the snake are used to show God's mercy and God uses them as vehicles of his like mercy and Grace and other ones like Pharaoh who's also he's also infected person. Just like you know what you've gone too far and I'm going to use you to become like the icon pattern of the human give it happens when you punch and what kind of
 play Cosmic logic is there that some people infected by the power snake can be treated one way and some tree is another way so the mission has split and gone to directions so one yeah leads to taking that binary kind of hardening it into it you know your destination and they can appeal to the pattern what's also interesting is that other parts the Christian tradition can appeal to this pattern and really emphasized individual and corporate responsibility that it's a result of humans choosing this path for themselves and that God stuff limit in entering into a real partnership with humans all the way back on page one and this actually becomes in problem of evil classic study of this about like the greater good type of options that the greater good
 there would be some that choose life is worth the possibility of however many will choose death so that's one whole option that's way to go and there's different ways to fill out those and then on the other like more extreme end would be the Christian Universalist approach which is that through Jesus the one human he has saved all from those who have given themselves over to the power of the snake and I'm trying to paint this is why I'm broke in the history of the Christian tradition we're looking at these stories we're trying to see the patterns and you could interpret the pattern and lead I think coherently to a couple different conclusions and the positive negative strengths and weaknesses of each over the other this is really important part of the development of Christian theology but I think it's just important to say that the biblical authors
 dinner table and if I don't tie a bow on this and that what that forces us to do is sit with these narratives and meditate on them to learn about human nature and also to learn about the mysterious purpose of God in the world that lease to Jesus but another part of what makes these stories so uncomfortable is that after the first few centuries when the Jesus movement was a religious cultural cognitive minority in the Roman Empire Constantine begins a shift towards the Jesus movement becoming enfranchised or it messed with the state Power Systems most of the Roman Empire and then it's replay it in different continents and cultures all over all of this world once that ship happens then all the sudden these stories are being read and interpreted not by their original authors
 the people who wrote all these texts were like I'm already up her know they were a part of persecuted religious cultural minorities direct the people who composed the Swift but the moment you have communities that are Allied or a participants and state power than all of a sudden these narratives become templates for Conquest Conquest Colonial expansion and these narratives have been appealed to and become the pattern for Colonial Conquest on every continent by multiple cultures and language groups so in our social location right here yeah we're sitting in centuries after in the aftermath of that in one of the keys that kind of maybe helps you not do that other than just recognizing the audience that this was is that this all is leading the Jesus Jesus he defeats the snake and he become the model
 how to defeat the snake and his conquest of the snake in the way he teaches his disciples to the continued to fight is not a kind of Conquest it's actually out of like very sacrificial like loving your enemy as a follower of Jesus I want Israel to go into the promised land and like you know do friend of Angela's over their heart yeah yeah build a beautiful new culture with the amorites Canaanites jebusites how Jesus picked up this whole set of themes and took it as marching orders for the arrival of the kingdom of God that you was bringing the flood of justice that is real is bringing on to these people which is also the flood that was brought on to humanity because of its violence jesus takes on himself and even more so the gospel authors present Jesus
 as bringing God's judgment on the principalities and Powers this is why when Jesus shows up in a graveyard
 in a graveyard and there's this super human strength guy there in the graveyard and he asked them like what's the name of the powers that influence you and they say we are definitely he's fighting a whole Legion its military language grab the powers of evil that Jesus is confronting you think it's Roofing off of the yeah it's it's the power within this guy is making this guy such a menace undeveloped it's the evil why else is the narrator presenting Jesus's enemy and not seen not the human yeah but a legion of soldiers Spirit beings and this is all about the Mighty Warriors and the nimrods and son in the Gospel of Luke when Jesus this is Luke's account uniquely In The Garden of Gethsemane when he's being arrested on the night
 the night of his arrest and the guards, and these are the Jewish Priestly representatives and Jewish temple guards and what he says is this our belongs to you talkin to the humans there and to the powers of Darkness
 so Jesus is with humans is actually captive to a whole structural power mindset called Israel in League with Rome as The Architects of murder and that certainly was Paul thought this is why in 1st Corinthians 3 he talks about the powers that crucified our Lord if people debate or is he talking about pilot Caiaphas was he talking about spiritual powers in the whole thing is in Genesis 1 through 11 they're not different like when a human Community structures itself in a way that defines evil is good they're embracing lies and engaging in illicit Union of evil and good to the degree that it produces death and so I just a Biblical I'm going to have such a different way of viewing reality if my point is
 Jesus and the apostles actually view themselves as picking up the language and imagery of this cycle pattern in the Hebrew Bible and they never once connected it to the actual physical coercion or conquest of humans it was about an aggressive stance taken to the lies and the spiritual forces at work in the architecture of human lives in human societies so in other words McCall says our enemy at the end of the season is our enemy is never flesh-and-blood it's the powers and principalities animating the whole thing I don't think he is innovating like that's an idea I think they were supposed to Gales it feels like out of place in this narrative if Paul would have said that to Israel going in it in like a wait so we don't we don't kill him in this is where we're at the story of Israel's conquest of Canaan is you have to
 read it in the larger sweep from Genesis to Kings where Israel itself will become you know influence by the snake and so the oppressed become a professor doesn't wear and that the Real Enemy at work under all of Genesis through Kings is the snake and his minions is Paul and Jesus I think I actually understood the message of the Hebrew Bible and that Paul statement our enemy is not flesh and blood is a message we should be getting out of the meaning of Deuteronomy Joshua the problem is that that has not been the way many Christians throughout history of read the stories and therefore these stories have been used to sponsor Inspire were legitimate actual conquest of actual human societies and we can't ignore
 that that's not a legacy of these very stories in the Bible and as much as I want to say that's a misunderstanding of them but that's an abuse of them they have been used in that way and we can't ignore that fact will and I didn't I didn't grew up in a tradition that felt like I heard those justifications that feels like interesting feels like 50 years ago or like the Crusades or but that's also the colonialism that you read of the missionary colonialism which is like yeah the land were sitting on right now like the reason we're sitting here is because of cultural movement is a car there was a term for it there was a manifest destiny which was an American continuation of the doctrine of Discovery developed you know by the Catholic church in the Spanish Colonial period precisely as Spain and Portugal or sending ships to go
 conquer the new manager that's uncomfortable for whatever reason I was protected from them tickets from our kind of isolated from that I think because that's two heads too personal just like we want to deal with that Irvington Atterbury tanks with these stories was snake lasts about hell yeah that's why there's a problem with my ancestors according to just more like that just seems wrong Behavior Behavior seems out of sync with Jesus yeah and so not only is it hard to read the stories for some people because of that Colonial stuff it's hard to read the stories just because why why not go and make me like it is actually really hard to read the story and then to get your Jesus and Paul are getting because you have to not just read the story you have to read the whole thing and you have to meditate
 and here's the thing you know Paul uses this language putting the enemy to death in Galatians and the enemy is flesh your flesh put the flash to death but he's using the language of the Canaanite Conquest putting the works of the flesh which are in partnership with the principalities and Powers than the lies of the evil one conquest yourself yes I think actually if you read these stories in the context of the Hebrew Bible That's the meaning that you are led to how because how is it that a society gives itself over to embracing the way any of the snake it's by believing the LIE leaving the lot the guy doesn't generous they got a lot of begins with Desiring something that's right distorted desire towards a misdirected end the brings death or contributes are participates in a culture of death that's how Paul usually refers to a flash drive is kind of like the impulses the way the human body generate
 fires in the way I meet those desires can you point me to the source of all fulfillment of Desire or it can point me to the way of meeting that desire this temporary and harmful to myself and other people do the degree that you do that that's Paul same flesh in the degree that you align your desires of God that he refers to his Spirit correct and it happens that in these narratives Deuteronomy Joshua the Canaanites become an icon of the boys of the snake and the works of the flesh to be put to death and so I think for me address I have stopped trying to reach a point where I am finally like I just got to be some point on this issue where I'm going to feel
 resolved because it still uncomfortable to humans go and inflict violence another human totally yeah and so counter to what Jesus said yeah and told his followers to do burn so I don't think it's a what do you say I don't think it's like a mortal contradiction at the heart of the Bible the ship doesn't sink for me because of this especially when a sympathetically try and understand it the same time I am uncomfortable and I've been focusing on this problem long enough without total resolve that I'm I wonder if it's just one of those issues where we just have to sit with it and for me it keeps inviting me into deeper meditations about myself in the ways of God but the one thing I know as a follower of Jesus I'm not supposed to get from the store is this is that somehow they are legitimate
 coercive conquest of another human Community Jesus certainly did not read them that way and neither did the apostles and I'm reading these texts as an expression of my discipleship to him so I have to make some serve that end yeah and if they do that and uncomfortable or where the challenges me I don't know how else to deal with them and I got some mercy in 10 years maybe I'll have a little more wisdom here but
 so I intentionally brought up this is the theme for us to talk about as far as you do wrong to me. Cuz I thought we would resolve it but because these honest conversations need to be had when you read these texts are these issues cell
 may God have mercy on us
 may God have mercy on us and I didn't give us wisdom and subdue the snake
 all right next we're going to move into the laws of Deuteronomy and see in them a source of wisdom in righteousness for all future generations of God's people thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we begin the second movement of Deuteronomy and we begin a new theme the theme of the law of Moses tells Israel that you always laws are the way Israel could show that they're loyal to him and not any other God by living in accordance to the laws you're expressing your devotions and allegiance to a particular element save your people out of slavery and who sang this is how you can bonhomie in the relationship so to not add or take away is about saying you can't just change the terms of our relationship and invent a new lock code on your own
 red tide and Uncle Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza had a woo provided the invitations for annotated podcast in our at the Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofits we exist to experience Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make the podcast are videos are classes are studies everything is free because it's already been paid for by thousands of people just like you thank you so much for being a part of this with us hi this is loyal and I'm from South Africa and I'm from a little town called Dade City Florida I first heard about the Bible project through a YouTube search as an artist I was curious if there was a way that the visual arts could be used as Kingdom or expose standing and understanding the Bible in his range in context and it's really helped me understand the Bible on a
 cheaper and more contextual level by John and the whole team really lay out picture is inspire me to do the same with my talent we believe that the Bible is a unified story that we've to Jesus people like me find free video study notes for a Bible project. Com
