hey this is John at the Bible project we are doing an ongoing series called how to read the Bible and right now we're discussing how to read the gospels the gospels are the first four books in the New Testament The Gospel according to Matthew according to Mark going to Luke and according to John these are for ancient biographies of Jesus and it kind of makes you wonder why did we get for and why do all four open in very different ways for very different Beginnings for totally different strategies for introducing an ancient biography gospel has a different beginning because the author wants to take you on a different Journey a journey to understand how Jesus is the climax of the Hebrew scriptures are constantly and from the first moment tying the Jesus story back into the Hebrew scriptures this is one of the main ways the gospel
 there's not a story not a parable of Jesus not a teaching of Jesus that isn't packed with Old Testament was written so today will break down the wall that often exists in our minds between the Old and New Testament the Hebrew scriptures the gospels and see how really they're all telling the same story pointing to Jesus thanks for joining us here we go
okay let's continue talking about the gospel how to read the gospels how to read the gospel how to read the fourfold gospel accounts the singular gospel told according to four different points of view that's the title of each of the books The Gospel singular according to and then the four different names Mark Luke and John and doesn't know how to read the Bible series what we talked about last time was what that term gospel means and I asked you to take a message with me in the historical setting what you spend some time doing but but yeah so it's good news and good news Jesus said he came in asking the good news at the kingdom of God is near which then they questioned what does that mean that you've been reading the Hebrew scriptures God has wanted to use Israel to bless
 all the nations and make their Nation gray the kingdom great and they've been anticipating that that to happen for the last half a millennia they've been enslaved by will not slave but they've been under occupation of the scene yelling this message announcing the charges near God's kingdom has arrived at such a message to gets people killed yes it does got him killed and it did it got him killed right away and then this message of God's kingdom coming it's through him it is what you learn how to read the gospels and so when Mark introduces the story he says the gospel is the story of Jesus as the gospel Jesus comes announcing the good news about the kingdom of God and you are told that story it's four sentences the good news about Jesus was a good
 is by Jesus becomes a good news about Jesus God's kingdom coming now connected and the apostles inherited this term good news from the prophets the biblical prophets who use that was specifically Isaiah use the word good news and talk about coming of God's Kingdom have to bring about New Jerusalem a new creation see you wanted to go through four gospels are and how to read them a kind of a new Next Level 2.0 bikes that are reading skills for features of the gospels that when you pay attention to them you began noticing and being able to appreciate more of what's their truck B tuning into what how the author's are doing what they're doing in their portrayal of Jesus cuz that is what they're offering is there ancient biographies
 Jesus which are aimed at both telling you the essence of this figure through the key events and teachings but also they are persuasive documents we talked about that they're aimed at persuading the reader they're not unbiased historical archives yeah yeah yeah
so here's for yes the unique features here's the first one we've already in to spend it is that these authors are very keen to show you how Jesus is bringing the storyline of the Hebrew scriptures to a climactic moment of fulfillment and they do this through constant referencing back to if you have a Christian Bible that's going to have the Old and New Testaments and so basically it's these four books are constantly referring back to key text key stories key Palms in the first three quarters of your Bible That's how you dance so 11 simple way to take your reading of the gospels to the next level is to get a Bible that has quotations of the Old Testament marked with low but not just so that I can almost every Bible does many do not really know if it's an explicit quotation it will if it's just a reference
 like if not an illusion but sometimes it's not a quotation there's many ways that they do it. Let's talk about it and he has a different strategy for how they employ I called these hyperlinks the Wikipedia page is such a helpful analogy for the interweb as a whole yeah yeah you can read a series of web pages in a sequence the rabies the website designer intends you to this page and then I pinch but then with hyperlinks you can begin linking between Pages based off of themes and ideas today and the Bible is very similar it's was written and produced to be read in both ways so the simplest way is to look at page one of each of the four gospel accounts and right off the bat from the opening lines each one of them is in a heavy-handed way linking the story of the
 they're about to present to you linking it back to the first three quarters of of your Bible so I thought we deserve a real quick cuz it just kind of cool to compare you haven't done it turns the gospel scholarship probably the widest most widely held position among Scholars of the origins of the gospels is that Mark is the chronologically the oldest written first written first and let Matthew and or wraps Luke both use Mark as a source of people to pay that and then mostly most why the healthiest John is with the last of the four to be written up so that's why you'll see people quote from Mark when they're talking about the gospels because Martha will have preserved may be the oldest form of the story of Jesus with the beginning of the good news about Jesus Messiah the Son of God as it is written in the prophecy
 Isaiah he doesn't even start The Story Goes he quotes from Malachi and Isaiah put in a blender you mentioned this class for that how the apostles quote the Hebrew scriptures is not how you would anticipate the do it yeah yeah yeah yeah so he's saying but what is actually done is Blended together wording from to text in the prophets Year from the first book of the prophets and him the last book of the prophets Malachi writes the book ends and in both of those books there is a two texts that are already there hyperlinked in referring to each other it's about Yahweh sending a Harold who will say prepare the way of the Lord to return to Zion
 so another words in Isaiah 40 and in Malachi chapter for those two texts before Mark ever came along we're hyperlinked with in the Hebrew Bible when you say they were a hyperlink to explain to you what I mean is that the authors of the prophetic collection have intended the reader to hyperlink Isaiah 40 and Malachi for to connect the Kinect to the motif of before the great day of Yahweh in the kingdom comes he will send a Herald who will prepare the way so that the people who shaped the collection of the prophets Clerks of the Prophet wanted you to read Isaiah 40 about end the sprays prepare the way of the Lord is the same exact phrase verbatim Isaiah 40 and use the Malachi yes and then in the contacts both passages of talking about how you always going to raise up a prophet to be the herald of that ultimatum
 in scripture phrase is repeated it's not like they were just running out of ideas or phrases they're like purposely connecting two other sections of the Bible yeah the main communication technique one of the main communication techniques of biblical authors is repeating phrases sometimes within the same story or poem other times within adjacent stores are bombs and then sometimes what stores are ponds that are near each other and especially rare design pattern comes as a work so exactly and especially when it's rare and unique vocabulary how many times in the Hebrew Bible you get a passage about Yahweh raising up a Herald to prepare the way of the Lord only 2 bucks and so what the tells us is Mark is paying attention to a design pattern in the Hebrew Bible marks
 eating the Hebrew Bible exactly in this manner he's reading at along the Contours of its design and he wanted first he wants his reader to know hey dear reader this thing that you read about from the beginning to the ending of the prophets in the Hebrew Bible that's the thing that's happening so he's tapping into a well-known Motif and then sang Jesus is doing that thing that the prophets were preparing for it which is why he will say it's called inform Isaiah but he's quoting from a hyperlink to quotation of Malachi and I think this guy knows his Bible yeah that's the point of you to spare so does not Mark does it before he even Begins the story he puts a blended quotation of a design pattern from the prophets to Ethel like a prologue to the Pacific Lee there's a messenger yeah it's time to prepare the way of the Lord yeah yeah so I'm sending a messenger and he is going to prepare the way of the lord The Narrative starts in verse for John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness
 he just quoted saying there will be a voice crying in the wilderness okay so thank you have a hair in the quotation you have a Harold in the wilderness preparing the way of Yahweh narrative begins John the Baptist in the wilderness right he preparing what's the message oh he's preparing the way for the Lord who's in the Yahweh slot in those days Jesus came from Nazareth and was baptized by John expecting the Lord to come yeah I figure after the herald and tomorrow gives you John and then Jesus Jesus in The Narrative slot we have to expect y'all been very clear he wants you to see Jesus as bringing about something that the whole Hebrew scriptures were pointing towards yeah I know he doesn't come out and say it's all through the narrative the design of the narrative and that quotation that that's his strategy for doing it right
 clear it's clear if you know what you're looking for is right it's clear if you if you're an informed reader of the scriptures Mark assumes that if you're reading his book you belong to a church where you've been taught how to read the Bible well Mark that's a brave assumption
 listen to Matthew chapter 1 the first in the Bible the Gospel of Jesus Messiah sound of David's son of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac Isaac to get Jacob Jacob begat Judah and his brothers and what follows is most of the chapters first half a chapter is a genealogy family tree first page first paragraph of it can be perceived as boring it is perceived as boring by lots of people actually the the word genealogy and Greek Greek word underneath that has the word Genesis where did where did I begin from
 geology like mapped out of any of your family life my wife does because of her grandma has fat binder that's German their Grandma mailed us thoroughly thoroughly German and then mine is mostly Scottish and all I know is that the kid my dad showed me the Makai plaid on plaid bad yeah you need to do something with that I had a family plan would you like me to make a jacket okay so the Mathieu highlights Jesus's Lineage 2 figures David Abraham years yeah so the Royal founder of Jerusalem the designer of the temple and the one whom God said I will give you a great name and you see
 how to plant my people in their land Abraham was called out of Babylon given the blessing of atom to become a blessing to all of the nation's it's just your hand right there even an opening line pf0k This Jesus will be carrying forward what God was up to with Abraham and then you get a genealogy Abraham David by the way like why repeat that we've got that elsewhere he wants to make it a certain point three movements three movements of fourteen Generations three movements of fourteen Generations from Abraham to David that's 14 cat videos from David to the exiled The Babylon and see that another fourteen then from the exile to Jesus who is called Messiah another 14
 there's three sets of 14 and so notice the progression in the first line he said Jesus Son of David Son of Abraham but then he gives you a structure of from Abraham to David from David Yang style from the exile to Messiah the implicit movement is from Abraham to David to the Exile Jesus is the response to the X the next thing after the exit restoration after the Exile and four hundred years ago a story but if you been reading the Hebrew Bible you know that the Exile in the eyes of the prophets but there's still no he didn't end they returned to the land but the restoration from Exile says still not happen to not until they become free yeah the new the New Covenant people who are Gods witness is among the nation's there's also
 nothing going on here with if you go compare these genealogies with the sources where you got them from and Genesis and Chronicles he's left out generation yeah so then there is a question why does he live 14 like he knows you can read in the Bible did the Kingsley left out so that just begs the question why is he doing that a couple of thoughts one it's a multiplier 72 x 7 second the number 14 is the numerical value of the name David you add up all the letters of David's name is three three letters and you get to the 14th when you get for 10 it's almost certain that he's shaped the numbers in each of the generations to correspond to the hope of a new David got it at the new David that his response to that exile
 he also has four women in the genealogy of the genealogy of names for moms Rahab Ruth and the wife of Uriah what do they all have in common they're all non Israelites through all done on juice but they were all of them except they have recently widowed they all have nighttime meetings that are a little bit suspicious with some leader from Israel they all make bold request of some Israelite and most of them at some point in their own narrative make a confession that Yahweh the god of Israel as their God is highlighting these Gentile women in Jesus's genealogy
 what does very similar to Mark the stories of Tamar Rahab Bruce and Bathsheba is the wife of Uriah they're all hyper length with in the Hebrew Bible stories are connected the stories are connected in really important ways in developing the theme of Yahweh rescuing the Messianic seed through the surprising woman figure it's a motif where these women keep saving stupid is right men but oh well I actually might be a seaman. I just need to do more work on it interesting thing becomes the first one to see if and then Adam is deceived to her deception but then what you going to get through the story of the Hebrew Bible is sometimes you get a husband and wife and the wife becomes the downfall of the woman sometimes it's the man's the downfall of the
 with the wife is the downfall of man sometimes a man's the downfall of the woman but then you'll get the surprising store is where the guy will get rescued by the woman and it seems I think all of those are a little inverted Genesis three stories and am so the genealogies packed with Hebrew Bible awesomeness yeah you're not supposed to just skip over this genealogy you're supposed to meditate on it by three sections my 14th yeah genealogies are one of the biblical authors most favorite vehicles for showing the continuity of God's promises throughout Generations until they build a lot of numerical symbolism and word plays into the genealogies from Genesis all the way to the end so if Matthew could add that to the series
 all right so we look at Luke high-flyin surveyor
Luke is the only one of the four gospels that begins with a little prologue of the author addressing the reader and we talked about this before this is the only explicit sneak peek we get into the house the gospels work created yeah yeah so he says as much as many of undertaken to compile an account of the things accomplished Among Us just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning where I Witnesses and Servants of the word so we sang for supplies acknowledging their other accounts of Jesus out there and how do you get an account from Jesus well it's Traditions passed down from the eyewitnesses one and two servants of the word people who have dedicated themselves to memorizing the tournament and then you travel around as apostles and teachers they memorize the Jesus Traditions before they were written up in the gospels and they I mean how the heck happened in the
 decades before the gospels existed in password on there lots of people are still alive who saw what happened but people are teaching memorizing the Jesus stories but it seems fitting for me he said there was three having investigated everything carefully from the beginning to write out in order for you must excellent Theophilus thanks for the paycheck by the way my research to leave so that you may know the truth about the things that you have been taught that place is like Luke go do some investigative reporting Community yeah he's heard the Servants of the word he's probably mad and I witness it too came through town maybe I'll let you know and then you know
 God bless me with like this all of water is really great year maybe I could commission a new account I met this guy Luke he's a physician super sharp he knows Paul traveled with him was in that shipwreck with him and so maybe you would write it up Luke says absolutely I will in fact I'll even dedicated to you and that's awesome I love to think about the untold story right underneath that tree owner evidently in your imagination is Merchant something okay look how he begins his beginning with style in the days of Herod King of Judea there was a priest named Zachariah
 of the division of Asia and he had a wife from among the daughters of Aaron her name was Elizabeth they were righteous in the sight of God walking blamelessly in the Commandments in the requirements of the Lord but they had no child Elizabeth womb is Barren and they were very old spot right there was this remind you of a priest named Zachariah the levite Levites all come from the lineage of Aaron and he married a wife from the line of Aaron what was Aaron's wife's name how come you're so pretty smile of Aaron married to a Levi's daughter who's named after the wife of the matriarch
 yeah you got that portrait priest their righteous and blameless that Echoes Noah exactly Echoes Abraham when God called Abraham to be in the opening line of Genesis 17 walk before me and be blameless
 but they're really old and they have no children this was a squirrel moment yeah so he's portraying couple who's going to become John the Baptist parents as an Abraham and Sarah has a Priestly Abraham and Sarah are correct and so what you're meant to do is be like oh yeah I know another couple like this advanced in years Baron but trying to follow God and the voice commands certain God so then your your mind is meant to survey the whole Abraham and Sarah Story look for similarities and then also to think about what happened to Abraham and Sarah and then come back here with full of anticipation based on what happened in the past so that's it setting you up for expectation so the whole plot conflict is God promises
 family to a couple that's in knock their 80s that had never been able to have children and then Luke just goes on and he begins to tell she's a beautiful story elaborate character protrails right of Zechariah and an angel appears to him while he's offering incense and says you can have a kid he doesn't believe it just just like Abraham and Sarah and Genesis 18 He says how can I know I'm an old man my wife is advancing years ago this a good the angel says you know you're going to have a son and then Interstate 10 Zechariah says how can I know if this for certain I am an old man and the angel answered and said to him I am Gabriel God I've been sent to bring you good news so you won't be able to speak until you know you're important when your answer be
 I'm Gabriel I love that I'm an old man I'm Gabriel Oh I thought so anyway she gets pregnant so this is the herald the angel tells Zechariah he's going to be in Elijah figure who prepares the way of the Lord he's over laughing with Mark's team here so God re does Abraham and Sarah thing to raise up the miraculous child but this Reckless child is just a setup character The Herald and normally these stories are like about the lineage of the seed this one is about the herald to the one coming that's right and then so in the next story with Mary then you get another story of the Angel appearing to Mary yeah and she becomes a contrast figure to the priest so she's like a teenage girl and stead of saying hi
 can I know this is true I'm so just and say that I'm so beyond that's impossible what her response is you know I'm a virgin right and the angel said you don't we got that covered the holy spirit will come upon you and her response is behold I am the servant of the Lord total opposite of Zechariah so she doesn't ask her if she shows the old priest who serves God in the temple and he lacks faith is it just like Abraham did most of the time except that one occasion when he trust God and he was credited to him as righteousness most the time Abraham's kind of blown it and so he puts Zechariah and Abraham slot is like the unbeliever and then Luke contrast the old man whose like the religious leader with a teenage girl
 can I get pregnant out of wedlock and she becomes exhausted as the model of faith for the reader so amazing and then she's going to go sing a song about it in chapter one and did look what it is it the whole it's all about the upside down yeah he's had regard for the humble state of his servant and it's all about how he's brought down the high and exhausted and lifts up the humble and hungry and so the narrative contrast between Zechariah and Mary is itself doing that the high priests are being brought down and Below league right now named girl is being exalted as the mother of the Messiah School narrative is doing what the later tell Sia
 God looks amazing man yeah that just becomes a massive themes about all of Luke explored in our week Series yeah yeah down
 yep
the real Duralast quick survey we're screwed up again we're looking how the opening movement of the four gospels link the story of Jesus into the Hebrew scriptures John want just hit you over the head with the head slap you in the face in the beginning of the opening words and you're supposed to be and of course in the beginning I know that phrase yes this is that I was a creation story this is the beginning of the new creation story God spoke the light into existence hear God's word is the light shining in the darkness those clear John wants us to have Genesis uploaded he goes on to even mention creation and John 1 verse 3 all things came to exist through him
 apart from him not one thing came into existence that has come into existence okay so that's clear supposed to be blindingly obvious he is doing that's not so obvious but that is actually really important and significant is the Proverbs 8 is very much on the brain for John in this opening paragraph two properties a remind me that that's a lady was dumb yes creating with God is the one of the most dense appearances of this figure lady with them who appears all throughout the Proverbs and then all of Genesis 1 and the meditation on the complex portrait of God found in Genesis 1 so this is ranging back to her that whole series on the goddamn conversation yeah but this one
 I pondered how later biblical authors like in Psalm 33 my paying attention to the portrait of God in Genesis one that you have Elohim creating in the first line in the beginning of painting of him and then the phrase used to describe God's personal presence hovering in the uncreated world is La Croix Spirit of Ella and then the means by which God actually begins to order create is by his word he speaks the word the song 33 Crystal parallel lines by the word of the Lord he created All Things by the spirit of his mouth the breath of his mouth and it yeah and that's those ideas are connected and that we are word is your breath which is the word ruach correct so in the biblical story as it develops Proverbs 8 picks us up and begins to portray and imagine this a tribute of God
 God's word mind or spirit and then another image gets added to it is wisdom is supreme wisdom to craft the lady wisdom speaks up in this poem it's as if we're hearing from this after beautiful God speaking aloud so this in Proverbs chapter 8 verses Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works from of old from ancient times I was established from the beginning later on and then goes on to say you know before the mountains were founded in before the sky is drizzle drain and I was kind of thinking that lady wisdom says there I was next to him beside him yeah like now separate from yeah yeah yeah really interesting but also at work in Proverbs our statements like this Proverbs Proverbs chapter 3 by means of wisdom Yahweh founded the land
 find means of his understanding he established the sky's so why wisdom here because in Genesis one wisdom is not a word that's used to fit snow and walk in the word of God correct so why is it in Proverbs in an hour talking about the wisdom of God why don't you why isn't that the lady the lady word for the lady well because the Book of Proverbs assumes a holistic reading of the Torah and the prophets and so it's combining the themes of you always ability to create an order about humans tap into that order when they submit to you always wisdom by the fear of the Lord which is a theme introduced in Genesis 3 the fear of the Lord the Lord too late right after they eat from the tree instead of before so it's as if you could say the wisdom of God is the Deep themed under
 gerding Genesis one but the word itself isn't that the surface Slater typical authors who bring it to the surface, to speak so the significant thing here is that this figure of Lady wisdom who is attribute of God that yet distinct from God gives the apostles a category to start talking about the identity of Jesus and so when John talks about God's word was both God and with God beside him he's using the same kind of category language in categories of Proverbs 8 and that it's God's wisdom and yet wisdom is an entity distinct from God like along with him without in Orthodox Christianity you don't have father son Holy Spirit and Lady wisdom correct correct so lady wisdom in the Proverbs fits a different category in that it's more what metaphor
 what's in those conversations we have in the past it's the lady wisdom creates a mental shelf space in the biblical Jewish mind of the complex portrait of God and the God's attributes are both God and distinct from God right and so so it's an abstraction where Jesus is what John is essentially claiming is Jesus is in a lady wisdom like slot he is one who created listed creation and exhibit was God and distinct from God from time before creation he's using the mental category that we have provides from the Hebrew Bible putting Jesus in the wisdom slot Scholars called this wisdom christology Apostles are talking about the Divine identity of Jesus in The Melody of Lady wisdom theme
 is there any Hebrew Scholars Jewish Scholars who think of Lady wisdom as anything more than just a scheme or a correct yeah there's been a diversity of views in specially in the modern era yeah some people think that it's essentially a survival of ancient Israelite polytheism it was you know a Creator Goddess that was alongside Yahweh and the what she is now submerged this all very speculative puzzle I don't actually think it's probable that all although there were lots of gods and goddesses and you know some of them work together in the ancient world once were what Proverbs is doing in my view an interview of other Scholars it's either a metaphorical scheme that would be like represent by Michael Fox who's with my doctor will advisor and a master of the wisdom literature
 thanks it's an elaborate metaphorical scheme of a really creative author however when you take it in the context of the Hebrew Bible there's all of these other things going on with god's complex identities that I think there's it's one part of a bigger puzzle in other words the opening lines of John the blink Jesus to pre incarnate Jesus TF2 Genesis 1 is also linking Jesus to Proverbs 8 and to both at the same time cool so notice their how it's a little bit different than Matthew Mark and Luke Matthew Mark and Luke you get a sense of the historical drama leading up to the moment when the god of Israel arrives there a new Exodus John gets into the prehistory yes for John it's all and he tells you that the epilogue this book is all about the identity of Jesus so he is going to have to tap you into is real story but really what he's focused on is how is real story
 illuminates the identity of Jesus and so you know who borrow from Genesis 1 in Proverbs 8 hilbar oh well it looks like another example this is later in the paragraph the famous Bruce 14th chapter one and the word became flesh and set up a tent among us and we saw his glory to glory as of the one and only from the father so that word that Divine word that created the word wisdom that through them that is God and with God through him God created becomes human you just you just completed those two things were done was the leader believed to be those who become of the same substance could we are as God speaks what does he speak out of he speaks out of his mind is mine was his wisdom is and when God speaks he orders the world and remember biblical wisdom
 craftsmanship your ability to craft something ordered and functional so God's word is an expression of us wisdom his wisdom is expressed through his words yeah there's word a nun to his word correct so that word becomes human and then John uses an odd phrase here it's the word for to set up a tent to tabernacled a very clearly that alluding to God's presents yes and if people often complained these two as the say this is Temple imagery and that's true but in the storyline of the Bible the temple is the brick-and-mortar version of a concept an idea that's already at work in the Bible in and through the 10th the traveling time to the tavernacle and John's uses the 10th imagery he could see me at the mobile right and so is Jesus Jesus so with that comes a hold saying about the Theology of the Tabernacle it's Eden
 or even touches Earth and Heaven on Earth so he uses verbs stay not know which is a verb of the noun that in the Greek Septuagint stay nice and Hebrew Michigan is the Tabernacle he is an incarnate Tabernacle at the Tabernacle itself was the Incarnation it was a physical manifestation of God's power and Glory Beauty so he's a human Tabernacle material material Incarnation that way I just thought of it as the holding tank for God's presence not that have some way it represented his presents otherwise the whole thing about holy Holiness Holiness or objects whose identity is transcended from their normal roll and they're brought into the Divine space
 cinnamon roll in the time purpose so you make these to the Tabernacle becomes Divine and some way well it it's an expression you have God's holiness and all the objects are very unique so you the oil made for the lamps you can never make that recipe of oil for anything else it's the sacred oil the 10th or the curtains you know that separate different Realms of Holiness inside the tent you know those are utterly unique not to be reproduced in any other way so it says this baby come ya co-opted into the incarnations John says we saw his glory the glory of God came into the tavernacle that's what you saw the fire Cloud color coming to descend on and fill up a tent so what John is doing he is tapping into the Hebrew Bible story but it's not just to say and finally he's here he's actually
 using a very potent image from the Hebrew Bible to talk about the identity of Jesus right that's kind of that pattern again so and every one of these patterns is putting Jesus in the Yahweh slot. John's really hammering that down that's right they were just doing it through a narrative means my remark put Jesus in the Yahweh slot when you quotes from Isaiah Malachi red one day you always going to come people staying John moves to do this are so clear that if it often makes especially modern readers are more attuned to the Jewish narrative style typical style it makes it feel like John's the only one who's making an explicit claims about Jesus Divinity where's matthew Mark and Luke maybe are showing more as a human
 but I said the misunderstanding we're just not getting the keys for Matthew Mark and Luke all four of them are doing this but John does it in a way that somehow modern modern Western readers feel like he's yeah so we could go on but we're just doing a little samplings here ready to the beach of the beginnings
Melissa's cousin just think of all four of those here for very different Beginnings yeah for totally different strategies introducing an ancient biography so Mark he does what you think is a direct quote of Isaiah Isaiah he says it is going to be a story about Jesus yeah block quotation and which is actually quoting from Malakai and it's all the set you up so you can understand why is going to tell you about John was going to introduce Jesus cracked and is supposed to be seeing the messenger declaring the way of Yahweh so he's using this kind of direct quotation to get your psyche into the Hebrew scriptures and seeing how it's connected to the whole story then what about Connex Matthew does a genealogy this hold the all he was scriptures is just one
 family Legacy really and he wants you to see how Jesus is the culmination of that Abraham has David Messiah over Israel exalted but then Exile and now we're waiting for a new David Luke does a lot more design pattern stuff with yeah he said off he introduces characters that are design patterns of characters you've met in order to see what Luke doing you really have to be clued into house design patterns work in in the Bible I would have never noticed that until you pointed it out or what he's doing with characters and he does it with minions characters are there aren't any explicit quotations for example Mark begins with a marked quotation as it says in Matthew begins with genealogies that are
 turn off of Old Testament genealogies Luke tells you a beautiful story and the parallels are just woven into the language and oh yeah but you also we are upright and blameless hyperlink to not able to have kids do you want to be uploading all those stories and paying attention to how the stories riff-off of correct or he's correct and he's doing that to make this kind of beautiful portrait of the humble and the lowly be exalted and being a model of faith yet and then John man he does similar hyperlinks thing where you just using phrases that makes you realize like oh he's doing creation stuff in the beginning light shining in the darkness has all Genesis 1 he introduces the word
 which is this attribute of God which is like a character in the Hebrew scriptures almost to Jesus shining and darkness inventory hear of techniques is all under the heading of a unique feature of the Gospel they're constantly and from the first moments tying the Jesus story back into the Hebrew scriptures yet so we seen lots of different strategies hear some Artisan the next one is Scholars debate the terminology here weather for the word illusion is a commonly used terms because when I allude to something I want you to see what I'm referring to but I want you to work for it whatever I use Star Wars like phrase is all the time around the house
 all right and that might my kids are now beginning to appreciate them cuz I've shown them the clips but the point is I need to be able to say you know your instincts it is this interesting with that is a communication technique of background knowledge and I'll suddenly allude to it and I'm putting the ball in your court to do the work yes to see what I mean and it could easily backfire and it could not land it wants the reward the reward is a bond between the speaker in The Listener it's like that becomes our thing and I guess the reward is what I do when I do Discover It. It means more because I worked for it it means exactly forcing The Listener or reader to participate in the discovery of the deeper meaning yeah yeah totally so this is actually
 well this is one of the main ways the gospels work be there is not a story not a parable of Jesus not a teaching of Jesus this isn't packed with Old Testament illusion so I've it just boggles my mind and too it's everywhere when we talked about before is in the baptism story which follows in Mark chapter 14 God says you were my son with you I'm well pleased and that's wording from three different passages in the Hebrew scriptures but it's not marked like the opening quote from Malachi and it says in the scripture that says you're supposed to pick that up correct but he's a boy he speaks is the language of Isaiah 42 Genesis 22 and song to all Blended together very strategically so this one you got to work for you have to read the Bible a lot and get the payoff here there you go there's nothing for it the gospel authors like her invite
 Jesus says to strategies when is direct quotation one is more indirect illusion and then there are two parallels and which is not language and sometimes not even verbatim words yeah but motifs the baron couple that God grants the miraculous than Jesus going into the Wilderness for forty days like it's real for 40 years all this kind of stuff Jesus talking with a woman at a well of Jacob which is where Jacob met his wife out of well this kind of thing so all of a sudden you realize every story has been designed this way okay so what's the first teacher of the gospels that's different than how it connects to the store this is makes them Stand Out Among comparing them to ancient Greek and Roman biographies heavily scripturally
 you got it you know this is really speaks to that this is going too fast for these Jesus like it's obviously what you're thinking so they're constantly pulling in the whole story I hope you see how it's all the unified rats yeah yeah Underneath It All is the other conviction that Jesus is the one bringing the unified scriptural story to its and taking it forward
 we just looked at how each gospel begins but I'm imagining that we could have jumped anywhere and any of the gospels are the beginning we do that anyways okay I don't have my print to see what happens if I just use one random alright be on the Baptist Jesus verses 1 through 6 11 with your six Jesus had finished instructing his 12 disciples and he went on from there which is where was he going around Galilee teaching the synagogue in their fifties now when John this is John the Baptist heard in prison cuz he's in prison about the Deeds of the Christ he sent word by his disciples and said to him are you the one
 used to come or should we look for another Jesus answered them don't tell John what you hear and see the blind receive the site and the lame walk lepers are cleansed and a death here and the dead erased op and the poor of good news preached to them and blesses one is not offended by me yes and then everyone's like what the heck you talk about Jesus we just want to know if you're the Messiah yep okay so the setting is John was the herald for Jesus yeah and now he's in prison and Matthew I forget by 11:30 the story yet know how we got in the prison yeah I think it's coming he's not going to tell you how John got in the prison until chapter 14 is a little of a preview a little preview and kind of chronological glitch almost where he's assuming something that he hasn't told you about yet but he's going to later
 the John sitting in prison and he hears of the works of the Messiah of Christ Jesus The Works of the members yeah he hears of the works of the Messiah and he's like oh yeah my cousin this is my son so Messiah supposed to be bringing the kingdom of God yeah I'm sitting here in prison what's in Jasmine that's a big disconnect the kingdom of God is here I think God would let me present I think the herald should be locked up shouldn't be locked up by the bad guys the bad guys were supposed to be getting ran out of town do you so is this going to happen yeah we're not people are surprised this is John expressing his doubt yeah I'm about to read scripture Matthew video
 this whole section and Matthew is different different ways people are responding to a portrait of a variety of responses to Jesus being some negative or neutral in some neutral and this one you said was neutral and let's face it is it is are you the one like I don't know I'm confused. Am I supposed to be looking for somebody else Jesus and people were like well yeah it wasn't if you said no but he is now I mean just cuz someone is full of faith in one moment doesn't mean they're full of Faith the next certainly characterizes my life to ya know the biblical authors that have pulled no punches it portraying characters looks like the warts-and-all approach yeah alright so
 look at one of this exercise is to show me look at Jesus house look at you as his response is words aren't even his own go and report to John would play during the blind receive site and the lame walk lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have good news and ask them to see it's just a list of 1 2 3 4 5 6 so notice the blind the leper the death the dead and the poor get three of those are directly out of the book of Isaiah so the blind receive site and the lame walking is Right copy and pasted out of Isaiah 35 5 and 6 oz yeah but Isaiah what again when Jesus or the apostles quote from one section of a chapter of a unit or
 what they're doing is activating the entire entire second war between two major sections of Isaiah and attacks itself this whole chapter is just all hyperlinks from other sections of the Buckeyes are so this is like a key juncture where you get the core message of the book and the poem that begins with the desert and the parched land is going to start rejoicing why cuz it's going to turn into a garden the Garden of Eden Wilderness will rejoice and Blossom like a crocus bursting into bloom for Joy singing and shouting for Troy you know what the glory of Lebanon the great Forest of the north will be given to it the Splendor of Carmel and chaperone okay so you have the desert is going to turn into the Garden of Eden and then Lebanon is going to be given
 and become like the forest of Lebanon what was Solomon's with building the Temple here he took the trees from Lebanon and they built the temple so a temple you have a forest garden tub is applied the temple growing in the garden in the wilderness and what's going to happen there they will all see the glory of Yahweh the Splendor of our God and God's Temple is going to grow a new lead in temples going to sprout in the wilderness or just the first paragraph by the way just all the design patterns right there in the first paragraph we're going back to show a literary connection like endless idea what the hell he was I would have been able to read that paragraph I mean I maybe after
 a half a day of working at can coordinate something then so we got okay at the desert that's great news a new Eden Garden temples can sprout in the wilderness what we've been waiting for since Genesis 3 y'all strengthen the feeble hands in the weak knees y'all say to those with fearful Hearts not be strong don't be afraid your God is coming he's coming with vengeance with Divine Justice your God is coming to save y'all so now we have a group of people who are being called to strengthen the weak and the hurting by saying no Yahweh hasn't abandoned us in the desert Gardens, then he's coming to save us or 5 then the eyes of the blind will be opened then the ears of the death will be unstopped then
 the lame will leap like a deer the mute Will shout for Joy Waters will gush in the wilderness streams in the desert the burning sand becomes a pool the Thirsty ground becomes bubbling Springs are we going to talk about that in the water is beating another words a garden growing in the wilderness of his people people's eyes being opened years being on bright-line the death the lame the mute water gushing in the wilderness these are all saying the same thing Kira got a new creation New Creation which is God's kingdom coming to rescues creation that's an exile from one section of a poem about saying to answer the questions he was asking yes New Creation really is arriving job it really is arriving here his response but then look at it last line
 he says how blessed is the one who who is it this is the word scandal in so I asked once but Isaiah chapter 8 and Isaiah at 8 Isaiah has written down his message of judgment and hope and the people have rejected him and so what he says is God says listen don't be afraid first 12 everything that this people called a conspiracy don't be afraid of what they're afraid of us 13 Yahweh of hosts that's who you regard as holy fear Him and then look at this for those who fear Him Yahweh is a sanctuary he's going to be like at Temple and this is all about the trial and Genesis one you are my rock and my Fortress Temple Gods The Rock Temple was life in the marriage becomes the safe sanctuary of those who will trust in him but for those who don't
 he becomes a stone to strike your foot upon and a rock to Scandal it so God is two kinds of rock based on whether you trust is a rock that you can build on the foundation yes or it can trip you or help you rock the stub your toe on the trip and are scheduled to last so Jesus activates this passage to where listen I'm here bringing about the new creation but there's some who aren't going to be able to see it and the things that I'm doing and saying is the new creation will actually caused them to stumble they'll stumble over got the purposes another was Jesus is saying I'm bringing about a moment of Crisis and decision for Israel they will have to choose just like they had to choose my last day so they have to choose now because I was a long day but that's all right that's the first unique feature of the Gospels
