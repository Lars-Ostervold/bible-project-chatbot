the main mode that many specially Protestants read the Bible in is the lesson for my life approach the Deep level Simpson is the Bible's like a moral handbook and each story is giving me a Life Application lesson that I can apply to my life and I think the gospel authors that's not what they're trying to do
 hey this is John at the Bible project this is the final episode in the short series on how to read the gospel the four books in the New Testament The Gospel according to Matthew Mark Luke and John collectively known as the gospels now if you're like me out of every part of the Bible these gospels are the easiest to read and it was fun to read through all about Jesus and Jesus is a really inspiring character we hear his teachings we see how he interacts with people and it's easy to draw conclusion that reading the gospels is all about trying to figure out how I should live by looking at how Jesus lived Jesus says to love our neighbors so should I Jesus says black people who heard me OK Google do that too but is there more to the gospels than just good more wisdom every story is not trying to give you a Life Application every story is making a claim about the identity of G
 that's the question that I should be asking when I finish each episode of the gospels is what's the unique Claim about Jesus being made from this episode of some new more elastic what are they trying to tell us so I took it for granted because when I was introduced to it that Jesus died so course that's what these books are going to be about this very careful design there tying Jesus story in is the filming of Hebrew scripture story line which is the story of Israel and of all humanity and then all of them are saying the story leads up to the moment of how would you wish Wonder workers execution but the simple point but that is their main point so today we conclude our time in the gospels with some more insights on how each gospel brings the climax of the story of the Hebrew scriptures in the life of Jesus and his death and his resurrection
 thanks for joining us here we go
we are talking about how to read the gospel The Gospel according to Matthew Mark and Luke John the good news of the life and death resurrection of Jesus and how it's connected to the entire story of the Hebrew scriptures and you want to walk us through four features of the gospels that will help you read it better hope you have a deeper encounter with these gospels were likely to see things you have seen before you start looking for for for new things for the first one and it was a big category which was the use of the gospel writers the use of the Old Testament Hebrew scriptures and how they refer back to it and connect it to what's happening in the Life Craigslist and they do that and these many techniques sometimes they directly quote from scripture this filled with spoken through the prophets
 pheasant in Mosasaur in the Psalms so it's referring to things in the story of the Bible through but bigger words phrases and words their unique or motifs of like how I'm a certain type of character or a certain type of setting and we talked about all the stuff in our design pattern is a third category yet that's okay right Solutions using direct wording biblical passages but just not mark it is that alright from a Biblical poems story okay but that but you don't work this out you don't Mark a difference between a metaphor and simile
 yeah or just you know as it says in Star Wars May the force be with you versus versus just May the force be with you and design pattern yet or what's the other phrase that you have parallels but I thought this was before week when you start using the term design patterns in our conversations developed a pattern design patterns just emerged it emerged and I like it a lot it's the term I use now okay and that's the use of characters use of setting these of plot at a certain vocabulary but not necessarily whole phrases yeah but just Jesus Goodwin Into the Wilderness for forty days yeah clearly we playing Israel's 40 years
 are you supposed to see his connection to all right it's all over saturates the gospels that's the first Feature Feature and I'm a reader I want to begin to read the gospels with greater wisdom Seymour dap be more in tune with the claims of the authors are advancing about Jesus to their community and at persuading me to embrace something about Jesus to believe and do something we've the ruler of creation bringing New Creation hike the high Bar for a document a feature of the gospels they are making claims about Jesus in the last episode one before I mentioned how at the end of the Gospel of John he gets a purpose statement for the book John 20 vs 30 and 31
 many stories another teachings about Jesus but I chose these so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah the Son of God genda so there's a few times where the gospel authors will directly make their claims about Jesus and that's one of them I want you to believe that Jesus is the Messiah Mark the first sentence of Marquita at the beginning of the Gospel about Jesus the Messiah the Son of God and he is small list of places where the gospel authors explicitly make a claim about Jesus so you can call those direct claims the gospels are most of the time indirectly making their claims about Jesus every story is advancing a claim about Jesus that you're supposed to reckon with as a reader nothing's there for just mere historical interest
 it's just a way to tune in to say I owe every story I'm so it'll stay there there's absolutely zero details that are there for storkel interest if it's there a serves a purpose and that purpose is to persuade the purpose of every story teaching has fits into a persuasion strategy of the authors which means that any detail that is given in some way AIDs that purpose differ from store to store in a bit and there are some that are more clear less clear but so just give me this was helpful when I want to tell you what I think I can do it directly I can also do it in directly and trust that eventually you'll start to pick up but I'm not the stuff of life my relationship to Jessica I can be really passive aggressive
 and I don't even realize how much I'm doing it and there's different types of being passive aggressive there's like kind of a malicious like I really want to tear you down, doing this pass pass away and then they just kind of more like I don't even realize how frustrated I am just kind of it's leaking out the type of indirect communication types of indirect there's no one can be you don't want to be direct cuz you don't think you should have to be on backwards the wrong way again and you're like the wrong view of the universe that's an example but we do this all the time in direct communication the gospels are as much as a look
 in direct me to church and what you're hoping is as you live with a person or get to know a person more they can be less direct you don't like it feels really good to not have to be directing for someone to get what you need or want or what you're saying then there's a special bond with are you guys okay it's someone you can just anticipate what you might be about to say so anyway and direct communication the gospel officers mostly communicate their claims about Jesus Through indirect music through the medium of the narrative kind of back to the how to read biblical narrative but specifically list they want to shape your perception of Jesus I want influence how do you think about Jesus so what are the gospels if you stack up what's in them there's a lots of narratives about Jesus performing signs and wonders
 likely acts of healing and restoration for lot poor hurting people I'm just a few lots of it so you just have to stop and again you can say well that's just what happened but that's fine but not everything to happen. Everything that happened in there for example there's no exorcisms in the Gospel of John not at 1 if we only have the Gospel of John we would never know that he perform at the Matthew Mark and Luke it's like every other story so that's a great example of their selectivity they don't have to tell you everything and they often don't so if it's there it's they're the repetitions there so the wonder-working Healer who performs acts of Deliverance and healing especially for the for the hurting this is a major major part of the portrait of Jesus in the Gospels
yeah these are stories that make me proud to be a follower of Jesus you know and some especially in cities in the west right now I'm being a Christian means that most people realize that you're stupid yeah he's worthy of being made fun of when you begin to tell stories about Jesus care for the hurting in the poor you know people like yeah that's cool I love these stories I think there's so many of them have to Stop & Shop why why they keep telling me this wouldn't one or two of us have sufficed like why multiple healings are blind people not just one but there's more than so they're trying to do something to you or trying to shape your perception of Jesus of who he pays attention to who he cares about through the repetition you begin the begin to see what Jesus values and who he values so that's one thing another part of that is especially in this
 for most cultures that aren't as like cynical and secularized as Western cultures stories about people perform healings and acts of feeling inside and wonders it doesn't arouse suspicion what it does is make people go through all this guy's got something going on it's impressive suspicion like kind of like the skepticism yeah that's right. It doesn't have to be in the modern Western contact you for like yeah right that's cute right I'm sure that happened but in cultures that are more open-minded about how the universe can work these are persuasive parts of a Genesis characterization I remember there's a great historical fiction work buy new testament scholar called The Lost letters of pergamum by Bruce Longenecker have I told you about this yes so good you have
 so what it is as you follow a character who's rich Gentile alike landowner who owns a bunch of olive Groves and then now he lives in prayer, and he meets some Christians and he starts attending a House gathering and you learn about how your average Roman would have perceived Jesus Through The Eyes of this character is he hears the stories of Jesus read at the weekly Gathering and he perceives the stories of healings as marks of a of the figure whose these are empowered by the gods or perhaps it a God incarnate like that's the category in the world and when they do it's usually the gods are at work this is remarkable yeah so this part of the portrait it's an indirect communication you can just say I believe Jesus is
 Yahweh come to visit his people which and they do say that in other ways but they're also saying it here in these narratives that's the important that they would have searched saying that the stories are in the gospel narratives because they really because it happened well I think the gospel authors want us to think the Jesus actually did and said these kinds of things right but that's not the only reason that's not the reason they put it in their correct because what he what I hear you saying is that they know okay this detail has persuasive power correct and so I'm going to put this detail and yeah I want you to believe that Jesus has power over having the nurse so lots of stories about him healing but then who does he heal constantly and then there you start to get the value set of this healer. He'll rich people who like invite him to come to his house and he heals poor hurting people
 I like that's right that's right I am and you'll see you'll see your son is Jesus's teachings if you have a red letter bible a Bible that highlights Jesus teachings and red you know the gospels will have long usually the red will come and dig blocks so the gospel out there's a lot to introduce you to the world that is teaching you want to recreate it for you but would you like to sit and listen to him correct and he was saying he was Parables of Jesus speaks for himself so the gospel others want to communicate to you about Jesus they mostly let his actions at the stories and his teachings were they let his teachings do it
 or they let other people do it story after Story in the gospels very often the story or the episode will conclude with people saying what they think about you and it's all a part of this strategy of your getting this variety of perspectives and every other scene ends with the secondary characters making some comment about the main character you would notice it, understand the main character and who they are and what identity and once you start paying attention to how often other people comment or wondering about Jesus so I think I just did a quick survey through Matthew the first character is God the First characters god this is my son chapter 8 the disciples asked what kind of man is this oh you know I didn't include at the end
 The Sermon on the Mount in the people say who is this and what is this Authority that years with the disciples at the end of chapter Matthew 8 what kind of human is this the demons in Matthew chapter 8 what do you want with us Son of God at the end of Matthew 13 the people of Nazareth this The Carpenter's son that's a good one by 13 you've been given all kinds of claims about Jesus now you're watching characters doubt him and like you said that this whole stretch of Matthew 11 and 12 is just responding correct Matthew 15 the Canaanite woman non-israelite woman confesses Jesus as Lord and send a text with Peter calls Jesus the Messiah the Son of the Living God the high priest asks are you the Messiah the Son of God Pilots ass are you the king of the Jews and the combination is the roman soldier who just killed who does executed them so surely this man was the son
 so what kind of a text has all these characters wondering about his identity or saying what they think it is a doubting it it's a major it's a communication strategy so one way to think about it is the gospel authors want to make claims about Jesus they almost never do it directly in a way they invite you into the narrative world so that you can meet Jesus and experience him for yourself so to speak it experience other people experience constructed for you the reader and again just like all indirect communication it forges a bond it forces you to own your own conclusions you have to work for your own conclusions you have to imagine yourself into the scene and at the end he all of a sudden you like well I've seen what he said I've seen what he did I seen how all these people respond to him
 nobody's neutral when am I going to tell us how it works so that's learning to pay attention to the indirect claims the authors make through the means of action characters into is the claims of Jesus in the gospels that are talk about directly under the questions about each story what's the takeaway here is very practical the main mode that many specially Protestant conservative Protestant read the Bible in is the lesson for my life approach to the past year the Deep level sumption is the Bible's like a moral handbook and each story is giving me a Life Application that I can apply to my life and I think the gospel authors are not that's not what they're trying to do every story is not trying to give you a Life Application every story is making a
 about the identity of Jesus building a case of building a case so the question that I should be asking when I finish each episode of the gospels is what's the unique Claim about Jesus be made from this episode that's going to build up think of a mosaic Rich portrait every episode in teaching adds a little bit more oil to the canvas portrait of Jesus it's not about me it's about me and that I have to make a decision about if I have the application it's pretty simple but what's unique and nuanced is the unique claim that each story makes and adds to the portrait of Jesus that's what was supposed to be quite that way before that. Help with me in this moment to think about that way
third perspective every one of the four gospels from the earliest moments in the book are building up to the moment of his execution and Resurrection in the words at the climax of The each of the four yeah is his execution in Resurrection I might seem self-evident yeah but it's good to remind ourselves that that's not the only way the people told the story of Jesus when you get into the Post New Testament. Where there's lots of other accounts of Jesus being written in these are made famous by Dan Brown in The DaVinci Code like the couple, talking with Thomas and all that is is a account of Jesus teaching secret is secret unrevealed teachings to the disciples and it's like a hundred plus two things Jesus that are very odd cryptic cryptic
 sample there's somebody presenting Jesus when did that come about a huge industry of debate whether it's somewhere in the early one hundreds of up into the 280 debate this thing for there is there's a presentation of Jesus and you don't have time to write a story of Jesus and make the death and Resurrection will become known as the Gnostic Gnostic sect and groups and kind of semi Christian send me mystical send me all kinds of other things but for them Jesus's death and Resurrection is not his main not the main event knew what he is is he's a he's not human he's a Divine figure who came looking like a human dispense secret knowledge and wisdom for how to achieve Illumination in to escape this world to the higher realm of spiritual truth and there today that's the Gnostic Gospel
 so there's no mention of his death just a death doesn't play any role in that portrait of Jesus because how could it it's not as if all is as a spiritual they don't even talk about it correct doesn't fit into their Paradigm so that's it for me once I learned that it was helpful to say are these four accounts there the earliest Matthew Mark Luke and John and they all have the same narrative Arc and they all from the earliest moments are moving YouTube Sam dissipation of his death on the light shines in the darkness and the Darkness could not overcome it but he came to his own but his own did not receive him if you're already in the opening sentences set up to this is going to be a conflict in Mark chapter 21 after Jesus baptized you goes out and he goes knee heals a man forgives our sins and then there were none who can forgive sins but God Alone Grumble the religious leaders and they make their pee
 it's about him just like that's how it works, the conflict has introduced early which makes you realize the whole thing is designed to lead up to the cross and when Paul summarizes the gospel on the 1st as we looked at both of them he emphasizes the resurrection that goes although it's that makes sense why is resurrection and Romans one can be the key event of the Gospel that he highlights there is just a couple of little facts but they're interesting so the gospel of Mark is the shortest of the four 16 chapters he spends ten chapters telling you the story of roughly 3 ish years of Jesus up and Galilee yeah the 60% of it is on three years three chapters a year
 focus on the course of seven days in Jerusalem to 7 days a week after your speeding through it over your clock in over three 3 chapters a year when you slow down to yes chapter day yeah yeah he is focused on seven slowed as they all lead up to the crucifixion all four of the gospels portray Jesus's crucifixion as a royal and thrown meant as the enthronement of King we looked at that in a couple portrait is the strain of Kratom in through yes so you just have to ask him what's happening here what kind of group would tell the story of the exaltation of their leader as that person's.
 yeah I think every one of them there's the dialogue with pilot is putting on of the robe in the crown and the scepter soldiers bow down to him very intentional all thing the substitution of the other prisoner Jesus right so there's another guilty one who said be crucified and so but Jesus is crucified in the place of bar Abbas who is the real guilty one for sure that's an icon that the motif of the meaning of the Cross you have a Israelite Rebel is rebelling against from is about to be executed and Jesus face with foot in the place of rebellious it's real and he faces the wrath of Rome in place I'm in. So yeah just have to ask there's a reason why all for climax of a story in this way the cross is the moment
 the whole story's been leading towards the resurrection then becomes the launching point of the Resurrection accounts are all very brief and puzzling they'd suggest whole universes of Wonder and then just move on you know the door was locked and then Jesus was in the midst of them is like what does it what does more about how do you have any fish I'm hungry and I gather the three perspectives then they're tying just a story in the filming of Hebrew scripture storyline which is the story of Israel and of all Humanity they are mostly communicating through indirect communication letting the stories speak his actions speak from him letting his words invite you in to consider him
 letting other characters perception of him help you come to your own perception of him and then all of them are saying the story of Israel the story of y'all and all creation leads up to the moment of a Jewish Wonder workers execution the kingdom of God that he's been announcing comes to a key moment as he's in surround as an executed Israelite Rebel yeah that's the kind which is it in the throat and throw them in as an excuse since it's an execution but they want you to see there is that that's where the god of Israel is taking this round of creation as he shames the power structures of our world for condemning the innocent so to me that's just I took it for granted cuz when I was introduced to it that Jesus died so course that's what these books are going to be about that's like no it's very careful design but every
 if someone ends with their death yeah that's right good yeah and with some great thing they did and correct from a group of people the apostles who all believe that the key event that gave meaning backwards all the way back to his birth and the launch the new thing that God is doing and that we are still a part of today yeah that's what these books are about an across your bed being the the crucifixion and Resurrection yeah without the Resurrection the crucifixion is just another sad story yeah just another Rebel Rouser getting killed and just another affirmation of the narrative Redemptive violence. Violence is how we bring peace to the world killing the bad guys and the Jesus story just throws of absolute
 that narrative where the execution of Jesus becomes God's condemnation was Paul said he uses the gods foolishness shames the wise it's a simple point they all four gospels are building from the very beginning up to the cross and the resurrection but that's just their main point
 is the kingdom of God that he announced from his first moments in the store a combination as he wasn't around
last point which was talked about in I may be in our Luke series long time ago each of the four authors has taken the stories and teaching the Traditions member Luke said and then I witnessed traditions in the Servants of the word is all the stuff yeah John told us at the end of gospel man if I were to tell you everything you said and did there's not enough scroll so about a hyperbole selected a certain amount and has arranged them in different orders included excluded to emphasize a unique portrait of Jesus you know I never really thought about the fact that there are a lot of stories about Jesus we just don't know ya on that like a lot of conversations he had yeah probably really cool things that he did
 and if you still have them I mean John tells you straight up any of us could write about everything except it kind of comfortable tragic I've come to appreciate that comment now because it inspires the imagination cuz the four gospels give me a robust in that picture that I can begin to imagine what he might be today or he did his kind of but I think that's the point is we have all the exhaustive yeah it's that now we have enough to know who he is or get to know ya his values that and what he cares about is those at yeah but you're at the point where
 so this point is to just say each of the four has arranged in a particular order with the particular set of unique seems they want to emphasize so each of the Gospel authors has shaped stories in a specific order with specific language reshaped the language of stories sometimes reshape what character say and do to fit into a pattern a unique scent pattern for what they want communicate as used to bother me and now I am real I love it it's one of the things I love by having four it says that Jesus is too rich for any one account to do justice to him and so we have of him not to stereo but quadruple I don't know what the term is surround sound
 differences between the Gospels when we first started talking about it it was it was challenged for me took me awhile to years to process in it I don't know what conversation that came up and maybe Luke Series yeah and I am more comfortable with it as well and it's been humming in the back of my mind as we talked about the gospels I'm just imagining many people listening going like they're having that question and then I'm like third discrepancies between the accounts yeah how do you trust the accounts if the discrepancies and and and when you start looking at some of them like that we like what you just said sometimes they'll just change the what was said correct and in my mind if you're going to give a biography you need to write what actually was said. So you should have the Liberty to discuss re-quote the way you wish he had said it you know that's thinking through a very like
 very specific kind of like a specific kind of document has a specific purpose report was the report that came out about the Russian interference with America and that kind of report it's like they really want to make sure that yeah what is sad corresponds to what happened in that foot noted and they needed the transcripts and what did you say on this day and then you give him the quote and then you got the other person and another room later what did they say and it's kind of close but different you're not going to be you know like anyways and then if I wanted to explain to you the meaning of what happened I'm not going to be concerned with the exact wording but I'm going to be concerned with quoting it such a way that you understand the meaning correct
 you have to try to like lie or confuse you the truth but actually to get to the heart of why it matters the heart of the truth and so have I thought about that more more more comfortable with that you gave the example of telling the story of relationship of courting your wife you tell that story you're not necessarily telling the exact way it happened you might be blending certain stories in the one you might be conflating multiple dates into one yeah recounting of yeah that's right yeah you might directly quote something she said but it happens if we did have a video recording of that time to go back until like Ashley said something slightly different and you have been such a thing on our minds like that's what you meant and she said so we're in the situation where
 people memorizing the teachings and memorable sayings of the rabbi's this is a thing of Jewish culture so that's a big part of what's going on but the other than there are a lot of the narrative framework send even the precise wording is adaptable the value said that they have in writing these ancient style biographies is the main goal The Bouncing to priorities while in his faithfulness to the Traditions that they received a second is their persuasion calls and to help the reader see the meaning of what happened and so to do that the Roman Centurion at the foot of the cross can say surely this was the son of God and then Mark or surely this was an innocent man is in Luke the point is is the tradition remembers there was a soldier they're experiencing a moment some kind of moment over there and what exactly he says is adaptable based on the unique goals of each of the stories and
 nothing for a man to just like Wreck-It wrecking ball that you said both up the volume on the Moses Illusions and design patterns Jesus is he goes to the tall mountain and gives his position on a Ten Commandments after going through the desert for day and yeah that's Matthews and he'll adapt the wording and tweak the arrangement of things to make the design pattern with Moses work that that Jesus is scrap Moses figure in greater than Moses figure correct but I just kind of want to make that I am more comfortable with how how this works in the gospels however there's a is a spectrum of comfort so totally like if you adapted
 the thing that someone said but it's basically the same that's on one level but the example you gave of the the Roman Centurion there's like a completely different quote what it is is this Roman Centurion has a conversion of his perception of Jesus I just killed this guy as a guilty criminals for election between that he's innocent we're in the wrong I see around timelines yeah or changing the setting of where the story took place it might be the story in a specific setting gets blurred and another one because the point setting isn't crucial I think this one is when Jesus calms the waters and Matthew's account in Matthew 14
 Jesus gets into the boat after the Peter sinks in the water and is gone and then Jesus gets into the boat and they worshiped him saying truly you are the Son of God in Mark's account in Mark 6 Jesus gets into the boat and they were completely stunned for they understood nothing about the Loaves and their hearts were hardened that's pretty big difference of Matthew portrays them as having a moment of you are who you say you are Mark portrays them as completely ignorant of who Jesus actually is that would be on the other kind of like maybe a little too much Liberty here always like they're taken that Liberty to progress the point they're trying to make this right and so I guess it's just at what point are you crossing a line and how much Liberty or take
 and it seems to me that my Baseline is not the same as these authors Baseline that's the first point I shouldn't assume that my assumptions about how you write a biography she should be the gospel authors options here it should be the opposite I found one understand them on their terms I should learn about how they perceive that I mean I know you said you would feel more comfortable with this but when you start looking at this doesn't it just start to for the normal person make you start to wonder can I trust anything oh I actually had the opposite effect over time because what I would be highly suspicious that the visits they were all uniform in different details and that they were actually what you can see in the manuscript history is scribes trying to iron it out it harmonize them to each other so that they don't stories Our intention to anymore
 so the fact that the earliest generation was okay with these differences I think that's worth stopping in really considering it did this didn't discredit I see these these testimonies in the earliest generation agreed on what the main point was the Hebrew scriptures is being fulfilled in the sky and his death resurrection of the unique point of The Story from beginning to end the disciples don't ever get it until the last moment he saves their comprehension of Jesus for the last moment and what Matthew wants to portray is a more slow progression in fits and starts so which one's more true about the problem actually I think I think they probably did get to know him in fits and starts because Mark wants to save everything for the cross in the resurrection as the moments that review
 is Identity the Roman soldier is the first person in the story to get who Jesus is in marks account and he saved that I think because he knows how strange it sounds to say that the executed criminal is the king of the universe and so he saves it until the moment to have somebody get who Jesus is here cuz he's acknowledging that it's hard to see if I think but Matthew has a different communication strategy and so what it doesn't mean is that nothing happened what it means of them being given four angles on the meaning of what did happen they were some people do as they say okay well who knows what happened and and so if I'm going to have any sort of assurance of something happening you want corroboration and I guess the question is
 level of corroboration that's right then makes you have confidence that something did did not happen correct and if there's details that are different does that mean you can't trust the corner of of what it's saying that's one of the other angle is they knew when they were changing details and they were doing it on purpose so that they can better communicate the things that really matter to them which was it you saw how this was all connected to who Jesus really was not because they're trying to fool you tell you something that's not true but because they just don't want you to miss their okay taken certain Liberties correct that from my perspective as a more modern enlightened person you just don't do that it's actually that's the opposite of persuasion is a discredit to correct correct and yeah these authors didn't write thinking about how they could privilege some later cultures view of how you write biography
 today they have the four different kind of you know what I'm going to do is read that story and Matthew and then just go quick flip to Mark's version and compare the differences and then you can see the unique differences between them so Matthews turning up the Moses volume is turning up the themes of Jesus a constantly being way more cryptic and a riddler and being a lot like the weird stuff that the prophets do you have all the facts and nobody ever gets who he is and he's constantly telling everybody be quiet about him so that's a uniquely loud semen Mark Luke has to
 seems to work with Luke to the nation's about the book of Isaiah dramatized narrative eyes book of Isaiah and then the Gospel of John is all about that Yahweh is Real's God Has Come to Us in the person of the sun John doesn't have hardly any ethical teachings of Jesus except love each other as I've left you she is his only ethical love your neighbor so how has John we would know he had did exorcisms yes and we wouldn't have the same teaching would be loved each other and believe in me and taken the claim about Jesus identity and made that the central organizing feature of the story so John has also moved the straw that breaks the camel's back to get cheese at executed when he storms
 the temple after he rides into Jerusalem on Sunday over the tables major at the why did I get killed for this kind of thing. John is taking that story which is the culmination of Matthew Mark and Luke and he's place that at the beginning of his accounting chapter 2 but he wants to build a whole set of stories that linked together showing Jesus as the true Temple the ultimate Temple and so in that story he storms the temple and says kill destroy this Temple my body and I'll raise it up in three days and then he then John can lay all this other Temple stuff and it all connects back up to that story that's another good example where they're not just giving us a video camera footage today and that's the connects idea of God incarnate Temple the temple is
 the Temple's where God dwells people that I have found helpful over the years the gospels are connecting Jesus tore the Old Testament they indirectly make their claims two gs is actions his words through other characters perception of him all of them are leading up to the cross and Resurrection as the climactic point where the meaning of Jesus is discovered and then each of the four of them have a unique portrait an arrangement instamatic emphasis and if you just start reading with that mccastle to come really really exciting Adventure

There's usually note that people didn't understand that they were puzzled and he even said and one important moment in Mark chapter 4 he said the parables are on
