we've been tracing the theme of the firstborn it's a theme about how people use power what we've seen is that people consistently use the power to oppress us they use others for their own benefit to keep themselves elevated but Jesus is the firstborn son of God wields his power and Cosmic Authority in a way we can never seen before and what Jesus as the Son of God is going to do with his Cosmic Authority is to go reach to the people in the lowest status in his Society Community before the imprisoned blind the oppressed and Elevate them enough the power of the Divine first born at work in the world in fact this is exactly what Jesus says he has come to do one day in the synagogue he reads from The Scroll of Isaiah it says I have come to Proclaim good news to the poor this quote is about God's coming Cosmic King and those they're listening write him off so he leaves the synagogue and immediately in cash
 an evil spirit whatever present is driving this man knows who Jesus it because it says leave us alone have you come to destroy us I know who you are you are the Holy One Of God this is ironic because the people in the synagogue relax who is this and then here's the death Spirit who knows exactly who is Jesus drives out the unclean spirit and then he continues throughout its Ministry to touch all sorts of people considered unclean under the levitical law now if he was a typical priest a rabbi this act would have made you this unclean to but instead his touch makes the unclean clean with Jesus if not contagion that spreads but his Holiness and Tay just holding it for a contagious life bullying us describes God that's the unique one who is the source of life it's as if Divine life is what becomes contagious through Jesus
 today Tim Mackey and I were talking about how Jesus uses his power as the cost of the firstborn I'm done calling you listen to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 Hey Tim hey John hello
 a word we're at it again we're going to read some scripture related to the theme of the firstborn many conversations many episodes in to this conversation tracing the theme of the firstborn though if you've been following through you know at this point it's like it's about like everything in the Bible themes kind of work but I think an episode or two ago you asked me to do a summary and I feel like I really
 didn't do a very good job cuz you have to jump in and rescue my summary that got off track began with a pattern in the Genesis scroll which is God wants to partner with his human images who will be his presents and representatives of his authority and stewardship over creation and so he elevates the Human images from the dirt in the dust as images of God to rule on his behalf and what happens is that the beasts of the field you have a hunch is actually one of the Heavenly rulers of the lights appointed to rule above and they won but a creature deceives the humans into doing the opposite of what God commanded for their good and for their life and so they end up using their own death without even fully knowing that's what they're doing by disobeying the Divine command
 so they exiled from the heaven on Earth place and what God promises however is that he will raise up a human from the lineage of these human rulers to bring future descendant who will destroy and crush the evil one cross evil at its source and restore the Eden blessings to all of creation and so that lineage that promise starts getting carried forward through the future generations of the Human family and what happens outside the garden is each generation God chooses one who will be the carrier of that promise and they have his first was two brothers and what God doesn't do is choose the first born who's the culturally assumed one who would have the right and responsibility and God chooses the second born and this begins a theme where God chooses us a carriers of his promise the latecomer the second-born the one of low status
 and gives them this elevated promise of blessing so he does this with Jacob over Esau was Joseph in Judah over their brothers get us this with Rachel one of the wives of Jacob who's of Love status in the family cuz she can't have children and then this pattern discontinued is where God keeps identifying himself with the lowly with the slaves like the Israelites in Egypt he calls my first born and he elevates them over Egypt who claims to be you know of the embodiment of the divine presence in the world and so really what the theme of the firstborn turns into his about God's challenge to distorted human systems of power and volume status
 and his way of bringing the promised delivery is to up and everything that humans have created is good in their own eyes and we've been tracing him through the Toys R Us through the prophets and now into the story of Jesus house that great yeah and one part of this that I kind of lose track of is that the purpose is that all of humanity is elevated as good as God's image of all Humanity male and female together being the image of God that God isn't trying to just find one family or one person
 he actually wants all of humanity to be this image but in order to rescue Humanity from Evil there is a person write a seed so now we have to kind of narrow down and see God choosing this line with us he's going to come from and it's easy to confuse that and think o God's choosing a family because God wants to elevate one family over the rest of the families of the world are one nation of the rest of nations of the world because he somehow loves them more or the right there where that his love is a zero-sum game yeah it's kind of what he says to Kane it's exactly right yes is Kane gets angry that God shows favor on his younger brother and he does God shows favor its space turns toward Abel and the happens and can't gets frustrated and he thinks it's a zero-sum game and then God says hey do what's right and you two will be what
 what is he say exhausted lifted exalted listed it I think my translation says accepted or something yeah yeah yeah it's so God wants to elevate both brothers but it's his mode like it's kind of get scandalous to us of like old is God playing favorites over here and why isn't God protecting my power and my privilege and why is he like taking care of this Outsider or this person I don't think deserves or why do choosing one family to give his Covenant to versus each other families and that's a whole dynamic that we've been exploring and then when we make the theme video this is a big part of how we kind of friend the conflict in the video is that how people respond to God's choice of one is often what creates the hostility in the conflict secane murder stable you have rivalry between Abraham and these other people in the land that perceive that he
 the bearer of God's blessing rivalry between Jacob and Esau that's one level of rivalry is when the one of higher status for the firstborn becomes hostile to God's chosen one who is lesser but then we've also noted there's other ways the conflict can start you can happen with a non chosen sibling who has neither the firstborn or the chosen one and like ham son of Noah makes a power grab so the conflict and start that way or the conflict can start when God's Own chosen one like the lesser the later born with a lesser social status person gets elevated and it goes to their heads and they make poor decisions every way possible
 humans mess up what God is trying to do in the park and ride the biblical stories about how God keeps creating goodness and accomplishing his purpose even in the face of human hostility kind of two things God's doing one is the big metal thing which is making all of humanity His Image but then second is the like sub storyline which becomes the main storyline of the Bible which is rescuing Humanity from ourselves so that we can then become as if they did not rescue plan requires him to keep choosing families and choosing people who will be the picture to the families who the seed will come from because both of these storylines with him, tis God's like generosity that God would share his power with humanity and that he would then go out of his way to like make this work even though we have
 rebelled against it and I keep thinking about how this is rubbing up against then
 the problem of evil and I think we talked about this a little bit so this is total aside but is this property is this proper meditation practice to say like look at Cain and Abel and let's use them as a pattern of the older in the younger than more powerful in the less powerful the one that should be chosen the one that's lesser and now let's take that back to the first iteration which is the Spiritual Beings and humans in the animals in the humans and animals and the rulers come before humans in the 7-Day creation narrative about the relationship between the beings to the firstborn of God's creation in a sense the first the first ones given authority to to rule have to have dominion in the in the Skies over time
 and seasons and that whole idea of these glorious Divine Spiritual Beings and their power in the heavens that God gives them first before then they sex their creatures God gives and elevates us to be his image and what we talked about is how the second temple tax and also other parts of Hebrew Bible and starts to kind of eliminate and you think about how it was Envy of the Spiritual Beings feel like a man these creatures don't deserve such a high-status why is God showing favor on then why is God's face on them more than us like this is ridiculous and in a way then you can kind of replay the Cain and Abel story with the Spiritual Beings and I wonder can you imagine God going to a spiritual being and saying like hey
 why are you angry like do what is right and won't you also be exhausted and is this idea that in the whole fabric of the cosmos all of God's creatures like he wants to elevate everyone in their place if there's enough for everyone there's enough for the spiritual beings and for Humanity and for the animals and all God's creation and the problem is is we can't we just don't trust that that's true humans and Spiritual Beings and we get scandalized when we don't think it's being like mediated out in a way that distributed equally distributed equally on the timeline that we think is back right than just the timeline and also in the manner of me like Hey we're first and we're more powerful you should be like favor
 and everything would be better why are you like focusing on these dark creatures that scandalous and so like all of the problems that generator out of the Bible come from this vets like we can't trust God's generosity like his timing and means that so I remember talking about this with you but just brush my mind again and Kane and Abel what YouTube exalted like I just think about Spiritual Beings more well thank you for sovaldi you're recalling like our first conversations in this series
 but also I wonder if it's fresh on your mind because our last conversation was about the early chapters of the gospels and yes what is important is that the Hebrew Bible when you're in the narrative world you're hearing a story you know that goes from the beginning on and is real story Into the second temple. But the formation of that collection of the Hebrew Bible took place over a very long course of many generations and each generation receiving what came before was praying and meditating on the Traditions they received as they were having the new experiences of God's purposes in their history and that's what new experiences became part of the tradition than that was added to what was meditated upon and all collected together so that when you read the Hebrew Bible as a whole
 when we read the garden there it says you're meant to read them with an eye and they are designed in the shape they are now with an eye towards everything that's coming which involves a lot of meditation on the powers above and human powers below so that by the time you get to Daniel for example
 Daniel has a fully worked out
 view of all of these things and it's exactly what you're saying is Rebel powers above those Rebel Powers below and they're linked their liked the Heavenly rulers and their Earthly rulers which is why you've got Heavenly princess of Persia you know that are resisting Michael the Archangel and their parallel to Nebuchadnezzar and Darius the kings of Babylon and Persia who are resisting God's human Partners Israel on Earth and it's all like a mirror of each other so that when we get to the gospels there's been so much meditation on that that that's why the gospels present Jesus is conflict with the rulers of Jerusalem as a conflict with the snake which is what Jesus is testing in the wilderness was all about and why I was framed as he's an Israelite replaying Israel's history like the forty years in the wilderness is 40 days
 and he's like David King David overcoming The Temptations and failures of King David but he's also like a new human he's a new Adam resisting the defeat of the snake in the garden he's all of it yeah okay well what you just made a connection that was helpful to is that reminding us the rulers above and rulers below aren't like two separate stories like they're linked yeah they're linked like there's something there yeah that's really fascinating I mean not yet it's a view of reality is that I find I have had to take a lot of time and exposure to like adjust to seeing the world yeah the other linked it so also Jesus is casting out demons a lot and that's part of this to write like yams like the fight that he's fighting is often like sometimes it's like
 religious leaders and disagreements and stuff but mostly it's with demonic powers and Jesus is presented as both the sign of Adam the son of humanity as we tracked us with his genealogy like in Luke for example in the last conversation where this is big emphasis on it was thought the son of Joseph you was my logical side of Mary and you'd have thought to be the son of Joseph and that's why the lineage of Joseph is brought back to the son of Adam the Son of God so he's the son of God in terms of one aspect of what that phrase means which has to be from God yeah but then in Jesus baptism he's presented as God's firstborn or godson in the even more Cosmic Eternal sense and that's what the baptism of the bout so he's both the human that we need to be the human partner that fulfills that story and promise from the early chapters of Genesis but it turns out that the human partner that we need
 needs to show exceed the capacity of what humans have been capable of so far that the one who's able to do it is actually God become human in the person of the Sun and so that's how Jesus is introduced to us as the firstborn or the Son of God in the early chapters of the gospels yeah yeah man for me feel like it sometimes I don't know it's what I love John is the organic nature of when we go on these theme Explorations because it feels like as you work through the biblical story Clarity begins to emerge as you meditate and restate it over and over again at least that's my experiences these conversations and that it kind of is what it's like to read the Bible as meditation literature as a unified story leading to Jesus
so where we left the last conversation was with the testing of Jesus in the wilderness he overcomes that test as the Son of God and then we were tracking with Lux account. He goes to his hometown and goes to synagogue gathering on I don't think he says it was Shabbat Sabbath gathered it just says he went to a poem that's connected to a network of Palms about God's servant who's going to be highly exalted and given God Spirit like David was and what Jesus as the Son of God is going to do with his Cosmic Authority is to go reach to the people in the lowest status in his Society Community the poor the imprisoned the blind the oppressed
 and Elevate them and that's the power of the first born the Divine first born at work in the world not where we left it which is very similar to the power of God at work Bible and behold God's firstborn
 I will unpack that more I'm sure later is got the same mode of interfacing with Humanity while it's fractured again the desire that all will be exalted right the desire is like hey if you do what is right want you to be exalted but like I'm going to favor the poor and oppressed like that's where my attention is going to be right now that's right so one thing we didn't do when we concluded that story in the last at the end of the last conversation was no. What everybody says when he puts the scroll down you put the Isaiah scroll down and a bunch of people were speaking really well of him like what a wonderful sermon you know I'm coming back next year but I want to hear this guy again but others were saying wait isn't this the son of Joseph
 whose son is this guy talking like he's something special but we know who he actually is Joseph I mean on a craftsman family you know up here in the Hills but yeah it's not he's not like a
 that's not nothing Craftsman but it's like where does a Craftsman son get the gumption to say that he is the anointed spirit-empowered Son of God servant to bring out the kingdom Sport and this is connected to this idea that while Jesus is the true image of God the first born as he's presented in the narrative is as an outsider and as a lesser person like you know like a Samuel yes he didn't come from Priestly stock but he's going to be elevated to be the like ruler so and we'll keep tracking with Luke's account so what you have after the Nazareth moment that we just concluded is Jesus starts going out and bringing the healing power in the good news of God's kingdom to the park exactly what you get so he walks
 synagogue and there's a guy who's this direction being says that he had the energy of an unclean spiritual being a spiritual being associated with death in the Underworld and disguise driven by something powerful and crazy and unclean meaning what here in pure yeah actually we talked about this years ago in our God series on Spiritual Beings because is a kind of to Rabbit Hole is here one is there was a very popular tradition in second temple Judaism that the majority of invisible powers of evil at work here in the world roaming around the world is the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim the Giants who are slain at the flat and you can track with this theme is developed in a bunch of Jewish literature associated with Ino
 all the books of Enoch but also I work all jubilees so that's one popular belief at work was that these are the ongoing Legacy of the Giants the mutant creatures that were inspired by the spiritual rebellion of the sons of God in Genesis 6 that's one and because it comes from their dead bodies that dead bodies are considered a computer that's one explanation the other man explanation is that it doesn't necessarily mean that to everybody that every Jewish person but because evil Spiritual Beings are associated with death and the underworld that means they're associated with dead bodies or corpses and that's what a could mean to yeah because like technically this Purity law stuff from Leviticus mainly is a very specific thing out of the Jewish Covenant law of like the specific things you can do to become virtually in pure and one
 it's like touching dead bodies and so that's because it's like connected to the underworld and death then it's like calling it unclean is just being like this is related to death and yeah it makes you a that's right. He is to be in a state where I am able to be in proximity to life goodness Beauty and everything God wants the Human family to be in a state means that I've been in proximity or touched something associated with death and so in Leviticus it's just a few things it's like blood bodily fluids dead bodies mold mold skin disease be used for a temporary. Ritually a which means that you're on the desk-side but God has provided a way through the Liturgy is in the rituals of the temple and priesthood for you to enter a state again so these are spiritual creatures associated with
 the dad in the Underworld the realm of death and that's why sensually what unclean should kind of signal for our ears feel like to a Jewish person who just reader of this
 this isn't just someone who's I guess you have a category of like man if you are an employee or state yeah that's bad I mean I mean it's sinful but it's like not a good condition to be in and but then you can go and you can change it but here's an image of a person so like overcome with death and empowered by death that there a state is like turn to 11 it's like no getting out of it this person is too far gone in Jewish Society at the time this will be somebody who's so on the margins they're not even of sound mind and heart and their bodies their minds their way of life shows their likely a must or they're likely a beggar and so this is the first person that Jesus drawing attention to and Luke
 that this is the first encounter he has after leaving the synagogue that's really significant is that whatever presents ride is driving this man knows who Jesus is cuz it says leave us alone what business do we have with you Jesus of Nazareth have you come there but they aren't cleaned even have you come to destroy us I know who you are you are the Holy One Of God this is ironic because the people in the synagogue we're like who is this and then here's the death spirit and who knows exactly who it is is heavy irony there so Jesus you know challenges this spiritual presence and drives exiled him from the man and the man came out of him and everyone's everyone's amazed in the message start spreading
 then he goes to his friend Simon's mother-in-law the woman and she has a fever so he heals her
 and then the Sun is setting and anybody who is sick or with diseases were brought to Jesus and he laid his hands on them, like a priest has hand on the animals and start healing them and Edward we when we did the holy this video is so powerful for me for you to point out that by touching someone sick makes you and pure in the Covenant law in that letter G but here's Jesus touching the sick and making them pure it's like I power is reversed contagious Holiness contagious contagious life of life and so is this Divine life is what becomes contagious through Jesus and so another was a priest wouldn't come and lay their hands on someone sick right because that would make them inferior
 the rituals for it and people need to go through a waiting. And then have a washing before they can enter stage Purity again yeah. Powerful stuff the next sentence after he tells everybody is it just gives a summary of other demons were being cast out by people and they were shouting you are the Son of God the one theaters the Sun theme again but Jesus wouldn't allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah even right there normally if you're like a hereditary Prince just come into your new surround you go around with like Harold's announcing it and so look at the irony of the scene is Jesus has Harold's all right as the Royal Cosmic son
 but he's telling them to be quiet and the Herald's are like the forces of evil and the people were watching all this for like off who's who's this guy I love his sermons you know about Joseph Stalin don't listen to that kid that's really amazing it's like this is the Royal Herald but in this really upside down way anyway man I can just read the gospels all day these are just like such powerful stories
so let's see he keeps on this is basically just sets the tone for Luke chapters 4 5 6 7 8 he heals a man is paralyzed at the rat story goes and Associates with a tax collector and invites him into the crew that's an outsider definitely an upside-down move or a choosing so it's not just now the first born in the second-born cuz member whoever is the second born now is whoever is a blow status you're on the margins the sick the yeah so in this Society tax collector which would be then you know a brother Jewish brother who is like now in League with the Roman Empire till I extract money from you on their behalf and is often fairly crooked about it yep like those are not the good guys yes it's a notice how the Rivalry The Sibling Rivalry thing gets brought up Tim this is great actually in Luke Chapter 5 so then Levi who's like able
 or like Joseph who got elevated above when that's total surprise eggs throws a big party and invite all these other tax collectors and other Sinners by there cuz he's like man is this is how God operates I want to tell all my friends and then he was caned or hears Esau grumbling and it says the Pharisees and scribes began grumbling at the Disciples of Jesus saying with tax collectors and sinners why are you turning your attention to them like why are you including the like you're you're missing it there scandalized by that in other words the gospel authors have been tracking with the cycling of these themes in their family history in the scriptures
 and so when they present the story of Jesus look at how they tell it they're telling it as another iteration of this pattern of the Rivalry and so Jesus response was interesting he says listen it's not those who are healthy who need a doctor it's the SEC so I haven't come to call the righteous but rather Sinners to repentance and it's kind of like his response. Response to cane which is like listen your I mean kind of but also really developed yet I'm not saying it yet but the point isn't like God's not against you like your righteous you're already on in the Covenant like you're good yeah okay he's not saying it's the same sentiment of like hey there's enough of God's generosity for all of us and so of course I'm going to go extend it to the people who need it the most. Doesn't mean that you're going to miss out healthy
 yeah but their grumbling is going to become hostility able to become very eventually so yeah it's another iteration of like the grumbling of the firstborn but in a different key cuz we're the different moment in the story okay so where I want to get you next is Jesus is spreading the good news of God's kingdom he's the son of God and this is how he's doing he's doing it exactly the same way that God was up to in the storyline of the Hebrew Bible so this tension keeps building and building until we get to chapter 9 and
 this is a moment parallel to Jesus's baptism again and we're almost almost halfway through Lux account. Quite okay so Luke 9:28 some eight days after saying what he just said for this he took along Peter and John and James then they went up onto a mountain to pray so if your kid into the way Eden imagery works in the Hebrew Bible back when Jesus went to a river
 anytime you're in the presence of a river
 you know that the river of Eden should be on your mind and this might be some kind of even seen similarly Eden is portrayed as being on a high hill but later double-crossers call the mountain and so he goes up onto a mountain to pray it's like commune with the father so while he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothing became White and flashing but they say he becomes like a lightning a source of light and there were two humans talking with him one was Moses and one with Elijah and they also appeared in glorious splendor
 and what they were talking about was his were Jesus's and it's the Greek word Exodus they were talking about the Exodus he was about to bring to fulfillment in Jerusalem right there like there's just there's a lot happening right there well but I think you've made all the all the observations like I mean on a mountain place to pray so the Moses and Elijah thing isn't incidental touchy really key to the claim about Jesus's identity here so Moses was this very significant leader who was like the closest to the image of God had to find in the Hebrew Bible it seems like he was also second one
 oh interesting yeah elevated to that privileged experience and Elijah Elijah is in the narratives about him specially in 1st Kings chapter 1719 is portrayed as a new Moses type figure both Moses and Elijah are the only two people that ever Ascend Mount Sinai or Mount Horeb both encounter the divine presence in Fire and cloud and have conversations with God on the top of the same mountain with the same kind of manifestations of power so I think the claim the shock Factor really is if you get the hyper likes here so Moses and Elijah are the two figures and Hebrew Bible they also represent the two big parts of the Hebrew Bible the Torah Moses and the prophets Elijah and
 they're the two people that the two figures who encountered the fire Cloud flashing presence of Yahweh and talks with that presents on the top of the mountain and so what Luke is doing is he's portraying this as an apocalypse of revealing of Jesus's real identity and he puts Jesus in the slot of the Divine Yahweh fire presents that Moses and Elijah met on Mount Sinai okay I've never had it put that explicitly before Jesus also as he does so he becomes a gleaming human image of God's glory which is what the high priest of Israel symbolized in represented yeah is a gleaming glowing figure dressed in white going into the holy of holies but Moses and Elijah didn't meet Erin on top right
 the one that Aaron is an image of namely the fiery presence of y'all my wow so that's remarkable Peter and his companions fascinating they were overcome with sleep
 what's the flight seem like the opposite of what I would be feeling if I was there yeah I just like us. And they're like that's cool but I'm tired or were they already sleeping that's a good question it's been a long time since I drove into the Greek of this account cuz whether or not to sleep this portray this happening it might be that it's saying like this was all happening while they were going to sleep which is to get it again because what it means is they were in the dream state and dream states are connected to the Visions dreams and Visions apocalypse apocalypse apocalypse is happening when our normal level of human consciousness gets subverted Rider are normal ways of seeing reality get surrendered when we are functioning at a deeper level of Consciousness awareness and I think that's what we were meant to see here this was an apocalyptic Vision a lot like what Jesus saw in the baptism
 but then they're told to be fully awake and they're still saying this so it's happening it's not like in there but that's the thing about these Altered States Of Consciousness and dreams and Visions in other words for us when we think of dreams and Visions we think of your seeing something that's only half real and the biblical I just have the exact opposite of something which is the average walking through life seeing half real yes and those moments where we get a revealing an apocalypse of what of what truly real and that's what this is so they see all of this and they saw his glory Jesus are not Royal Splendor in the two guys standing with him so Peter comes up with this idea that a man we need to make some Tabernacles yeah this is such a weird like part of the story for me yeah but what did the Tabernacle in the Hebrew Bible what is it hosts that hosts
 the divine presence oh okay but now he's seeing three glorious presence has yeah you like set up camp for everyone and then Luke says you know after Peter says let's make Street Tabernacle if you know one for you one for Moses 13 Elijah and then Luke says he didn't know what he was talking about even crazier while Peter was talking a cloud came and overshadowed them
 so now they're in heaven right they all of a sudden swept up into the heavens in the form of this Cloud as they enter the cloud and a voice came from the clouds saying this is my son My Chosen One listen to him so this whole scene is a replay of the baptism but now there's other Witnesses and Jesus as identity is kind of explored even more in parallel listen to the implications of what the voice said another word to this scene is kind of feeling out what you should have got for the baptism but now it's filling it out with even more hyperlinks and so notice Jesus's status as the sun is front-and-center right here and he's the chosen son in the baptism he was called the beloved Son now he's called The Chosen son
 which is another word from the syrup bombs and Isaiah in the scroll of Isaiah the chosen one and listen to him is that connected to Shamar yeah and the phrase comes from that the hyperlink to Deuteronomy chapter 18 when Moses says one day God is going to raise up a prophet like me from among the people listen to him so he's being identified this literature so dense man Jesus being identified as the fiery divine presence at the Moses Elijah met on the mountain that's why all that took up residence in the Tabernacle he's being portrayed as the high priest as the one that the high priest symbolized with the white clothes in the middle of the Divine glory and he's being portrayed as
 the son of Psalm to this king from the line of David the chosen one who's that's from the servant Pawns in the hand of the Prophet like Moses who is to come from the Torah just liked it so dense and then what's the voice spoke Jesus was alone everyone is silent it was over
 yeah apocalypse over yeah so what all of Luke 4 through nine is taking you on a journey of the baptism with Jesus being commissioned in light of his full identity then you watched him acting on that identity as God's ultimate Cosmic first born son and everybody's got questions
 Spiritual Beings seem to know exactly who he is and now he just brings a small circle of his closest followers and they get an apocalypse of his identity as the cosmic Sun glory of God. Man that clicked for me a while ago and it was actually as I was working in the Gospel of John for about the classroom class that we're going to be doing in the next year and a half or so on the Gospel of John and I realized that what Luke is trying to communicate about who Jesus is through hyperlinks and narrative patterning from the Hebrew Bible but the claim that Jesus is the human embodiment of the Divine Glory that took up residence in Israel Tabernacle in Temple that is exactly the same claim that John is making about Jesus in The Gospel but just
 more explicitly from beginning to end just conclude this part of the conversation but this is really significant at least to me that Luke is using narrative strategy to communicate something about the identity of Jesus but you have to know how he's communicating to pick up the signals and I think this is why when it comes to understanding Jesus is divine identity in the New Testament why John seems easier to see that that's what he's saying then in the other gospels but it's really just about the different narrative techniques these authors were using cuz they're all communicating the same thing about Jesus okra so let's let's look at John 1
 so John chapter one this big pivot because we've been in Luke and Mark has previously so John begins his account of Jesus with a poem a long poem that we call the prologue and let's see we made videos about this and had conversations in the podcast about this too yeah did we have a conversation the podcast about a prologue of John yeah so we won't read the whole thing here Jesus is introduced in the opening sentences as the human embodiment of God's word and will and purpose that is eternity with God
 and is God at the same time so that's a whole Mindbender to think about but he's called the word the word of God that does both with God that is somehow distinct from God but also one with God cuz he is God at the same time so if you care that forward that's the opening of The prologue you care that forward Down 2 verse 14 Jesus but before coming here means is called the word again and the famous line the word became flesh and he
 tabernacled set up a tent in the middle of us and we saw his glory the glory as the one and only from the father full of grace and truth
 so we'll just stop right there because this is loaded so that Divine word and will and purpose that is somehow in some way distinct from God but also is God
 that became a human
 and then when John wants to describe what it meant for them to become human he uses the language of God's glorious fiery presents that took up residence in Israel's Tabernacle right and this is the same presents we just saw it during Luke's account of this that will be call the Transfiguration and that night and that you just showed us it's connected Jesus being the is in the slot of God's fiery presents that Moses and Elijah experienced on the mountain are they not there now experiencing it and it's revealed that that's Jesus Genesis God's glorious presence here is John just saying in another way like Jesus here is like God's presence in the Tabernacle is frieza's here with us in Flash not just like he is that at least I think it's worded it in the way he takes the sting
 I think that's what he wants us to hear like he is that that Divine glory and word in purpose took up
 physical form Among Us and when we looked at that human what we saw was the tabernacle fiery glory of God and then he gives the line clarify he said the glory as of the one and only from the father and so this is the first he doesn't use the word son here but by saying that this glory is from the father he's implying the son father relationship here and on the translation that you're reading that you switched the gotten from the father and we talked about that word begotten yeah cuz it came up and saw them too is that right yes it uses the birth language of today I have begotten you yeah today I have birthed you
 heard you okay so what I have a sense if that's not what's going on here correct with the translation discrepancy cuz it's helpful to do that's the new American Standard says the glory of the only be gotten from the father be gotten being an older English word for born see and then at least among modern translations oh yeah and then that comes from the King James all the way back to the year 1611 the first edition of the King James where the King James adopted that translation from was from the Wickliffe Bible one of the earliest English translations from the mid-1500s and that was one of the first uses of distinguish raise the begotten one if you look at all of the other modern translations they Translate
 the phrase will talk to the word that we'll talk about that's just the one and only or the only son or not the one and only so here's a little nerdy Deep dive on what's going on here the Greek word underneath this is the word mono Guinness and it's actually it's a compound Greek word yeah I think I can guess it Mono-Mono you know it's one we have lots of single version yep single yep and then Dennis actually is what's underneath our word genius which is the Latin word category so the one and only of that category early on the word could possibly or has been taken from another Greek root Donato which means to be born but the only born
 and so sejanus might have its origins in the word born yeah it doesn't do it. But it would be spelled slightly different as I understand okay the Greek etymology of the word the word would actually look different if it was from born okay so it has a different history and it means catego category as means the only one of it whatever category were talking about and when was you use this word like describing what like what other thing would be the only of its kind so the words used nine times in the New Testament three times by Luke to describe the only son of a widow okay the only daughter of a guy named Iris and the only child of a guy who was demon-possessed the other five
 time city was once in Hebrews oh to apply to Isaac because this is what Isaac is called in the opening of Genesis 22 Abraham take your one and only son and is that how the Septuagint translated it then and the Greek translators of the Hebrew Bible translated it with the word mono kinase and then the word appears five times in the writings of John and that's the main usage of the word in the New Testament outside the New Testament it's used to refer to all kinds of things one actually is Post New Testament to Christian author named first Clement and he weaves this hole parable about the Phoenix the mythical bird the Phoenix that can rise from its ashes and he calls the Phoenix a one and only Amano kinase kind of bird is the only one of its kind
 so the word mono Guinness doesn't mean only child it means the only one in that category is often used of the only child because that's the word you can't mean that that's right I see but like Isaac wasn't an only child that he was the only yeah I allowed to receive the blessing he was the only son of Sarah but he wasn't at Abraham's only son yep that's right so where the King James and the Tyndale got this translation from was not from Hebrew and not from Greek they got it from the Latin Vulgate translated under the supervision of Jerome scholar in the mid 300 who translated mono kinase with meaning the only born who know if you need anything just because the word isn't about birth rights
 emphasis is about unique identity right and so when you take that into the equation with John is saying is that Jesus is the embodiment of that Divine Glory that took up residence in the Tabernacle and that glory is divine like that's y'all always Glory however in this is what the gods series was in the podcast years ago we made our God video all about this is that the Hebrew Bible actually has a really nuanced portrait of God's identity the God is God and that there is one God like in the butt that also when God Appears were contacts creation he does so in ways the reveal part of God's self
 and that God has the second self as it we're through whom he connects to the world and that one is not created it is God but it's also somehow a distinction within God's Own identity so God's wisdom God's word God's glory are always the Hebrew Bible talked about that and what the gospel authors vaginas you're saying is the guy we met and Jesus is that he's the one who is God and is distinct from God he's got the glory he's God's wisdom is God's word become human and he's the one and only from the father
 that's what he's trying to communicate this is the foundation bad of Christian Orthodoxy through the centuries this is what really Christian Bishops were like debating about fiercely in the early century is just trying to hammer out what does it mean does it talk about God as one and yet having a plurality within that one that's at the same time yeah I think we could try to make even more sense of that but that's the god series that totally you know but now that was there the identity of Jesus as God but also separate from God and that whole thing for distinct come to try and use distinct is the one English word I can find the doesn't drive a division or separation was in God's identity interesting is God and as distinct from God at the same time anyway
 they'll connect that back to the theme of the firstborn yeah well this all goes back to Jesus his own primary way of referring to God which has to call God my father father or our father and calling himself the son so the son father language was the primary language Jesus use to describe who he was and who he was in relationship to his father and that's why it's passed on and all the writings of the Apostles is because this is Jesus's on language for this and the apostles as they meditated on their Encounter With Jesus in light of their meditation on the Hebrew scriptures
 also started use other categories of Jesus is God's word and God's glory and we can see that reflected in what we've looked at today but Jesus is Way primary way of trying to communicate all this is describing himself as the son and of the father and the anat revelation of God's identity is the one God so does it all come together this way maybe try to let me try to verbalize something so as we trace the theme of the firstborn what we see is that God has created humanity and all its uniqueness but not as Humanity there's the animals There's A Spiritual Beings with all these creatures and God has created and given Dominion for all these creatures and it just kind of generosity is poured out on all of us and then there's a thing that's happening constantly in the Bible which is like one creature going wait a second
 am I getting my fair share like maybe I'm maybe I can't trust God may be why isn't God show favor on me like I see him showing favor on this other person and so this is the theme of the firstborn for us which is like why is God paying attention to someone who seems lesser than me that doesn't seem right I'm more powerful got you work for me why I see bypassing me can I trust that I will also be exalted and so that theme of try to connect Jesus to y'all because so in response to that what we're seeing is that every generation of God's Partners were potential Partners keeps getting hung up on this just like this is the thing that keeps sending them off the tracks to make stupid decisions and hurt themselves and other people
 so the question is how is that fundamental conflict going to get resolved when are we going to come across a partner human partner that will so trust God is generous abundance but they won't let even the slightest hint of doubt that I can send them off of the tracks right that's not what we're after here I think so but I think also what I'm sensing is that while we're trying to figure out whose first deserve the blessing you know if I'm a spiritual being, I guess it should be us and should be me like everyone's posturing it's almost like the curtains pulled back and we're like hey that's the guy yeah yes Jesus he's the one if you're all wondering like who's first who has the most like it's it stop squabbling it's Jesus and he's the one and only from the father he
 the glory and it just so happens he's going to be the one that's going to come down and show you guys and help you guys through that mess of your own making of not being able to come to terms with my generosity what it's like to be a son at ozen one who doesn't let it go to his head and he models would it looks like to trust God's generosity even when it looks like he's not coming through for you so he he models but then yeah he is not just a model he actually is finally the human who will be that trusting human partner to do it on the half of the money so that they can actually finally get the blessing that they keep forfeiting through their lack of trust wow so profound why do I feel like you said three things I think they're all really important like he is the firstborn he is God's glory
 so does that kind of idea we're all trying to figure out who's more important it's like it's him then he's the model for how how to use that power because we let you know we aren't the first Board of creation but like we are the image of God and we are supposed to be able to use God's power to rule and so they become a model that's the second thing ever to say and then thirdly he shows us what was the third thing you said well he showed us by showing us he's the model but then he doesn't just like show us like okay so here's how you do it so now you guys do it but he doesn't he just doesn't he just he just is the human partner he is the firstborn that's right he does and then he becomes human yeah that's the third thing is like not only is he the like the one and only from the beginning the word of God has created for the beginning all that and not only can he now be a model he's going to become human which is
 the twist of all twist yeah I got to do for them what the Human family hasn't been able to do for himself and then what we saw and Luke was he starts folding in all of these people into the generosity of the father and giving and sharing with them the power in the life that he enjoys as the one and only first born
and so this is how John Loops at all in this great place to land the plane is in Jesus's prayer in John chapter 17 and he's praying first and foremost for this circle of his followers and then he starts praying for all of these people who will get brought into the family of God through them telling the story about him and so he prays this prayer needs his father is in verse 24 father I desire that they these ones that you have given to me that they would be with me where I am so that they can see my glory
 we're Glory again the glory you gave me because you loved me before the foundation of the world
 the for eternity we've had this Divine love Bond
 as God the father and the son together and I want others to see and participate in that he says oh righteous father the world that they don't know you yet but I know you and now these that you sent me to these these now
 I have made your name known to them and I will make it known so that the love with which You Loved Me Maybe in them and I will be in them
 both cryptic and poetic what he saying is you and I have this one that's where one and we've been having the lovefest fraternity as and me as your beloved Son but what I know is that you love them too and you actually loved the world John 3:16 for God loved the whole Cosmos so here I am I shared with them the love that you have for me and I want that love to be in them and I will be in them and what he'd said if you sense his ago is that I am in them and you are in me
 so if you and I have the Love Fest and I have the left us with them then that means they are in me and I am in you which means this is all about the father and the son in folding all of creation into the eternal love Fest but that requires if they're going to anybody Ventures that loves fast needs to trust that God actually wants to be eternally generous to them in the first place which kind of wraps it back into our first Bond theme did I take it I think I'm trying to bring synthesist all of this I don't know if I'm making this clear as mud or making a clear well I mean you added a new element which is about Unity with God
 communion with God that now I feel like it's opening new mysterious ideas that but it ties into this not trust in God's generosity thing of Jesus so transparent single of this unique relationship with God is that he is the one and only who has from eternity past present future experiences the love of other day for love and that experience allows maybe not allow his butt like is
 what he's pointing out here of being like I can do this by experience the love and they I can now bring them in to this communion through me
 because now I am not only and it's this weird this is crazy like not only is Jesus God but he is human and so now he's like the bridge for Humanity to be connected to God yeah commune with God is our brother to become Sons and Daughters of God yeah. We're always in the biblical story right yes but like it's like 10:00 though he doesn't feel like God's beloved Son when God chose the favor to his brother and what God says it's not like exaltation is all yours that just might happen in the time in a way that's going to test your character but their Adam and Eve communion with God was eating of the tree of life and being with God and so
 here now it's like re access is like now Tree of Life is Jesus and connecting to Jesus and that's now a re-entry to that communion of Love okay yeah but the son the child parent son's father how one realizes one's identity as the Beloved son or daughter of the father is by latching on to the cosmic firstborn who is inviting us in and that happens to an act of trust which is the key word in the Gospel of John belief trust really profound really profound
 okay so deeply personal cuz it really this is the question that I woke up with this morning and probably all of us If we're honest is locked in my safe in my welcome in the world do I belong
 is everything going to be okay and inhabiting the story is choosing to believe
 as I begin each day I am the the one and only beloved daughter and the one and only beloved Son because God's one and only son has reached out and folded us into his love
 which is in the audacious astounding claim to make and that it seems to me is exactly what Jesus and the apostles were we're trying to share with the world
 okay do we have one more stop I thought you know the Apostle Paul John and his letters and whoever wrote the letter to the Hebrews is so tracking with all this and so we're going to be storms in the New Testament letters to end our conversation with another employee out there and I haven't stood in front of mind going there yourself and Jeremy think about what you do here, things sometimes my new details certain things we've been working on recently I've been working on lots of lots of little projects that come through and then way to simplify the website to to make it a lot more usable lot more user-friendly a little bit more beautiful and he just wanted to be an easy experience for people to come find what they need if they don't know what they're looking for we can help them that stuff show me
 what about your life outside work had three kids 1310 and to gather ten years in between the oldest and the youngest it was funny to kind of go way back into like having a little kid running around again cuz we got out of that stage and then then we're back in that stage and it was super fun to experience that again and have older kids that can kind of help out and and all of that so they're great kids super fun we live in Colorado so in the winter like taking up skiing I'm sure growing up in Colorado if it's so nice media other thing to mention is that the reason why you're in town is that you have a photography exhibit
 Scott take photos I like to take a lot of photos of landscape stuff you know I just go outside and just see what the lights doing and it said there's a few of us from the Bible project that for we got into a local show here I'll go to Portland so we're going to go and shower stuff and talk about it and see what happens to my podcast team including producer Cooper pelts and Associate producer Lyndsay Ponder our lead editor is Dan gummo
