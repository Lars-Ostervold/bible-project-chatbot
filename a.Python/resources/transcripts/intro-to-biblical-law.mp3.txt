hey this is John and this is Tim and we are re-releasing the top five podcasts that we've ever had on this on this podcast we've actually never taken a break before we are at episode well we're over 250 episodes then I guess it's amazing but it's been wonderful credible so this summer we are giving us a little bit of a break and also giving you an opportunity to revisit some podcasts that maybe you haven't ever heard before because they're reaching back far into our back catalogue like this one today is on understanding the law part 1 it's actually the very first episode that we ever release episode 1 and we happen to be working on the video on the law recording our conversations all the way back in 2015 do remember the first one that we did do you remember sitting down and doing it did record it sitting under the stairs of the basement office wear
 started yeah that's where we started yeah that room was Tiny and so hot as loud so being read mix the remastered yeah I mean I did these in my spare time and we did not have a recording studio so they're a little rough around the edges and they're going to be a little nicer to listen to so remastered Revisited let's listen to understanding the law episode 1 how this whole thing got started
 it is the first episode of The Bible project podcast my name is Joan Collins and today I'm going to be talking with dr. Timothy Mackey PhD the co-creator of my project with me we recently put a video out on the law and there was a ton of stuff we had to cut out of the video If to do this and every video and so this is a conversation to fill out all the things that we left out but also to go deeper into the things that we do brought up in the video but couldn't dig deeply into in this first episode we're going to talk about what are these laws how did ancient Israel get them what was the purpose of these laws in the second episode we're going to look at how the Old Testament prophets thought about the law and the need for a new Hearts to obey the law and then we're also going to look at Jesus and how he jumps in the conversation and turns things on its head
 this is been amazing for me to listen to and discuss and I'm glad you guys are joining the conversation you can follow us on Twitter at join Bible project facebook.com join the Bible project we'd love to hear from you all right here we go
so I can start from the beginning and first of all when we when you say or when I say blah I what am I even referring to their what's right so a lot in the Old Testament Allah is a command that God gave to the people of ancient Israel that's what the laws are in the Old Testament and there's a lot of them but they're all concentrated in one set of books in the Old Testament that are within the first five books called the Torah
 which is translated into English as law and we talked about in the video how that that translation is is a bit confusing white why did we translate it into law the English rendering law of the Hebrew word Torah comes to us through about two hundred years before Jesus there was a community large Jewish communities living in Alexandria Egypt where was the center of Greek learning and language and and that's where the first translation of the Bible was ever made into Greek is the Septuagint call the step to it and the
 the translation of the word Torah into Greek was the Greek word anonymous slaw so that's just kind of passed into Greek and then Latin and English throughout the years and why did they choose yeah that's that's a great question. Moss was just one of the standard Greek words for principles of a Greek scholar the historical origins of Greek, but they must have looked at that section of scripture and was like hey there's a lot of law out here is the appropriate word to talk about a command Interstate Torah isn't the only Hebrew word for La there's about five different words
 that bring out different nuances just like an English we have law command regulation this is what I was wondering sorry. I'm not sorry in Hebrew in Hebrew when I use the word Torah does that mean command lot or did that just refer to the first five books it's just what they call that what the etymology of the word Torah comes from a verb yatta which means to teacher instruct okay and then the word Torah is a teaching or instruction or principle of guidance so what the word Torah mean so even in Hebrew the idea is Deezer books of teachings of guidance of the Hebrew Bible itself that word is sometimes used to talk about
 the commands were the laws or regulations that you find in the pin those first five books of the Bible song when I you know a lot of times David will say I love you a lot and I love the tour I love the Torah and he's referring to those five bucks but is he referring to the books was referring to this idea that God gives us commands without question I answer that question I get a million dollars I wish a lot of money in them choose the right here yeah that's the $0.10 question I guess you can refer to the body of teaching and instruction that God has given but in the history of Israel that body of teaching instruction began Mount Sinai and so Torah became the way to refer to
 the first five books of the Bible because there were so many
 laws in it but part of what we're doing the video is saying that's misleading confusing because it leads you to think that those first five books of the Bible are Allah book or a lock code for a purpose is to teach you to obey the laws but the laws actually don't appear until your 69 in chapters into the Torah
 which if it is the Torah is a log book that you're supposed to read and then obey the law that a big practice very strange 11 and there's some with in Jewish tradition there's actually a lot of debate about this where does the Torah actually begin does it begin once the first commands are being given in which case I'll be the commands about Passover in The Exodus story or does that begin as a narrative in which case the purpose of the tortoise something different but yeah so far the Torah is the way it presents itself to us is a story and the story has a moment in it where laws are given to the people of ancient Israel but those are framed and a narrative framework and you approach the story is it a different way than you do a bob
 read them with different kinds of expectation I don't read a lot of lava yeah I've never so I don't even really know if I would go to be like red one the Constitution so that a law dictionary you know like read dictionary you know someone who doesn't
 I had a friend yes I know a friend right now reads five dictionary entry is a day of words to learn new words to but not to fall asleep not to fail to learn words made that up is a imaginary scenario but they read they read a dictionary they've just going through the dictionary would be a good example of the type if it was a law book entries and shoes any entry and you can say okay this is and it would probably be alphabetized in some way or arranged in a way that was easy to find yeah yeah I have a few friends that are lawyers I went the ones office once was looking at his reference books it's all online now but
 yeah it was a the set is reference series of case laws on the potato and it's arranged by topics and it's summaries of the cases and then the law statutes that were established by that case and it's all arranged with indexes and you can look up topics and stuff in the Torah that's in the Bible is definitely not that so the question then is did did ancient Israel have that was there ever a document that they had was just hears the whole Constitution here's the whole list of laws that you have to follow us and is relaxed right yeah that is the question and I think we have yes it's a safe assumption
 to say yes it's real had some kind of religious / political legal Constitution that governed their life as a people and that what we have in the first
 in the Torah first five books of the Bible is a selection from that Constitution so in that we're trying to clarify is people identify the Old Testament or the book the first five books of the Bible with Israel's Constitution that they lived by and basically I think the reason we conclude it's just cuz there's so many I mean the official number in Jewish tradition as a scholar named maimonides gave the official report of 613 laws between Exodus 90 why does he get credit for that I mean that doesn't sound very well there's a repetition okay we're in one lot don't cook a baby goat in its mother's milk
 repeated three times okay so some loud the Tabernacle instructions I feel like there's a lot of repetition of laws it's a very odd lava cuz there's a lot there so there's debate exactly about how many of there are you count repetitions and so on this in my mind at ease gave the official report of rabbinic Judaism 613 6th and so that's one of the reasons why we're confident that this isn't the law book that they had because why would you have a log book that repeats laws yeah why would you have a log book that begins with 69 chapters of story the first 11 chapter easy in easy and of those lost the first eleven chapters of the story I have nothing to do with this real there about the nation's and what's not
 the why are the laws broken up into all of these chunks and sections and drops right into a flowing narrative why are some of the most basic laws that you would think should be there aren't in the laws like what like the 613 laws there's only two about divorce any guidance for divorce what's the weather there's laws about marriage but there's only two laws about divorce which is one of the most
 basic human institutions of dealing with marriage and divorce there's two and even those two are not very clear and they assume a whole bunch of other laws about divorce and remarriage underneath them that's are not in the Torah so there's a lot of laws like that if you actually wanted to run the temple sacrifice system just based off the information in Leviticus you don't have enough to nowhere near so how would how would we rebuild the Temple than and and and reinstate a new sacrificial system so that
 there is a body of literature around the Torah that clarifies all those gaps that feels it in the gives and those are the traditional Jewish documents called the mission which are at their heart commentaries on the 613 laws in the Torah and then expanding and developing and adding new laws to clarify fill in the gaps to make it a comprehensive lock code that if people can actually live by so so if you need some more guidance on divorce you go to the mission yet and it's it's right so in the video we talked about how these laws are interspersed in the narrative and that you think there's a design
 2 how that's done is that where did you learn that the first teacher two teachers that I had one in college professor named Ray Lubeck toggle Testament at Multnomah University in Portland and then the second was a Hebrew Bible scholar named John sailhamer who taught at a lot of different schools but he taught in Portland for a few years at Western Seminary foundational reading on
 the pentateuch read the Torah as a book that sell Hammer wrote called the pentateuch as narrative and space it's a commentary on the first five books of the Bible but it's a commentary that's trying to explore the Torah as a narrative in the basic thesis is that the Torah is not a book of law but it's a book telling a story about the laws given to Israel and that the point isn't that you read this book and think I do I need to go to obey these laws it's to get a message from the author actually about
 my in capability of truly obeying God's law and now I need God to transform my heart to make me into a person that can truly love and serve him was pretty different message pretty different ways of different ways of viewing the message of the Torah one is obey the laws
 viewing as a story that's trying to tell you something about the laws in about human nature it's pretty different the sale hammered teach about
 they saw the video we talked about you no laws were given the Converse at Saint Sinai the first 10 I mean to slavery in Egypt they go to the foot of Mount Sinai God says you're going to be a kingdom of priests you're going to be my unique people set apart to show who I am to the nation's that's what priests do and so then come the Ten Commandments then comes the first chunk of law after that called The Book of the Covenant of the Covenant code it's Exodus 2023 and the first two commands don't have any other gods don't make idols
 don't matter all that and then the Covenant code is flashing all that out for Israel you know Iron Age farming communities but it's flashing out with those The Ten Commandments look like in about 50 more commands and then there's a narrative the Lost come to a close and then the first narrative after the giving of the laws is about Israel breaking the first two laws of the Ten Commandments worshipping the golden calf
 and tell him his point is start if you pay attention to the storyline of the Torah you'll see a pattern of laws of Israel rebelling or disobeying or breaking the laws then comes another big block of laws given his from Mount Sinai then another story a some failure or sign of failure more lost failure more laws you can follow it right through all the way
 I'm through the Book of Numbers is which is not most people's favorite book of the Bible that a cuz there's not just laws there's no sense Big Blocks of Senses I mean it's hard stuff to get through for most modern readers but numbers you can just see it will be that is real rebelles it says it's the same Principle as the
 you know why why is there a sign in front of this business building that says no loitering
 certain point somebody came along and loitered for way too long and distracted customers and so we should do something about that put up a sign right or or like why do I have a son I don't have one of these but why would have a have a sign that says no soliciting it's because the third or fourth time you got interrupted when you were reading dinner and you're not going to put a sign up yeah they come to your door at the worst times and they want signatures for this for that More Lies come as a result of some violation or some Rebellion or something wrong and that basic principle is what you see throughout the design of of the pentateuch there's that there is stories of Moses going back in like yeah Castleton with God and getting more laws and their their weight
 her three days don't touch the mountains and God's presence is going to come down and then the people that were called us and the mountain that they don't when God's present comes down cuz he's scared samosas goes up instead and then he receives the Ten Commandments and the first block of laws when it comes down golden calf debacle the golden calf incident and then he goes back up and intercedes for Israel and God renews the Covenant and then you get a little quick summary in Chapter 30 exit 34 of the Covenant code from 20 to 23 and then Israel's at Mount Sinai for a year receiving blocks of laws as the Tabernacles being built in as the priesthood is being
 you know instituted and so on but then once they set out into the Wilderness there's
 a story of rebellion the one of these plagues comes as a result of his real rebelling and so some people die and then you get a block of laws numbers 15 about dealing with impurity and corpses and dead bodies make sense so like the need arose for more clarity about what to do with dead bodies and so they get laws about it but with so is the idea there that they ran there's like all these dead bodies and Moses is like okay let's go consult with God and he get more laws or is the idea they had these laws but this is as limp as a way to teach we are and we're going to place the laws at this point in there. Yeah we don't know we just know this is how the pentateuch is designed as a story where some people died then the next chapter is somewhat out of my mind was it just gets the whole he gets the whole Constitution and I was wondering how he got it all onto tablets
 so there's two things relevant just to give a complete answer at the end of numbers there are some people who come to Moses and say hey the existing laws we have about how to observe Passover or what to do with like the inheritance of the land like we have some questions and there's no law for it so Moses goes and inquires of the Lord and then come back with
 more lot and in the book of Deuteronomy is for the new generation the children of the Exodus generation whose parents died in the wilderness and then Deuteronomy the core of the book chapters 12 226 is a whole hundreds of laws and some of them repeat laws from the earlier sections and then a whole bunch of them are brand new and so that's Moses in a new location. Mount Sinai unpacking more laws for the Next Generation so if that's the last come in stages throughout the wall the story of Moses anyway that's that's how it goes in the storyline
 the Torah is called the law in English it even means that in Hebrew and with Moses giving the speech and what his things Moses says is hey guys you are not capable of following all these lies yeah yeah he said both from experience he spent 40 years with this group of people so he knows that they have not been able or faithful to follow the laws and he predicts the thoughts just got to keep on happening yeah but that's that is real is going to fail at being Covenant partners with God and obeying obeying the laws and so what's important is right as the tour is coming to an end
 he says you guys signed up to obey all these laws and you signed up to the consequences of it which is blessing God's blessing and things going good if you are a nation of Justice Noble curse and Devastation in Exile if you don't and we do point this out and not this video in a different video the Deuteronomy video I was thinking about how the human condition will come out November of 20 Brian yeah is to parallel the story of Israel receiving these commands and not obeying them the design of the pentateuch parallels is real with Adam and Eve in the garden receiving a command and also breaking it and going into Exile and installing so part of the design of the Torah
 is that Israel becomes a case study in human nature in general that we seem to not want to do what we're told to do we like people telling us what to do
 so when you come to read the Bible you're a regular guy you decide I'm going to read through the Bible
 and you get going as 69 chapters of narrative it's it's kind of weird stuff it's in its ancient literature it's hard but you're getting through it and then I'll send you get into the guts of the Torah and it's a bunch of really just lists of laws that's really obscure and weird some stuff makes sense and most people. They can't get through it and so
 that's always a problem with the law yeah but then the other problem which is connected to it is as you're reading them I think the question you start asking yourself is well why is this been preserved for me read why doesn't my in the Holy you know that the holy book of my my tradition am I supposed to follow these laws it maybe maybe just some of them because the Ten Commandments are actually pretty legit you know like we kind of Stand by those but then there's other ones like boiling a go and its mother's milk or ways the grooming things are different things you like that we don't I'm not going to do that yeah so what what is a there for ya should I do about them if I believe the Bible in some form to be a Divine and human book or God's word yeah what should I do with these laws why are they here
 so I've have a handy dandy list of sale hammers for uses I have a handy dandy list of sale a four rolls of the laws in the pentateuch it's a great list it's in his it's in his little book The pentateuch is narrative so so first of all the laws are not given to all Humanity they're not given to all of the nation's they're given to the people of ancient Israel as a part of the Covenant God made with them so you have to ask yourself first why are these here they play a role in the storyline of the Torah which is that God wants to bring his Blessing to all the nations and he's going to do that through people
 somehow we'll live by these laws in their own context in this case is real and embody a new vision of justice and community business and family and marriage that sets them apart from the nation's so Moses and Deuteronomy 4 says if Israel obeys the laws it shows they're God's wisdom and God's righteousness to the Nations and so I think what you can say the authors included all of these laws to give us a not a comprehensive but a full vision of what life for Israel was like according to these laws but they are a sample
 this is why it's a large sample pack a large sample but it's a sample of the actual Constitution so that's number one that's number one number one is these were written specifically for ancient Israel they were written to show me the reader of the Torah what life was like under the Covenant at Sinai and to show how God's laws were to affect all areas of their life individual and corporate Lee and then to those laws were to shape Israel so that other nations like me to email three thousand years later look in and when I read those laws and their ancient contacts and I can see oh wow those are principles of wisdom and Justice in the God was pushing his role towards do you think even now as a modern American you can look at those ancient law codes and see the wisdom of God
 yes totally I think there's there's precedent for that within the within the Bible itself Moses said the Nations will look in that the laws just for the nation's back then who were slaughtering their children and stuff to see that these laws didn't drop out of heaven for all people of all time they were for Israel at that time in their history when you compare the laws in the pentateuch to laws on the same Topics in in Babylonian the Code of Hammurabi Assyrian laws I mean it's really a step forward you see the wisdom of God only in comparison to Modern Western Law seemed bizarre to you but when you compare them to other cultures that share the same worldviews and menu
 same cultural practices you can see women and servants had a much better life in ancient Israel than they did in ancient Babylon Bradley due to the laws in the Torah what I hear you saying is one of the purposes of the law in the Bible
 is so that us people of other nations who can read it and see the wisdom of God thought I'd noticed but we don't have the context we of what life was like around that time maybe we can kind of read between the lines a bit mean if I only read the Bible only read the Bible if we didn't have a Code of Hammurabi if we didn't have we didn't have modern what's it called when you dig stuff up right around then I wouldn't be able to see is clearly the wisdom of God and so is that a design flaw in the Bible that's more question about the nature of the Bible if the Bible is something like devine-gold
 tablets Dropped Out of Heaven the tell humans what to do so that they can go to heaven after they die then boy the Bible just has a really poor job being that kind of document was written in the ancient Hebrew I mean how are you even supposed to know what any of these words mean if you don't learn an ancient language right I think the fact that God hears the Bible itself is the product of God working with speaking to and working out his purposes in human history and the the Bible is the wedding of God's word written and expressed through humans who lived at certain times and places in history and so are modern kind of Western ideal is a quality right at the democratic ideal and so we think will if God was going
 ever reveal himself to All Humans English where everybody headset headset is it automatically translate and it's just hearing everything automatically in their own language but that's what we think all of a sudden idea that God would start revealing himself at a point in history through a people and working itself out in this case is real and and and reveal what does Israelites were huge steps forward and justice but now we look back and it seems archaic to us and so that's that's just a fact that God has chosen to work with in history revealing self and he's got to reckon with that or else nothing in the Bible's going to make a lot of sense to you I think sure so so what are the purposes of the
 is to are these our principles first principle is
 this was these were law specifically for ancient Israel the second principle is they show other nations the wisdom of God and that's where I got hung up because I don't see that is clearly as I would ya sure if I live in ancient life if I was in the ancient Babylon and I got these texts I might go I like this guy this guy seems wise but I read it as a Westerner and I think wait a second does he not know about you can actually see that in the history of interpretation of some of the laws are there meeting with lost this is history but then recovered so that the LIE Mission earlier about don't boil a baby goat in its mother's milk gets repeated the only repeated three times in the Torah and what so
 in Jewish tradition with that came to mean is somehow cooking something in the Life liquid of the same species that it came from just rolling through it cruel bad and that was discern just the principle underneath the law which is why in Jewish kosher law as far back as we can tell the separation of dairy and meat is law of laws cheeseburgers in the off-limits nevermind that's why that's why because of that lot putting Dairy on to meet ya and principle is boiling a go and its mother's milk what's this life for why is it there three times God doesn't want us mixing a source of life with something
 is Dad of the same kind so don't mix milk and meat so kosher restaurants have a veggie side where there's Dairy and then the meat side where there's no Dairy and you use different place different place oh yeah different dishwash all that kind of think so is that late eighteen hundreds are in archaeology and israel-palestine you know in full swing and
 there was a full excavation done in the ancient Canaanite City dating to about the same time as Joshua called Garrett and it's you know they discovered a library their huge library and it was the first thing like it biggest library of Israel's neighbors ever found there's a Temple there so but it was in the library are all kinds of text that reads like Leviticus there like Priestley Tech manuals for guidelines for the priests to do and 41 there's a ritual that mentioned boiling animals in the milk of their mother's so we'll practice involved in the worship of Canaanite god and one of the purpose of the laws was this that is real apart from the nation's so that's an example of where the meaning of Allah was lost to history
 then we found we found and that's why did nothing to do with cheeseburgers well then that's the debate the band so you have to say wow that's interesting then is it possible that we have this whole modern will not modern like a whole practice within kosher law that actually wasn't craps what the law was originally intended to communicate and I think that's probably what happened so there's lots of things like that where there's something in the Bible the word or phrase the law and its meaning was lost to history once the historical circumstances past and that that's why biblical scholarship is so awesome we can learn are like we actually are still learning about the Bible is all kinds of things that are coming to light in light of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other stuff that's that's a bit scandalous
 you know you come with this perspective of
 the Bible is everything I need for life and godliness got to give us is complete is complete library of literature but you know for 2,000 years after Jesus and we're still discovering how to read this thing correctly that you can respond to that in a number of ways you can anybody narrative is so woven into the human brain and psyche you can read the pentateuch if you're looking at it as a narrative and get the basic get the idea of the story line even if you are clueless about what half of these laws meant in their context you can get the it's real given under these laws they don't obey them they're giving more lies and More Lies like you get it and then Moses says at the end you don't obey them your hearts are hard you need God to change your heart like a you don't need to be a Biblical scholar
 no no I thought you figured that out you do need to learn how to read stories that are written differently than modern western novels but I think a reader who's willing to put in the work can get totally get with the message of the story is so at that level which is a really important level that the barrier to entry is very small yeah but then but then they would well goes deep and we're still uncovering it's like these facets of of these that we have until we dig something out of the ground we just didn't know until you dig stuff up and that goes back to what the nature of the Bible is that God has
 revealed himself with in history which means that God has communicated in through people who live in cultures and speak languages and language unless there you go unless God's going to speak to us all in you and headphones but she clearly has chosen not to do you blew that opportunity that would have been awesome if I could just wake up and put on a set of headphones and and then God just tells me what's up that day Manny mangon so today you're going to be really tempted to be mad at your wife and your kids for these reasons just patience
 and also you can get tired around 2:30 I can recommend a walk and like cool and love your neighbor. Mike got it we you are not too many steps removed from the Theology of the spirit Holy Spirit in the New Testament I'm not joking yeah we made it off the spirit telling you to go for a walk part I'm just saying you can do it through you and headphones that would be be helpful isolates part of the problem I think the
 story of the Torres trying to point out though is that that we need you in headphones or laws the laws were good and they served their those purposes of setting is real pirate God's wisdom and justice but the laws were not adequate to completely guide and reshape the broken Human Condition to live in love and obedience to God that the humans need something more than just to be told what to do some help just telling people what to do
 it's not a long-term solution the reason we make decisions is tied into our affect like what we want and desire motivation not just because it's the right thing to do. Clearly if we all did things just because it's the right thing to do human history wouldn't look the way it is for the metaphor that Moses uses and then also the prophet pick up on our is a new heart what is Moses actually use circumcise your heart heart heart heart yeah so and you'll have to make us feel hammers third point about the role of the law is is that the laws in the context of the story show that Israel heart that there are Will and moral sensitivities we're actually so broken that they were incapable of obeying the laws so this is
 counterintuitive the 613 laws and even number if you read the story the story is trying to tell you is real didn't and can't obey the laws why are there so many laws in their wisdom of God that whole thing but also to show you that
 they didn't and they can't so you know there was that thing the Pokemon that's the guy who tried to live by all the laws oh yeah the day the day of the year he did it for years and living biblically that what it is
 yes if example AJ Jacobs the Year of Living biblically one man's humble quest to follow the Bible as literally as possible during interview with him and he like even stoned a woman do you like threw pebbles at her house cuz you commit adultery years of the little Pebbles and so that's a great example the Year of Living biblically sailhamer would say and I think he's right is missing the point of the Torah cuz it's saying 13 laws in the Bible the Bible's message to me is obey these laws so I guess I am going to follow the Bible on the way to the end sale hammers point would be no Torres a story and you follow a story by reading it to get its message and then responding to this message
 the service following the Bible if you read the Torah as the story would be to get on my knees and say dear God please change my heart so that I want to love my neighbor it love you but if I was a Jew let's say post Exile and I'm and I'm doing that very thing I read that story in a grown man and your heart I still might try to get a Sabbath and all things cuz I'm Into You tell right yes because that's right cuz they've they've they were the my culture that's my Heritage and as the tribe they still saw themselves in that Covenant so I guess the role is in the narrative the third thing would be in the narrative the laws are demonstrating this point is real did not and cannot keep the lock and then it points new solution in Civ by that designed the laws then 4th Leo
 pointing to the real problem explorer that in the video we at we show how the narrative continues after the Torah they go into the land they continue to break the laws just story after Story got the time of the judges those are pretty gnarly times yet then you got the time of the Kings yeah yeah the books of Samuel 1st and 2nd Samuel 1st and 2nd Kings and there's some good moments but the story of every significant figure is a story of some rise initial rise in a time of
 blessing and goodness in obedience and then a crucial failure to follow the laws and then a demise and that that story for all of the leaders is then playing out in the life cycle of the nation of Israel as a whole and then that that part of the story ends with Babylon taking them out yeah which is kind of what Moses predicts so Moses said what happened yet so that all plays out so so what Moses predicts in the Torah comes to be and so this leads the the reader to go okay I get it they weren't following they're incapable of falling the law threaten extended case study long is thank you in the Bible where is third of the way through the Bible and we just thoroughly scene over and over yet that The Human Condition
 is rumor really bad off like watching Breaking Bad or The Godfather Trilogy you just walk away feeling dirty but highly entertained but highly entertaining a few things about human nature yet
that's it for episode 1 in the next episode is us talking about the prophets talking about Jesus and Paul and New Testament Christians Jewish and non-jewish followers of Jesus wrestling through what do we do now with the laws you can watch the video we made on the life that youtube.com the Bible project we have a lot of other videos on there they're all free and we're really proud of them we hope you like them thanks for being a part of this with us this is Vanessa and I'm from the sunny island of Singapore this is Brandon and I'm from Oklahoma City Oklahoma to Rodger karwoski and I'm from Columbia Missouri cycle project for my social media feed it was a short animated video that made sense of Distinction text from the Bible I first heard about the Bible project through a suggestion on YouTube
 I use the Bible project for teaching Middle School at my church my favorite thing about the Bible project is the background information on Hebrew word meaning of widget for my own quiet time a space where I caught about and reflect on how I live my life and use the Bible project for personal growth study and teaching others about the Bible reading about Bible project is the relevancy of the message is given how do you connect teachings from the Bible to the world today and how we can learn to treat others and ourselves we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus were crowdfunded project by people like me find free videos study notes podcast classes and more at bible project.
