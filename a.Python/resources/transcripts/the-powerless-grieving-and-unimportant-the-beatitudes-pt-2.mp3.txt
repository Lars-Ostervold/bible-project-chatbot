this is Bible project podcast and we're reading through The Sermon on the Mount where the very beginning 9 statements about who was at the Centre of experiencing God's coming blessings with me is co-host Michelle Jones statements they work in three pairs of three three Triads today we're going to go over the first try at the good life belongs to those who are poor in spirit because there's is a kingdom of the Skies the good life belongs to those who mourn because they will be comforted and the good life belongs to meet because they will inherit the land that's the Triad now we're going to start with the poor in spirit is okay so I grew up with that phrase poor in spirit and how I thought it meant like to be downtrodden to be having a rough life to be depressed to be just kind of sad that's interesting I grew up thinking this phrase poor in spirit
 humble but you're thinking humble I'm thinking humiliated that's right. Tim is going to talk us through what this word means poor in spirit and we're going to find is it actually means less of what I thought in a little bit more of what use the okay being right. Right here's Tim and John talking about the poor in spirit thanks for joining us here we go
do we die then the good life belongs to the impoverished in spirits and Ivy poor in spirit because theirs is the kingdom of the sky's the sky's and honestly I don't know what I mean yeah so the Greek word jocose which means poor to talk about. Or breath to their Numa yeah which is in Hebrew in Hebrew so this is a great example of the Greek words but this is all about the Hebrew Bible where the words come from and what they mean Hebrew Bible conversation on the spirit of God in from years ago maybe 3 years ago even could that have been like hundreds of
 hundreds of hours okay so the Hebrew word refers it and it's a cent to Invisible energy yeah we can do that together or did you already go to have the I just remember feeling like energy weekend we were invisible energy and that can be impersonal energy wind or I can be the presence of someone's personal life energy which river goes spirit Spirit and that's the meaning when it's the ruach of God and often times are good quality or will use those two to talk about human life energy gets to talk about their ruwa but because it comes from God ultimately it can be called God I forgot the Breath of God so there's just one class example and jojos 12-10 her job says in God's hand is
 the nefesh the being of every creature and the ruler of all Humanity all of their life energy of all humanity is in God's hand comes from God know it's Humanity's ruoff in that it's the energy in the Vitality that we are animated with the rock is one of the standard ways you can talk about just a person's Vibe will make some go can become the basis for a particular kind of Hebrew phrases where you describe someone as X of spirit or X in their spirits to describe what is that Life Energy describe its Quality quality of life examples of 7-Eleven he says the distress of my roof
 song about suffering and later the word distress mean squeezed of my spirit so it's like his life Vitality is in a vise Netflix squeeze stressed Spirit dress has that same, squeezing mentality it does Genesis 2635 Isaac has a bitterness of spirit what is bitter about is that his son married to wives that he really doesn't like Ezekiel after he sees the crazy Throne Divine Throne of God will be able to tell him to go prophesy to this tree lights he's done he's super angry and he walks away bitter and hot of spirit he's ticked off yeah you bitter and angry energy going on and it just one last one because these are really helpful for understanding the phrase Jesus uses 15 for describe
 enough spirit that interesting broken Spirit that's like bottom of the well it feels like yeah you can't get back up there is your life Vitality broken broken your life support which doesn't necessarily mean affect your all the Myriad the proverb just so we can get a context for it Proverbs 15 for a soothing tongue is a tree of life but Distortion in the tongue makes one broken the spirit lies lies when you speak kind healing words to somebody has to tree of life brings abundance when you twist reality at the bring Zach rushing of the spirit is so interesting in the parallelism of the verse when you have a soothing tongue or a distorted time you have the tree of life and the opposite of the tree of life is being crushed in spirit crushed of spear
 yeah or broken of spirit yeah I'm just now going to fit Jesus thing into it he speaks of those who are impoverished of spirit impoverished what does that word mean o POR in English we have the poverty and impoverished not having resources lack a lack of resources when your life energy doesn't have fuel you lack of Vitality and you lack of ability what makes you get up and go yeah and you don't have the power to get up and go is depressed a good is raucous about this power or energy than what we're talking about is a lack of power so I guess if you're thinking on an individual psychological level of the Pressed that's what I'm thinking individual should I be thinking more corporate would observe
 I Think Jesus thinking more on a social level I think powerless without power you lacked the energy to do what needs to be done if we work is your energy inability to hear the crew and their Collective like ruach Numa is lacking in resources word pour as people without economic social stability and resources yeah and obviously practically they don't have a lot of money or resources or influence but metaphorically then their life energy is also yeah that's right correct so there's a couple commentaries are there in Matthew that are like 10 or perhaps twenty times the length of the actual book of matches the one of them was WD Davis
 and then another of historical Jesus collar Dale Allison it's a massive what's a three-volume the dude it's like no stone unturned you can find whole page is on just one or two words isn't this awesome what they know it is in history interpretation poor in spirit has been given what they called a religious meaning meaning those who lacks spiritual excitement or energy and spirit people who aren't spiritually or religiously influential are significant to it's called the religious meaning and then there's a hole straight down in history of interpretation of the Strays that they call the economic meaning which is the social economic meaning poor so it must be stressed that the religious meaning of poor does not exclude its economic meaning rather for Jesus to go together with probably the majority of Jesus is audience the religious state
 poverty was matched by an outward condition they suffered literal poverty and experienced firsthand economic inequities they knew the meaning of being needy because they were poured in spirit and port in fact they are literally without power in the religious structures of their day when Kai VISTA high priest makes a decision he doesn't like them do a poll what are the poor in Galloway think so the power the power list of spirit the power if the spirit is talking about one's energy or Vitality or power and poor means a lack of power last so you think a good translation could be the good life belongs to the powerless that would be an interpretive an interpretive translate the meaning of the eyes of spirit
 but I think our list is a good interpretation of the spirit is lost to me if you just say powerless that's because the word Spirit has been connected to the word power power less I less of Power Board of spirit lacking in power what is the word Spirit mean there are some people who are poor in the spiritual realm or in the world of spiritual thing and that's what I'm saying it actually doesn't mean the spirit is using it is about my life energy of My Life Energy my ability to get up and do things in the world yeah and this is a group of people who are impoverished their impoverished and their ability to get things done and in the world structure and having fluids and that becomes even more probable that Jesus is there a ring and I'm not invited the next to what's great about that Translate
 mission is it what's better within the translation since we're doing a bit of a interpretation is it really helps you feel that counterintuitive tension yes the good life belongs to the powerless blessed are the poor in spirit that's just kind of got to go find out it's like I think I get it I'm going to be this
 I don't know how I got like I said I didn't actually know what I meant but even you have that little reflex of like I need to be or I want to be all right I don't get that one yeah this is not a state that you would wish upon somebody but Jesus is saying the people who find themselves in the state are in fact the privileged ones because they are in a position to receive the kingdom of the Skies the reign of God as long as there will be other people like Zacchaeus or Nicodemus who will enter the kingdom and they would not be counted among powerless but there is something about being in a powerless position in a society
 that makes that person more easily grasp and understand the upside down value system of the reign of God I think that's what Jesus is now sitting here
 he's looking out at Farmers fisherman Traders Merchants Beggars sex-workers life belongs to you cuz here I am offering you first the reign of the Skies
the good life is for the powerless that's interesting because when you think about it those who don't have power in their hands or or don't grasp at it they're actually able to see the king and her hands are open and ready to take hold of it we live in a world where the good life is for the movers and shakers and Jesus is saying but good life is for the empty-handed because theirs is the kingdom statement follows if you don't have a lot of inner resources if your life is on the margins likely you're experiencing a lot of loss and death and grief will Jesus says surprisingly the good life is also for those who grieve here's Tim and John
 The Good Life belongs to those who grieve for they will be comforted grief and comfort they've mean in English pretty close map on pretty closely to what they mean in the bible grief is associated with death primarily death and loss these words to mourn or degrees but I think they do an English to do you think so yep and then the phrase Comfort is particularly paired with grief over loss and death so for example
 this is in the Book of Genesis in the story of when Joseph gets sold into slavery and his brothers his coat and dip it in the animal blood and so when Jacob sees the coat with blood this is Genesis 37 Jacobs Justice dad Jacob tore his clothes he put on sackcloth so here these are cultural practices of grieving a grieving over the dad and he grieved for his son many days is sons and daughters came to comfort him but he refused to be comforted saying now so I can put in front of you slew passages where these words for grief and then words of comfort are paired and not that that's the pair that Jesus is drawing on here so
 The Good Life belongs to people who experience life in a constant state of grieving because they're experiencing death and loss and to be comforted then means to what actually it's these the second line of all the Beatitudes are typically going to be oriented towards the future or present overturning of the age the arrival of God's Kingdom so here is standing on the shoulders of the Israelite prophets Isaiah 40 Comfort Comfort my people Exile is over the New Jerusalem is on its way that will be a comfort for those who grieve and mourn the state and what you don't need to grieve any more yeah your your time of grieving will be over because restoration a job job is in a state of grieving but by the end his fortunes the circumstances are all reversed
 and restored nuts at the discomfort to find Comfort after grief means to experience some new restored kind of life after a prolonged. Of loss and grief over death I think the Standard English translation of this is mourned and again that just sounds more religious and where is the word grief sounds a glance has brought her used to the good life belongs to those who experience death and loss yes because they will be comforted now there's a particular layer of meaning hear about grief as it relates to the story of the Bible the state of the Exile the Babylonian exile brought about a period of grief
 and comfort became an icon that's it doesn't look like they have for the New Jerusalem the restoration of Jerusalem a hundred or so years after the Nebuchadnezzar took out Jerusalem and after the people were exiled from Jerusalem a bunch of people come back that's what the book says or any of my about and it's cool but not as great as the narrative reflection of the diminished version of what they had for that's right and so in both stories of the characters as Ryan the Amaya is moments I have marked hairy ones and Ezra chapter 10 we're all of his plans to restore Jerusalem in the temple they all start falling apart and Ezra chapter 10 and so he starts fasting eating tofu drinking the water and he says he's in a state of mourning grieving over the unfaithfulness of The X-Files
 so now the unfaithfulness of Israel living in prolonged violation of the Covenant under pressed oppression by rulers is called grieving and then same with Nehemiah chapter one when he hears about the state of Jerusalem all broken down and ruins he Grieves and morons and praise so there's also within the biblical story the stage of grieving is waiting for the Restoration in the Fulfillment of God's promises is also identified as a stage of grieving so I think for the probably both layers what Jesus is saying are there's like a social, political layer of the people that he's like looking at is he says this everyone does experienced loss but there's something about when you have power you can ignore it distract yourself and so then you don't actually have to grieve
 skip over The Grieving the kind of what modern life is often times we don't want to spend time grieving and being sad let's just move on because when you have power are you don't have to be but we don't have power you're just stuck having to grief and they're like social sets of like I can't change yes the circumstances yes there's no other way out of this I don't have another option for of spirit 15 powerless yes in the first one for the good life
 is what he longs to those who experience the world and they understand that this is the world's in a State Warriors grieving over my city is in a state where is grieving over if you're glibly moving through life and everything's Dandy you're probably not paying attention right right and the good life belongs to those who do pay attention and paradoxically it will make you sad The Good Life belongs to those who will pay attention to loss and grief and it may be your own McKay's can't avoid it but it may be you start noticing other people's loss and pain and that that also will put you into a state of grieving and that's a fortunate place to be According To Jesus
I think we need a bigger vision for the space and time it takes to grieve so to help me unpack this I have back in the studio Bible project scholar been hurting I've been thanks for coming. Thank you where should we go first I want you to walk us through a story of grieving particularly the one in Genesis where Joseph has to bury his father in Genesis 50 and let me just read it here then Joseph hug his father's face and he wept over him and he kissed him Joseph instructed the physicians in his service to embalm his father and so they did and they took 40 days to do the embalming do you keep reading then they mourned for 70 days and when I say they it's not just Joseph and Company or family it says the Egyptians mourn for him for 70 days so they
 what is this whole like National communal morning. And if you get a knife then keep reading and they asked for permission to take Jacob my father back up to the land of Canaan to be buried and when they arrived there there's 7 more days so you get from that story but just look for different instances of mourning and grieving throughout the Hebrew Bible and you'll pick up on this all the time it's public not just private and there is a it's this the old phrase of steering into the skid it was on your car fishtails out the back door instead of Turning Away you go at it they're intentionally focusing on the pain for extended periods of time far longer than we would ever be comfortable doing so Jesus is saying a good life actually requires you to have a capacity for grief
 yes and turned toward this King Jesus and participate with his way actually join with him as he says this is actually good for you this is good for a human being to not just pretend that in the face of tragedy death lost and Corruption of life to just pretend it's okay so that's why we have a Jesus when he goes to see Lazarus he knows I went there to raise this guy and and yet he still weeps he he still he still greed about his death yes she is unwilling to minimize what's going on Queen Elizabeth said that grief is the price we pay for loving
 and this feels like that it totally does
 The Sermon on the Mount is about the kingdom of God which is a world of people all compelled by love
 the third and final statement in this Triad is the good life belongs to the meek what is this word meat mean to Jesus is Meek the best translation here's Tim and John
 all right the third saying of Jesus about the good life is most famous or well-known for blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth blessed are the meek yes that's a whole bunch of reasons that way of phrasing in English this going to lead our minds down a totally wrong path to get with Jesus was trying to communicate making Mi so let me go for this that's a start, so the good life belongs to The Afflicted because they will inherit the land The Afflicted The Afflicted another English word that could get us there much more closely than me could be the unimportant so there's nothing for it we have to know what where it's Jesus's activating
 what's the background of round these words and what school is both both of this word The Afflicted with an important one and also the phrase they will inherit the land they both are hyperlinks very clear passages in Isaiah in the Psalms and when you turn there then it's like it's not hard to get it so should we just do that so the Greek word gets translated as meat is the Greek word process which in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible that is a couple hundred years before Jesus called the Septuagint this word prose was one of the most common ways to translate into Greek and Hebrew word in Hebrew word is on me and I'm just going to read a few Psalms where the word on the appears and these are place where this word appears then if you read this Greek Septuagint version of these
 it's also the Greek word progress which is the word Jesus uses here so some 76 God you caused your Justice to be heard from Heaven the Earth was afraid and Stood Still when God a rose for justice to save all of the Omni of the Earth
 the Omni of the Earth are saved from God's judgments know by God's judgment God's judgment is what saved them or did I say you're saved from God's judgment as just to see sometimes that's all you do is our modern use of the word just has a much more what the point is that whoever the Omni are there a group of people that need to be rescued and they will be rescued when God brings ultimate Justice
 now what unspoken here is the army or people who are being abused and taken advantage by the wicked and God's justice will confront the wicked resulting and deliverance for the honey that's the context of this song it's appealing to a judgment seen your there's you know somebody being accused of wrongdoing against the army or the army or people who have wronged done against them okay so that's first category in jokes 24 jokes describes the worst kind of guy you can imagine it's a portrait of the Wicked Man jobs point of view and he's described it as vivid imagery that you know the Wicked Man is somebody who drives away the donkey of an orphan he takes the Widow socks for their own debtors much is describing somebody's heartless yeah so he sees the donkey of an orphan
 I deserve that didn't take it and it's like that you know it had a name the orphan you know named ed and cared for it and the rich masks like I know you don't matter yeah that's the amateur yes they push the needy aside on the road the Omni of the land hide themselves when the wicked bad comes to getting the idea because you're vulnerable this guy was taken into the Donny are somebody who's in a social position of unimportance but also you lack it's very similar to being powerless to the poor in spirit so it's you are in the social position where it's easy for people to take advantage of you
 you're a social Outsider from centers of the resources and social capital and Bethany David call himself when he is out in the wilderness fleeing from Saw and there's Palms in the Psalms of David describes itself as Donnie and he's not poor he's like that with the royal family but he is a social outcast in that season of his wife and so he's got to pull together his own community of support he's on the run and he's got no presser so
 they're bassani the in the produce in Greek step one step two is they will inherit the land
 so when we talked about land inheritance on one level there's a hyperlink here that will look at the land inheritance is about wealth and the ability to have dominion economic means to generate wealth which makes you a contributing valuable member of the community and this was a culture where land ownership was primary way to generate wealth and it's probably the one of the very clear things The Afflicted will lack yes that's right be a landowner but she was kind of in a class that you not be considered the money yeah that's true in most societies throughout human history that you don't have set up systems
 private property and so on so that that's one piece another piece on the ground in first-century you know Galilee and Judea in the land of Israel these are their ancestral lands that Israel inherited you know in the days of Joshua and it's very clear that they do not have independent freedom on their land they occupied territory and you think so many of Jesus parables are filled with images of land owners or managers who hire servants to work on the land and he's just he's reflecting on real life like the land was being bought up by non Israelites who don't live nearby they live in Italy they live on Cypress they live up on the coast and so you've got like motion after who are now day laborers on the very land that they're great great great grand
 father and mother like I own this part of their tribal inheritance that's the tragedy here. So to say they will inherit the land is pretty explosive political language yeah that's the one we're going on a quotation from Psalm 37 shall we read it yes alright Psalm 37 verse 7
 be still before the Lord wait patiently for him don't be anxious when people succeed in their ways and carry out their wicked schemes
 refrain from anger turn from your hot anger don't be anxious it will only lead to Raw Hebrew word Badness
 for those who are evil will be destroyed but those who hope in Yahweh will inherit the land
 a little while the wicked will be no more we will look for them they will not be found but the Omni they will inherit the land and enjoy Shalom and Tove goodness decent goodness this hyperlink is to that second layer of Israel being with was this written in Exile so what were tapping into in a poem like this is if Israel is no longer in a position of having Eden freedom and responsibility over their land we're definitely in the realm of the Covenant curses of Deuteronomy and God has handed Israel over 24 and oppressors
 and when you're living in that scenario it's buried over after Generations it's very easy to think this is just how it is in the wicked or winning and how it's going to be at the phones 37 is one of many many poems that hope for Israel's resurrect restoration to the land as the time of comfort and the time of inheriting the rain the kingdom of the heavens here on Earth or in this case inheriting the land so that the position of a song is very much within the larger biblical story of Israel and so on so that's the role of The Afflicted inheriting the land
 so Jesus is speaking in very real terms to Galilean Israelites 444 don't have any land who are grieving over the state of Israel oppressed by foreigners and by their own people who are in League with foreigners
 and you know they were whatever edged out of their land Holdings Generations ago or recently and that's the context for Jesus saying how good is life the good life belongs to those who are unimportant to those around the outside of centers of power and influence because something is happening here
 when the reign of God arrives that is going to bring about the new creation which will be the ultimate land inheritance
 okay so the four we sign off we want to give you a little behind the scenes look at a video we made here at bible project about these statements of the good life here is our producer Dan talking to some of my artist
 okay Dan here and I'm going to walk downstairs to the animation studio and talk with our friends Josh and Lisa
 that's why I do this
 I think so I was really excited talk to you guys because the scene that stood out to me to mohsen video number two was centered around the idea of blessed are the meek or is Tim John safe blessed are the unimportance for they will inherit the land needs people are not powerful or important but just wait Jesus says because one day it will be you who are ruling the world about to hear the creative process of mine that what's happening like right here we're moving from The Mountaintop where Jesus is giving a sermon to this inner World portrayal of a throne room that has an elevated throne with a a little King on it and then right at the moment when they're talking about the blessing of the unimportant that he switches places with this farmer who has been sitting kind of heads down at the foot of the throne
 yeah and so the king and the farmer switch places and when she goes to take it off to put it on the Humboldt King it produces a second Crown leaning into the abundance over scarcity mindset and reversing the roll again we're even though she is elevated now she's coming down to the former King you know what that sounds like trying to start a revolution kind of but it's not a revolution for those who are hungry for power or influence this is a movement of people who are going to serve
 so roses going is now if you were the director of this video is there anything else that you guys wanted to communicate in this scene everything I'm trying it's about trying to get people to flip their perceptions if people can after seeing this think about how they relate to power maybe they're unimportant and they get to have this crown and that means that they get to share that same thing as everybody to feed credible
 talk to you later
 these first three statements are all about the surprising backwards nature of God's kingdom how The Good Life Starts in the margins with a poor Afflicted the downtrodden next week we look at the second Triad if the first Triad is about the place. Find us in the second Triad is the type of character. Cause us to the pure of heart is the entry card to returning to Eden in the storyline in the Bible do God on a mission to make the Spear of heart possible important to recognize the biblical authors and God really thinks humans are capable of their capable through God's New Creation power and present what we are made for mermaids be pure of heart
