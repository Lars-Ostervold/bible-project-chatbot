hey this is John and this is Tim and for the last few weeks and for the next couple weeks we re releasing episodes from their back catalogue being five most listened to podcast episodes in our 250-plus podcast yeah we've been rocking a weekly podcast for over 5 years and it's been amazing so much fun believe also never taking a break since we're taking a few weeks to take a break and we know the next series is going to start after this we're really thought about that but yeah The Seventh-Day rest here is a couple years ago yeah we did this series as part of a bigger focus on things that happen in Genesis 1 and 2 and one of them was on the theme of rest on Sabbath yapping the video that came out of the conversations was called Sabbath or wheeze we're calling at seventh day of rest this was the first episode in that series is the third most listened to as a
 good in our whole catalog and it's great to think about rest because that's what we're doing right now just have some vacation Sabbath as an important principle that you build in your life rhythms where you stop and rest and reflect and so gratefulness it's like a disciplined it's actually a pretty strange tradition to have because it just doesn't help you actually survive in the world super well I think I need to really listen to this episode episodes going to be great if you enjoy it as a whole series on 7th Day rest and also a YouTube video we made it's one of my favorite videos we hope you enjoy this released episode The Restless craving for a 7-Day rest episode 1
 good we live in a busy fast-paced world we can shop eat and work any hour of the day most of us live with constant access to the internet and if you're like me you're constantly checking phone news and updates is always a new deadline a new urgent request a new problem to solve one day bleeds into the next life can be hectic and it can be exhausting
 and then we get to the Bible and there's an idea a theme that you may have heard of but if you like me you might not know a lot about if the idea of the Sabbath
 that is most basic is that you stop the word Sabbath mean stop the word Shabbat in Hebrew they're actually other words for rest like an English we think of like laying down and relaxing and being rejuvenated to do those things you have to shabbat but the word Shabbat it's basic meaning is to cease from to stop I'm John Collins and this is the Bible project podcast that the Hebrew word Shabbat is where English word Sabbath comes from and you may have heard of people observing a Sabbath day entire day of stopping from your work or you might have heard of people taking sabbaticals long break from their work but this practice comes from a much larger theme in the Bible Acts of Shabbat is just one way to think about something way bigger going on which is about the design of time all culminating in the seventh seventh day God created the heavens and the Earth in six days and on the seventh day he stops enter
 creation and he rests and rules and humans are there with God's Rule and rest with him on the seventh day of the seventh day is like a multi-faceted and as the concept developed through the story of the Bible we're going to discover in different story after story that there's going to be different ways and angles in the past it's the kids YouTube for one of the man facet is the fabric of creation as leading towards a great goal where humans imitate gods and join him in ceasing from working labor there's going to be another facet that's all about being enslaved to our labor and so the seventh day is the time to celebrate our Liberation From Slavery so that we can rest with God they were beginning a new series understanding the theme of Seventh-Day rest thanks for joining us
 this is going to be a very long conversation when we did the god conversation was trying to do a 20 episode of podcast it was about 40 pages and that's great to hear my hand 41 pages of math projects theme video I started reading and writing and collecting notes on a couple months ago so I guess that's when it's technically started but our conversation about it starts now it will become a theme video at some point it's our future in the past when the videos so much as I've been preparing yes conversar office white boards are just filled with your beautiful mind notes
 a lot of it to was I hit the Torah like hard and slept study mode about 2 years ago Rite Aid in breathing reading and rereading the tour over and over again and so I've just been noticing collecting all these observations specifically around patterns of the number 7 moving into the narrative in poetry of the Torah and then as I started to think about this conversation all of a sudden it hit me like it's all connected to Sabbath and so then I started collecting stuff on the idea of act the actual Sabbath but all these other narratives and Toms in the temp to keep getting pulled into the conversation with us 40 pages of things for us to talk about sweet I've learned so much I'm excited and I'm not even done like I've just outlined the New Testament stuff in these notes I have a actually filled it in a really I'm sorry I'm sorry you're welcome theme wasn't on your original
 that's a good point yeah I don't know when it dawned on me like this is an organizing main theme of the entire biblical story begins is the opening line of Jessa really in terms of its literary design cool yeah yeah so like you when we start this project you had about 25 themed videos correct and then what happened was we started thinking about doing a series on Genesis 1 through 3 at creation series and so basically like five or six ideas that are really important to those chapters and Sabbath was one of them and instead of treating it as a Christian series we decided to treat them all as separate theme theme videos and so are we forcing this to be a thing where you think this is like a Biblical theme do it definitely is usual criteria introduced on pages 1 2 and 3 develop worked over and over and over
 and then repeating developments throughout the Hebrew scriptures there's a culminating moment in the story of Jesus which then launches you out into the new creation for the Sabbath so it probably is even more a theme in that way than many of the some of the other things that we have made I was just it everywhere yeah it's awesome let's get into it
so let's do this instead of first going to Genesis 1 let's talk about a memory that you and I share and then connected to a memory that I have from the year that my wife and I lived in Jerusalem and I was studying there and our apartment was in West Jerusalem not far from like the old medieval walls and that we live by the largest outdoor Market in Jerusalem the famous tourist spot now which is why years later you and I went there that for history in that market I remember did we eat lunch there and we are at the market and then we went and got some lunch that's probably the equivalent of like an an American city maybe two square blocks of space but it's just all of these little narrow Alleyways yeah
 in the Maze and every square foot of the walls are little store friends yet and it's really just vendor tables right and it's been it's like fish or meat or berries or not produce or bread and electric it's so bizarre I would never live so close to a much less like getting old wait a second I'm thinking of a different place I'm thinking of the very touristy place the open yet the market this is what you made me do the shabak a grocery store but where everything is fresh every day every day and you walk into this place hundreds of vendors everybody's yelling like you know in Hebrew
 of course we're back like what they're selling how much you know fish fish my sling in these little guys know Ali what is bargaining over stuff you know this is wonderful so we would basically just go there every couple days and get food there next couple days instead of like going once a week so you and I never abused later when we visited we went there on the Sabbath on Friday afternoon. How you say in Hebrew yeah so there were some young men Hasidic Jews who were there the equivalent of Christian traditions
 yeah I remember this totally yeah they were hanging out in the marketplace getting people to what I didn't know what they were doing that's why I kind of come over here cuz I knew what they would do to you but you didn't know yeah but I imagine they want to get your attention and then they want you to engage with them and they want to convince you of something that's right but they're not talk about Jesus and they want other things from the one you have may be some olive complexion olive skin Corrections straps around you backup my brother had just like a month previous to this taken one of those 23andMe DNA test and it came back that we have like asking Ozzy Jew Jewish
 had no idea so my brother had just shared that with me either and then we were in Israel and I told you and it's like it's like 15% or something so we walked over these guys were thrilled and then what they say are you Jewish that's right she Brew Hebrew say yeah I'm telling them that he just discovered that he has some Jewish Heritage and then I told him and he would like to say the Shema and they were thrilled solid member they wrapped in Hebrew but they are the traditional Jewish prayer like regalia these straps they're connected to prayer practices in certain forms of Judaism they put this thing on your head do you member a little prayer strap with a little box on it
 a little scroll that the written on it the Shema and then they had you and then they had to repeat in Hebrew the Shema and I just butchering it cuz it was everyone around everyone around enjoyed watching YouTube yeah I'm glad you made me do that definitely good memory that when they were doing that because they were Preparing People for their there every Friday afternoon because they want to it's a place where the city gathers and they're honoring the god of Israel by anybody who's there at the market may be their heart isn't right with God or maybe they haven't been faithful to the traditions of this rail they want to be there to be available in that moment to help any Israelite any Jew commit and what better time to do it then hours before Shabbat so that you could recommit and then go home and forget on Shabbat maybe in a way you never have before I didn't notice anyone else
 do they get a lot of people up and dying it's a good question I don't know I don't know so I shop there cuz I would have been going to school during the week and that she Jessica actually served during the week she would cross through the checkpoint over in the West Bank and she would volunteer at Bethlehem Bible, which is the Palestinian question is that where we visited cool when I get out of school she would take the bus back from Bethlehem we meet up and we just do like a week at shopping cuz most of the stores are not going to be open in 24 hours were and so on Friday afternoon it's like the crush of people there and everybody's there getting ready for Shabbat and so everybody's getting 36 48 hours worth of food and so what would happen
 right before Sunset is it packed there was just got off work and it's all too busy prep this is like a weekly Rhythm just breathing for us it's just by the predictable and this market and I remember the first time we were there and we are pushing it time wise for Shabbat and then these these men may be like half an hour before sense that these men in long black leather jackets and robes and the Russian hats a certain kind of Russian Jewish group that lives across the street in the ultra-orthodox neighborhood called me and they would run through the market with these little trumpets I've never seen anything like it and like maybe a foot long and they would be to get out of here is like the third alarm clock 30 minute warning and then I would like the 20-minute some people liked it
 not everyone in the city knows about that's right but a lot do like what percentage would you say go to Tel Aviv know you're very few I don't know what I don't know what the numbers are which feels like you're in for more secular and that you couldn't even tell us about started if you're eating at a restaurant and come downtown Tel Aviv to Jerusalem tracks more religious ethnic people if people would be running through a blowing these horns and then if you happen to be a mean anywhere in the city at Sunset the sirens go off through the whole city because we leave this year we would have been gone.
 if you lived in the Midwest and you know the tornado sirens and no cars on the road. It's just it just got real quiet and especially in our neighborhood and then it would just be quiet and you would just see lights on if you happen to not be observant and you walking around you would just hear people singing York a family's think walking around is not observant observant you're in your house we have it in your family having them sometimes at the other evening to go for a quiet walk because what we learned as you walk through the neighborhoods and you would cheer family singing like you cuz you're in the in the summer when when does the rest of it was a beautiful yeah and it was for a whole year just like living in the city experiencing this Rhythm it was so amazing and I just never experienced I knew about Shabbat
 but I never lived in a community that was so passionate about it right so think about this that was a long time ago 2006/2007 that we were there so me and Jessica didn't have kids yet so to think what we were experiencing that year has been a ritual regular practice for this people group for somewhere around 30 plus centuries I just I have to imagine myself into a culture that has been doing this thing for 30 + centuries probably more well before anyone had a weekend All Around the World in different cultures different neighborhoods different language groups this people has been practicing at sundown Friday afternoon Hustle
 to get ready cuz it's a lot of work to get ready to not work right I'll just saying cuz these are things you're not going to be doing for 24 hours once once it sounds that deer yeah I imagine yourself into that imagine being born into a culture where it's already ancient and for your whole life you don't know anything different except this rhythm of working especially the the bus all up on the sixth day Friday the Jewish about calendar your whole week leading up to this moment and then it stops at Sunset and then you're with your family you have some friends over and so here's what you do you sunsets and you all come around the dinner table and you like candles and then you say a prayer maybe dad maybe mom sings out
 King of the universe who has set us apart as Holy by his Commandments and has commanded us to light the lamp of the Sabbath and the next 24 hours we're going to eat we're going to sing we're going to read from the Torah and Prophets and writings and we're going to wake up the next morning you're going to go to synagogue you're going to hear the Torah prophets and writings read aloud you're going to hear homily to go home have another meal and wait for the next dinner on what we call Saturday night and then that's a whole other deal to wave goodbye to the Shabbat for another 6 days until you agree to it again and then you celebrate the coming of the 8th day which then
 becomes the first day of the new Shabbat cycle so in that calendar Sunday is the beginning of the week and noticed the Shabbat begins on what we perceive as the end of the day Sunset is the beginning of the Shabbat day it goes from Sunset to Sunset cuz that's the day delineator is sundown in this all about Genesis wants we'll talk about it yeah I guess from Sundown to sundown here so you're actually welcoming in a new day at sunset on Saturday you know I was always hard for me to understand that because that's not how I think of day is it in the days when you wake up correct and I remember things around in college when I finally figured it out it was because there's a website B&H Photo that's owned by Orthodox Jews and they don't let you buy online otherwise I should come Sundown on Friday and I was always like a Friday night
 oh yes oh yeah that's right yeah yeah you'd walk around Jerusalem and not everywhere but many shops are closed and they won't be open for the next 24 hours here you'll see a lot of people won't drive they'll walk but just around the neighborhood the developed Traditions about how far is not the point is is that work yeah it's because of the stories about Jesus in the gospels having conflicts with religious leaders over here had observed that reflects unintended I think by the gospel authors that have cast a negative atmosphere over the Sabbath and the guidelines for observing it being legalistic were oriented instead of God oriented and that's totally wrong in Jewish tradition it's so beautiful what the Sabbath means we have a meeting
 but what does habit means is it worthy being protected just like parents will establish guidelines for how we work as a family in our house you don't like those are rules here and it would be totally missing the point to be like how legalistic do you know the point is you love this thing right and you want to honor it precisely by protecting it so in all these different ways different Jewish Traditions developed different types of guidelines for what constitutes work that's the whole thing was there something beautiful here when we stop we stopped the hustle and bustle stop acting like we're the center of the universe that my work is the center of the universe or that my striving and work is keeping everything glued together yeah that's right yes yeah everything will fall apart if I don't XYZ if you just you stop so we'll unpack what Sabbath mean in the Hebrew scripture
 it actually means a lot of things but at its most basic is that you stopped the word Sabbath mean stop the word Shabbat in Hebrew they're actually other words for rest like an English we think of like laying down and relaxing and being rejuvenated to do those things you have to shabbat Shabbat it's basic meaning is to cease from stop
shut up
 shovel
 shut up
 I am not strictly I'm not sure about observant in any kind of strict way and we've adapted guess I'm going to have over the years about how we try to live by the wisdom of it and so we'll get there when we talked about the possible it's so it's I haven't lived this reality except for a living in a culture that did it for a year and it was really affecting that night when we are in Jerusalem after you said the small we went to an amazing Shabbat meal together. You know I am remembering now we walked to that house and the city was empty from the market and the streets are completely empty I don't really think about that but now remembering back yeah we went to that guy's house and he hosted like all of it was like a group of 30 is crazy and then he let us do it all the songs and prayers and had meals with a lot of work for them to put that on
 yeah they host groups of Simply to arrest you if he and his wife would sing these different traditional prayers one part of it is singing selections from proverbs 31 the poem about the amazing woman. I was singing to his wife the line of fire because this isn't native to my tradition and life experiences and so it's sort of like who Am I who are we were Gentiles ancient and because it's been going for over thirty centuries it's developed its meaning in the traditions in the way people talk and practice it has changed and developed over time
 and so what we're going to be talking about is the earliest. And the biblical materials that talk about it which after 30 is only the first 10 centuries of the tradition like after the biblical after the Hebrew Bible. It kept it on the thing for another 20 Century so maybe a distinction to make cuz we began a lot of people love to learn to talk about the Shabbat because they're really interested in the practice of it either Friday night or Saturday night practice why and what that means our conversations going to be a little bit different of a focus and Ice the video will be different in that if you go to the Hebrew scriptures you have to wait 80 chapters then the whole book of Genesis and then a half of the book of Exodus you don't get a command about observing the Sabbath until Exodus chapter 20 set 70 chapters in to give to people of Israel
 hand book on how to observe Shabbat it's kind of a weird one cuz it doesn't even get to it and then what that you're staying and we'll look the Sabbath command in the Torah are differently worded and they give different reasons about why they practice the Sabbath different from each other twice will look at it in a moment but there's different reasons for why you'd necessarily contradictory but they're different numbers the Hebrew Bible doesn't seem concerned to be a hand book on how to observe Shabbat what it's more interested is the meaning of Shabbat which is why it sent that the meaning of Shabbat is introduced on page one and in true Jewish meditation literature style it doesn't come right out and tell you the meaning of Shabbat she keeps developing that's all right yeah that develops it so that by the time you're 70 chapters into the Torah then you get a command about the Shabbat will you actually already all know all about what that
 Seventh-Day rest means you've been thoroughly educated by the burden of the scriptures about the development of the Shabbat practice and the practice but within the storyline of the Old Testament the practice of Shabbat is just one way to think about this something way bigger going on which is about this design of time all culminating in a 7A seventh day which is way bigger than just what you do on Friday not what people do on Friday nights is one of many symbolic narrative pointers to a larger C logical idea so it's it's the idea that the video is going to be about the video won't be about practicing practice test. I will get there in the video and then our conversations but it's a governing theological idea about the concept of time in the Bible and time is moving toward
 a climactic resolution and a time of ultimate Bliss in abundance and rest and the weekly practice of Sabbath is just a pointer in a foretaste of something way bigger is that distinction clear I'm still trying to find lately I think of the Sabbath being introduced the Sabbath it's all about the practice of taking the day not to stop how do you do it and how do you do as a Christian and why do you do it you're saying there's a bigger set of ideas about how the Bible thinks about time in the culmination of time that the Sabbath is just one manifestation of the practice of the practice of the Sabbath as it's described in the Hebrew scriptures is just one of many many many other ways that the Sabbath idea is explored and talked about in developed and I guess
 the tricky part is that it's the same word really what does videos about is about the seventh day the seventh day into that other words there are many different seventh days there are many many ways are words that this the culminating Seventh-Day concept kids develop them as she bought another one is called shmita release which is the seventh year of when slaves are released in debt to cancel another one of them is the year of your veil of Jubilee which is the seventh seventh seventh seventh year released slaves are freed and land goes back to its original Eden like conditions when Israel first enter the land so she bought the year of release the Jubilee are all different time practices that point towards the same
 my dear the seventh day of the seventh day, dating day so maybe we call this video on the 7th day that's interested if the ambiguity between the practice of the weekly Shabbat and this video which is about this idea of really nice of time as the culmination of history at the 7th day is a collation as a team unifying the whole storyline of the Bible and she bought points do that but so does the year of release and so does the Jubilee that's interesting it's just becoming clear to me in this moment we made the video called the Holy Spirit and many people watched it hoping that we would be talking about the Trinity but that's not what we talked about and so we reflected maybe should we have called it just in spirit or the spirit of God cuz we mostly were talking about the Hebrew Bible or not video I wonder if this is a similar thing where he will be disappointed before you like I do they made him
 on how to do the Sabbath Sabbath what are people doing Friday to Saturday night what's the meaning of that and this is about what's the meaning of the seventh day in the story land Bible that's interesting
 tonight you smoke
 be cool
it's the Sabbath is one of the Ten Commandments yeah the very overlooked in certain culture debates about the importance of the Ten Commandments in what do you remember we were at member we were at Calamity James and they had the cowboy Commandments and I pointed this out to you is the restaurant is Zoe's Restaurant Hood let me just Google Cowboys but it was like this tongue and cheek kind of like it here to remember this one just one God to honor your mom paw 3 no tellin Tales are gossiping for get yourself the Sunday meetings get yourself the Sunday meeting is the cowboy command so it's like they get to the Sabbath and for the Cowboys. But just you know the American Tile
 Protestant products. It's just me to go to church on Sunday right this is up this has been a debate in America has been in the last half-century a Hot Topic in American culture the Paradigm is that we should publicly display the moral code of the Bible the Paradigm being Bible is God's handbook for Behavior so we should publicly and the Ten Commandments summarize the best that's one way to think about it I think there's a more helpful ways to think about it and a lot of them work one God the ones out of the Bible if you know tell the truth the one that's really sticks out of the everyone agrees with them know that mean even if you're not a Christian or even not religious the ones like we can all agree we're not going to believe it maybe the people who don't believe in God
 I'll take a pass on that one but yeah it don't matter but yeah it's really situated in it as a Israelite Jewish practice keep the Sabbath just keep the Sabbath so in Christian tradition what's happened is that this gets removed from the Friday night to Saturday night saying I guess applied to going to go to church on Sunday and it's true actually my kids are listening a lot to audiobooks of Little House on the Prairie and so that's how Mom and Pop talk about going to church keep the Sabbath day so early into American culture is there a concept of that Sunday so that probably goes back into European Christianity Roots but there's an irony there because that's not what sabotage means in in the old or new testament this is argument I heard that the Sabbath was on Saturday but then Jesus arose from
 dad on a Sunday and so the early Christians began to celebrate the Sabbath on the Sunday and that's why we all do church on Sunday underneath that concept is a loads of loads of controversy because the historical data to tell us that story is not clear it's and it's very complicated so I we might get here maybe at the end of our discussion on torn well it's not important for the video actually is a really interesting and important but Sabbath within the first two generations of Christian Christian Christian literature Sabbath Never referred to Sunday the Sabbath was Friday night to Saturday night and Sunday is called most likely is what the phrase the Lord's day returns to it was only much later that the word Sabbath came to be attached to me in like a Christian version
 I think for the many of those early Generations you know many of the followers of Jesus were Jewish and so they would have deserved Sabbath Sabbath but then they would also do something on Sunday in fact there was an expectation amongst Jewish followers of Jesus or kind of a hope that that Gentiles would also adopt the Sabbath and then this became controversial yes that we know about through Paul's letters to the church in Rome into the churches of galatia and so I'm in class A so I just want to like put an asterisk on that yeah yeah I will pick it up later cuz it's not what we talked about in the video and the Ten Commandments appear twice in the Hebrew scriptures we talked about this and I'm out sign Exodus 20 another set of Ten Commandments is in Deuteronomy 5 When the Children of the exit
 generation are with Moses about to go in and so it begins by saying remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy and Deuteronomy 5 Moses says keep the Sabbath day in order to keep it holy so and wanted to remember when Moses repeats it and remembers for a new contacts TCF remember fine or keep how do you remember it you keep it and as you keep it you're obviously remembering it but it's a little little difference from they're both commands or verbatim to say six days you shall labor and do all of your work but the seventh day is a Sabbath of Yahweh your God on it you shall do no work neither you nor your son or your daughter or your male slave or your female slave or your ox or your and then here's where the passages to part sew-in exit
 it finishes by saying your ox or the Immigrant who stays with you so that it's done in Deuteronomy 5 the list keeps on going neither your ox or your donkey or cattle or the Immigrant who stays with you and then here's where the two different passages depart in Exodus 20 the reason why do why do you do this how do you stop working for Sullivan of exodus 20:4 in six days Yahweh made the skies and the land and the Sea and all that is in them and he rested on the seventh day and the Hebrew word there is Shabbat he ceased on the selfie Shabbat hyperlink to Genesis 1 do we do this why do we stop from work that's what God did this 20 got stopped on the 7th Day therefore we stopped in your reading and Deuteronomy 5 and you get to the the reason why it says so that your male slave and
 are female slave May rest along with you and the word rest there is different the word rest that's the same route as Noah's name North Newark Newark means that you have stopped and now you're in a state of being refreshed and settling in and resting in the place that you stopped so they kind of two stages Shabbat is about stopping what we were doing new office is about now settling into the place where you stopped so that you can be refreshed the next part so you can't talk unless you you have to Shabbat in order to new us and if you knew offing that's because you've you should have bought it so it says you shall remember you were a slave in the land of Egypt and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and outstretched arm. Therefore Yahweh your God commands
 you to observe the sabbath day so two different house but they are different sure okay so and Exodus the rationale is this is what I did when he created rested there's something about the fabric of the cosmos and how come what God did that in the end and imitating you do this because that's what God did have other than in Deuteronomy there's this focus on well and because it's about slavery they have slaves how should you treat slaves will remember you were a slave you weren't treated well God rescue to you but I want you to treat your slaves in a different way that's right why do You observe the sabbath in Deuteronomy 5 so that your slaves can have a day of rest along with you
 all of you were slaves and God redeemed you so that you could have rest in the promised land so now once you go into the promised land you make sure that everybody gets a day of rest you could say this is that it's a Liberation unto rest that's interesting but like you know Paul talks about being slaves to send you know the whole identity of slavery super crucial especially in will next from axis narrative on and yeah it's interesting to think about what that means what is our slavery and was it mean to stop you from where are you at right here the 7th day is like a multi-faceted Jim and as the concept developed through the story of the Bible we're going to discover in different story after story that there's going to be different ways and angles and facets to get to to the Core
 one of the man facets is the fabric of creation as leading towards a great goal where humans imitate God and join him in ceasing from work and labor but there's going to be another facet that's all about being enslaved to our labor and slaves to something and so the seventh day is the time to celebrate our Liberation From Slavery so that we can rest with God and actually both of these themes are in Genesis 12 3 to 3 is where you find both of them developed and then from there you get two strands two cords so I can think of a symphony and one will be the creation and all history leading up to the seventh day another one will be the seventh day is about Liberation From Slavery to rest in Eden like state but they're both
 really about the same thing and you can see it that's why I like the two gives you the creation imitate God participate with him in the seventh say Deuteronomy 5 gives you the Liberation from slavery is you celebrating Liberation From Slavery every seventh day in anticipation of some Future Past full Liberation that's right and those two ideas are both ways of thinking about the meaning of the seventh day it's like a Genesis 12 3 will introduce these two facets of Sabbath and then the rest of the story line of the Bible acts like a symphony is going to rest and weave them into legitimate stories in different teams and so on cool
 Panama
 because this was the longest quote that I think will be interesting and it's Railey Skylar Matisyahu savate ever really met things going he is going into the phrase It's repeated in both Sabbath commands the Strays and English tickets rendered the seventh day is a Sabbath of Yahweh in Hebrew the phrases Shabbat Sabbath to one day out of seven the Israelite is to renounce dominion over his own time and recognize God's dominion over it simply put every seventh day the Israelite renounces his autonomy and a firm's God's dominion over him in conclusion every seventh day the Israelite renounce his dominion over his time pronounce autonomy recognizes God's dominion over time and that's over himself his conclusion keeping the Sabbath is an acceptance of the kingdom and sovereignty of God I like the way you put that
 so what ya you tell me what are your hearing and the significance of it so to call the Sabbath the claim that the Sabbath belongs to God is to cut a jar you into remembering that it's kind of weird to think about a day of the week belonging to someone I was weird to think about but then he kind of makes a point like we're masters of our own time think of ourselves as like time belongs to us our time belongs to us time to the currency earn it you lose it you spend it say that song that we think about it enough actually I think it's it's actually kind of a cruel thought experiment to realize how little time is it is actually have been how fast it goes and how one third of it you're asleep
 I wish I was but yeah so I think that every day belongs to me the ritual practice rituals are habits and structures in our lives that determine reality even in ways that were not conscious of right so the fact that I have a calendar app on my smartphone and I determine what goes on and off of that the only thing structured for me is an empty box calls to 8 and I determine everything that goes into March 8th that doesn't so that's a ritual and structure in my life that unconsciously convinces me that I control my dad is kind of what he's getting at here we consider ourselves the masters of our time that by the ritual practice of Justin
 serving that one day actually belongs to God it humbles you it's renouncing autonomy it's kind of like crack of the door open just enough and I like the least at least recognize one day is mine and then all sudden as you do that you realize oh all time belongs to God
 yeah and the seventh day this is Santa's being our later discussion but the seventh day is always some culminating day of rescue for of divine miraculous provision of God doing something and coming through in a way that I couldn't do my cell that's interesting as this how the two motifs weave together The Liberation yeah yep that's right so what is so what idea is I'm a master of my own time and that needs to be readjusted but the other idea is what do I do with my time will generally I obsess about do I have enough am I protected am I am I going to be happy you're busy securing your life stability and provision yeah that's what we're doing can I hold everything together to make sure that my wife doesn't fall apart small and big ways I don't want like my car battery didn't start
 but but that's a small thing at the we're just trying to hold it all together tragedies and remind us were not the masters of much of anything yeah but we like to tonight pretend we are and so these two kind of things are like one you're not and secondly you're trying to be because you're hoping for Liberation you're hoping for peace and that's something God's going to provide correct God's the master of time and God's going to provide some master of your your life and well-being and so here's when the tragedy hits or when I'm reminded that I'm not the master of my life where time and Trashies have a way of shaking us awake to that but what if I've developed a lifetime habit of inconveniently interrupting my time in my life every seven days year
 are the reason why I just can I found it hard to implement this is because we haven't been strict about a practice and so we kind of more fit Flex it and so the whole point of this tradition is you don't more from you flex your life to this pattern for it and it's inconvenient that's why everybody is bustling around in the market you know 4 p.m. be convenient on purpose on Friday it's intentional inconvenience in your life and the structure remind you there's something bigger going on and I have to adjust my life to it and then in God's time and in God's power he will provide and work out his purposes and I adjust my life to that storyline as powerful and I've often wondered this like if and asked you do friends Jews are Messianic Jews like the psychology that that shape than you overtime that you only get sick
 go to 7 days to do what you want it really has a deep formative influence and how people think about their life but the intent isn't though to say okay I get six days and got to get one day no that's the wrong way yeah I get six God gets one yeah it's more that what I need is a regular reminder of the true reality of my life which is that none of my days belong to me in a way a firm in God's kingdom and sovereignty was just begs the question the bigger question then what is the story of God's kingdom and sovereignty that culminates in the seventh day what am I doing when God culminates in rest on the seventh day what's the meaning of that why is he resting I see why that's a great question I'm a little puny mortal creature what's that mean and why is the idea of God's rest
 connected to the liberation of slaves so that they can have rest of that all bundled together and today I think I asked for the magic of video could be is in tying together stopping with Liberation in the culmination of time to have some great Sabbath event and that is the storylines Bible listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast Today Show is produced by Dan gumel the music by the band tents made of enjoyed the juice music today and would like to thank you Tom Cats and Joshua Aaron for generously allowing us to use that music you can learn more on their website eitan Katz, that's p i t a n k a t z., and Joshua Aaron.
