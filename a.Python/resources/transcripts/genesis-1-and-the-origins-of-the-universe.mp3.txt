the Book of Genesis begins with an explanation of how the world came to be in the beginning God created the skies and the land has a lot of strange images which would have landed emerging from chaotic Waters a solid Dome holding back water is in the sky the spirit of God hovering over a dark abyss where did these images come from where we're going to see is that in Mesopotamia ancient Babylon and Sumeria and an ancient Egypt there were like six Traditions ways of understanding how the cost of works that involve the waters things emerging out of the waters things being separated from each other the gods speaking for the gods acting and Jen is one is at home in that cultural environment and we are not this series is about ancient cosmology or another words the way the Ancients thought about the nature of reality the images that used to think about it
 what is a judgmental and if so ancient cosmologists don't provide an account of the cosmos that's primarily concerned with the physical material processes by which what we called matter came into physical existence and the way that an Ancient Memories they accounted for the cosmos what is he completely different so today we're inviting you to join us and being a good tourist leave your own cosmology behind for a s and let's look at the world in a foreign way the way the authors of the Hebrew Bible looked at today's episode we're going to set the stage for this conversation what is a cosmology anyways do I really have one do they really matter and how do I become a good reader of Rage attacks that have mentioned cosmology
 thanks for joining us here we go
I'm really excited about this new series that we're going to be doing what series will be exploring the literary design and Main themes and images in Genesis chapters 1 2 3 just as 1 2 3 but we're doing this because Genesis 1 through 3 I mean we're always talking about you actually composed to introduce you to all the key themes and ideas for the rest of the biblical narrative has become the favorite chapters for me to read in the Bible and it's because what you discover new in them is noticing how they have prepared you for something later but you didn't know it when you first read it but then you hit something Isaiah or Daniel or the Gospel of John and you like so you go back and so that's really where this comes out we are not going to address
 issues surrounding the culture wars surrounding debate about these chapters that's one thing that got me really excited to the series looking at Genesis one through three and the way we're going to walk through it and you get to bypass entire cultural debate about Evolution and creation or Not by passing it just to be sneaky no ya don't even have to consider it the threatened if you're honoring the biblical authors that God chose ancient Israelite authors to communicate through then what we're honoring the cross-cultural nature of that communication so the ancient Israelites we're not arguing with Canaanites or Babylonians about the issues of our day they were debating if I'm issues and they were debating as we'll see Genesis 1 and 2 it's very much that part of a conversation happening in the ancient world about the nature of the Gods and the nature of the world and so
 we're bypassing it because of the debate that's called creation and evolution in the 21st century didn't exist in the first Millennium and earlier when these texts so that's the approach and by bypassing it we're really honestly not taking a stance of any position should do is first attempt to understand what's being communicated by these authors and their context and then appropriate the significance of that meaning in our modern conversations and people have different positions on the debate should all these have that as a primary goal here so yeah I'm excited to see what I find this is just in general as an approach when I was just thinking about this this morning I don't know why cuz I was doing some dishes I was thinking about when the first classes I took at the Bible College that I went to was one how to read the Bible class
 introduced to all of this historical context literature but also took a Systematic Theology class and I remember the first time I was introduced to 1st Corinthians chapter 12 was just a passage of Paul's letters about spiritual guess I kind of knew the whole thing and I was introduced into that chapter was not reading it but here are the debate people have about it here are the positions and here the key vs. that's how I was introduced and so there's some versus still in First Corinthians 12 that I today still have to actively unhinge that framework and learn to read it as a hole Paul wrote it at the flow of thought and so that's true we're introduced to the Bible in the context of debates about its meaning then the debates determine what we look for and they determine what questions we ask and then we walk away thinking we've understood a passage when I said
 done is taking something out of context to shore up my position on that it's like going to a play and instead of just going to plan on watching it someone recorded it and then sat you down and pause dad playing certain sections told you about the debate about the play but never let you just can old people watching what this character meant when they said this before we do anything let's just sit down and watch the play problem with watching the play for me reading Genesis 1 and 2 and 3 will one I don't know a lot of what's going on and he's like inch debate that you do you want to talk about and stops right but to a certain things that I did it's still anchored in my brain about the way I read things that's right yeah the moment you see the word Earth in the first sentence of the Bible we're already set up at a disadvantage we're thinking about the globe is Earth means globe and Modern English and that does not mean
 and Hebrew that's example about language for me was about debates when we've come to the Bible primarily to settle issues about debatable matters in our day were predisposed to not understand things in context we just need to be aware of that and it's a good reminder of the analogy of use reading the Bible as a cross-cultural experience and when you go to another culture what kind of tourists are you going to be are you going to bring your culture their stuff in your fanny pack and kind of impose it on everyone else are you going to try to just kind of experience this is a one-liner the Hebrew Bible scholar helpful work on helping people understand Genesis wanted to his name is John Walton he introduces the whole discussion about Jensen wanted to with the fact that nobody disagrees with but that most everyone ignores wants to actually start talking
 fact that the Bible is an ancient text
use the word ancient a lot and what do you mean by ancient
 well there's something that sold this might be totally subjective when I think of something that's old I tend to think of a couple Generations you generation ancient I think of like I would hardly I would hardly recognize the world if I were to be transported there totally other often times it's just a pose with just tutor modern This Modern and then isn't yet but that's a big category and then sometimes people use it in a derogatory way but I found that it's more more being used in a way that has respect and Webster online dictionary really into a remote. Of time early in recorded history really recorded history historical period beginning with the earliest known civilizations of Mesopotamia extending through the fall of the Roman Empire that's what I was thinking that would be kind of cut off is Roman Empire that's right that's how I use it and then I think before that I think prehistoric
 more humans developed writing and yeah please don't know another term Antiquity to describe from the beginning of the Roman Empire to like the Dark Ages into the medieval.. Begin somewhere in like the 878 is hundreds up until the Renaissance history to the Bible is an ancient texts I'm going off your point of being a considerate tourist you're so when you fly in a plane you're going not to an ancient time but you are going to another cultural yes when we opening the pages of the Bible we are doing both we're going to another culture in another period of History getting it a time machine so one easy way of some debate and why are there so many different views its results from people not treating Genesis wanted to as ancient text it comes from a desire to read an ancient text
 as if it's language is addressing our modern ideas and categories for talking about cosmology now it should have some sort of implication for modernist yeah that's right but an ancient text can communicate things that address a modern audience but that's very different than reading an ancient texts as if it was written as a water. Yeah in the Modern Age so why is it significant to the Bible's an ancient text and that we should read it like one and it's a simple fact about communication and language for the vowel words don't mean anything people mean things and buy me and I mean people in 10 things and words are vehicle a small vehicle often times did you got your body language and facial expressions yeah yeah where is there one part tone of voice sometimes your words can be a very small piece of that pie that's right so people intend to things through their words and
 words have the meanings that they do within a particular language yes which is an abstract mental simple set of these syllables arranged in the patterns that you and I agree on mean certain things we want to read the Bible but we're talking about communication. I love it so the syllables we arranged together into certain patterns yeah we agree that they mean what they mean both cuz we share a language in the second we share a historical context a cultural context where those syllables Matt's realities that we assign meaning to in our world so their words and phrases mean what they mean and why does the cultures and the people that get them so this whole series is born out of honoring that basic fact about Human Condition
who's John Walton this is actually not on Genesis 1 and 2 it's called ancient near Eastern thought and the Old Testament he says effective communication requires a body of agreed-upon words terms and ideas a common ground of understanding for the speaker this often requires a combination to the Audience by using words and ideas though I understand that we do this what how you say something based on who you're saying it too for the audience is they are not native to The Language and Cultural Matrix of the speaker this means reaching Common Ground may require will be seeking out additional information or explanation in other words the audience has to adapt to a new and unfamiliar culture there one way you can prove what you saying there is you can't read the Bible without having like a study Bible in a way ya do you think that goes that far that you can't just hear his Genesis one through three and less they are an ancient Vedic speaker
 around the Bible is a book that you have to study you have to stay out of this but yeah it's designed to be studded not simply red right from the very beginning whatever it means for the framers of the Hebrew Bible in someone or Joshua one to say that it's something you have to recite quietly to yourself repeatedly every day for the rest of your life good definition of study undergrad there was this debate do you have to have something outside the Bible to interpret the yes I did yes I do remember that and I think on one level if all you had was the Hebrew Bible and the Greek New Testament and you can make it work you can make it work totally there are challenges without approach with English Bible because in any Translation your reading competition but yeah I think you just give someone at any time. In history a Hebrew Bible and the dictionary ancient Hebrew dictionary and they just taught themselves the language and started on pick up line
 yeah they figure out a lot so what we're talking about is weed in a language system at the least we're crossing into ancient Hebrew culture but we find was it the ancient Hebrews didn't exist in a vacuum the language is the Semitic language so Hebrew belongs to all family of languages throughout the nearest and they belong to a whole Matrix of ancient near Eastern cultures that all shared a lot in common and how they saw the world they also differ dramatically and important West that's the second one first one is words for me like movie references are easy ones certain phrases I have here like beam me up Scotty you have to know you have to know Star Trek but whatever think of any movie lines there's a very small window of time in American culture where you can understand the intention of the phrase beam me up Scotty do otherwise you'd have to do some homework and then there's other phrases that lose their original like beam me up Scotty
 body doesn't lie happened with that necessarily but I imagine another generation people are using it has meaning like let me come over let me come over yeah they become dead metaphors happens a lot in fact someone pointed this out actually just today on Twitter that we were talking about Nimrod cuz nimrods that character in The Bible means Rebel meets Rebel but in English it means idiot yes if your name Rodger an idiot you know where it came from from Bugs Bunny really yeah Bugs Bunny would call Elmer Fudd a nimrod he was a hunter hunter hunter hunter you call Nimrod but you'd always say it in this like the meaning what it became his cultural reference of calling someone a nimrod met more like you idiot. Are you serious this is a great example. We're talking about animals Slayer and Genesis
 ruling the animals in peace there can kill the animals cuz he was a violent now this is the whole thing with you and so in Genesis 10 you need an animal flyer and he's his name is Rebel and he found the civilization of Babylon right and it's impossible to read that name in English and not think idiot when it means like rebellious animal Slayer discuss is from. And line. Net I don't know what this is Bugs Bunny the secret origin of one of Bugs Bunny's best insult the cultural icon Bugs Bunny redefined the meaning of the word Nimrod and no one even knew he was doing it was a picture of Bugs Bunny putting his finger in Elmer fudd's rifle so he constantly outwits and insults Elmer Fudd one of his favorite put Downs is calling the hapless Hunter a nimrod which as we all know means idiot except until Bugs Bunny came along the way
 did not mean that yet what a trip because Bugs Bunny is popularity of the use of nimrod became overtime the predominant meaning of that word yeah so much so the few people today even though that's the biblical character it's a prime example of Life imitating art the word means something in its cultural context rebellious actually adopted by the writers of Bugs Bunny I think it would because Elmer Fudd the Hunter he is a stupid Hunter so calling him Nimrod is almost an inversion is sarcasm and Bugs Bunny is a sarcastic and you're supposed to be able to kill me but I keep beating you. I'm really happy to know about that that's a great example of where I am now the meaning of the word is completely disconnected from its original cultural context you
 Bible that's it it seems like a basic point that shouldn't need to be made but I find that is keep talking about Jenna's wanted to keep having to make the point over and over again please I'm in a lot of contacting you so the meaning of Earth in Genesis one is not Globe right it means the land of the meaning of the firmament or the expanse up there the rock yeah yeah yeah the word recchia means a smooth surface and so the meaning of words then gets tied into ancient conceptions of the cosmos and how structured and Inseparable and I think a lot of the missteps in our debates about these chapters come when we try and give these ancient Hebrew words Modern English meanings
 theragun
 s starting point is if it's Nation text in the words mean what they mean ancient cosmology she's so ancient narratives about the origins and nature and architecture of the cosmos is a mouthful and buy cosmology mean cosmas and Logan has caused my understanding your account and account about the cosmos of the universe that's right or the entirety of space-time Cosmos is a Greek word from the Greek verb cosmetic cosmetic to order to talk about the ordered it snow globe that were in the Big Show in the accounts of the cosmos so just like words have their meanings with might of their ancient culture any cultures cosmology means what it means and why.
 an ancient cultural setting in cosmology today's changing so rapidly changing BS now by the year and we are an interesting transition. I think we're much of our language about the universe is still embedded in a completely outdated cosmology when we talked about laws universal laws or when we use metaphors of the universe as a machine from my minimal understanding of quantum physics this molecule is this Cog this molecule is that gear put them together and what time so way more complicated so yeah this all came from trying to build quantum computers and in a quantum computer you don't have like a binary like it's on or so you have a typical a cubit and a cubit instead of a b being on her off a cubit is a potential of many states in the way that in quantum theory work so then you add to Cuba
 together and now you got this exponential set of potential States and because of that quantum computers are just so powerful and how they could process information on one of the problems with peers as I understand it is that the quantum world is so sensitive when it becomes physical that you get all these bugs really quick and boy like you but stop working correctly and so what they're trying to do now and Quantum Computing is there trying to figure out how to smooth out these bugs how do we I can't remember the word they're using but how do we basically create the safeguards so that the cubits don't bug out and so they're writing all this code and different stuff to do and what they found was the code that's working the best has a strange association with gravity and space and time and so there's these theorist going maybe we all space-time and gravity is is a smoothing out of the quantum world so that we can Skype live in it and whatever the universe is it's not him
 it's not a machine it isn't no it doesn't work like the engine of a car but that is the cultural environment in which most of our English words about the universe came into existence but it's the same way in every single culture every culture's account of the cosmos was in flux and those cultural context determine the meaning of words about the cosmos so another Hebrew Bible scholar who has written a really helpful book on the south side of issues getting William Brown he puts it this way he says the framers of Creation in the Bible inherited a treasure Trove of venerable Traditions from their cultural neighbors instead of creating their accounts ex nihilo that I do nothing develop their traditions in dialogue with the great religious traditions of the surrounding cultures particularly those originating from Mesopotamia and Egypt as well as of the more immediate Canaanite neighbors what he's not saying is
 father's just borrowed just like I don't borrow the concept of Atom from anybody when I use the word atom or atom a t o m p t o f m it's my environment give me the world is composed of atoms and actually my understanding based on my cultural contacts yet in the cosmology of my culture and so I'm not borrowing Adam from The somebody it just the fixed feature of my imagination the building blocks of your that's right understanding of the biblical authors by the spirit to talk about the cosmos with the language and categories of their cultural context your house mology available to them how could it be otherwise and what we going to see is that in Mesopotamia ancient Babylon and Sumeria and an ancient Egypt there were like 6th tradition ways of understanding how the cost must works that involve the waters
 emerging out of the waters things being separated from each other the gods speaking for the gods acting and Jen has one is at home in that cultural environment and we are not we are not and so ancient cosmology is don't provide an account of the cosmos that's primarily concerned with the physical material processes by which what we call matter came to be into physical existence of physical existence and then became life correct and became more sophisticated life or any of that stuff modern develop contacts with the history and the way that in Ancient Memories they accounted for the cosmos was a completely different lately different and so there you go it's just wanted to or written in Hebrew for visiting another language and culture Genesis wanted to or ancient Hebrew cosmologists which means we have to become familiar if we really want to understand this thing in full.
 You want to appreciate both the Hebrew words and their cultural context and the ancient cosmology is so not only how do you use your words what are your words mean to you but what kind of mental constructs do you have about the nature of the world that these words are being used within their related words in cultural context cosmology is are what they are in the cultural context
 is there another like more normal word to use in cosmology then the word cosmology is and so it's a fresh word that you can give meaning to ya as we have the conversation yeah it's your what would you describe as your cosmology just to kind of give a framework for someone still a loss I was leaving by cosmology modern person's cosmology the universe we live in an expanding Universe growing material objects which is both matter in some kind of dark matter if we don't fully understand but that is necessary to account for the existence of matter matter is composed of exponentially decreasing building blocks right molecules and atoms and then protons and neutrons and then whatever Quantum states are the determined the behavior of those protons and neutrons
 the space-time Continuum we call them laws but there's some kind of constraints you know what is CS would call design features are constraints that make possible the emergence of conscious life one way to spend another to say is conscious life isn't epiphenomenon person would say there may be someone who just you know doesn't care about that stuff just a really simple fly but even between the two there's like some common ground we use the phrase flying space rocket lot where on the globe Circle in the sun in the solar system solar system you look up you see the sun you realize even my seven-year-old realize that thing is far away and it's not moving we're the ones moving and we're moving around it and the moon moves around us and all the stars in
 Sky our sons very far away most of them some of our planets in our solar system and then we'll gets really kind of mind-blowing is you probably seen those videos where you can like keep going then you realize like oh our solar system is in a neighborhood of solar system that are in the galaxy The Milky Way galaxy which is if you see that stripe of intent stars as kind of a Milky Way called the Milky Way galaxy is flat and beyond that and there's tons of those were just one floating around with a bunch and that's the universe and it's actually expanding in the moon like the edges of its growing like a mole Moon that got a little geeky that's all right but that's not expanding the larger thing and which the Milky Way exists the Milky Way is one of many floating around in this thing we had that that's kind of a
 Ron flying space Rock orbiting with a bunch of other flying space rocks around a big exploding class of all we get a bit of arrogance in that we would look back in an ancient cosmology look at these idiots and I bet you when our children have children will look back at our understanding you how primitive so this is the difference between maybe knowledge and wisdom well in ancient contacts their knowledge about the material construction of the universe may have been different their wisdom and intuition and conclusions about the nature and operating realities and significance of the cosmos I think is actually likely to have been way more profound than anything in the modern era that's my humble opinion so this whole conversation cosmology is helpful because if I were to make an account of the meaning of the universe I would be borrowing
 from the cosmology that I have and I wouldn't do it as a technique yeah I would just do it because that's my cosmology so just how I understand you were born into it a classic Jewish Christian confession about the inspiration of the scriptures is a God chose as the vehicle to speak to his people ancient Israelite authors and to address his people through that cultures cosmology and they're so let's honor that and dive in
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're diving in deeper we're going to start looking at the ancient cosmology is of Israel's neighbors and as we do these stories in Genesis 12 and three are going to come to life in a new way another helpful way to do this and to help Place Genesis 1 and 2 on the map of ancient cosmology is to learn something about the cosmology is of Israel's neighbors I want to introduce people to Quick survey of ancient Egyptian cosmology a quick survey of ancient Babylonian cosmology and then see how Genesis one is participating in a dialogue with those cosmologists today's episode was produced by Dan demel and Zac mckinlay are show notes by Lyndsay Ponder and our theme music from the band pets Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to help us all experience the Bible as unified story that leads to Jesus do we have this podcast
 you got videos who got free online Seminary classes and we got a lot more in the works it's all free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you who are pitching in to thank you so much for being a part of this with us hi this is Grace from Seven valleys Pennsylvania and I first heard about the Bible project when I first became a Christian in the early years of my college experience when I was trying to understand how to better study the Bible and I use the Bible project now for just that how to better study the Bible how to better unpack the Deep literary designs throughout it all and how it applies to to my life even now like everything about the Bible project is that it takes a very complex and an intricate ideas and themes throughout the Bible with makes it in a very digestible manner that just he's has your your curiosity just to dig and unpacked and learn
 more about the character of God in and how he outlined the scriptures we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus for a crowdfunding project by people like me are free videos study notes podcast classes and more at bible project. Com
