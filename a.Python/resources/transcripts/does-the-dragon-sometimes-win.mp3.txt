in the story of the Bible the sea dragon is a reoccurring symbol representing chaos death and destruction and the power of the Dragon takes on many different forms it's the snake in the garden tempting humans to choose their own demise it's that voice inside of your head telling you you can win if you kill your brother the sea dragon is a problem but the good news is that Yahweh is a dragon slayer and he wants to give humans power over the dragon to except sometimes it just seems like the dragon winds and the Sea Dragon gets the best of us but welcome to the story of joke what happens when the cast Dragon strikes our life for Joe that takes the lightning strike in the form of Bandits and Raiders to come steal and kill and destroy and then of a huge storm that knocked a house over that his kids are in the nail. How is the image of
 supposed to process that explores what happens when a righteous person someone who should be experiencing God Eden blessing gets their life co-opted by the dragon in the story of Jobe God allows the accuser to do just that the accuser the opposer says. But how about this send out your hand to touch everything he has surely he'll curse you and the Lord said okay let's test the faithfulness of my servant for Joe for us these moments when we lost everything when God is seemingly far away it brings us face-to-face with some really important questions do God's people love and fear Him for God's Own sake as an end in himself or is God a means to some other end will any human enter into and maintain a relationship with God when the only think the game is God himself
 today Tim Mackie and I talked about the sea monster in the story of Jobe I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey Sam hey John I have we are moving kind of slow through a theme in the Bible we've been framing as a theme of the dragon and we covered a lot of ground to cover the dragon appears so much in the Bible okay we've been teasing out this theme in terms of why does it matter what does it mean with the theme about chaos what does it mean to confront chaos and the dragon is a symbol symbol for the opposite of creation creation is God bringing order to the borderless possibilities of potential existence but the tesno former energy to make it be in go anywhere and do anything so creation is the bringing of order to Nan order
 and that Nan order is depicted as a chaotic ocean in Genesis one with the dragon in it yeah and in ancient imagination the dragon is the embodiment of the chaotic ocean and it is the force of chaos itself that wants to drag creation back into disorder and so when we meet the dragon in the Bible we are interfacing with that set of ideas that's right and when we get to Genesis chapter 1. Orders creation and he separates the land from the Raging Sea the abbess we learn that they're in the ocean is the taunting and God put it in its place it wasn't a battle it was just creative word put him in his place but then we read some Psalms the last discussion about when God ordered creation and it described as a
 and it's the idea of God being Victorious over disorder and chaos and so now we're going to move into a squirrel call Joe 12 to the biblical story though is that God plants within Creation in Outpost of garden order in the ideal and he installs Heavenly and Earthly rulers as his Partners in the creation project to continue to subdue spreads and fills all creation
 but through the agency in decisions and wisdom and rulership of the creatures themselves trust in God's wisdom here but when they choose to do what's good in their own eyes they end up on doing God's good order and so become agents of that Dragon chaos and so then both Heavenly rulers in Rebellion against God and Earthly human rulers in Rebellion against God can be described with the symbolism of the Dragon so that's kind of the big framework will ever done right and that makes it complicated that one in the Bible talk about the dragon what's the talking about is it talking about simply that there's disorder in the world that God wants to order and wants us to partake with him and then ordering or is it talking about the rebellion of God's image Bears working to create violence and Disorder so is it talking merely a
 out the creatures in the sea and the Wilderness and expanding the Garden or is it talking about like Babylon coming to destroy us and I guess I'm wondering in the case of Joe because we're going to meet the dragon here and Jobe is a story about a man who suffers greatly and wants to know what's going on why am I suffering so he's experiencing chaos in his life yes okay look of Jobe is going to be an exploration about what it looks like to live is one of those human image of God rulers on the land and then when as a human ruler you've been living by God's word and wisdom right in the fear of the Lord
 and in theory if you do that it should just be Garden of Eatin for you just you're just working work in the garden with God but then what happens if you live in a creation that's on its way to the full Garden ideal but they're still Wilderness out there and Notions with dragons and dangerous things what happens when the cast Dragon strikes our life in the form of a picture of a text that lightning strike in the form of Bandits and Raiders who come steal and kill and destroy and then of a huge storm knocks a house over that his kids are in and they all died what's that about how is the image of God supposed to process that and so that's what happens to job but that's not just what the stories about what we are given is a picture of what's Happening up in the Divine Council in this guy's between God and some of the house that heaven so this is
 works one day 1:6 the sons of Elohim beings were standing before the Lord and the opposing the one opposed also came with them
 it's Diva word the satin translate is a proper name in all of our English translation switch is
 I guess fine but it doesn't help us really understand what's going on. Yeah yeah it's not a proper name you don't put the word the on beginning of a proper name yeah I tried looking it say Satan was there yeah the one that's the time that I've said one of the Spiritual Beings that as we can see is trying to undermine confidence in God's maintenance of cosmic order and so what God says to sit on it is hey you know check out Jobe this guy is awesome no one like him on the way and blameless upright fears God turns Away From Evil legit and then visit on a squill does jobes hear you and obey your
 I hear wisdom in the word for no reason come on you protect this guy and you bless all that he does and now he's wealthy so so she's going to be exactly yeah yeah but then the accuser the opposer says. But how about the send out your hand to touch everything he has surely he'll curse you
 and the Lord said get behind me Satan
 that's what we wish you would have said let's test the faithfulness of my servant and he's in your power just don't put your hand on him and stuff and so this is when the cycle of terrible things begins to happen so really this sets up the book is exploring both the principles of order by which God governs the cosmos that's what the satanis questioning but then also by focusing mostly on jobin is internal emotional Journey it's going to focus on this question of so if God is going to partner with humans
 and bless them but in the stage of creation that's before the garden idea was everywhere that's going to bring moments of Challenge and trust and so do God's people love and fear Him to hear I mean use the words of a scholar Eric Portland excellent book on Joe called piercing Leviathan I ran out long ago. He puts a question that's what he said the conversation between God and the setan focus on this do God's people love and fear Him for God's Own sake for God as the goal as an end in himself or is God a means to some other end
 will any human enter into and maintain a relationship with God when the only thing to gain is God himself or God's blessings for the mean the game God himself would mean to see God and talk and relate with God and intimate Union I think that's what it would mean if blessings are manifestations of God's generosity and goodness then you can receive them as a gift but would it be great to just like have intimate Union in connection with the giver like that would be the ultimate so what am I after the gifts or The Giver think that Sarah Cortland with putting the the question that that's the who certainly but the Titans trying to raise the issue here to humans
 want to work with you serve you and do you want to work with them for what reason would they want to work like the whole thing. So this opening scene doesn't there's so many questions it introduces but does not answer it's like will okay this is how God normally makes decisions about how to work with people who doesn't seem that way job's clearly an exemplary kind of person yeah he doesn't seem like a realistic person in the first place as the innocent suffering servant of God who suffers for no wrong that he has done and then brings all of his pain and suffering to God seeking to just connect with God intimately to understand why
 then finding deliverance from his suffering and then he goes on to intercede for his friends so that God's mercy will be shown to his friends who are from other nations groups two and then he's restored to New Life at the other end I'm just right there and you like cash that sounds like the story of Jesus and I think that's the function of Revival is for sure one of the books that Jesus did a Bible study vest at the end of Luke of the scriptures about how the Messiah would suffer and then be Vindicated on device so that forgiveness could go out to the nation's to bold statement that's for sure where they went Jobe oh I absolutely absolutely like it was late at night you know maybe only Simon was awake anyway so that's the portrait what I want to focus on is the dragon comes up Joe mentions the dragon-slaying Miss many times
 and then God brings up the dragon like in a big way at the end and I'm just interested to see where this conversation is going to go
so in his first speech after he suffers he opens his mouth and Chapter 3 of Jobe and he curses the day that he was born this is such an amazing Pawn it's like an anti Birthday song but song in the key of Genesis 1 turned upside down so he works through the different aspects of Creation in Genesis one but asking for the reversal and you can see it even in the first line let the day perish on which I was born and the night that said a man child is conceived that day let there be Darkness Let There Be darkness of day one when God said let there be light it's the same phrase just let there be Darkness so clever
 what you saying is if you conceive of job's Life as a little Cosmos let that be all been done may God not secret from above nor made a light shine upon it let darkness and deep Shadow claim it but the clouds settle upon it
 47 left that night become Barren let a joyful song not enter into it so may not be able to produce any life and anything that would even bring joy like the birth of new life may not even enter into it first aid let those who curse the day curse it those who are skilled at rousing Leviathan but those who curse the day course it yeah this is the days born the day he was born yeah so he's saying I want other people I'm cursing the day yeah now other people, Chris the day with me especially people who are really good at Conjuring up the chaos Dragon browsing the rousing so-and-so and cursing so he's referring to his really fast so this is going to be nerdy in I forget what
 these were found somewhere in the 20th century that the archaeological site of natur which is the ancient Babylon there were found loads of these things are called the Aramaic incantation bowls so they are balls that were shaped and written on by Israelites I'm living in Babylon for the legacy of the Exile in Babylon men who stayed in Exile and did never go back they built communities and live there for centuries many centuries and so there's all of these balls
 with Aramaic written in the balls and then when scholar start studying these it's like magic spells or blessing spells and incantations what is the whole life and makes the language from where well Aramaic language spoken by the tribes tribes up north and what today we call Syria and then it became the language of the global and then the Persian Empire and it became a global language for time it was the first multinational Imperial language under the Persian Empire and then Greek took over after that so Jewish communities in Babylon spoke Aramaic incantation false is all kinds of fascinating stuff but there is one of them
 that reads as follows I enchant you with the conjuring of Yum-Yum is Canaanite deity it's also the Hebrew word for the sea
 so I enchant you with the conjuring of yam and with the spell of Leviathan The Sea Dragon so this is Somebody pronouncing a curse on somebody else
 and Conjuring up the powers of the Sea and the sea dragon against somebody that they're going to curse OK Google way to make someone's day really bad yeah play the Sea Dragon find you today that's a great way to insult someone dragonfly jug is referring to his practice people who are skilled at rousing up the chaos powers of the sea dragon and unleashing them on a person I just want someone to do this to him and he says I wish somebody who was really good at Conjuring up Leviathan would have Unleashed it on my birthday I said I would have never been more so he's wishing the undoing of his Cosmos
 by means of Darkness instead of light and by means of the Sea Dragon so it's it's both very creative in terms of literary and hyperlinks but the emotions that is expressed anger. So Raw it's so deep why is suffering like this is a part of what it means to live in this world on the way out of chaos into the garden ideal but man if this is the price what it means to be on that Journey out of chaos to the Garden I'd rather not so it feels right now that's a rather not do it I wish my existence would have never happened so dark place and is very honest very honest
 so I need to just get the pause and say this type of honest response it's not the only thing job says that's not the last thing he says but it is part of what he says and this is in the Bible coming from the mouth of someone who's presented as a model of what it means to suffer
Job chapter 7 he is complaining to God and he makes a comparison between himself and the dragon tooth interesting he says verse 11 I will not keep silent I'm going to speak out of the anguish at my spirit I'm going to complain in the bitterness of my soul you can talk to God right here it says listen to am I am am I the sea am I the sea monster of the deep that you have put me under guard and could clearly than the setup of the story is no she is right he's not doing that right while almost all of us do that constantly hear the guy that's not doing anybody even yeah yep that's exactly right so am I your Cosmic enemy I thought I was an image sparing partner of yours that work with so that's kind of a clever
 first mentioned the dragon is the cosmic enemy that he wished would have consumed the day of his boring now he's just saying listen to visit me
 okay this one in chapter 9 is wild he's lamenting at this point he's talking to his friends and getting exasperated with them and he's complaining that even if you could get in front of God and plead his case and say listen God you know I'm innocent he's afraid that God so overwhelming in power and might and splendour that the moment he saw God he would just forget everything he's with wanted to say sorry for some context Joe and his suffering is visited by some friends and the friends are these people from all these other nations and they are trying to tell Joe but look your suffering for a reason It's gotta be a reason you did something wrong and so and Jobe is just like no I know I haven't yeah and we know as the breeder that he had already that he has it that's exactly right and now he's here going but Eva
 if I could talk to God to tell him that I'm innocent how would I go even if somebody wanted to dispute with him they could not answer him not one time out of 1,000 because his wisdom is profound his power is vast who can resist him and come out unarmed he moves mountains without their knowing it you over turns them in his anger he shakes the Earth from its place he makes its pillars tremble I mean he can just speak to the sun and it won't shine and you can steal off the light of the Stars
 he's the only one who stretched out the skies he Treads Stomps on the waves of yum
 he is the maker of there and Orion and Pleiades the constellations of the South so he's the Tramp Allure of the chaos C okay so this is a little even though it doesn't mention the dragon stomping on the ways of the sea is one of the most piece from the dragon-slaying meth or was it in the sea is Young and y'all is it is it is it the what language is it from Voorhees the Sea Dragon is that from from Tire well yeah in the the bail epic the bail at the which is the Phoenician Canaanite version of the dragon-slaying nephew Bale the storm God face is off to enemies and it's hard to tell if they're the same enemy or if they're like a Duo it one is called the yam is the semantic word for C&C just like it isn't Hebrew the load 10 Mi of time which is leviathan treading on your toes too
 cast monster
 and he's the maker of the rulers the best form of these constellations one of them of the Wilderness monster the bear we just mentioned his victory over cat he's Creator and decreator if he wants to and he can just walk on top of the chaos Waters he's just not a threat to him and when you talk about him walking on the waters it's often to go do the battle so he says when he passes Me by where I can't see him
 when he walks by I don't even see him if he chooses to snatch away who could stop him who can say to God hey what are you doing he doesn't restrain his anger or even the allies of Rahab the Raging Dragon even they cower At His Feet how can I dispute with him how can I find words so when he's mentioning God walking on the ways and then he mentioned that the end to go and leashes anger on the Raging Dragon the Rahab and even the enemies minions with the dragon they all cower
 but look at this line in the middle but when he's on his March to the images of God like a night marching on the water on the waters to go fight the dragon he's going to slay the dragon here but when he passes Me by he doesn't even stop like where is it so this was an inside that I got from Andrew Angel his excellent book on the Dragon theme in the Bible called playing with dragons
 all the trees has 10 races excellent choices Jobe follows the story by the Simmons the traditional dragon-slaying story he follows the story part way but then suddenly moves in a strange and Direction the normal signs of the trembling Arthur mentioned the disturbances in the skies job speaks of God's conquest of the see the work of creation after that conquest and God continues in the march to terrify the Demonic band of helpers who accompany the monster rahav
 however here Joe plays with the traditional script so is retailing the march of the storm God and praise God for his glorious work of defeating chaos you shows God carrying on with the Warriors March and just passing Joe by
 nobody dares to even ask the question why
 job uses the traditional language of the Divine Warrior to say that God is too powerful and busy to bother to reorder the world of an insignificant righteous man like himself
 so normally what would you expect as God comes treading on the way is Concord the dragon and restores Order yeah so by Conquering the dragon and reordering creation I get to benefit the feast is saying actually no I'm just to be left in the dust her off somewhere else but it's not hard for me but when he came to me he just kept on walking he has the power to conquer over chaos and he's not doing it for me not in my neighborhood on the March has left me behind yeah I think of an author
 but that is creative turn the literary creativity but the personal honesty and the theological like sophistication to think about yep sure I know God that's good for everybody loves him and great for everybody else that happens to but it sure hasn't happened to me what am I supposed to do that has really powerful and who doesn't know that I feel like
 let's just look at one more this isn't from chapter 26 so similar to that previous one he is going to starting a five talk about how all of creation is in awe of the creative power of God and of his might and his majesty and he's going to use creation imagery to talk about it is going to talk about how in 46 the grave even the grave is naked before him there's no covering in death he stretches out the north over emptiness he hangs the Earth over nothing he ties up the water and clouds and the cloud is not torn open beneath the covers the face of the Moon he spreads his Cloud over it he describes a circle on the face of the water between light and darkness
 what is happening what are you saying is even the most empty what you think are lifeless uninhabitable Realms of creation are all accessible and open before him so the grave death the farthest extent so if you look over the ocean as far as it goes there's a line where the sky meets the water what's that line right what's up there and what if you push into that line what's there and God's the one who inscribed the line between light and darkness he's the one who made that line it's fully available to him so by his power verse 12 he's still the Sea by his understanding he struck down rajas the raging one the dragon by his breath the heavens were made clear his hand pierced the fleeing snake
 these are just the outer edges of his ways this is just like the periphery with this language of the outer edges he's kind of play Krishna vitreous like what happens on the ryzen so whether it's creating the realm of order by drawing the horizon line that's like surrounds us or by defeating the sea dragon that is the Rival of creation these are the outer edges of his ways but you know what how faint is the word that we ever hear about him okay I can like he's out doing this but in somewhere else he's left me behind exactly right that's the basic idea I wish you would do some of that dragon slaying in mine - doing that at the Horizon here I am but I've been left behind so where'd you end up going is he becomes convinced
 let God must be a moral monster that's the only conclusion I can come to the God is unjust or 12 and 16 so he just says there's no resolution here except that if I could just talk with God face to face and he kind of stopped talking to the friends and you just his speech has turned into prayer and eventually he gets his wish God comes and delivers to speeches to him and Joe gets two responses and the two speeches, this is whole universe is could be many many hours of conversation and probably should be the first speech begins with God first God answer job out of the world went out of the storm has already echoing the dragon-slaying story by he appears in the storm as the storm God
 but Jobe never disputed that God has the power of the storm God so he is really starting with Jobe and says who is this who darkens counsel with ignorant words to call me amoral monster yep gird up your loins that is tuck your shirt in your belt and get ready for action like a man I'm going to ask you some questions and how about you teach me some knowledge
 where were you when I laid the foundations of the land the first line of a long poem about and it's all about the ordering of the cosmos and all the questions the question whether or not assistance in other words they're not you were not there when I laid the foundations you were not around when I ordered the land the questions it's as if God's inviting Joe do you really think about the fact that he wasn't there as it's inviting Joe to come to his own conclusions and then. Goes on a long speech to talk about how is intimately involved with all of these wild animals of like Mountain donkeys and lions and Eagles and ostriches and their eating habits and their reproductive habits and where they sleep and it has all the stuff and he's just like do you know where the donkey likes to hang out and get wild
 cuz he's been accusing God of you might maintain order everywhere else but certainly not in my neck of the woods and desist you've completely forgotten and God's responses now I'm intimately aware of every square millimeter thing I care about where the donkey eats of course I care about you is that the idea of course I know about and if we're okay like your situation is not unknown to Massey I haven't passed you by I haven't asked you why you're not in my periphery I may seem like I'm in your periphery you're not the first is about God's creation and maintenance of cosmic order
 judge accuse God of cosmic mismanagement and the questions get him to say like okay I've kind of overstep my bounds the animals are about God's intimate care and knowledge for every creature in square inch application including job
 so dubs response to that first speech is a spotless he says and check 40 look I am insignificant what can I reply I put my hand over my mouth I spoke one time two times even but I won't say anymore she's like yeah you got me why does God need to give a second speech that is a good question cuz this this should end it retracts his accusations against God and recognizes like I'm nothing
 I should have said any of this I'm sorry but she doesn't say I'm sorry what he says is I'm in significant I shouldn't have spoke I'm not going to say anymore so question what is God after what's he looking for from job that he feels like he needs to give a second that interesting way to ask again those are cortland's is God speaks to X speaks two times so what is Jobe second response to do that he doesn't do in this response and what is God s speech do that he did not he do in the first Beach okay
second speech comes in three parts of course and the second speech begins with a question like this lesson do you have an arm like God can use Thunder with a voice like his
 I wonder if you could close yourself with Divine dignity and Majesty pour out your anger and everybody who's arrogant just bring them down to the dust I'm kind of a phrase like a job everybody who's proud and arrogant just tread down the wicked where they stand and hide them in the dust
 you could do that I will confess to you that your own right hand can save you so this is all about arm of God and how God Treads and his arm brings Justice on his enemy's language of the dragon slaying story is it God's arm and then God treading stomping on and then reducing to death these are the things the storm God does but here it's too human dragons as we're human enemies the proud so if you could implication is if you can do what I do then I'd be glad to recognize that fact so what God doesn't say is listen actually do bring Cosmic Justice and I do it everyday I do it all the time in different ways
 what he asks is can you bring about the cosmic Justice that I do so it's a backwards way sure to be able to do the cosmic Justice he just complaining that God not doing it that's right for him for him and then he comes to the deduction multiple times that he must not do it at all to God like why don't you do it go ahead show me how it's done yeah that's kind of it away just before those that that's right so what is God looking for hear you really want a job to know not just does he hold Cosmic order he doesn't stop because he is aware of every square inch of creation I really do bring Cosmic Justice
 regularly and you're not able to subdue us just get that clear and then the next two speeches are here we got one is about Behemoth and the other ones about Leviathan long speeches yes about these two Creed is not too long about 10 vs Leviathan is super long yeah that's right so Behemoth is not the name of the species in Biblical Hebrew it's the word Bahama was just usually refers to cows are cattle that can refer to this large land creatures is the plural but it's referring to a singular Beast cows in Hebrew you can make a noun into a plural and not always mean many of those things it can be like a heightener intensified version of one thing so yeah some.
 superbeast superbeast super field beast and I'll recommend a book long history of people trying to tie these two creatures down to hippos are wild aurochs or crocodiles sir something like that but you have to shoehorn in some ways because the Behemoth also has tailed like a cedar tree no hippo whereas Cosmic huge giant multiforme like oxen Lions you know are very much a part of the ancient Eastern imagination in artwork so many people have made the case that these are
 we're taking the dragon and now we're bifurcating the dragon into to Al and version and then see version version though it's the it's the snake yes that's right and this would be yet another land version but what we're doing is we're taking like the lion the bear The Oxen and we're just merging them together superbeast yeah so the key is verse 19 where God says he is the the race sheet the beginning of the ways of Elohim Rashid can also refer to the first fruits or the 1st in rank like when it comes to land beasts this creature like wins every contest let his maker bring near his sword who actually hear let this is one way to translate it
 and IV reads yet its maker can approach it with his sword so God is the one who made it and it's even Chief among all the creatures of the ground and God's eyes regard to take it to God is the one who can come out with a sword so this is implicit of a Divine combat with the monster but only God is the one so what God is going to do is mostly describe how powerful it is and that description just reinforces the fact that if there is anybody who can take this thing out it's only God
 and that basic idea is the same thing at play in the Leviathan speech to super long
 what it begins is all these questions about who was able to pull in Leviathan with a fishhook who can lie tied its tongue down with a rope or a joke can you put a cord through its nose and Pierce its job with a hook it's going to beg you for mercy and speak all nice to you implicit here is God's claim to be the one who can. It's the one and in fact these descriptions of hooking it in the jaw dragging it up and tying it down this is what God says he will do to the dragon in Isaiah and in Ezekiel so I think what's interesting here is God is describing a man goes on a long speech to describe how destructive and powerful than Invincible this Beast does
 and it begins with just the implication that God is the only one who can slay it he doesn't promise to slay it what he just says I'm the only one that can slay it you and you definitely not Joe and job's response after that is to say you're right I'm sorry in 46 he repents he says that he's sorry and he feels really bad for what he said and then that's the moment where we transition into the end and jove is restored from his suffering
 and that's look at your house so the implicit Claim about Leviathan in job is that God has power of the dragon and that he's the only one who's able to pierce the dragon but that's not the main event of these final speeches here instead where God is focusing on is that at this point than the storage of this creature is a part of what it means to exist in a world that is not yet the Garden of Eden the cosmic Garden of Eden and it's not evil it's just there and it could devour you and its existence doesn't mean that I am unjust and the fact that it could bite you and destroy you doesn't mean that I am unjust
 you're just going to have to trust me that I'm the only one who can defeat it
 the book of Jobe never says what any of us quite wanted to say we wanted to say I'll kill the dragon job there was some purpose for which you suffered that will be revealed to you one day I mean never hears any of he never learns about the conversation with the Accuser
 so you the reader we know that there's some test this is a test of God's righteous servant whether he will suffer and Trust
 any passes the test by recognizing what by recognizing that he shouldn't have accused God of mismanagement accuse God of being a more monster he should have trusted that there was some reason even if it was beyond his reason but the book even the author of Joe doesn't give us what the reason is like the conversations with this the time at the beginning don't tell you what the reason was just tell you the god
 decided it was okay to test job well the reason was to see if Joe was in it for relationship with God or for the blessing and the fact that jokes about his speeches eventually just ends up talking to God he just pursues God in a way and even in his frustration with God it drove him closer to God I see and it proves that he was actually in it for God forgot cuz it his last request is if I could just see God and talk to him okay hold on
 Hakeem is really so you're saying that what it looks like Joe is doing is he's wallowing in his anguish and then he starts accusing God
 Miss managing the cosmos and you just feel like, man I wish you could have just been more like you know what I'm going to trust God and there's a reason for my suffering like Jesus yeah like Jesus like a confidence and trust and so you almost feel like the problem is the way he's dealing with his English but there's this really needs point out which was his anguish he never said I'm done with God he said I I need a moment with God yes what I need and becomes his obsession and even though he thinks his moment with God as he's going to have to tell God like look at your screwing things up the fact that he was still trying to have that moment a Todd and that it led him to that and when he had his moments
 Amelia's, like I just need to be quiet and then you know what actually I forgot the most important part is my ears had heard about you
 but now my eyes see you I reject what I said and I Repent in Dust & Ashes
 my eyes see you and Joe knew a lot about God clearly but it's like all of everything he knew about God just becomes like secondhand information cuz like now I see and everything every category I had was like still so infantile now and he's a piece and that's what he wanted was to see God to just have an encounter I think the Shivers were like when you have you know that person you had that friend or maybe you've been in this place yourself where it's like a lot of people have confronted the problem of evil and then they're just like man I'm losing hope in God
 in fact like I I don't get it I don't know if I can trust them like this is just this is a big problem and I can go one of two ways I guess it could just be like and then I'm done
 but it could also be
 I just need a I need
 I need a moment with him I need to work this out with him and those two things maybe it's hard to see what what's really going on with someone from the outside it might look the same ya sure ya job looks like a mess and he's clearly pretty angry as he sat on the desk deep you could write him off if you be like well he's not in with got any more disrespect but what God was after was like does he really want me or does he want the good thing and by fighting him wrestling with him
 Jeb show that what he really wanted was got yeah yeah that's right even though the fighting was Joe questioning God it was actually him seeking God yeah his suffering removed every sing how do you say you couldn't you could appoint a job and be like me know the reason why he's still trying to get attention from God because God's giving him good things he doesn't have any like nice thing that he can point to any more and say that is the thing that shows me God's goodness or connect me to God in some way but I've got he's got nothing the only thing he has left is his longing and his frustration that drives him his quest for an answer and its quest to reconcile who he thought God was God seems to be for him right now God seems to take that as the search forgot yeah yeah and God Honors that he has like that's what we're close
 to the heart of this portrait of him suffering anger that drives him to God
 and that's the moment that God says enough the tests over it's different than the portrait of Jesus who surrenders more like an Abraham Mike with Isaac surrenders and he has his own moment Gethsemane you know Matt father is this could happen any other way to go but then you but your will be done joke a lot more noisy and angry but both end up accepting death and suffering and that's the moment that their suffering becomes a vehicle of life for others and for themselves restoration
 well that's the Redemption of a suffering yeah that's right is that he can then bring life to others it does this is suffering and now and a search for God has brought him so close to Union with God now he's a fit vehicle for God's mercy to go out towards others through his intercession
 I got it honest that role by an exulting him with a new family and when he meets of God God wants to tell him about the Leviathan let me tell you a really long description experiencing chaos blessed put some shape to him but yeah yeah that's right the dragon is actually more terrifying than you've ever imagined so we didn't read any of it but like I just read that chapter yes it's so it's Invincible no human could ever resort to arrows won't make it fully sling stones are like dust ad against its scales with other sides or Jagged Potter's we actually on the mud is actually to show that chaos is even more frightening than you have ever imagined
 you sure can't defeat it application but I can and want to place Jobe into the bigger story in the Hebrew Bible you know. Well so at the moment it's all joke can do is say God's goodness
 explode the categories Beyond is imagining and Chaos has even more terrifying Beyond is imagining and the end of reconciling himself to God does he stay between us to where does he sends God's goodness has more in terms of what God is saying is I ordered the cosmos were you there I know every square inch and every creature do you say nothing good that's just being powerful well but providing food for wild donkey out there just got the provision of food is a order is to be good yeah for the creatures minute to provide them food there
