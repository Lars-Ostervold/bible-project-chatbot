hey this is John and this is Tim. This is Bible project podcast and for the next four weeks were releasing episodes in their back catalogue revisiting some of the most popular episodes and that's because we are for the first time in five years of releasing weekly podcast taking a few weeks off right we have overheard 250 episodes week after week it is so much fun but we also know that the back catalogue is super valuable and it's some cool stuff in there that you might not have heard heard in awhile so this week we're going to listen to the second most popular podcast episode in a whole catalog and it is about trees and the Tree of Life theories did you think that this episode on trees would be so popular depending on how much time I have to prep for any one of our conversations I tried to sit down and think of it not just for you and I but like what's some cool fun stuff to talk about the podcast listeners to
 I remember this was the episode where it's like the human lung you do a inverse image of shaped like that ever since the root system of a tree I tried to find a bunch of cool stuff like that I was really surprised at how many people love trees you know they had this deep passion arborist that part of the Bible and I didn't realize how big that world was very important for this episode and we hope you all are enjoying humans are trees Tree of Life episode 160 Jonas
 have you ever Sat by a peaceful River looked on it a tree planted nearby blooming with flowers and thought you know that tree is a great image for what human floor looks like if you haven't done that creative exercise the biblical authors have in fact the other song One imagines the Abundant Life and says that person is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and has a leaf does not with her whatever they do prospers
 in fact this metaphor that humans are trees it doesn't just pop up here and there in the Bible it's actually a unifying theme throughout the entire story and trees they have a significant animated role in the biblical story they are not passive trees play an active role in the first creation account in Genesis. Creates trees and tells them to be fruitful and then later he creates humans and tells them also to be fruitful this is all on purpose this is all intentional and I meant to connect all of these stories as a unified developing and it's strategically at the key points of the hold of the story a low and behold there's almost always a tree where the max I'm John and this is the Bible project podcast and in today's episode him and I begin a new series discussing all the wonderful
 tree of trees throughout the Bible the tree of knowing good and bad the Tree of Life The Burning Bush the cross but first to set the table for this conversation we begin with an underlying metaphor the biblical authors want us to ponder and that is that humans are like trees thanks for joining us here we go
 returning a new theme video on the trees Avedon yeah it was for the title I thought of while ago but the more I've worked on it the more I think it's a cool chance to zero in on the Tree of Life specifically the tree life there's two trees in the end of note to play an important role in the plot yes good and bad correct we hung out call it good or bad we talked less about the tree of life but they're related which we talked about 4 I will talk about again but for the moment we don't have to decide the title right now is just the beginning of the discovery process so weird it's about the trees the trees and eating and then the steam of sacred trees where Humanity meets God
 or fails God or has to own up to their failures at 3 is on high places throughout the story of the buy for use in high places reason high places it's a thing the major design pattern throughout the Bible so we need to recall back to me to read the Bible series Jewish meditation literature correct the Bible is Jewish meditation yesterday and one of the Hallmarks of Jewish meditation literature is that biblical authors will riff off of symbols types like images is characters settings all these things and by repeating them and building on them and new ways they're actually communicating important ideas wrecked repetition really it's just it's a basic communication strategy of repetition with variation and so the trees does repetition
 this idea trees correct so yeah going really big picture here the Old and New Testaments he Revival and the Greek New Testament is a collection of different Scrolls letters but they are unified thematically and editorially they've been composed as a collection in multiple stages and one of the main ways that they're unified in terms of steam in message in story is through repetition of ideas of scenes images keywords story after story after Story and when you see a repeated set of images in the story where your mind is meant to go is to all of the earlier places and when those images occur in the story and then you meant to start to think of them as one whole idea throughout the whole collection so trees people meeting God at trees in either succeeding or failing a test
 major theme throughout the whole of the Bible coming to his climax in the story of the tree on the hill of Golgotha in the gospels and then the Tree of Life in the New Jerusalem on the last page of the Bible so it qualifies as a team throughout the whole Bible begins on pages 1 and 2 leads throughout the whole Bible up to the story of Jesus and then on to the last page there is no better candidate for a Biblical theme then the tree of life however I wasn't on the original list know you had like five don't know that doesn 2000 themes are the two doesn't go back and look but I added some more in the last year-and-a-half here but now yeah you are very convinced All About That Bass All About the tree. The trees let's begin with some surprising facts about 3 in the Bible okay
 apart from God and humans trees are the most frequently mentioned living thing in the Bible and socially in sentences like and God said or and God did humans are on every page and I think Amanda and animals is one but I animals as a group are mentioned the less than trees animal has a hole or any animal in particular has more personal. There's a lot of animals in the Bible the trees appear way more often than animals correct well yeah you know one of the more well-known English translations Modern English translation version the word tree appears in that translation 293 times the word fruit
 a 212 times the word Branch 107 Route 57 Forest 51 Vine 7219 just that right there tree fruit Branch route for us finally gives you over 800 appearances and that doesn't include hundreds of times that invasive species of trees are mentioned Palms Acacia Street oak trees terebinth Willow sycamore-fig all of pomegranates and you can name about 10 more so where I mean we're up to the over a thousand different texts where trees and tree related things are mentioned a lot it was surprising to me I mean I don't have a baseline to compare that to you know if you pick up like a modern novel you know like
 the crab Gresham Gresham John Grisham John Grisham novel my Hunters you wouldn't get anywhere near this number many words in the Bible Pages 1,500 Pages 780 3137 if you have to pay some kind of tree on one of those two pages facing Pages odds are you got a tree on one of them that's a lot that's a lot of density you know the cultural context of the Bible says Hebrew Bible was written by a community of Jewish tribes and Prophets who for the most part we're living in the Hills
 country of Judea and Israel and it was a tribal network of farming communities trees are on the brain trees are like they're those are their life and vegetation and yeah so a lot of its culturally-specific I'm not trying to over press the significance I'm just saying it is interesting a major role on two trees throughout the Bible famous bible stories are verses with trees to the most recognizable things from the story of Moses and the burning bush bush which there is an affinity and a connection I think in English and I think a brush I think of basically like a little miniature tree tree tree is just a big bush and a
 bush is a small tree for how the vocabulary we had this tree in our front yard at our previous house that if you didn't trim off all the extra sheets that came out it would turn into a bush but if you kept from those damn shame off it would be a tree is just normal observation you look at a bush you look at a tree and even though they have different shape of leaves and height categories for The Squatty tree squatty tray and even a flower it has a different kind of stem of the ground pretty busy flowers tiny travia so yeah the word tree out of this is important for everything we're about to do with the word Tree in Hebrews very flexible the Hebrew word 88 and it can refer to a tree that can refer to a bush it can refer to as we going to see a symbolic tree that is a idol statue it can refer to what we will call
 so when you cut down 1/8 you still have it it's you still have it when you shape the Apes into firewood it's 80 throwing on to the fire where is we differentiate between living tree and would work for a living biological dad go in I guess in Britain and their English I would you go into the woods sort of the woods the woods are you going to the wood but yeah so that's unique okay so would traditions of English still can refer to a living tree in American English generally gesturing to the material you get from a tree
 this is the tree then you get what type of wood and Hebrews all its Abraham puts it on Isaac's back it's the Apes for the burnt offering you this is the firewood call firewood that's going to be important cuz the fact that it's can cover so many different types of a tree or a bush so does that mean that the eighths of a life might be a bush or flower bush correct vines vines in Ezekiel 16 he has a slow parable about a vine tree and he calls it the 8th in the wood of the vine that would have I would have Divine divine
 what substance is a b y n. Yeah we got to Grapevine in our yard is pretty pretty sick cuz it's like a branch of the old one that you're freezing and it's wood I mean it's not you know green and pliable it's what race is not given all these different passages that have different species of trees and bushes but in the biblical imagination they're all its its which means it can be connected and design patterns and talk in archery school dance well there are a kind of tree creature related sounds like a difficult animated role in the biblical story they are not passive trees play an active role in the story different than animals and humans but still alive
 living things okay so we're just going through famous Moses and the burning bush classic yeah it's like a tree planted by streams of water yields is fruit and season yeah it's a common metaphor to talk about people as trees correct and which were going to take a moment to stop and revisit our metaphor conversation Jesus talked a lot about trees in his teachings and Parables I am the vine you are the branches portrays himself as a tree Jesus portrays the kingdom of God as a mustard seed that becomes a huge tree yeah yeah and another one didn't really stand out to me until I learned Greek was that the cross that Jesus is crucified on the Greek word stauros for a crossword across but the cross is regularly referred to as the
 especially in the book of Acts in the speeches of the book of Acts the cross is not always but regularly enough to notice it throughout the whole book that is referred to as the tree upon which Jesus was hung hung up on a tree that's actually survive the Christian tradition I've noticed and hymns and worship songs and stuff in the cross is called a tree correct so it's not just that they are all throughout the Bible equally occurring equal density tree imagery occurs at strategic moments in the biblical story he liked hinge narratives or poems we already talked about many correct creation story of Eden the fall of humanity the Rebellion revolves around two trees the covenants the significant Covenant making moments in the story happened around trees
 God makes covenants yeah exactly trees on top of high places and there's Workout Mix covenants consistently was Noah Abraham Moses and David about the way the trees appear is different remember a design pattern in the Bible is repetition with variation so the way that the tree looks on each of those high places in the Covenant scenes is different sometimes it's in the form of a boat made of made of its other times other times it's an it's not mentioned in the immediate story but mentioned at the first time that Mount Sinai was mentioned story The Burning Bush where Moses meets God and that's the mountain where he makes and then the temple which is made out of all kinds of its the promised land is the land of Full Of Vines and fig tree is everybody should get able to sit under
 lot of tree imagery in the temple is All About Trees literally made out of but then symbolically with the pomegranate trees woven into everything Caribbean in the prophets the Messianic deliver is regularly described metaphorically as a tree and packed in Jeremiah and Zechariah the name for the Messianic ruler is branch and the branch breaks Jesus Parables Jesus death the work of the spirit is connected to lease and fruit okay and then the Tree of Life at the end of the story in the new to respond so at this point is that this is all on purpose this is all intentional and I meant to connect all of the snow
 worries as a unified developing and it's strategically at the key in the points is a hold of the story lo and behold there's almost always a tree somewhere so tell Bible wants you to meditate on trees yeah and by meditating on trees you will become like a tree so let's pause and recognized your your cultural social location will in your family of Origins and all that is going to predispose you to a certain view of trees and plants are not think about them they don't play any role in your life but they do play a role in our lives cuz they feed us even though we don't we live inside of their bones their houses
 yeah totally my point is this is a moment where we have to let the Bible recreate a narrative world for us let the biblical authors sign the meaning and significance of things I can't just assume my white trees are significant I think of when I think of a tree I can't just assume that's what the biblical authors think odds are very different and less you grew up in may be a more rural or agrarian farming context where your life is connected to bushes and trees probably people from those cultures or settings have a leg up have an advantage over people grow up a more urban contacts I grew up in the city and there's lots of trees in Portland OR are lots of trees in Portland but that's why Island
 medicine is yeah well if you live in a desert city like a lot of the hollow trees need a lot of low-lying bushes so just as a way to close the sky opening getting trees on the brain movement I came across as a working on this really creative fun book by Johnny Matthews least called reforesting face what trees teach us about the nature of God and it's really accessible it's not nerdy academic but he's really sharp and he's done a lot of work on treasons in the Bible so it's kind of like an overview of trees throughout the storyline in the Bible's there's some overlap with what we're doing and just really creative but he's also he has a background in the sciences and so there's all these biblical meditations but then scientific meditation on the nature of trees and the nature of human and tree into dependents fascinating
 so I'm course of conversation opening up a couple things that he brought to my attention every kind of cool that's a fun easy to read meditation on trees and general from the theological perspective it called again reforesting Faith before sting what trees teach us about the nature of God Matthews police probably don't listen to podcast but maybe someone will tell you so as with all the little things start the beginning
 okay Genesis 1 many things we could talk about what I want to talk about is the symbolism and meaning of trees on page one of the Bible So within the six days of God's work there's the tube to pairing panels to 3 days 4 through 6 that match but after listening to this and it doesn't register going to be in the notes I don't know I asked it into pairing OK Google the design of Genesis 1 first creation narrative begins with the prologue and verses 1 and 2 at the log which is actually what what is in modern Bible's chapter 2 verses 1 2 3 that's the epilogue and what's in between verses 3 through 31 is this
 6 days of God's working and those six days are designed into pairing Triads of days days one through three make a sad make a set and then days for 6 go back and map onto what happened on days 123 rather Days 1 and 4 days two and five days three and six all maps in terms of content vocabulary on the prologue begin with saying everything was wild and waste unordered disordered and uninhabited the first Triad is 123h most translations you'll find formulas in void is a typical translation unless it has no for him as one of the order one God's light emanates into the darkness day 2
 Waters below are separated from the waters above this important one thing happens if light day to one thing happens water is separated from the waters they 3267 did you catch that one thing they won 12 to one thing they 33 is plants emerge out of the ground and specifically fruit trees trees of fruit so that's three days and go back to the lights they want it permitted Darkness Sunday 1 now today for some inhabit crate gives inhabitants reach of the Realms he did he did order the three Realms the heavens the waters and then they three of the trial and is forced to do is go back the light Sunday for sun moon stars
 the sky flyers in the water swimmers on the water is above and below that matches day too and a six we're back to the dry land and lo and behold there are two acts on day 6 the match the two acts of D3 so it's important they just wanted to. Just one thing days 4 and 5. Does one thing is three and six got this two things on each of those days the last the little like the bonus think of it as the bonus thing on day three on day three there's a bonus it's fruit trees on day three idiots fruit trees are the bonus day6 the bonus is humans who are to be fruitful Sunday 3 is trees of fruit the bear fruit with seeds in them the bonus of day6 is humans who bear fruit and seat-belted English that's the same word fruit trees and fruiting arrest
 free God says let the land bring forth vegetation big General category then next category plants that produce seed next category fruit trees on the land that produce fruit that have seed in it corresponding the bonus act on day 6 matching the fruit trees is human fruitful humans who bear fruit and give birth to seed seven Hebrew those are connected to your backside correct structure of Genesis one wants me to associate fruitful trees and fruit for humans as they both exist on the dry land and they both have a parallel function describes with the same vocabulary so this is interesting and I been coming along with you in this journey of how to see the Bible and its literary form and he's fine meaning from that Mark this cuz what are you doing is your saying
 days one through six create a pattern they wanted three create these like domains track days 4 through 6 then match those demands with an applicant habitants correct so now we see this this pairing pairing now we just look at these three and six weeks now see within this pairing there's a word there's they each have more than one Act of Creation to create event to creative acts and on the second creative act and A3 it's a fruit tree and in day6 it's a fruiting humans poop humans and now here's a big putting it together is that now as of the reader will this is designed in such a way so that you now start thinking in the metaphor of humans like trees all that work
 I just said hey dear reader what you think about humans like trees well in a way they are cuz this same concept is going to come from a different design pattern in Genesis to the same humans will be like in the trees could go because you'll be so think of it this way and again this is not my Discovery this is actually very ancient but most recently it was brought to my attention by Hebrew Bibles scholar David Andrew Teeter was that if you take a class or look at any introduction to reading the book of poetry or listen to our conversations on biblical poetry than the main design convention a Biblical poetry is two or three short lines that are parallel designed to be paired together in some way of repeating either the same ideas or cabbie Larry but never identical
 is with a little bit of variation so that you think of them as one combined Associated idea but the difference is enriched it give it with greater depth and metaphorical comparison and it's that same principle that here in a narrative where certain elements of a narrative are paired and poetry you can do it in two short lines here and there it's if it's through a literary structure and design so the the bonus act on two paired days is fruitful trees and fruitful humans humans are trees trees trees humans metaphorically and they're not becomes yeah that's exactly right thank you for trying making that being introduced to it on page one because that's going to be one of the main way biblical authors communicate I was never taught to read the Bible that way me neither and it almost smack salus
 a bit of like Bible Code in a way of like you know let's take something and then find some meaning in it but at a very basic level what you and many other Scholars are saying is this is how the biblical authors are communicated know what they're doing and you're doing it on purpose roses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet and so are you thank you you're welcome it's that repetition was variation so violets are blue so are you those two lines are not next to each other are separated by sugar is sweet so I understand your mind associate because of the because of the Luke Bryan and and there's a lot of people are like flowers
 yeah right by little blue and so are you where is that what you're supposed to get from that sugar is sweet and so are you that's the immediately paired line but the rhyme from violets are blue and then the last line so are you makes you be like that people are like flowers too and so people are like flowers and sugar which means people flowers and sugar are all like each other as one metaphorical Matrix the flowers are sweet in a different way than sugar and identify the human design patterns are type of writing it's a poetic communication strategy and we are used to it on smaller levels of poetic lines the biblical authors it's one of their main Tools in narrative to design narratives impaired repetition theme and variation why people are familiar with it and movies and object on screen and there's no specific attention drawn to it. Talked about like a pig
 his object is there and then it keeps reappearing and I'll send you realize this is important object same with movie scores like music we listen the lot to the Star Wars A New Hope soundtrack we were playing with Legos and so you know that Luke Skywalker it comes up when he first appear so yeah and then and so many scenes afterwards it just a sometimes it'll be one horn doing the little things sometimes really intense sometimes really and that's it it's a little flourish and it brings back the design pattern of everything that look represents and all the stories before that point it's the same strategy here through the little red design in Genesis 1
okay now let's pause let's think about what trees and humans both do that's a little bit different than the other things so the trees and the humans are both associated with the word cede they have seed in them like God has the capacity of the kind of being who can just sell Jenner Universe Cosmos out of his own power and creativity and word whose word is the word is like seed the word is like seed 5500 really did I see if we can talk about it later in this conversation so God is depicted as a self-generating he can write he doesn't need something else he can just tell Jen right there in the same way
 there's a long paragraph about how trees have their seed in them to produce more trees with fruit so why is why are we going into that trees are there not self-generating it turns out they didn't generate themselves as the species they develop from something before but when you look at a tree it our perception and experience of a tree they live longer than humans many do and they make you think of a self-generating concept zero they just they have within them if in the tiniest little form the seed form of a whole other huge thing and it just grows seeds and then drops them on the ground and then nutrients grow and it just it's a kind of Perpetual life it's a kind of eternal life not literally
 but metaphorically just continues continues and if you stop and think about it Humanity as a species is kind of like that it has within within the Spurs and the Beast Within A within a man and a woman there's these fluids and fluids mixed and that fluid is called seed and Hebrew male sperm in Hebrews called so humans are trees and bear fruit is an image of God giving the gift of self-replicating life to other creatures in a way that they expect their images of the Divine Life and creativity other creatures they didn't generate their own the beginning but once they're giving a beginning they can imitate God's so perhaps a life in through the pharmacy so that there's something kind of divided about seed exactly a human's and trees as a self
 perpetuating kind of creature and an animals are too but the narrative doesn't draw attention to that for animals that's that's right really focuses in on the trees ability to reproduce in a human's ability which means I think we're supposed to pair them anyway so that's a meditation Point make a cup of coffee or tea take a long walk how trees are like humans and how both are an image of God's Own Self generating power and creativity for me what was interesting when it struck me was the idea of a tree as its symbol bestowing eternal life and Ethan makes a lot more sense when I get into this concept of what tree symbolizes a seed being kind of metaphorically connected to the idea of eternal life that a seed has the ability to self
 when's your weight become a living thing which has more seeds which becomes more living things and that can continue on indefinitely and this idea of an indefinite life is you're not that far from the idea of eternal life so you're saying that the an ancient Hebrew thinker was just sitting contemplating seeds and the kind of this connection and is like man this is a lot like Karina life and then that became the seed of an idea which is that may be coming to life is best represented by a tree imagination where a tree can be associated with the gift of God's Own eternal life through trees have their own kind of Perpetual life and humans
 that capacity but they don't ever that capacity is compromised and in many ways she's level of trees are both oh I see what species for humans on the planet level it would be is what phylum class Kingdom levels of their species fruit trees is what Genesis one drops funds between mammals that station okay cool I mean the other thing is that the tree of life being a tree is because it's something you could take of you know it's like kind of a next step in the development of idea but I'm just basic category people are like trees and both are given the gift of potentially having ongoing Perpetual life
 that is one of the ways that Genesis 1 images God's eternal power and when I think of eternal life personally I don't think of one species level I think of like me being able to say I've ever actually correct it also makes sense in the book of Isaiah when I say envisions the New Jerusalem he talks about my people shall be like the days of a tree rings it up explicit way the book of Isaiah represents a sustained meditation on the meaning of trees for the Hebrew Bible
so are there was trees in Genesis 1 worth
 pondering thinking about taking next step trees in the Garden of Eden
 so just like the introduction of trees in Genesis one is paired with introduction of humans the same idea happens in the Garden of Eden Story the origin of humans is designed parallel to the origin of trees and seven that Yahweh God formed human of dust from the ground and the Hebrew words are significant, get the parallel here pick up an English too so the word formed is the Hebrew verb by yes sir yes sir human is Adam and from the ground is minda Audemars all right so Adam and Adam are human and ground rhyme in Hebrew human and hummus
 which word first saw type of soil is it tomorrow for the soil or ground yeah so he makes human from the hummus Adam from The Audemars Adam, I don't expect an email to versus later in verse 9 and Yahweh God caused to sprout every tree from the ground the word for sprout is Violet's Mark face mask for the human form something at the invites for the human for the tree but the first three letters of both of those verbs are identical in this happens once again these are repairing
 strategy is repairing tools the biblical authors will use using verbs and nouns that share similar letters are often clue preparing things those to those two verbs basically both of them begin with by it's not going to happen but then it's you get a noun is what the intended to do what they do I know that there is an intended pairing are you get a violet verb then you get another case a tree a tree ate it and then both of them are from the ground so God by it the human from the ground God by it's the tree from the ground, so once again what emerges from the ground in this short little paragraph fear trees if you'll trees and people and I've already been prepared to make a link between trees and humans because of the
 Aaron and Genesis 103 enforcing the same metaphorical concept people are like trees which means the future of humans their Origins and their Destiny are going to be linked in some way humans are trees the origins of trees similar to humans I wonder if the future of humans will be bound up with the future of trees
 and then the next thing you told us you know there was once a couple special tree is the tree of life in the middle of that garden and the tree of knowing good and bad oh yes the destiny of humans and trees are very intertwined I like how there is the detail of all the different types of trees Genesis to like trees that are pleasing to the eye right right and Ministries for food I just like it because it's like it to me in this you were going to help me really appreciate it but to me it's just like he was God in the garden and it just it's not about being your functionality trees that is good to look at it they're just there because you're beautiful just wants trees there that you can just sit and go
 is drawing attention to the artistic tastes of the creator doesn't need to have a practical function be meaningful with me you have trees and humans who are fruitful and Genesis one you have trees and humans the both are Violet out of the ground in Genesis 2 and then what you learn about the trees is there beautiful the good for eating and there's one kind of tree that brings life there's one kind of tree that brings knowing good and bad it's going to represent a test so if that's true of trees, if the trees can provide life and can be beautiful and can represent a test and I know the tree
 are parallel to humans human kind of like 3 extra life or who will represent a test I on a road of somebody choosing between good and bad this is vocabulary of pleasing to the eyes and good for food is going to describe multiple human characters in the book of Genesis Sarah sees his good of sight and he takes her when she and Isaac or down in garage bar and the demo Lex people see that she is beautiful of sight and then she has taken Joseph is good of sight to Potiphar's wife and she wants to take him so what trees represent in Ethan is going to be an idea that is going to become true of humans
 humans will become trees of testing the other humans in the Book of Genesis metaphorical trees of testing and I'm prepared for that right here that I think I'm falling to God what happens first the forms human out of the ground cumin from the Altima and then the tree from the anima that happens first but then isn't there that moment where guy just says look at this bunch of there's a bunch of trees here and plants trees that are good for looking at good cat food and then he draws attention to the two trees right and so you're saying we've already been thinking about trees and humans as kind of poetic rhyming of an idea and so as a reader
 being drawn attention to these trees that are good to look at it so we shouldn't be surprised to find a little behold that in The Narrative of Genesis human does humans that are good to look at in the trees in Genesis to represent a test of how are humans going to rule the world with God and so in the same way the humans who are good to look at represent become a test for other humans so there's a few ideas I've become paralyzed you and I both have little boys and little boys Christmas and Christmas will say they're younger than they are now I give one son a bike and the other person at Reich Twitter they rhyme one's a bike one's a trike and one boy likes his bike one boy likes his private doctor
 the bike is Silver the trike is silver and I give a short lecture to the boy given the bike about how you're going to be tempted to hog this for yourself to never let anyone share it and enjoy it and I'm going to encourage you to share this bike when your friends are around and want to take a ride on it must have stopped right there do I mean that the trike will not also represent the same kind of test Madison is playing with this rivalry lactylate a similar thing will hold but I assume that it's two of the bike then that will also be true of the Triton but he'll need to share it represent a test of his generosity and that's the kind of communication strategy Happening Here the trees and humans are parallel the trees are beautiful of sight good
 take one offers life the other offers death good and bad and so that will also be true of humans and I'm going to meet a whole bunch of humans that a beautiful sight and good for eating metaphorically and people will take them and bring disaster on themselves just like the Trees of Eden and that's very intentional in the Book of Genesis people are trees and people can be trees of life or trees of testing about good and bad in the story why Jesus curses the Fig Tree will talk about that yes we are we're laying the biblical imagination groundwork that will make sense of a lot of strange tree stuff including the fig tree that you can cuz you give that you gave this long story of the biking the trike Jesus do something with his Parables similar that we could probably just grab like some sort of like the fig tree
 come to mine but well yes there's a handful of text in the prophets the Jesus is tune in to where Jerusalem is a fake tree instead is going to wither and die when it when Israel was exiled so Jesus is announcing yet another way of us destructive Exile on Jerusalem by cursing at Victory go back imagine you have us wise Mentor person in your life and you taking a walk through the woods and you get to a fruit tree and he tells you in this beautiful way isn't life human life a lot like this fruit tree wax poetic about that and then tells you a story about how trees can become a Crux of a moment of decision and Tas
 you're saying me as young Padawan learner should go I see you're telling me that humans in my life are going to be a lot like it's some of them will be like a tree of life some of them will be like a tree of knowing good and bad and I should learn how to avoid certain trees and learn how to hang out and eat from other certain traits of the Tree of Life only occurs in what other book of the Old Testament and it's the Book of Proverbs and Wisdom Tree of Life but then also righteous people are a tree of life the righteous faithful are trees of life to those who are around them people can be trees of Life in The Book of Proverbs the tree of life being something much more Cosmic oh it's just been just the fact that people can bring life people who would like the tree of life it's not the tree of life is like
 the tree of life has its own thing is Cosmic what we'll talk about symbolism of the Tree of Life okay but people can be likened to the area 5 day can be a vehicle of God's life and love God blessing to others around them which is what the tree is a vehicle of God's Life coming it to you thank you that's good clarification hear it surrounds us off people are like trees this is from Matthew sweet's books I mentioned we are wasting face forward in Genesis 1 and 2 people are like trees in terms of producing fruit he had this cool image in the book of an x-ray or CT scan of a human lung looks like a like a bush if you look at it just Google it's called the Bronco G or looks like it's spelled Branch a gram but it's this photo of the vessels
 human long it's a tree a tree this design what is the function of our lungs creating the cell structures that are meant to capture as much CO2 and then to absorb it into the tissue mixed with blood so then Gary oxygenated that's exactly the function of the branch structures of tree just to absorb CO2 and so actually isn't it the leaves that do that in a tree branch structure developed precisely to produce as many lives as possible got it so for the purpose of absorbing and the lung structure you got all these tiny little sacks at the that are like the leaves at the end yet and they capture that so the human lung is like an inverted tree
 yeah. This is clever it's just a way of furthering the metaphorical connection and Inter of interdependence between trees and humans right provide life for humans on the fruit level that's Genesis one but humans are also like trees in Genesis 2 in more ways than one and here in the ways that the trees at the biblical father didn't even realize it wouldn't ya ya anyway I thought that was just a cool, I realize the trees were there the one that the tree was creating oxygen humans is absorbing look up look up branches and I on Google image and its inverted tree inside my lawn
the where Saint James wanted two people compared to trees in Hebrew the main Hebrew word for descendant is the is the word for seed and the word seed for a plant or a tree and the word seed for him is the same words era and Hebrew Sarah this becomes for me was a was problematic in terms of talking about Tracy any idea of the seed and connecting it because remember we the word Offspring yes yes yes what kind of the closest thing an English cuz we don't say when we were children English rest and probably can hang some of the strange guy the word seed when you see it in the Old Testament translating the words era but what you don't see is that the
 descendant is nine times out of 10 also the Hebrew word Sarah and there's an important metaphorical connection between them namely that people are like trees fruit can refer to descendants as well as my loins be fruitful and multiply children can be named lay the thing inside the fruit or children can be fruit trap the ghosts can work however fruit can also be used as metaphorical a to describe not children but the results of one's life what you produce in life can be called fruit like in Psalm 92 the righteous flourish like a palm tree they grow like Cedars of Lebanon they bear fruit in old age which doesn't necessarily mean they keep having kids goes on to talk about the right choices of women who struggle with infertility
 typical story all the generations Genesis Sarah Rebecca Rachel Hannah and the Hebrew word for infertile that it's the Hebrew word which means to be uprooted or disconnected from your route to be comfortable with it so we don't have a metaphorical connection that English interesting but the Hebrew word for infertile is unrooted without ripped disconnected from me but you're not connected to the vital source of life God has given to the ground so that's why I fertile womb is described as blessing just like fertile fruit trees is blessing fertile phlox is a sign of divine blessing cuz it's all means you're connected to the life of Eden the God is packed in all creation is so interesting so vocabulary of cutting off or withering is regularly applied to humans to destroy
 death or destruction in Syria cut off a bridge that's sleeves with her correct it's a regular phrase to be cut off from your people were to be cut off from the land of the living tree image cutting off a branch or cutting down a tree cut someone off where that come from suffering a relationship I cut them off them off is that the thing people say I think so yeah cut them out of my life but I don't know if that's connected to your culture or if it's just this idea of cutting in another sense of what's necessary for trees to grow and flourish and so water is a regular image of all kinds of things that come from God to make human life flourish
 so God Spirit his breath is compared to water and multiple places Isaiah chapter 44 44 I'll pour out water on the Thirsty land streams on the dry ground all pour out my spirit on your seed and my blessing on your seat in the same way that the stream Waters the ground God's spirit is animates humans People's race and then I in other places his instruction will be like water or traffic it's life but the point is is that all these images of God's word for life breath or spirit being something that grows trees is all connected to this space metaphor from Genesis one of your schemes people are trees correct so this is why when you get to someone you get the righteous person does faithful to God and neighbor he meditates on the divine
 word and he's like a tree planted by streams of water whose leaves Never Fade so humans can become the Eternal Tree of Life to other humans if they connect themselves to the Divine Source of Life someone's just somebody who really thought for a long time about Genesis 1 and 2 was written from the imagination of somebody's in Genesis 1 and 2 people are trees so this is really helpful for me this will pay dividends as you go into the rest of the Bible of sorting out tree imagery and why it took her so often why a man who claims in word and deed to be the Creator hanging up on a tree can give the gift of God's own life and spirit to the rest of creation the meaning of the Cross takes on so much more significance I think when you understand how these metaphor images work in the Hebrew Bible so
 I'm excited for this than to continue into the dots to connect and for the stool and right now I didn't came into this conversation thinking over top of the tree of life more specifically but we've done is we've shown how in the biblical imagination and the writings this metaphorical schemes of like trees being really foundational that just seems like kind of like a launching pad now and then we're going to talk now specifically about this Cosmic tree the tree of life and it'll be connected it's connected because we've already seen that humans become like a tree of life humans are like the tree of life and the tree of life is a specific kind of tree that he was to be like because humans are like trees
