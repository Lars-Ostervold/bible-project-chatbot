the last episode we started discussing the name of the city in the New Testament and in the life of Jesus now before we go any farther we want to take this episode to pause and go over the big ideas that would come across so far in the last episode we looked at how the New Jerusalem hoped for by the prophet is fulfilled in Jesus and his followers and if that's the case then why did God have David make the original Jerusalem was it David's idea to make the city of God or was it got the idea that's exactly the question is David's desire that corresponds to God's desire and what God's desire is to have a resting place a heaven on Earth resting place where he can have a human Royal Priestly partner from whom will sprout a future king and his kingdom will be forever and ever and the Edan land our cities the best way to create a heaven on Earth spot aren't cities just to inherently flawed to work with it's good to preserve life
 like God it's good to create a refuge where New Life can generate that's an imitation of Eden and so now cities though not ideal become up to 10 shal way to do that and now the question is not going to be whether we have cities or not have cities that's what are we going to do with the cities that we have yet Jesus it doesn't go and fill the city he doesn't make himself king of Jerusalem and he thinks of the city has the people who live in it and he tells his followers you are the city what is interesting is that in those poems and Isaiah that we looked at the city is merged with a group of people called you or the servant and it's the servant and his followers that are exalted up high to become begin to the Nations and together we'll become like the new Eden light shining out to the nation's
 today to MacKay and I review some of the big ideas of the theme of the city I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
Hey Joe hey so we are talking about the City by theme in the Bible and looking towards the end we are I've been processing through with the content and I'm feeling some holes in my mind and how I understand it I love that Jesus I mean we talked about Jesus and him calling his disciples the city the city you are as a city on the hill there the city the light to bright shining City on the hill which is this kind of massive turn right cuz we've been talking about actual just cities that what people as you know also they are the city when God talks to a city's talking about the people in the city that's right yeah but as we've introduced city is it talk about them as the place with the wall and like it's a setting so I'm going to continue with Jesus but
 let's try to plug a few holes in my thinking as we get back in the Jesus yet yeah actually since we have that last conversation have had more clarity oh good about the ideas underlying it and actually there were a few Hebrew Bible and other second temple Jewish literature text that came to mind that make a lot more sense another words to go from the Hebrew Bible where the city seems of Jerusalem as like the Heavenly Jerusalem the Earthly Jerusalem they're really hard to tell apart two Jesus saying a group of people in Galilee you are the city shiny on the hill there's a whole series of dots a trail okay and few centuries of history and biblical authors and Jewish Bible nerds meditating that actually help explain why Jesus saying something like that actually make sense of
 I want to hear about so I have some new clarity about that that actually might form some helpful backdrop okay should we start there well maybe but I want to hear about the holes that you feel like you need to plug cuffs let us remember the reason we have these conversations is cuz we are also creating media videos ever the Bible project about the city and we need to we need to talk about yeah well I think the first place to start is as we talked about the city are we talkin merely about a setting or are we talkin actually more about what it means to live in community with each other almost done regardless of the setting because what's interesting is I think about this as an opening this video I think about 3 settings the Wilderness the garden in the city right now in the wilderness out of the Wilderness God creates a cultivated
 the Heat cultivates and that's juxtaposed to the other side of the Wilderness pain going out building a city between the garden God cultivates in the city can build Wilderness out of wilderness a cultivated Garden out of wilderness a walled City session on the comparison and contrast of those to you real quick so remember that the garden is about a place where God's Heavenly life meets her place of abundance and the generation of new life and so similarly cities are designed now and came to mind for the protection and preservation of life and why do you need to protect it while cuz it's dangerous outside of eating so it's not the Wilderness cuz you're going to cultivate something but at the same time it's a human-made little
 refuge for the preservation of Life they're both met to preserve life they're both refugees of sorts and for the generation of new life is just the one is God made of not made by human hands and the other one is made by human hands not inherently bad though the fact that you need a wall tells the story just by itself and that really key meaning of the city and they said you're not all bad it's good to protect life it's good to preserve life it's good for have these refuges the out of which New Life can generate and that's a cities are viewed but they're also viewed as this kind of compromised
 kind of like eating but also not like eating right we talked about how they can turn on a dime yeah just like humans yeah just like cities are scaled up versions of humans right now but that's not something about the garden the garden will also turn on a dime that's the garden has some sort of stability about it I suppose that someone could have come into the garden now that's right to do something really evil and that's cuz it's God's Garden said he's got bouncers at the entrance of the key differences is that God's Throne was in the garden and that in a city where we are introduced to the idea that man will start crying Towers to replace God's Throne yeah yeah we're going to city tower representing man's will till I grew up on their own terms the towers which is Scott I send back into the sky send it with a human-made version of and it's got a wall
 saying we got to protect ourselves so in the garden there's a throne but it's God's Throne there's protection but it's God's protection which is what his wisdom is abundance those are his protectors actions were like really intimidating bodyguards over whom he dwells America's Yahweh 12 spell cherubim and those representing the Divine the other Spiritual Beings and divine power yeah but the Caribbean in specific cuz the zoo amorphic hybrid animal mashups but with wings so they represent a combination of the creatures of Heaven on Earth altogether singing Praise and standing at the boundaries have a nurse and bodyguards to protect her as a as a where and as we saw in the story David maybe I don't want to jump ahead too much but
 you know that boundary is real and their number of people who lose their lives in the story The Bible by trying to cross it inappropriately so then my question becomes how suspicious do we need to remain about cities because what it seems like is the way canes the first city in the Bible Cain City the way that story comes to you is your like Man City suck we have a murderer who goes out into the Wilderness doesn't trust God's protection build a city a few Generations down the line is this backwards King bloating about violence against men who wounded him and then that's all connected this backward King Motif continues in Genesis 10-hour post-flood but just as hell yeah and you've got the genealogy of Noah's kids that become all the nations
 and right in the center of that is the story of this guibor mighty warrior can feel like he makes the cities that are the big bad guys in the Bible Syria Nineveh Babylon and then we get the story of Babylon and how it just gets out of control and God has to stop it so like I'm not far into the Bible and I'm like yeah no problem their problem that's a big problem yes and then on top of that when God called Abraham write Abraham doesn't go and take a nap and then build a city No No in fact he's always lives at the edges and outskirts of cities or just straight up in the hills yeah and then there's a story between Abraham and lot and it's almost as if the position of a lot goes to live in the city. The problem is he doesn't and Abel who is favored by God was a shepherd shepherd shepherd live out in the hill.
 that's right Haines was the farmer farmer's so she was sitting since this thread of a kind of like the sense of guys let's not create the city life City Life the problem let's stay in the Hills somewhere in the story of Abraham and it kind of feels that when Abraham goes to Egypt problem Lagos Autumn problem now we get a really beautiful picture of the city when Joseph for Generations down and Joseph in Egypt and he becomes second-hand ruler to pharaoh and you get a picture of a city transformed by wisdom of God ruling in Wisconsin wisdom and now a city is protecting and sustaining life at the storage cities, sources of life for the land and you're like a city can be transformed this could work it's kind of all your first moment of like
 okay maybe something can happen with the city that feels like a turn it is and what's important is that the structure or the physical structure of the city the storage cities Remains the Same but it's about the inhabitants right at the one ruling them in the inhabitants and shape that City and all sorts of Life instead of a source of violence meaning the quality and roll that is City plays in the story really is about its leadership and its inhabitants right because there's a theme that a city is really just leveraging the creativity and the Ingenuity and the collaboration of humans to be able to do great culture technology just do a lot of stuff and so one person could kill their brother Sony
 person killed her brother and evil King song yeah the cities are like nuts and scaled versions of Givens literally and metaphorically yeah so when we get into now God has well but here's the other thing about Egypt is we get this beautiful picture of a city led by the wisdom of God but then after a few Generations what time are the knife-edge thing again a new king who all the sudden wants he's afraid and wants to rule with oppression and violence in the death and then God says Nope Justice judgment and so then in an ironic twist what Pharaoh has his New Slaves still the Israelites as build more storage cities the very types of cities that were the source of Life led by an Israelite leader in Egypt
 I don't get all inverted now the Israelites are slaves building more storage cities as a sign of their death from the city part of the yeah the rescue from Egypt the like the history and psyche of the people of Israel is we became a nation within the belly of a city they came in as like a small family yeah that's right yeah well 70-plus works are the Bible project and yes such a huge extended family he was showing me a picture of their Christmas gathering it was like it was so many people anyway cousins and second cousins the whole thing yeah I love it so they come out as like this extended family and then they become more like a
 a group I like a what you would call a nation Nation nation and interesting Lee God takes them on an extended Journey Through the Wilderness back into the Wilderness in the world today from the city safe from the city back into the Wilderness now in the wilderness God is Not preparing them to come into a land that's going to be like eating and to create communities and create a way of life that's led by God's wisdom that should create righteousness and justice
 and so here's my question how are they then to make cities because I got to go into this land yeah they're going to have to live somewhere this is a land where there still violence yeah and what they're told is that the inhabitants of the cities of the land are going to be hostile to them and resist them and that's exactly the plot line of the Book of Joshua it's interesting so the most famous city when they go in the land of Jericho yeah you know the name of the famous wall wall around the wall an interesting way in that story the way they are to attack the city is to do nothing militarily March around it and all these patterns of 7 and blow horns and then God will dismantle the wall so the city is defeated not by human hands not my sword and shield spear
 so that the God is the dismantler of these hostile cities but then almost every battle that comes after that is Canaanite pouring out of their cities to attack the Israelites and then Joshua take some of these campaigns there is law in the Torah about how to take over a city that's right or at least within the land of Canaan they would have one approach with the seven Canaanite tribes but then outside of the land they were to take a different approach but yeah that's right and there's one particular law that talks about when you're performing a Siege of the city you don't cut down the fruit trees to build ramps such a rad little Garden of Eden I feel like you have to lie but what you're noticing is you would think there would be some huge part of the laws of the Torah given over to guidance about house for Mindy
 all the cities or I would almost expect some laws of the Torah about not building cities there's a one moment with Egypt but otherwise like let's live like Abraham Left Right Father Abraham build a city in fact lot his nephew he went to a city in that didn't end well so I won't feel like we're set up for the tour to go case when you go in and don't build walled cities you don't need them but I guess okay yes if Humanity was in a condition where they didn't need walled cities anymore but we're not even though Canaan is depicted like an Eaton type land humans are definitely not in a pre Eden Rebellion state so I guess you would say
 that the allowance for the building of cities is God's accommodation to an outside because there's one spot we talked about it the Cities of Refuge tells them to give cities to the Levites living in their meant Source assuming that the tribes have should have said is not I can donate some abilities and then six of them will become Cities of Refuge for anyone who's liked and and it's all its Numbers chapter 35 full of hyperlinks back to the Genesis for where the somebody kills a sibling brother before their trial they shouldn't be murdered without the trial and so they can flee to one of these cities
 so that the one who finds them does not kill them so they're clearly we're in the postseason reality here so maybe there's an analogy to the laws of the Torah that talk about when you go into the land and want to be like the other nations and you place a king over yourself
 so the law is it is the law in Deuteronomy 17 that's anticipating something God knows Israelites will want
 and that they're going to do but when it actually happens later in the in the story and Samuel God's really offended by it and says they're refusing to accept me as their king that's why they want to come in but there is law of the Torah about how to have a king so the laws of the Torah member are not Gods ideal will for all times and all places they are for Israel for certain time for the Covenant relationship as a application of God's wisdom and they're very much and accommodation to the non ideal realities of human existence of laws about the king in the Torah aren't accommodation because God obviously didn't really want them to have a kid he was frustrated by that remembers us talked about you we're both going to be gone at the same time which means we've been influencing each other religious leaders ask Jesus about a law of Moses around divorce
 Jesus says look that law was an accommodation is that what he says he says this law was given to you because of the hardness of the human hair OK Google play Notting idea it's a Band-Aid right it's a triage know you're saying there's no law that or about building cities but there is a law that or about how to donate some of your cities to the Levites and do cities have walls and there's also laws about hey when you go and take over a city that had walls and outside of eating you need that so all of a sudden what was Cain is a sad the building of a walled City to protect his life instead of trusting God like upset to protect him that's like it kind of a sad tragic reality of City represents tragedy but as you go on cities are it's good to preserve life that's like God
 it's good to create a refuge where New Life can generate that's an imitation of Eden and so now cities though not ideal become a potential way to do that and now the question is not going to be whether we have cities or not have cities that's what are we going to do with the cities that we have
so that brings us to Jerusalem so what's up what you were slammed because what came first did this ideal idea of a video of God like a psalmist is Psalm 145 6746 Beyonce their streams make glad the city of God so the song Now sudden imagining that God's throne and Rule can come out of the city so that's a big shift because up till now no God's Throne was in the car that was in yeah these are an accommodation in fact Tabernacles can be carried around the Wilderness you don't need a city God's Throne Room doesn't need to be associated with the city sunleaf Psalm 46 there's a city of God where did this idea come from is it an idea that Dan sets up the reason for Jerusalem or is an idea reflecting on the reality of Jerusalem and taking it to a new low
 that's great this is exactly what I was referring to. Today I had some further thoughts so if you have sowed the goal we talked about David bringing the ark to Jerusalem bring in the Tabernacle right to the center of Jerusalem the highest hill you planted there he's bringing Throne of God to do multiple questions there one is why did David choose that place what was going on what did he think he was doing a remind me he took the city over which is something that the laws of the Torah said he could do yeah yep David Goes to Jerusalem and he takes it over from the Canaanites over there but Klan called the jebusites and they were like yeah good luck yet good luck over anybody's blind or disabled in our city cuz well fortified City and then David and his soldiers sneak in through the water shaft now David has a well fortified city until it's called city of David and also the Zion with
 means Rock most likely means Rock High Rock and then that's in 2nd Samuel 5 next chapter David brings the Ark in the Tabernacle up to Jerusalem which means that the heaven on Earth presents the Eden presence of God is now coming to inhabit the city just two things one there's some questions here is whose idea was it yeah and the narrative doesn't like okay who's idea was it to bring the Throne of God to Jerusalem the story in 2nd Samuel 6 just begins and David a rose with all the people to bring up the Ark of God to dwell in Jerusalem and it doesn't go good first-round we talked about that for those
 and his dad said he doesn't wrong it will actually a series dark wrong and his brother and their dad set up the arc on this cart if they were not supposed to do splits that we not supposed to say not supposed to do and it's what the Philistines were doing with the card when they shipped it out of their land earlier in the story of Samuel scroll we don't know if David was supposed to do this but we do know that they're going about it the wrong way so what's interesting is that was a great meditation literature example the Psalms have a whole lot of reflection on David's notice and what he thought he was doing super interesting so you get us all home like Psalm 132 which reads like this
 remember oh yeah we're on David behalf all of his suffering how he swore an oath to Yahweh that he made a vow to the mighty William Jacobs I will not enter my house or lie on my bed or give sleep to my eyes or Slumber to my eyelids until I find a place for Yahweh but dwelling place for the mighty one of Jacob were reflecting here on David had a thing he wanted to know if he wanted you to have a home so this still doesn't explain whose idea it was sweat so behold we've heard of it and efrata town south of Jerusalem cup we found it in the field of y'all might have to look that up yet remains Forest but let us go to his Dwelling Place let us worship at his footstool
 arise Yahweh to your resting place you and the Arc of your strength let your priests be clothed with righteousness that your Godly wants Sing For Joy so we actually it's like we're meditating on the procession of the Ark oh we found it we found the ark with people and now let's take it up taking it up to the resting place for the sake of your servant David don't turn away the face of your Messiah
 the Lord swore an oath to David COS of David's were not to bring the little Garden of Eden thrown into Jerusalem and now you always swearing in of this is exactly the sequence of 2nd Samuel 6 David brings our to Jerusalem 2nd Samuel 7 God make a promise to David about a future seed Finish Line in the Kingdom the last record cup which is exactly what we're saying you always warned us to David a truce from which she won't turn back out of the fruit of your body I will set upon your throne it's your son's keep my Covenant the testimony I teach them they will sit on the throne forever
 because Yahweh has chosen Zion e desired it for his habitation this is my resting place forever here I will dwell for I have desired it I will abundantly blessed her with provision else that sounds like the Garden of Eden I'll satisfy her needy with bread her priests I will close with Deliverance The Godly Ones Will Sing For Joy because they're I will cause a horn of David to sprout
 and I prepared a headlamp LED light for my Messiah her enemies will be closed but shame but upon him the crown will shine so David chose the city
 and he swore an oath to God that's connected with the heart coming to the dwell there and then the flip side of that is you always swearing an oath to David that in this city Yahweh will release of Eden blessing and abundance and protection provision notice the protection from enemies and David's desire also corresponds to God's desire to 12 I think what this represents is like the Redemption in the bigger Ark of the story member Jerusalem there was a little blip of the cities of Egypt they can become a source of Life yes but then a quick return in the Next Generation and I think here this would be them the second moment but even more intense than what happened in Egypt with Joseph that you have a wise image of God human ruler
 who wants the city to be the city of God this is like the Redemption of the human City okay yeah yeah okay but let me choose this out a little bit so are you saying the way this is written it makes you think it's still accommodation David shows it and so then God said great I will also choose it to State it plainly was there some sort of sense that God otherwise maybe we don't have it written down but did David have a sense of like God wants me to do that this is God's desire isn't to create a throne room City right now is gone and now it's just kind of hanging out somewhere like it needs to be in our capital city was that David's idea that God's accommodating or was that God's idea right that David
 is being loyal to like who came up with the idea first I love it I love it so good it's exactly the question and that's exactly the little detail that neither The Narrative nor these poems make clear what this point wants to do is say the David's desire corresponds to God's desire and what God's desire is to have a resting place a Heavenly heaven on Earth resting place where he can have a human Royal Priestly partner from whom all sprout a future king whose kingdom will be forever and ever in the evening land God's desire in the second half of the Palm nuts just sat in an allergy to David's desire so what's interesting I have a whole thing that we didn't even get to in the notes long time ago but
 what's interesting is let us not forget that this is the city there has existed already a royal priest came for the most high God in this city long ago because it is and it's too that cities that Abraham came and met the Royal priest-king and paid homage to him and honored him and received in Eden blessing from that King so I think it's a narrative analogy between this city has been just kind of unique spot for the worship of the one true God and it's like David is activating that Royal Priestly Eden on Earth City on the hill type of role but other than that we don't get a donation so you could historically like speculating say will David could have known about those traditions and he wanted to restore the city to be what it was in the days of a
 I definitely think that's what the narrator wants us to see is the David is creating a version of the city of what was true and milk to the next day but story doesn't say there is one other song actually there's a couple of the Psalms Psalm 78 has a moment where it describes how you always chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion which he loves and then he built his Sanctuary there and chose David his servant in Psalms 78 very much yahweh's initiative and choosing the city that's highlighted here in the pain so I'm 78 is a retelling of Israel story in the land and when it gets to the David part it highlights that you always the one shows and the details Mount Zion also contrasts Mount Zion or Jerusalem
 with the biggest mountain actually in that whole region which is Mount Bashan way up in the north today we call it Mount Herman Herman and contrast that with this is Psalm 68 verse 16 the mountain where God chooses to rain where he dwells forever
in terms of why this mountain the story doesn't say but it matched it on to David's desire and God's desire come together resulting in this Redemption of the Canaanite City to become the city of God in image of the city of God
 but I'll take you one more step but it does this plug a hole that's been a gap in your mind well I think there's still a little bit of ambiguity in the well okay if we say look God chose Jerusalem and David was loyal to that idea then when we get to Jesus it feels like a real mess of shift. Intention interesting if we come to the story of David and we go yeah God chose it as an accommodation David's the one who chose it and God worked with David's desire desire but God's desire was always a level deeper than what's the city like where's the city which mountain which would ever but that was an accommodation what God was after was a place where his wisdom
 was manifest and his throne was there so I think there's still some ambiguity there for me I just want to know my time I walk into the Jesus story feeling like yeah God chose Jerusalem I got to do something with the city of Jerusalem it's the one Jesus starts to like talk about the his disciples being the city I'm like what what's happening like how did you get there okay so that's where we need to take a few more steps so even though the narrative about David choosing Jerusalem and then a poem the only pain that really reflects explicitly on that moment is Psalm 132 and once again it just Compares David's decision and desire and post with God's desire and God responds favorably to David's Desire by saying you chose this place I choose it and I choose you and you're lying in this
 I need to become like a new Eden and sprout a Messiah King for the future so what's interesting is we went to Isaiah already to talk about we didn't have enough time to go through the theme of the city all throughout Isaiah but what is interesting is that in those poems and Isaiah that we looked at the city is merged with the group of people called you or the servants and it's these the servant and his followers that are exalted up high to become the speak into the nation's just like the descriptions of the New Jerusalem shining on the hill it's already in the book of Isaiah there's this pairing between if Jerusalem's ever going to be that City on Hill it's going to be because of a righteous Remnant the servant and his servants
 being faithful to God and they all together will become like the new Eden light shining out to the nation's the words to move Jesus is making is not unanticipated it's already there in the book of Isaiah because and Isaiah Jerusalem is already failed exactly and can't lose all this reflection of the prophets about the corruption and Injustice that Jerusalem has caused yeah and that God lets Jerusalem be Unwound by these other nations because of their Injustice and so when the prophets think about will how will Jerusalem be reclaimed as God's Throne as this Throne City yeah it will need to be a moment like what David did a moment when David picks a place of people in a Time
 bring the presence of God there and say this is the city of God in other words think of the transformation of Jerusalem the Hebrew name is called gibbous it was the Canaanite name so what was it that transform ya boost to yerushalayim right Jabba's to Jerusalem it was a righteous seed David who brings God's holy presence into the city plants it build a house for God throws a huge party blesses the people all this food for everyone and God takes up residence there and all of a sudden you have this becomes the city of God we're stumped transformation there but then slowly over time the city of Peace Jerusalem gets corrupted and becomes like a new Babylon and that's certainly how Jesus viewed to rusa limited stay
 and here is Jesus presented as a son of David coming to do another version like of what David did the Redemption of the city so you put Jesus in parallel with all those things Jesus is a seed of David Ernst well he's a he's a c in the line of David that's fine and well David brings the Throne of God up into Jerusalem Jesus is said to be the Throne of God well himself come out of heaven will its interests in the birth story that Matthew has it he presents Jesus and very similar imagery actually very closely making the baby Jesus in the place of the exalted Jerusalem if I have Isaiah Kings coming right light a light shining the light the star comes to Jerusalem you like yes of course because Drew slim is going to be restored and then it keeps going over to Nazareth and all this is happening in contrast to Jerusalem and it
 King which is herot I see who was acting like Pharaoh killing all the babies and will in the other thing is that I was trying to make the parallel to the park is like if David brought God's Throne to Jerusalem in the story of Jesus. The rain is thrown the Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven comes down it comes down here David brings it up God sends a damn and when he got sent it down it's in a person not in no longer an arc seat it's actually incarnate now yeah and so now Jesus if he's also the king and the Throne of God which is this new kind of you know the temple throne room of God is a person name of Jesus that's a huge new like reorientation and then when Jesus says you guys following me your the city you're saying
 that Isaiah was always envisioning a group of Faithful Servants who would be the ones to transform to be the like the new foundation for a new city and that's we just read for my Isaiah 60 but I did say then just was but that Isaiah 60 61 62 or three part litter a bundle
 the two on the outside 60 and 62 are about the exaltation of the city in 60 to the city is described as a woman giving birth to lots of people and then in the middle is the famous Yahweh has anointed me to bring good news to the poor and then that poem that's what Jesus quotes yeah this anointed Harold who brings good news to the poor start turning the pour into the servants like himself that become the ReStore hours of an ancient ruin City and they become like the planting of a new Garden so that it's the people there's a coming and anointed one a servant and a people who become the vehicle of a new Eden and they are the inhabitants of and the members of this new city heaven on Earth that's Isaiah 6062 so Jesus is picking up the cues from my desk roll
 that the city of the people the city is a person the city of the people and so on but what I love about this is I love how you're trying to think about the David store in the Jesus story and I think that's exactly faithful to how I start to work it's David shows the city almost like for the Redemption of the city for the first time you should Riesling becomes this really positive city right and it's God's Dwelling Place being brought up and it when you rules and righteousness and Justice which is said that that's what he does is for a while and then it becomes this image of the city of God is in Chronicles remember the chronicle squirrel in Hebrew Bible it's a retelling of Genesis 2
 the first word of Chronicles is genealogy that begins with Adam and then the last parts of the chronicle school go to the Babylonian exile and then the Edict of Cyrus so the retelling of Genesis of Kings by set of authors who are sitting somewhere in the mid for early 300s b.c. few hundred years before Jesus loves me and they've got most of the pieces of the Tanakh sitting in front of them so the way they retell the story is the Super Hyper length design pattern by nerd out session
the Chronicles retells the story of David selecting Jerusalem and rebuilding trust one there's a whole section in first Chronicles 28 where David is giving the plans the city plans and specifically the plans of the temple in the middle of the city and what he says is that all these plans for the temple in the middle of the city the Lord made me understand in writing when his hand was upon me to give me all the details of this pattern
 and this is echoing Moses on top of Mount Sinai who's shown that having a temple and then he said to write down and build the Tabernacle according to the pattern that you're being shown and this stuff right here in Chronicles is not in Samuel our tanks this is new material so Chronicles is depicting David like a new Moses who saw the vision not just of the Heavenly Temple but if the Heavenly city with the temple at its Center and then you gives all of these detailed plan oh really I thought was a time of the temple plan it is but this is right after he took the city and established it as a city but right now it's about so it is focused on the temple but the temple in the city
 I really joined together cuz the temple is at the crown of the city so it's depicting David as building Jerusalem as an image of the Heavenly City in the Heavenly throne room of God that's a nice little detail to show the David was trying to create a heaven on Earth just like what the Tabernacle was it's like the Redemption of the city but in the form of what the Tabernacle was like a garden in the wilderness now the Jerusalem is like the city of God down in the city of humans
 the parallel team coherent God's desire to build the temple and make that an image of his Heavenly Throne by David getting the blueprint from God's like own initiative is on Parallel with Moses up on Mount Sinai being the holy Divine throne room and then getting the pattern pattern yep to Moses creates Tabernacle David builds the temple Tabernacle can be carried along with you you don't need a city can just be with you know anyway yeah that's right head ball becomes a place where it's like this is where this is going to stay forever but the parallel is that God was behind both and both were signifying yes hit like he was going to dwell here that's right and all of them are shot through with the imagery of the Garden of Eden
 cuz that's the temple and the Tabernacle were symbolic Earthly counterparts of the Heavenly reality that is the Eden the Garden of God so the garden tent or the Garden City so when we get to Jesus and now we've got an image of God's Not Just a pattern but the image of God the image of God coming down and making residents not in the form of a tent not in the form of a city with walls but in the form of a human right but the human being called being depicted in the birth story he's being depicted as the New Jersey and in the Gospel of John specifically
 it's called The Tabernacle called the tower at Ya the God made his 10th among us and so we've now got like almost three versions of God mean residents yeah the Tabernacle Tabernacle at Temple in the city on the hill and then Jesus Messiah and the temple were both patterns looking towards Jesus looking at a Heavenly reality I have in reality that when it came to Earth and it's like fullest sense yes that's right it came as Janice clarification so it's not just that they're symbolic realities of Jesus it's that the Tabernacle in Temple are symbolic realities of Yahweh dwelling in his Heavenly throne room and then the claim of the Gospel authors is that that Yahweh came Among Us in the form of a human too and that's how the Tabernacle at Temple point forward is because
 they're all connecting up to the same Heavenly reality so where we were going to go next was now how is Jesus the Tabernacle become human the throne room of God become human God himself with us as a human how is that person going to relate yes to the Earthly Drew slippers lead rooster Matthew presents Jesus in the story of the famous wise men as be all the hyperlink so that story Place baby Jesus in the spot and all the language of Isaiah chapter 60 and then when you start store in Galilee this is what we did in the last episode Jesus starts tutoring on Galilee announcing the arrival of the kingdom of heaven and Mathieu quotes another part of Isaiah Isaiah chapter 9 talking about a light shining in the darkness which is what that city was doing and Isaiah 60 the light shining in the darkness for the Nations and then Jesus goes up on
 and says y'all are the city of y'all are the light let your light shine to the nation's application is all of the hopes of the Heavenly city of God are now focusing on Jesus and his followers which raises the question that you just yeah it does because yeah this is all set up for you now Okay so we've been waiting for the servant we can wait for the anointed one that's Jesus and we've been waiting for the throne room of God to take residence again we thought that was the temple it's Jesus we are waiting for the Servants of the anointed one to like come and we thought maybe those are the religious leaders that work in the temple where is Seed from the line of David or maybe yeah a future king and here they are there the ragtag group of people will do anything out with that's right so it still makes you wonder okay
 well then the throne room of God become human he could then go and build himself a place to live yeah you would build himself the city did he can Reign Over the city and what better City to do that from then the city of Jerusalem were all of this was the setting of the place that got shows in the place the prophets continued to talk about being at Center Stage when the city of God is done the city of God has gone with Jesus so Jesus should just take residence in Jerusalem all the pieces come together he's he's going to do a David thing again was wrapped around himself and you would think he would go up to Jerusalem
 set up his throne and in a way that is exactly what the gospel authors are trying to tell us what happened but the the way that it happened in the lead up to it was somewhat different and that is what I had planned for the next step in our conversation so what is Jesus's relationship to the city of Jerusalem and then what is going to go down when he gets there and that's the exciting surprising story that the gospel authors want to tell us
 text listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're exploring the question what is Jesus's relationship to the actual city of Jerusalem Jesus clearly understands that Jerusalem has a stand in his day as opposed to the purpose of God and the ships not going to turn around he wanted to be a part of helping this generation turn on avoid the fire in the flood but not only are they not going to do that Jesus knows that he's going to lose his life by standing against the true slim of the stay
