the Bible has four biographies of Jesus to call them gospels and they all begin in a unique way to The Gospel according to Matthew begins with a genealogy that connects Jesus's birth all the way to Abraham The Gospel According to mark it begins right in the action with Jesus being baptized The Gospel According to Luke begins with a note from Luke about why he wrote the biography and how he went about writing it and of all the introduction
 Gospel according to John is the most unique John begins with a highly designed artistic poem that connects Jesus story of the Hebrew Bible and to Yahweh himself John the prologue of personal poetic and powerful killed and then who he's somehow I got this crazy encounters with and saw the empty tomb and it just blew the categories for everything and now he's trying to share with us the most important thing you can tell her before telling my story and this is a prologue introduces Jesus this way in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God it sounds depending on your view of reality it sound like a craft contradiction in logic how could something be with something and also that thing if it's with it it's separate
 who is Jonathan Quick just say I'm inviting you into a different view of reality I'm John Collins welcome to Bible project podcast today I talked with dr. Tim Mackey and dr. Carissa Quinn and together we look at the literary design of the prologue to The Gospel according to John thanks for joining us here we go
alright we are together as a three-person crew again because we're working on the visual Commentary series and so we have him a key item John and Chris are going I guess today we get to talk about a section of scripture which is the prologue to the Gospel of John it's an entire chapter it's it's 18 vs. John 1 through 18 and it's this coherent literary unit that is as wonderful and I'm excited to talk through it with you bringing to a conclusion in kind of our first what for us with the pilot project of the visual Commentary series so we thought about what's a short series we could do to just explore this new medium is doing visual commentary so that's been all around passage in the Bible that are built off of Genesis 1 and themes of creation so this is the only New Testament book that we're doing it'll be the first New Testament book yeah
 Lyra unit they were exploring and what better than the poetic prologue to John because it begins with the same words that's Genesis was the first in the beginning so maybe one way to frame this is for stood back up real quick here so in the New Testament there are four accounts of the story of Jesus and each of them in its own way Miss connected back to the circle of the first followers Around Jesus the people who satisfy followed him around Galloway part of the original Circle and so you know Matthew Mark and Luke are tracing through you know a set of connections back to people who either in that Circle or you know we're co-workers of the people in that Circle so Mark referring traditionally to the John Mark that worked with Peter and Paul Barnabas in the book of Acts and then Luke is following a series of connections
 back to the Luke that Paul names in one of his letters calls him the position so Matthew is connected back through a whole other set of complicated connections but I just one of the four thumbs actually is also the most unique from the other three the other three shared common sources and redeploy them in their accounts and John is aware of all the same stories and traditions but he's given his account of very unique stamp yeah he writes it differently yeah it just feels different and Jesus talked so often differently than he does in the other three and so that itself is an interesting thing you know to explore but the speaking voice that begins the story here is not that of Jesus it's of the narrator who's going to speak throughout the rest of the account and tell the story of Jesus but all of the gospels have their own unique beginning
 John in particular has a poetic prologue that previews the whole story to follow and none of the other gospels have a beginning with quite like this most of them kind of just get the narrative dying in their own ways but this prologue is truly a prologue in terms of its not yet the beginning of the narrative proper it's an anticipation of poetic cast of previewing what the whole thing's going to be about is it like a summary upfront then it's a summary that's introducing you to do the key themes and ideas motifs imagery but also it's placing the story of Jesus and a bigger context it's saying dear reader if you want to understand the Jesus who you're going to meet in here what you need to know is that you got to go all the way back to the beginning what John is going to do in the prologue is essentially blend together a whole bunch of Hebrew Bible
 hyperlinks as a way of showing how Jesus is the reality to which the whole storyline of the Hebrew scriptures were pointing but not just the storyline every important image that you know that becomes a symbol of God the god of Israel the Creator whether that's God's word will God's light or God's truth for God's child got Sun God's glory the temple the Torah
 these are all up like really cool images associated with God's character in the Hebrew Bible and he's not just saying Jesus is the Fulfillment of the story he saying that Jesus is the reality to which all of those images in the Hebrew Bible were pointing he is the thing that all of those are referring to and so it's a little bit more unique of a move then how the other three gospels portray Jesus as the kind of climax of the typical story with the ology and I'm looking at the structure that you outlined here it's highly structured like it's finally structure really two parallel panels six parts it's pretty amazing yeah so I'll make a few observations and see what you guys think about it and maybe I'll say what I think is being clear and then you can tell me if I'm not making any sense
 so it begins with a pretty famous beginning of four short poetic lines in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God he was in the beginning with God after this for political ends something begins that is something that feels like a narrative thread that talks about how in that word with life and the life was the light coming into the darkness then we're told that John the Baptist all of sudden the Pierce and he's bearing witness to the light telling other people about the light then we get the story about how the light came into the world but some people didn't want to receive the light and they want to live in the darkness but then there are some people who do want to see the light and then they become reborn as children of God and so that's the first kind of sequins light enters the world John Bears witness to the light
 the light is rejected by some received by others who are born from above the first kind of sequins do you like that sounds like a pretty good idea of what I got to say first let's just say all of that imagery light and dark creation people humans being born this all feels like I'm in the world of Genesis 1 and 2 starting verse 14 a new movement appears and you can feel the shift in the language and imagery and it's probably more than one of the more well-known versus and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we saw his glory to glory of the one and only from the father knows you're just thinking in terms of narrative the word became flesh and we saw his glory if you're following the narrative flow I think I thought we reader would come to the conclusion didn't that's already happened I thought the light
 already came into the darkness and like was interacting with people if this is referring to the Incarnation didn't already happened back in verse 3 right because we've already heard that some people received him some people didn't so what's happening again this it's a poetic prologue we're actually restarting and we're going to tell the same story of Jesus Incarnation to what happened for now going to do it with a different set of images and we're going to do that now not with the length of Genesis 1 but with the language of the the Tabernacle the story of God's presents coming to the Tabernacle in the book of Exodus so the word becomes the Tabernacle and the Divine Glory they went over the Tabernacle is Jesus then the next step in the story is all of a sudden back to John the Baptist again during witness and you can buy that's already happened
 yeah this is John gets another speech and then you get a third kind of movement to the second retelling of the story that's talking about how we received Grace and Truth through Jesus and then you get a concluding line which is Verse 18
 no one has ever seen God ever The One and Only God who is in the the bosom or the lap of the father that one has made no... That's the whole point is that if you just look at it from a narrative perspective it seems like we retell the same story twice but if you pay close attention it's because we're cycling through the same basic idea the summary of the book you're about to read but through two different lenses as it were so you can think about the story Jesus using Genesis 1 and you get three sister teen from light to light entering the darkness John the Baptist
 some people stay in the dark some people receive the light and are born from about let's take one takes to let's think about this whole story you're going to read in the rest of the book but from the perspective of God come to dwell with his people in the Tabernacle so now all of a sudden Jesus is the Divine Glory light not just the light of creation into a one but he's Divine Glory like he comes to dwell Among Us you get done the Baptist appearing again which from a narrative perspective you like he already came but you're like no no he had a retelling the story all over again so here's John's role he Bears witness and then after that you get a group of we who received the word that came through while Among Us that's like those who received and became the children of God in the first take a second take we receive Grace and Truth and then you get another poetic little before line concluder
 about this no one's ever seen God but there is this one this child of God who's in the lap of his father and that one has made none and then advance so I can think so it just feels artsy-fartsy to make you feel like force you to just keep re-reading it like like it's do with meditation letter and I think that's entirely the point
 okay so I've been packing that so what are the things that seem unclear or maybe some questions that will get us, probing some of the issues here about the structure or just about anything other than any of the content at the structure and maybe if one of you wants to summarize the movement's what you see going on here so you got the two tellings and three in a three-act structure first telling is juices juices light John the Baptist comes gives it when it's the light and then there's the reaction of how he going to react to the light and then that's parallel with the second three-act structure but Jesus at the Tabernacle and it makes perfect sense and then you gave us a chart so that you could actually see those two plays essentially and the axe how they connect to each other introducing Jesus has a light with Tabernacle John bearing witness and then the reaction yeah I just very very clear and then it's so full of all this like you said
 Bible imagery is just packed in here all these hyperlinks so you can just swim in here for for a long time just thinking about the stuff in the first the first plane from Genesis and creation the second from Exodus in the Tabernacle for me is little Oddity that I could never quite make sense of until this hit me like a ton of bricks was the fact that John appears twice doing the same thing as if as if it hadn't already happened and this is just a good rule of thumb when you're reading a story and it feels overly repetitive usually that the guy who that there's some kind of design is a structure half happening that feels funky if you read it only linearly it usually means that the text is designed to be read in multiple Dimensions not just linearly but then also read symmetrically a really good thing to point out because it happens often
 yeah that's what are you just like it just feels clunky and in our English mine's is not how he would tell a story so I can have you told me that detail already and usually the reaction is ancient authors that is so primitive and I can't just be clear and concise different sources woven together accidentally overlapping very prominent view about the composition of biblical literature is it's the amalgamation of different sources and traditions and it's incoherent doesn't make sense and man the in the greatest teachers I've had here are some colleagues of mine Hebrew Bible David Andrew Teeter and William two men really brilliant Hebrew Bible scholars who helped me see the biblical literature is designed to be read both linearly but then also be a multi Dimensions there are often symmetrical patterns were you meant your mind is joining together pieces
 that are connected not in linear sequence but in SS metrical sequence and the value out of that is for here is an example is now as you're realizing that the introduction of Jesus as the light is now connected juxtaposed against Jesus as the Tabernacle and the glory which is like reflecting on that juxtaposition because you noticed this new dimension to the text that's not linear but is I don't know what you would call it to Terrell off yeah it's all so similar to the fact that John a two times and it was interesting the first time it says he came to bear witness so that others might believe and but it does leave you wondering what exactly it's just a short John bore witness and then you get what he said and what he says is the one who comes after me
 has been in front of me because he was before me and that becomes a way of kicking you all the way back to he was in the beginning with God and so but those two little bit about John or actually meant to be joined together as one idea but they've been split apart so you can have a Jon B in both those sequences has a good point to make to that when you hear a petition and if you can outline it or see the text that super helpful but when you here repetition you can consider those things are parallel like this does pieces of the texts these like parallel chunks and there's a repetition but there's also movement or something that's going to be a little bit different in the first part we went from he was the light and now he's so we see his glory and the second part with John you hear that he Bears witness and now we hear what he is saying in this
 a section in the third section we see some people reject him some people receive him and then the third part of that parallel section is just we have received him and then the narrative moves forward after that so there's there's a movement even when there is repetition in it it still pushes the story forward yes and then bill at bills on the tune but in literature that this is something cuz you need to do a literature that I mean I'm sure we'll find parallels it so yeah this was a rhetorical persuasion technique is used in other ancient near East literature it's using Greco-Roman literature but it is used to a degree that as far as we know it was pretty unparalleled in biblical literature in terms of the the volume of literature that's organized both linearly and also in the symmetrical patterns
 yeah it feels more natural to find that at least for me and poetry that oh we can we can recall different sections of text it doesn't have to be linear when I'm reading poetry there could be repetition and I think that's something that's really interesting as I've been reading more biblical narrative is that narrative actually works a lot like poetry in the Hebrew Bible yes so even even when it's telling a story there are these yeah I like Poetic structures well the first one the design of the prologue in this was a multiple academic and popular books on the Gospel of John I came across this way of seeing the letter a design in her book called God dwells with us Temple symbolism in the 4th gospel
 mine blind Mary close the book was the first scholar that Drew attention to this for me it was one of those things where I think about Genesis 1 so much I can't believe I didn't see it but her point the literary design of the prologue to John is exactly the literary design of the creation Narrative of Genesis 12 has a little four lines into action and it has two sequences of three that are parallel to the other one it's the 6 days 6 days Days 1 to 3 and then days four five and six go back and parallel Space 1 2 and 3 in the exact order and then you get a short little poetic dense concluder that is in John Spurlock open-ended so it's just kind of has a little short poetic introduction short poetic conclusion into Triads of three that match each other and the moment she pointed this out I thought it was yes and of course he chooses the fur
 where's the Genesis 12 begin up but he's not just got Genesis 1 on the brand for the language and imagery he's literally imitated the design structure this is really cool so we call how in Genesis when the seventh day is about the completion Begins by saying and so were completed the skies in the land and so God bless the seventh day he said it apart as holy it's very much a note of conclusion that little fender and what she pays attention to is that John's little Ender that stands in the same slot as day 7 is intentionally non conclusive it ends with an incomplete sentence in Greek so I'm just going to read from her and she says the six strokes and strophe is her way of saying paragraph It's a paragraph in poetry Astro a group of a group of lines that makes up a pair
 so she says the six Strokes or paragraphs of John's prologue like the six days of creation in Genesis 1 require one final Act to bring it to completion this act will begin in verse 19 after the prologue as the gospel Narrative of God's final work that began with the Incarnation will culminate in the life in the death of Jesus until the story of Jesus's final work has been told therefore there can be no seventh day to the prologue but you lysing the structure of Genesis but also breaking from its pattern the very design of the prologue asserts there is still something more Yet to Come okay when Jesus is on the cross and his final words are it is finished
 the Greek word that uses is the same root word as the Genesis as the seventh day in Genesis and the and so we're finished this guy is in the land wow so she's convinced that means you get what you get her argument here the GSS death and then the empty tomb is The Seventh-Day completion to the prologue so it becomes a book and around the entire account and it's like New Creation made complete
let's go back to the last sentence of the prologue and then maybe if you wanted to go back and we can unpack some of the stuff going on in the six paragraphs but the last sentence of it in the translation that I put here no one has ever seen God so it's kind of stating a core claim of the biblical tradition and this actually comes from something God said to Moses on Mount Sinai in the cave no human can see me and live now that's why he has to see his backyard and what passes in front of them is the glory of the Lord what he sees this the glory which of course is with John the saying that's what Jesus is so this is John's way of making the classic Jewish Christian theist move saying even when God reveals part of God's Own Self to us it's not like we can never comprehend the Divine being and all of its Majesty we're only ever seeing or experiencing a part so no one can ultimately see God however this story is going to be about how the one and only God
 what does that mean for John The One and Only God is includes the one who is in the lap of the father so in the opening little four lines he called the pre incarnate Jesus the word of God and he's God and with God so not here he's using a different metaphor to make the same point just like a word can be God's word but also distinct from God so also you have a child who's in the lap of the father whose both God and distinct from God as father and son and then the last line is an incomplete sentence in Greek which is that one that is the one and only God who is in the lap of the father that one has and use a Greek word X ago which means we get the English word exegesis which means to bring out the meaning to make known the meaning and so in Greek he says that one has hexagon he's brought out the meaning but there's no object to the verb in Greek
 the meaning of what meaning of who or what and all of our English translations can't tolerate that and complete the sentence object which is he has made him known that is the sun has made known the father and that is what John means but he hasn't supplied the ending of the sentence precisely so that you read the story to find out what the Sun is going to make them what the object of a complete sentence but at the same time it is actually on does with John at trying to do anyway and scrape yeah yeah that's cool so the intro and conclusion to the prologue are making a similar point that the word or the one and only God Heather referred Jesus is being referred to here as the word in the in the intro The One and Only God and the conclusion was both God and with God
 trust God and distinct from God with different images first the word and then second with the Son and the father of the child different metaphors that are trying to get same reality so what's double click on that and talk about that so previously we all three of us walkthrough Proverbs 8 and it's this reflection of God's wisdom personified as lady wisdom and we made the observation that the way probably 8 is designed is to make God's wisdom in the slot of God's word and Genesis one in the spirit in Genesis 1 order out of chaos he does that through his speech and then through the spirit of God the rock of God the God's Life Energy and and we talked about how there's this very Jewish way of thinking about God which is
 when you experience God what you are and you and you mentioned it earlier Tim you can't see God but you are experiencing God not something less than God but it is separate than God or distinct that I've come to find the word distinct to be the only English. This is that says both enough but not too much it is but it's also something distinct from God out to me and so the one images of a word so when I when I give a word that's my thoughts and desires and it's that coming out from me the what's that word comes out its distinct from me it can go do stuff yeah the word can get captured on a page and then it can live outside of my life and then in Genesis when it goes out and it created this is pretty intuitive for you if you say I would like something to drink and then that creates an effect in the room and so may
 then one of your boys is in the room and he hears that word means I got dad there's like a fizzy water in the fridge and then all the sudden your word went out and interacted with another and then like something happened in the world based on this thing that came from you and if you use interacting with you with your son and example but but really was interacting with any distinct from you which was your word that came out and this is at this very Jewish way of thinking about interacting with and Experiencing God God speaks things into existence so God's word go goes out and creates a conviction of the Biblical Portrait of God which is Israelite in to us that becomes Christian is that God is other than creation God precedes creation the God's Own being is the ground and others got a part of creation so anytime I interact with God here
 wooden creation it's because some aspect of God has reached out to me that's not the whole of God but it is a part of God but once I'm here in creation interacting with it and then it becomes a part of me then it's both God and stink from God so it's got the wisdom cuss word it so it makes sense for John to say the word was with God and the Word was God which sounds depending on your view of reality could sound like a just a crass contradiction and logic something be with something and also that thing if it's with it it's separate from it to wish Jonathan would just say I'm inviting you into a different view of reality yeah so I just noticed he's doing heavy duty theological philosophical thinking here in the form of poetry
 quintessential biblical thought you know well what a growing up reading this I think I was much more distracted by Greek philosophy because the Greek word is law God and there's a whole tradition in Greek philosophy around Lagos and so I just really thought John was trying to translate Jesus into Greek philosophy and what it seems like is that was just totally missing the boat like he's using a Greek word but he's thinking in Hebrew sure however I also think he was obviously a very sophisticated intellectual mind that produce this text yeah yeah obviously boggles the imagination to think that he he didn't also know that by using the word Lagos that he was creating an account that would have traction with any educated Greek or Roman whose skin I read some of the classics and Play-Doh and and so on so I think it's more about the job
 John could use the word that has traction in two cultures and mean everything and plied with it and she is that for many English speakers who don't ever learn another language or don't grow up having to be multilingual it's hard to have an imagination to think that you could think in two languages into Quarters at the same time but anybody was growing up multilingual all this is just it's normal and if you're clever you know how to communicate to multiple audiences at once or maybe doing that without even thinking about it they're just using the categories that they they know that are familiar in the world around him yes so quick little sketchy here this isn't a quote from George beasley-murray who wrote the commentary on John in the word biblical Commentary series he's got one quote and he's talking about the Virginia
 the heritage of the word the Greek word Lagos and its history in Greek philosophy of the great philosopher hair Cletus The Lagos is the omnipresent wisdom by which all things are steered it's the Divine words as received by the prophet and it becomes almost equivalent to God in his writings for this Greek stoic philosophers the log us is the common law of nature eminent in the universe maintain its Unity the Divine fire or soul of the universe in Philo of Alexandria so here's a Jewish philosopher who was Headmaster of the Greek philosophical tradition he exploited the concept in Striking way he saw the log us as the agent of creation and he distinguished the longest as a thought in the mind of God is eternal wisdom and its expression in making a form of matter into
 Universe the log house is the medium of divine government of the world it's the captain pilot of the universe according to Philo so there's just as a quick sketch of the word Lagos actually was really active in Greek philosophy do you really can come at from both both of the tradition for sure yeah and I understand what John is doing a similar to the yes I think so the Hebrew or the Biblical Hebrew understanding of of God speech going out creating order and that being a parallel idea to God's Eternal wisdom creating order and those things being almost equivalent to God really really overlapping or just similar ideas of what you're saying is that a Genesis 1 in its own way and now John by activating the Hebrew of Genesis 1 he's saying Genesis one is making a contribution to the same topic
 nothing in his world in Greek philosophy which is what is Ultimate reality and what's the relation of the ultimate Divine reality to our contingent you know constantly changing and adapting world that we live in and so the word log us the word is the word that's used so it's as if he's kind of he wants to show how Genesis one makes a contribution to that conversation to this day and then make a claim about Jesus that Jesus is not worth your background John to say a lot cuz I don't think that would be awesome maybe you have imbalance maybe it was because of your background however maybe the what was really going on in the Hebrew of Genesis 1 wasn't fully emphasized and so what you heard it's about Greek philosophy but it's it's actually both at the same time will I think what I buy not seeing the Hebrew thought I think it was a general trend of me not seeing these Jewish ideas and then we
 going to have Leon Greek ideas and where that got a lot more messy wasn't ideas of the soul and and that kind of stuff but that's a whole nother story for years now
 okay so here's your something interesting also seems like John is using not only Genesis one to try and unpack the significance of Jesus he's also doing a whole biblical Theology of characters in the Hebrew Bible that function as these Divine agents who are God and distinct from God in the same time we talked about some of them so in Genesis one you have the spray is in the beginning Elohim created the sky in the land you have the spirit of a Levine in out there in the dark Waters and then Elohim speak the word the right there of Elohim the spirit of dullahan and then a word that's in Genesis 1 in Proverbs 8 which we did a whole conversation the three of us on Proverbs 8 is itself hyperlink in to Genesis 1 and in the slot of the Divine word and spirit lady wisdom speaks up in Proverbs it says Yahweh brought me forth or possessed me at the beginning of his way
 before is ancient works there I was from the beginning I was beside him so John is for sure drawing on that when he talks about the words that was God and was beside. We're with Scott and also in the lap of the father and that depiction of Lady wisdom as a child growing up With God all things came into existence through that word there's a whole network of text in the Hebrew Bible that talk about this idea so we have the word of God that's Genesis one we have the wisdom of God Proverbs but then also look at this little lion in Psalms 33 6 that says by means of the word of Yahweh the sky is were made and by the breath of his mouth the spirit of his mouth all of their host so the author of Psalms 33 is doing the same thing blending the spirit in the world and the wisdom is all like one and so this is all happening
 it's all happening within the Hebrew Bible itself so did this blew my mind so in Jewish tradition just like it when Alexander the Great did his thing storm the ancient world 300s b.c. and he spread the Greek language already started using the Greek language in the same way in the era before Alexander the Great when the Persians were running the show Alexander of stoled it World Empire from the Persians are Mac form of international Aramaic language so if that's not a native person language native language that they used Aramaic as the international language and so that became so widespread and that early. That many Jewish Community started translating the the Hebrew Bible in the airmatic which is kind of like going from Mike French into Italian you know they're both very closely related so these early Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible are called
 targums Aramaic targums so one of these very early called Target new CD of Genesis 1 I'm just going to read a translation of it from you and then we can talk about it so this was this is the translation made by Jewish Scholars for Jewish communities around what time it's the million dollar question is very difficult it seems to emerge right after the second temple. Which means that it is reflecting a way of reading the Bible from the temple. Around time of Jesus before so you could actually translate it two ways that are making two guys that I think it's on purpose so I'll I'll start with the first one so this is a translation and interpretation of Genesis 1 1 2 3 to the reason Aramaic from the beginning by means of wisdom the son of Yahweh completed the heavens and the Earth
 and the Earth was waste and unformed desolate of man and Beast empty of plants and trees Darkness was spread over the abyss and a spirit of Mercy was from before the Lord blowing over the waters and the word of the Lord said let there be light and there was light according to the decree of this word it doesn't feel like a translation the targum specially targeted need feety it's like gum it's a paraphrase like a message it is as if I did check the first line from the beginning by mean by with some the son of Yahweh completed the heavens and the Earth with all this girl just call now here's the thing is that the word sun in Aramaic is exactly the same sequence of letters as the word create
 in Hebrew what does multilingual word play is going on you could equally translate this Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible to read from the beginning by wisdom the word of Yahweh created and completed the heavens and the Earth which makes a little bit more sense that they would get their first sure but the question is is it that inconceivable for a Jewish author whose steeped in the whole heap Revival to conceive of God's word and wisdom and child son and you like man we're already there in Proverbs 8 wisdom wisdom is a child of the Creator yeah participating in present there and all the sudden John one you feel like I'm thinking about how it relates to the world that has deep roots in the in the Jewish tradition in their way of thinking about God the root in the Bible itself and The Innovation is not saying that
 would interact and enter into a relationship with Creation The Innovation is saying Jesus of Nazareth is that person is that that's where the chakra comes so there's no shocker there isn't because it's a person necessarily it's because it's it wasn't a king who ruled Israel it was someone killed as a rebel how could that be the son of Yahweh the word in the lap of the father and of course that's exactly what he setting up for is that that Scandal and think that's why I think okay it's no range brought her in the in the prologue the whole of each side of the sequences it's about the light or the glory entering into creation there was a venerable honorable witness to John the Baptist who was honored with controversial figure but you know Kings Carriage with John the Baptist thought it did the Pharisees sure did
 cool boy witness to the light but yet the light entered the darkness and a whole bunch of people wanted nothing to do with the White House that work and that's going to be like what's the prize for the crisis that he wants to tell is well that's what happens when the y-intercept the darkness and some stay in the dark and some will find themselves born as new kinds of human yeah what what does John mean here when he talks about the light and the Darkness like what is what are those concepts are I mean I know he uses these words throughout all of his writings I mean I think is you follow Darkness through the Gospel of John it comes up quite a bit and it becomes an image for the the spiritual non-human animating forces of evil and darkness it's akin to the spiritual powers in the Hebrew Bible or the principalities in the powers and Paul's thought and it's the anti creation
 if God's word is drawing people in to participate in the ordering of the world the darkness is a part of what is dragging humans back into destruction and disorder and chaos and so John sees the rejection of Jesus by the leaders of Israel and his execution as an attempt of the darkness to overcome the light and of course with empty tomb in the resurrection is the whole story is going to be about how the darkness couldn't overcome the light at least I think that's what's going on I mean here at sounds like he's already looking forward to the death of Jesus by saying the darkness did not overcome it but also drawing on just those those two may be ways of life creation new creation and in Jesus this new life where the light is shining into humanity and all the Genesis all of this Genesis repetition or Illusion so there's new life and New Creation in Jesus and then there's the Antichrist
 enter the decreation forces of darkness in the world to the light doesn't eliminate the darkness it's sort of like contains it and then everyday contains a cycle of light and dark the darkness doesn't overcome at the sun always comes again leading up to the seventh day that has no evening like all the days when we talked about us for all the days of creation in Genesis 1 have and there was evening morning at it but the seventh day has no evening it's like the light winds on the seventh day and I think that's what John capitalizing on that momentum is there reached at the moment where the darkness not able to overcome the lights more
you know when I read this prologue I feel like John the Baptist the witness is it surprises me a little bit and I'm a Little underwhelmed by the role of John the Baptist like I I think I don't have a good understanding of why it's so important to the authors to put right here central to times that John bore witness like you're talkin about a cosmic conflict good and bad in there and there's this dude John yeah like what's the significance of coming as a witness this is where the historical facts on the ground are meeting with the cosmic narrative the John wants to plug Jesus story into another with all four gospel authors make very certain to give the first moments of the stage to John the Baptist Matthew Mark Luke and John so I think it's this is kind of a bedrock in the eyewitness traditions of when you tell the story of Jesus the first
 we want to say is it all that like when this thing went public it was all of that thing that started with John and so that's where you start the story so to me it's pretty cool cuz what it shows is that he's not just waxing eloquent and doing like Cosmic biblical Theology and just making it all up he's he's actually telling the way we tell the Jesus story anchored in first-century history but he's doing it in like a cosmic tune with the Genesis and exodus so I've come to see that underwhelming b is actually really cool cuz it's anchoring all of this really high flying Cosmic stuff but anchoring it in actual events Illuminating this ancient value of the eyewitness testimony also and the the biography style totally that relies on Witnesses so heavily words and images here in the prologue you can trace them right on through.
 concordance and they become big motifs through so light and dark life and death but the witness so John's the first witness and then there's as big theme of people saying Jesus you know you're your own witness your witness doesn't count in Jesus as well my Deeds are my witness and the father is a witness and and the Samaritan woman Bears witness to Jesus and the witness is the big metal theme in the gospel so his birth and the sons of God the Torah Moses Glory Grace belief those who believe in his name who is also sitting all the key ideas they're going to be at work throughout the rest of the the account can we talk about this verse 14 just because it says significant the idea that Jesus
 is being called The Tabernacle hear Dwelling Place I know I'm sure he has a podcast about that before and I actually that image that comes to mind is that heaven and earth video that we made where it doesn't Jesus become a tabernacle with legs I need to take a few more long walk on this one quite a few probably but more with about how the Tabernacle was perceived Israelites thought about the Tabernacle because the Tabernacle itself was an embodiment of divine Glory not just the cloud that went over it but all the gold and the jewels and the curtain that had the heavens woven into it and so the Tabernacle was itself a kind of incarnation of God's Splendor what this would mean is that when John says that Jesus tabernacled with us or dwelt Among Us it's not just that he
 came and wild with us dwelt wild but it's also that he was the Incarnation of God if anybody wants to know this is really cool resource hits by Scholars CTR Hayward called the Jewish temple in non-biblical Source book so he's compiled together all of the writings were references or descriptions of the temp in all of Jewish literature outside the Bible to kind of put together a how did juice think about the temple and man is mind-blowing feels like they were like John's friends the way they talk about the temple is using very Incarnation all language and so I guess what I think it shows is that John is he's using category that have traction with his Jewish neighbors if they listen to we all know the Tabernacle was like where God meets Earth
 and Jesus was that it's not just the glory Cloud that Jesus is the embodiment of his he's the actual tent that is interesting people and you've described the tip of 42 as this a microcosm of creation that's right where all creation is meant to be God's Temple but it isn't in some way that hasn't come to fulfillment and so the temple is a way to present that reality do a little yeah without the garden imagery in the temple at the center of creation for New Creation New Life
 do you have anything else that you really wanted to touch on 10:00 maybe just a quick thing about the Torah following on the obviously the figure of the biblical character at the center of the Tabernacle story is the Moses is Moses get the blueprints for the Tabernacle but he also gets the law and he sees the glory when he's in the case and that's precisely the moment God reveals himself saying Yahweh Yahweh gracious and compassionate slow to anger overflowing with loyalty loyalty love and truthfulness faithfulness to look at verse 16 and 17 of the prologue is this for from his fullness in his for sure is referring to the word so from the words fullness we have all received Grace upon Grace we've been getting a lot of Grace from the god of Israel for a long time for the Torah and Grace here meaning gifts
 overabundance that's the fullness the overflowing generosity of God and the Torah is a gift what he says he names the first gift the Torah was given through Moses gift number one yeah what a wonderful gift the revelation of God's will some people think this is in contrast to what comes after and so it's like we got the Torah but how much better is Grace and Truth came through Jesus the Messiah so some people see a contrast their right of the Torah is like not a guest in Jesus is The Ultimate Gift and I think that's exactly the opposite of yeah that's that's because of first 16 it says they called both of those things Grace whether whether it's his grace upon Grace or Grace and place of Grace they're both gifts they're both Grace gift number one the revelation of God's will do the Torah guess number to the revelation of God's Own generosity and Truth through the Messiah Jesus and this language
 the fullness are overflowing with generosity and truth the truth. That is the Greek translation of full of this is not only the embodiment of the Tabernacle in the glory he's the embodiment of the character of Yahweh reveal the Moses when he forgave Israelites from the golden calf which is kind of cool to think through this is in this panel this parallel to First Take of the story which is where many of his own reject him he had a rebellion but many received him even to his own rebellious people is to keep giving gifts Ultimate Gift is the generosity through Jesus Messiah sent even to people who didn't recognize him but it was God's gift anyway yeah man this is so off
 every time I come to the prologue I feel like this so much not just deep Theology and philosophy but it's like moving but he's trying to communicate about this guy you know I mean like I knew and loved this guy who got killed and then who he's somehow he had this crazy encounters with and saw the empty tomb and it just blew is categories for everything and now he's trying to share with us the most important thing you could tell us before telling the story of Jesus and this is it yeah I'm struck by how deep and complex it is the illogically how much it references the Hebrew Bible but also how many maybe basic or foundational claims it's making about the person of Jesus like this is maybe where we would go if we want to understand Jesus Is God and His there's a father there's a a son he became flesh and dwelt Among Us he reveals the full person of God these are really foundational claims
 about the person of Jesus and they're also woven into this complex structure that reflects the Hebrew Bible example of a new testament author and follower of Jesus who was so in love with Jesus and so saturated with the scriptures in his mind and heart that when he writes about the Jesus he loves out comes this and yeah what a guest
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're jumping back into our Paradigm Series in the scriptures being inspired versus inherit to someone who comes from a tradition that emphasizes inerrancy what's funky about the term inerrant is it a reverse way it's a negative it doesn't have errors so you could just flip it over and when you flip it over and think about this idea then we come to where scripture itself about spectacular for it but the scripture is truthful
