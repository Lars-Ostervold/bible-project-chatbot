hey this is John and this is Tim and this is the Bible project podcast and this week we are in the second episode of a preview of the Jonah class that is in our classroom it's in our classroom what do we call it we talk classroom we've been doing this for a couple years now and you can listen to podcast you know about it we've been filming classes Seminary level classes here in our studio turning them in online classes and putting them up for free and one of the first ones that we did was on the Book of Jonah we wanted to give you a sneak peek of what that class is like here with some audio so we're jumping into the second episode what is this one of the main point of the session was just to say the Jonah doesn't appear out of nowhere with in the Old Testament not isolated story it actually fits right into the themes and story
 of the Hebrew Bible as a whole in Hebrew the Book of Jonah begins with the word and which I think is highly significant because what it means is its continuing something from like the last sentence I came for it which is just a focused way of saying how does the Book of Jonah fit into the prophets of the Old Testament fit into the story of the Torah and the whole thing and that's what we're going to see how Jonah actually fits neatly into the themes of the whole Hebrew Bible all right that's today's episode in Jonah thanks for joining us.
 I want to go back in this session to launch off of a comment that Jesus made in Luke 24 and we observed it but I wanted to give against and then launches deep into the rabbit hole this week of Luke 24 44 and that's how I remember it 2444 it just has a way of sticking in the brain
 when Jesus is having his Bible Study post-resurrection Bible study with his disciples and he gives that summary of the Old Testament scriptures the Messiah suffering rising from the dead third day so that repentance and forgiveness goes to the nation's Old Testament 101 cording to Jesus notice the way the Jesus refers to the scriptures when he was walking and playing them was walking on the road he called it the Torah and Prophets be called at Moses and the prophets here he calls it the law of Moses the prophets and the Psalms
 so there's a pattern there with the window and how Jesus taught about the organization of these writings and he talks about it in his teachings into into it sometimes has a two-part collection will talk about Torah and Prophets sometimes as a three-part collection tour of prophets in this case the song I could be of just passing interest you know it's just his way of talking about the top 10 songs you know it doesn't account for like the Book of Job or where it doesn't account pending on what comes to your mind when you think of the prophets you may think will be left out the historical books well the historical books are about ancient history of course those wouldn't be about pointing forward anything cuz they're about the past and stuff
 but the fact is there's actually something really really significant here because Jesus wasn't the only Jewish teacher in his time to refer to the scriptures in this way Jesus is giving a standard type of reference to the scriptures that we find all over Jewish writings from the same. I have this handout on how to read a text like the Hebrew Bible and what you'll find on the first page of that handout is two different ways of organizing the Old Testament scriptures in the left-hand column is organization that came after Jesus the name is his name is something that obviously is from the time of Jesus it's a conception of the scriptures called to knock and it's an acronym for the three-part organization that Jesus is getting at here Torah prophets and Psalms some just highlighting the left-hand column here so Torah the Hebrew word meaning instruct
 and that accounts and often prefers that can actually sometimes refer to the whole all of the Old Testament scriptures and number of times in Jesus's teachings Hill quote from the book of Psalms but call it a quotation from the Torah it cuz it means instruction so we can refer to the Divine destruction of all the scriptures or depending on context can refer in the three-part formula to the three sections Satora accounting for what Christians called the pentateuch with the Christian name for it then in the Tanakh organization the prophets notice what the prophets account for Joshua Judges Samuel and Kings which are typically called history in Christian ordering and conceptions of these writings but that's not the oldest conception of them in the Jewish tradition that Jesus grew up in these are prophetic text with Mimi and a little tweaking of our concept of what Biblical prophecy is or at least a broadening of widening so this is a narrative about it
 bills passed from the Divine perspective of the profits with an eye towards where the story is going we'll talk more about how narratives can be a form of forward prostate so then after the narrative for narrative works you get the 15 classic works of the prophets I've been in the Tanakh organization in the last section 7 I got the name the writings and not make sense cuz writings is a pretty generic term and it covers a really broad collection of material here so looks like Psalms Joe Proverbs often recalled the wisdom books are in here but also narrative works like Daniel as any of my Chronicles The Ordering of books within the writing's varies depending on manuscript in history however one of the most consistent ordering of the writing's has the book of Psalms
 reading this third collection and thanks for the thanks for the Jesus reference again the Torah the prophets and the Psalms this more than likely that the is naming not just the book itself but the whole final third collection how do we know this I just have here a list of just a handful of selections of Jesus's comments about the Old Testament and also citations from other Jewish texts from the time. Of Jesus and you'll notice a pattern here the wisdom of Ben Sarah you guys know about the wisdom of Ben Sarah it's in Catholic editions of the Bible because it's in a collection of works that came to be called the dude real Cannon or the Apocrypha is such an amazing but it's a Jewish Sage who lived in Jerusalem around the 160s to 170s BC and he's got the whole of the scriptures in front of them he knows the scriptures like the leaving to say the back of his hands he has them completely wired into how he sees the world and
 he's both offering his own wisdom to the generation but it's one of the first great works of biblical theology that's itself at a different where he's got his whole set of scriptures in front of him and he is sunrise in his wisdom for his generation which is right before the maccabean Revolt in Jerusalem if you know about that. It's really interesting anyway I'm his grandson later wrote a prologue to the book and look what he says he he says he's my grandfather you know it was a master of the scriptures and he says many great teachings have been given to us through the law the Torah the prophets and the others that followed them look again at the captive in the writings how would you summarize that group of what are you going to call it you know the prophets know is it the wisdom books will there are wisdom books in there but a whole lot more so than serious grandson went for the others to follow them so my grandfather Yeshua Yeshua is named devoted himself to especially to the reading of the Torah
 prophets and the other books our ancestors in the Dead Sea Scrolls there's a reference to the Scrolls of Moses the words of the prophets and of David and what book is traditionally connected to David especially the song even though he only is connected to 73 out of 150 lb it's still mainly associated with him Philo of Alexandria Alexandria he's down in Egypt know each other you know and he talks about the laws the oracles and the songs she can see this is a widespread conception so it's one thing the second of all may seem silly to point out but it's good to this technology of organizing text did not exist in this era where these people are talking this is all the Codex and in Jesus day this is brand new and only the Romans Elite Romans and few Greeks have been doing this thing so whenever you see the word book in the Bible you but you need to translate in your mind is scroll
 so just stop and think about this so that these texts exist as a unity in people's minds there isn't one scroll that has all of this literature in one place the temple for sure has all of these Scrolls in one place and there would be synagogues there would be Scholars but it would be very rare for the all of the Scrolls to be like in someone's home it would be a community set of property than threats of synagogue owns and that's where you go to means that how you learn the scriptures is in a communal setting its by hearing them it's by the fact that your mom and dad had memorized most of it and then they sing it to you about every night and you were sighted at Sabbath meals and so on but it stopped and register that point so then for Jesus to be so immersed in the scripture is and have it mentally organized in his mind in this three-part way cuz that's how we think about it as a people so Jesus is not alone in this three-part shape
 and it seems to me that then this three-part shape must have some clothes connection with how Jesus summarizes how it communicates and what it's about another word There's Something About This three-part shape this is going to be my visual abstraction of this three-part shape but this existence in people's minds who grew up on this literature that it exists in their minds and hearts in this three-part shape and somehow that shape is connected in Jesus is mine to its content namely a story about the Messiah suffering Rising repentance forgiveness to the nations in other words the way that our bibles are organized actually preload interpretive assumptions about what the text mean if you look at how are English bibles are organized this is an organization that also has pretty ancient Roots the organization in the average most modern Bibles today we'll go like that pentateuch same as the Torah
 then, large block of narrative books Ralph and conceived of his history and Joshua Judges Samuel and kings are in there but then you got Ruth put in between there and for a very good reason anybody what's the opening sentence of Ruth it came about when the judges government Ruth is down here in the writings which means even though it is in a separate collection mentally that opening lines of glowing blue hyperlink isn't it and you are mentally meant to fit into a relationship with other writings in this collection even though they don't exist on the same scroll but once you understand how the collection works you begin to see how every Parts hyperlink other other parts like a knot karate whereas this organization and our more modern Bibles just take the hyperlink so seriously they put the book
 but the fact is that the Book of Ruth is actually hyperlink to more than just the Book of Judges it's also hyperlink to the Book of Proverbs but that's a whole separate class after this and our modern Bibles, collection of poetry Jobe songs Proverbs and then you get the profits as like a ski-jump at the end but I do think the predisposing with us to think of the pentateuch and the history as about the past poetry as well that's the nice kind of black beautiful stuff and it's wonderful to help us create worship worship songs and then there's the prophets cuz that's the stuff about the future a caricature but I don't think it's a completely wrong one I think that is certainly the way I can see the Bible for many years the past the beautiful stuff and then the Ford pointing prophecy my main point here is just to say Jesus has a different Paradigm a different cancer
 of how this literature is organized and the fact that in this organization you can kind of summarize it down to one basic set of ideas which I repeated many times now but it's Luke 24:47 oh I think the order is significant and I think it will help us answer a different way of conceiving of what these texts are what they're saying that will help us process when Jesus says something like this John is brought up one time and teachings of Jesus actually I'll go to the version of Matthew you can also find it and Luke in Matthew chapter 12 Jesus and just pulling this right out of context here where 12:38 Jesus has been duking it out with the Pharisee since the beginning of the chapter this is my conflict number for so the leaders of Israel are at this point for the first time in Matthews narrative are beginning to reject Jesus even though he's trying to get their attention and the culminating conflict is where
 is a teacher we want to see a sign from you in the context he's just healed two people in previous so we want to see a sign that it's meant to hit you as like cash and so Jesus first of all quotes from Moses the quotes from Deuteronomy 32 from the pain that Moses sang Deuteronomy 32 he calls this generation of Israel and evil and adulterous generation and you want to sign and you're not going to get any sign except the anti sign the upside down to sign the sign of Jonah the prophet just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster so will the son of man be three days and three nights in the hearts of the Earth the men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it because they repented at the my commentary lackluster preaching of Jonah
 and behold something greater than Jonah is here you finish the sentence do you get it let's just go verse 41 there's no punctuation in ancient Greek manuscripts but if they're worried this would be... You see that the men of Nineveh will stand up why because at the preaching of Jonah they repented someone greater than Jonah is here and what are they not doing the doing the opposite of repenting there's an inversion here so you are the opposite of the ninevites and what is Jesus in relationship to Jonah be with me he's not just like quoting the cardboard children's book here he's doing something very sophisticated actually so his generation is like the generation that Moses had to put up with for 40 years he's quoting right from Deuteronomy 32 right here and so listen Jonah do you think Jesus is unaware of the negative portrait of Jonah
 of course not so he knows that at a very unlike a stubborn rebellious Prophet was able to bring about the repentance of Sin City ancient world he knows what the story is about so you can see what he's doing here he's turning the whole story inside out as a way of looking at this present moment so here I am a greater than Jonah and you all can't even like match the ninevites in fact you there's almost nothing here where he's a it's as if he's Jonah and they're worse than Jonah and they're worse than the ninevites Jesus did like Kung Fu Master right here so that's just the minimum it's tough but then check out this party this time and all of this is assigned to them what is that it's a sign here's the sign that you get you hate me and reject me to sign that you get let's just go to the second half of the comparison what do you referring to the son of man being in
 how did the Earth what's he pointing to hear 22 his own death and Resurrection who's going to kill him he's going to get him killed at least two people so you're going to kill me because you're like worse than Jonah and you're worse than the ninevites and then he brings in this Jonah getting swallowed by the sea monster no notice it doesn't say well now that's interesting that's because it's not the word well the Greek word that he is fighting here's the word chaos will come back to it later in the course it's the Greek word for seed monster it's they have a perfectly good word for fish in Greek and this ain't it it's the word monster so ngss conception John has swallowed by a monster of the deep and his journey through the belly of the monster is like unto Jesus as journey through death and out the other side you can take a long couple of a long walk and many cups of tea and just
 think about what Jesus is doing right here so this is what I'm talking about when Jesus thinks about the Torah prophets in the writings and he thinks about one and a half pages that we called the Book of Jonah for him work where instantly into the core themes of the nation's Israel's role before the nation's Jonah is like this some kind of a way for us to think about rebellious is the grill but also a way for us to think about some inverted version of what is realistic posed to be a prophet to the Nations and then here we are with this three days through death into life on the other side and again so here's what I'm after I want to read my Bible Like Jesus Does I want to see what he's seeing not just in the places where he mentions it I want to understand the whole thing this way
 and I think this list three part way of organizing things gets us into that Walmart
 show me the pause question or comment and then we'll take take the next step after we know that the worst sea monster is not well and is the reason I asked many people argue that the Bible is not true because you can't find dinosaurs mentioned in the bible we know that dinosaurs that is a fairly modern word how do we know that the Greeks were not referring to a whale o I certainly think it can account for well but especially in the Hebrew Bible the monsters of the deep are given a much broader profile than just big big Desh although the Hebrew word used in the Book of Jonah is the word fish fish specifically but what's that fish means and signifies in the store will come back to that but I was just drawing attention to is in the Greek representation of the fish here it's not the words this it's a word that conceives to the huge things of the day
 man I still have my boys I've little boys right now and our Sunday afternoon tradition is to watch like ocean documentaries cuz they're just going to see creatures that's why I have to remind myself I have to think myself into a time period in human history where no one's been down there with cameras and so like what you know of what's down there is what you see surface the few people who Traverse the Seas write what you know is what you see surface or what you see wash up and crazy stuff washes up you know from Wales to squids and or little creatures and then you think well there must be a bigger one of that out there that's why I want to honor the fact that the biblical authorized to represent the creatures of the deep from based on their experience you know what I can see is a gray whale back surfacing but if you've never seen one of those on the shore you have no idea what the rest of that thing look like
 pictures is not as awesome as specific as the way we conceive of it is that make any sense to think you hit me like a ton of bricks one day when I was watching my kids and I was like hell yeah if I had never seen this thing under the water who knows what I would think it is anyway we'll come back to that this is the new American Standard translation they do readers a favor when there is a Verbatim quotation or near verbatim quotation from the Old Testament they put it in all capital letters DOE stand out translation in The New American Standard the thing is is they don't always get all of them they don't always notice all of them so there's a whole bunch of that ought to be in caps that aren't and their ego appreciate the sign and the way that I do this is playing on what's going on with Jonah but it's always bothered me in verse 48 says so the son of man be three days and three nights
 in the heart of the earth and then you read to the end of the gospel and it's 3 or 3 days but it's only two nights
 is there something we're supposed to get from that or we'll talk about that the three days Motif in testing or near death stories in the Hebrew Bible and the phrases used to refer to this concept is actually pretty diverse it can be 3 days 3 nights to be on the third day it can be 3 days but not mention the night it's a motif used in patterns stories in the Hebrew Bible and Jesus will sometimes say on the third day when he refers to his resurrection sometimes they say on the third day sometimes and then this time he says which I think I could give us a clue that it's about the concept underlying it as opposed to Earth rotations in the Bible says then he open their minds to understand the scriptures about Luke chapter 24 hour Rite Aid many people can sing the ab by the art of magic they suddenly understood or is it talking about
 open through the scriptures and then suddenly there are mines we're open two thousand year old question about what did the the biblical authors no longer is a Biblical I mean the the authors of the Hebrew Bible what did they know and what how much were they aware of this summary right here that Jesus gifts there will have been some movements that say they didn't know anyting it was all just stories and poetry and or they knew some things but they didn't have any concept that the story of Jesus how it actually went would be the way that it gets filled so it's complete surprise and so that the meaning the followers of Jesus now look back and sees exceeds the human intended meaning but access is the divinely intended me that's one way people frame it up there would be another camp that kind of goes to another extreme to say no it's really important that this whole package deal the Jesus sunrises is exactly
 what the Old Testament authors intended even with if it was fulfilled in ways that might have surprised them they had that basic picture and then there's views in between so not just because I like to be in between extreme but because that's just where the evidence points me notice when Jesus comes up here and meet the first to notice he called them idiots for not understanding the scriptures but then at the same time there's something that happened when post death and resurrection that enables people to see things that in theory they could have seen But now that it has happens it you can't unsee it now and I think there's some combination of both there and I find myself a different seasons of my life kind of being in between those two Extremes in in different ways I have a hard enough time seeing it at even after the resurrection is taking me a long time to work but I also yeah at least try and make clear as we go through Jonah these authors say no way way more
 about how the story has to be resolved and it's not just a matter of them like being like Nostradamus like they look into a crystal ball it's this biblical author's study these texts as they were producing them and they were students of their own history they were looking for how God was speaking to them through their own history and as they studied their history they stopped patterns and the Book of Jonah is like a distillation of the whole story in the one little book and the way that the story has to be resolved if you can you read the gospels new like that I wouldn't really look for any other way for the store this is of course how it had to go but when the disciples are watching Jesus get crucified that's not what they're thinking they're thinking of this is game over which is why Jesus has to have this Bible study so I'm still wrestling with that question and since it's been two thousand years of people wrestling with that my hunch is that are not going to figure it out but if you do let me know I really interested Cynthia
 this three-part structure versus the structure that we now technically have our own Bibles so you said that this structure supposed to mimic Jesus his own rise fall and resurrection and so do you feel like it the way that our bibles are structured now the tracks from that from from our ability to see that I don't think it detracts from it the way that Jesus reads his Bible we will more easily see what he sees if we think about it it's organization the way that that he did let me show you.
it doesn't hand out and this could be a whole class in and of itself but I just want to point out a couple things about this organization this organization of the Tanakh has intentionality to Think Through the technology it's not like this it's not a bounded codex this is a collection of Scrolls that existing community centers and its main existence is in people's hearts and minds of the people that have memorized this text so the mental conception but if you're dealing with ancient scroll technology and you want to create LinkedIn connections between sections are Scrolls where are you most likely to create and give glaring signs that things are connected what's going to be likely at the beginnings and ends with X turn to the end of the Torah with me which is the final senses book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy thirty-four Deuteronomy chapter 34 is about Melissa's death and
 tell nobody knows where he's buried even to this day even on really what you would say traditional views of the authorship of the Torah most people are open to the fact that Deuteronomy thirty-four wasn't about his death and how nobody to this day knows where his I mean he gets his sight of the promised land that he will not get to go into the Lord says here is the land I will give it to the Seed of Abraham so Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab according to the word of the Lord he buried him in the land of Moab and nobody to this day knows where he's buried. Right there a little notice right there nobody to this day should you register there's a Time gap between this day and when Moses died which means that while Moses is mentioned as a writer of a lot of material in the pentateuch their stems from Moses at tradition of prophets
 and biblical authors who have given the final shape to the toilet cuz they're the ones talking to us right now and is not controversial it's just like somebody else was talking Moses was 120 years old when he died his I was not dim nor his Vigor abated actually glowing hyperlink but we don't have time everybody went for Moses and then who takes his place Yeshua Yeshua the guy name Yahweh is salvation is filled with the spirit of God's wisdom Yeshua filled with the spirit of wisdom for Moses had laid hands on him and now everybody listens to this kind of Yahweh bring Salvation since that time no Prophet has ever Arisen like Moses did Moses special face to face all the signs and all the Wonders and land of Egypt against pharaoh and his servants all the mighty power all the terror which Moses performed in the side of all Israel that kind of knows us never yep
 don't ever showed up like him okay so somebody at the end of the Torah is really interested in knowing something so somebody wants us to know that man he know what we need around here we had another Moses but has one ever come nope when's that guy going to come cuz you know what mother said back here in Deuteronomy 18 you know this Moses said in Deuteronomy 18 you know you always going to raise up a prophet like me from among you and when that guy comes listen to that guy and then the Torah ends that Deuteronomy 18:15 the Torah ends and says he had to Reeder we're still waiting on that that one so we're waiting for a prophet to come who's like Moses and all the stuff signs and wonders so just right there the last sentence of the Torah is like a ski-jump Moses did all this amazing stuff and then
 and he got angry and was also a rebel and lacked faith in God unlike Abraham who was also a rebel but at least he had faith in God God can use Rebels who have faith in God but Rebels who don't have faith in God. He can't do much with apparently and Moses was one of those ended when you turn the twins Ronnie and Joshua a scroll descended and you be opened up a new scroll and what do you see in the opening sentences of Joshua well I knew that this guy is named you always salvation and that is full of God's spirit to leave the people into the promised land and in Joshua chapter 1 God tells Joshua to be strong and courageous I'm going to give this people possession of the land be strong and courageous be careful to do all of the Torah
 that Moses my servant commanded you don't turn to the right or to the left the right or to the left just took that away for Jonah where do you gain knowledge of the right and the left so that you can go straight you getting that Knowledge from the Torah that's where you learned God's wisdom you read the Torah and you learn up don't go right don't go left take the way of Yahweh the straight way huge relevance for the book of knowing the right and the left and if you do that you'll have success wherever you go in fact it just listed as the Scrolls of the Torah don't ever let it leave your mouth that you're going to have to have some battles and you should probably know the shape of the hillside we need like launch an attack on Jericho but actually no just study the Bible I said don't do anything else just meditate on the scriptures day and night and that's how you know the straight way I did not go right and left and that's how
 my people will have success but it's just memorize the scriptures all day and that's what we saying here we're here in Joshua chapter 1 and we're being told here to meditate on the scriptures this is for the new Spirit-filled leader we're being told that true success and divine wisdom memories filled with the spirit of wisdom by the engine running begins and things go well for him until he's deceived by the gibeonites with deceptive food and then it doesn't go well let's go if I'm thinking of the profits as a collection of Scrolls and I want to go to the end of the prophets where's the end of the profits if I want to look for the next ending America Malachi for opens up by telling me that the day is coming and then when you're in the profits of the day the day
 coming the day of the Lord day of the Lord and is the day of the Lord in the profits of good news or bad news
 yes yes it's both it depends on how you respond if you want to live in a corrupted distorted world where humans don't bear God's image then this bad news because it's you're going to be consumed that creation is is destroying itself and God will allow it to go that way fire the arrogant and evil door will be like chaff on that day but for those who live by the fear of the Lord was a fear my name the sun will rise sounds like Genesis 1 the light in the darkness sun will rise but it's the sign of righteousness the right relationship with God and neighbor of healing bringing wife to death out of death and you'll go for skipping like Calves from the stall I didn't grow up on a farm took me a long time for this to resonate
 you will tread down the wicked they'll be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day that I'm preparing that's intense hey everybody remember the Torah I'm sorry I just register this don't forget the Torah of most everybody remember the Torah and then all the Commandments and cash it. Don't forget that next point I'm going to send Elijah the prophet before the coming and fearful day of Yahweh and he's going to bring Revival in restoration between the broken generations of God's people are we talkin about a prophet to come yeah so okay we're talking about Prophet to come the prophet here is like we're giving the name Elijah what are the two prophets that went to Mount Sinai in the Hebrew Bible Moses and Elijah and they both went into that cave they both have experiences of Yahweh but very different experiences but that are also similar we're going to come back to both of those stories are very important to the book of Moses
 have a prophet like Moses a prophet like Elijah and he's going to bring rest restoration so the Torah and the prophets and with a forward pointing anticipation about how we need a prophet around here I would prophets do prophecy and God's Divine Council to hear a word from the Lord that God wants to speak to his people but then we've also got this thing here with Joshua one about a lead Spirit-filled leader will lead people into the promised land and if I'm looking for the next part of the collection what school am I turning to know if I open the writings but I think it's the Torah Moses the prophets in Psalms sub just real quick and we hear about this blessed righteous person who is the opposite of corrupt distorted human beings and what is the source of him walking in the straight path he's just a total Bible nerd he just is constantly reading the Torah meditating day and night you recognize that phrase that's a Verbatim
 Joshua 1:8 him he's like the Tree of Life of perpetually fruitful tree just like in Genesis 1 and in everything he does he has success this verbatim from Joshua chapter 1 so we've got a story here emerging on the largest level of this collection out of the storyline of these writings something should be clear to you as a reader you finish the Torah and what you think is did we need a prophet like Moses he is the only way out of this mess the only way we're going to get into the promised land cuz we're going to sit here in the wilderness for a long time actually but we need a better than Moses don't we I just mostly better than most of us failed alongside his successes we also need a new Elijah who was a prophet like Moses but also I'm like Moses and instead of interceding for the people he had a suicidal Death Wish on Mount Sinai can I think of any other prophet
 suicidal death wishes after they have the opposite of Elijah's amazing success on Mount Carmel and he ends up fleeing to Mount Sinai and he wants to die Jonah has an amazing success it is prophetic career and he also ends up going outside Into the Wilderness wishing he could die so what's up with that there's something going on so ji-sub Saint John is brought into the orbit of the macro design of the themes of of the Tanakh Joshua 1 and someone focus our attention in on a number of other portraits of one name Yahweh bring Salvation and this blessed one the righteous one who meditates on the scriptures and is so transformed it connected the God's own life that this one becomes a tree of life to all the others around him someone actually this is in the class on the book of Psalms but someone into our joint introduction to the Book of Psalms and some two is all about
 a king from the line of David the God has appointed to subdue evil among the Nations and to bring God's kingdom over them so we've got a Joshua David and Moses and Elijah and this is just at the scenes of the question here so somebody wants a somebody's inviting us here to see in these narratives patterns were characters imitate previous characters as the story becomes like a template for the later profits and they're either like a unlike him in different ways and Joshua becomes a template of a character that gets replayed and David and unlike him and like him in some ways and then you get Jesus in Matthew chapter 12 we looked at this where he Compares Jonah to someone called the son of man who's the son of man where's it getting who's this character why are they talking about himself in the third person and will he's getting the son of man
 key chapter in The Book of Daniel where Daniels saw a son of man figure Daniel 7 verse 13 and the son of man was getting trampled by the beasts of the earth that are the kingdoms of the nearest begun vindicates him from the realm of trampling and death up to the Divine Throne so he goes out of the realm of death into the realm of life and Vindication to be given to Dominion in a kingdom over all of the nation so we can rule the nations are you with me here this is a paradigm so it's always about one basic thing that's a really diverse collection of literature from all over Israel history representing stories about all these different characters but do you see in these editorial links and in Jesus conception there's just one basic storyline getting replay over and over and over and over and over again with all of these creative variations and every new story just turns out the anticipation more and more and more so that the
 by the time you leave the Hebrew scriptures I think we're supposed to have in our minds you know what we need around here we need an anointed one who will go through death on behalf of everyone else keeps creating a world of death and then out the other side so that life eternal life can be announced to the nation's that's what the kind of thing we need to have happened around here and so my invitation would be to consider that this actually is what the Hebrew scriptures are about this isn't just a Christian rereading of them or imposing a Jesus filter I Think Jesus really means what he says when he says the guys did you read it did you read it cuz if you read it the way it supposed to be red
 won't be surprised
 thoughts thoughts Reflections at this point I may suggest a sidebar why is it organized the way it is cuz this wasn't just thrown together it was thought out and so I mean I agree with you said organization is preloaded with assumption so could you speak to what assumption led to this cuz these are people that studied a new scripture and we're putting it together we don't know the earliest manuscripts that reflects the organization of a modern Bibles or a Greek manuscripts from about the fourth Century ad Christian Greek manuscripts that are codex codices Christian invention and what you can do is then look at how early Christian Scholars and writers referred to the scriptures and you see again evidence even earlier than that manuscript of this kind of organization so it's murky as with me
 things in history most of us are concerned to write down a lot of things that happened in our day-to-day lives we just live our lives you know and they're all kinds of mysteries about what happened to you year ago but even you live through and I forgotten and some it's more in the history of the Jesus movement so the hunch of a lot of people smarter than me and it's my hunch to after spending while thinking about this is that the moment that the Jesus movement became multi-ethnic which is awesome and what it was supposed to do but a neglect and disdain for the Jewish Heritage of the Jesus movement set in like within a couple centuries and all of a sudden things that are a value to Messianic Jews are seeing is not of value to the Gentiles Gentile Believers and it's essentially it's a b the Jesus movement losing touch with his Jewish Heritage that's a pretty broad comment to make on it but I think it's the same by the
 so that if you encounter I mean nobody's owning a Bible like this until like the post-reformation. This is only 500 years old that we all have our own Bible scriptures were community property even in the early Jesus movement and so very few people you know have even a whole collection of Scrolls much less control over how they're ordered and so you can just see how it would happen so it's one of the things were a man that's crazy but there's all kinds of stuff like this in church history of crazy stuff that said in early is not good habits and they get on have to get unlearned you know later on and we'll just have to take that up with Jesus at some point I don't know but here we are. We're tracking with her right now so let's just move forward as far as your question is concerned Allison I'm wondering don't you think it is by Divine Design that the same condition exists in our world today as it did in the time of Christ
 first coming so when the Jews when Christ comes is the Jews responsibility to Proclaim his coming they're given a very specific prophecy that gives them an idea of when he would arrive when this Messiah would come to Jesus or do you think about Pentecost the Jews their job is to Proclaim his coming to the rest of the world and at that time. They had lost sense of what their own scriptures were were pointing to do you think it's by Design perhaps to caution us that perhaps that would be the state that we would be in a pond Christ's second coming as Christians we are the ones who are to be feel comfortable making that kind of assertion in I I don't just because I'd I feel I I don't know what God is thinking
 I've got access to this and like trying to Intuit what Jesus is calling me to do I can my family in on my street and that's that's enough for me macro history of God's purposes there is a pattern and the Book of Jonah is this pattern the people that God has chosen to work with on page one it's humans are extremely frail fallible creatures who seem to get things wrong almost immediately and the next moment he calls another guy is almost as if you can do in the next session Noah same thing it wasn't through the waters and messes everything up like right after he gets off the boat after doing one thing right and then dancing with Abraham it almost immediately gets it wrong in this right after he goes to the land and so that's the pattern of humans are constantly trying to scheme up our own way
 singing God's kingdom and blessing to the world and the kinds of characters who actually become the vehicles of his kingdom are those who precisely come to the end of their selves and undergo a kind of death or an actual death welcome to the Book of Jonah the Book of Jonah is telling us to do not expect that much from humans but also to expect New Creation through a human that will have to come for this whole mess to be sorted out the Book of Jonah is almost like an he's an anti Moses he's an antichrist is an anti Messiah is exactly the opposite of the kind of profit that we needed to bring a resolution to the story and so think just like there's value in watching Hero Stories where like the the hero overcomes challenges and I don't think I'm going to make it and then rescue at the end but there's also value in stories of people who have all this potential and then they fail and then they stay away even more and then they fail again
 and then it destroys them all tragedy and the Bible values tragic portraits they're all over there the cast of characters of literate literate cast-rite of failures which is most of them but they have moments where they're at their best some of them in the case of Joe and I will have a party debate whether there's any moment in the story where he's getting it right but yes thank you whether that's true in the present I'm not sure but the longer I start with the scriptures the more I am some would say a pessimist some would say a realist about my own nature and humans in general but not to make a pessimist about the course of history I think it's to put our hope and someone other than ourselves that makes any sense at all answer the question by showing the that there is a patent and that is that God's people do go off the path constantly and God has to bring them back for
 mission to be successful you should have just said that to expect humans to not be able to do on their own what really needs to be done which creates exactly a Divine human slot for a character who will do what only God can do but as a human is that Incarnation is not a surprise twist it's the only possible Solution by the time you finish the Hebrew Bible yeah at least I think so and perhaps that's why the reminder to meditate on it day and night that it gives us intellectual dependency we never step outside of a moment thinking I'm going to make this happen like I'm going to reverse the narrative for sure not like you see the time and time again if faithfulness and Rebellion remind us the only thing that will survive I think is what I'm on
 I'm hearing is that okay no my demise is just around the corner so I need him I need to be looking for that greater profit from the dead left around devices we end up in the pit with sea monsters selfish stubborn humans and sea monsters that kill us before our time but with the god of the story there's a there's another possibility out and did the Book of Jonah read the first one but we're going to do that at the beginning of the next session so let's pause that's a Big Mac or a saying on the Hebrew Bible where we're going to see is these patterns and we can see a lot more are being worked in the Book of Jonah and very creative and significant ways there's a listening to this episode of Bible project podcast s
