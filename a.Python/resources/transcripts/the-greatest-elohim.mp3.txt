try to think about nothing
 what image comes to your mind seriously think about nothing
 what does it mean to not be a thing
 maybe you think of pitch Darkness
 maybe you picture yourself floating in the vacuum of space aimless lost
 the thing is we live in a universe of things of stars of dirt of trees of clouds but before there were things what was it like for there to be no thing
 I think if we could sit down with like these biblical authors and help them see our cosmology I think they would want us to equate the dark Waters of two home with our modern concept of nothingness
 it is Jonah Bible project and we're walking through a series looking at agent creation Stories the ones in the ancient near east of Israel's neighbors and the one found in the Bible in Genesis 1 and 2 this week we're going to jump into Genesis 1 and read through the first four lines in the beginning when God created the skies in the lab and what were things like well there was a Darkness over the Deep Abyss the Deep Abyss that's the Deep chaotic ocean and in Hebrew it's the word the Tejon The Depths are going to play an important role in the symbolic geography of the biblical story The deeps become associated with all sorts of negative chaos and so it's the first usage in the opening sentences of the Bible that establishes that Facebook picture that the home is something that is opposed to the good order that God wants this world and then
 suddenly the spirit of God is there hovering over the town but this time it's not called to home this time with God in the equation we find a neutral word for Waters the water is in the home or two ways of referring to the same reality but Waters is neutral waters are good why do these two lions are perceiving the water from two different points of view when darkness is over the Earth those waters are two home the chaotic threatening disorder in waters but when God spirit is in the mix power of God's invisible presents those same Waters become the canvas from which God creates life and he doesn't not with an epic battle but simply with his work
 today on our podcast we dive deep into the first four lines of Genesis because in these four lines is an entire universe in fact it is our universe thanks for joining us here we go
 okay we are going to read Genesis chapter 1 together right need to work with us the first couple sentences and then will allude to some other things in Genesis 12 senses got quite a bit show you if you listen to the last episode I'm sorry so let's do a quick recap of those stories then that'll help us keep this fresh as we read in Genesis the Egyptian story of a tomb and the story is he comes out of just water Waters of nothingness he arises from them the waters recede From Him He makes himself be from the waters he's the Primeval Mound that emerges from the waters, right
 he's like this egg of sorts of which everything else then he's like embryonic everything evolves at beginning coming from the water self-generating emerging from the Waters of nothing the Egyptian god creation story and then we also looked at the Babylonian creation story which is a continuation of the Sumerian civilization civilization but what's happening the Babylonian one is there's a chaos Dragon that's right the gods of old established the order of Heaven on Earth out of the waters so having it comes out of the waters this whole old Garden of Gods that's right haven't heard come out yet and you've got the freshwater and saltwater mingling and out of that emerges that's the Sumerian one that's how the Babylonian one begins with t m at Ocean salt water in the opposite of the freshwater mingling and all the gods develop out of that and then you get the first order okay so you get the fresh water.
 yeah the saltwater God they get juicy and then all the other gods which creates the whole world order and then humans are part of that but what happens is that order is now in chaos and the chaos is represented by a saltwater ocean in the Mesopotamian Plains who used to floods and you know the danger of the ocean coming and just taking all the time you know the danger of the flood waters of the rivers and You observe that the coast is just chaos Watertown dancing on the beach every moment of every day at and their ancient psyches they know of times when it tsunamis yeah, I'll get over it that's right things and so the chaos Waters of the saltwater Timmons is a story of her and this just a horde of bad guys demigod kind of terrible creatures of the night coming to
 best battle and just take over it's just as image of the apocalypse and Neymar Duke who battles team on he comes in singles are out netzer up the cast Waters but then she's also depicted as a dragon dragons that live in the water and this one is mad is like going to through the rip open Marduk wouldn't like swallowing them whole but he's ready for it and he summon the wind God for the wind and he's riding a chariot dorm Chariot a storm cloud and then as she opens her mouth to eat them the wind gusts and exposes her like Deli in her heart open throat passageway through Marty shoots an arrow right into her gut splitter open destroys the chaos and then fillets the chaos and re-establishes the world
 half of it goes up into the sky half of it stays on the land to Nomar do is because he won that battle against the chaos Dragon he now is the god that matters and he is the patron God of Babylon he's the one that everyone's Babylonians are like a he's the reason why Babylon exist and he's our. So it's way of portraying Babylon and its God as the hero as the establishment of order and the upholder of creation itself as long as you pay your taxes so we got to ancient civilizations we were both contemporaries to Israel in fact they both show up and Israel's few Generations enslaved in Exile in Egypt Egypt and their oldest ancestor Origins Abraham's family traces its roots to ancient Mesopotamia in Babylon and that's where the Israelites ended up exiled is so these civilizations were their neighbors and
 at times captors have these dominant Dominic stories how the world came to be and why it came to be the way it's right so with those in mind let's then look at how they chose realized yet how their story or the story of creation and we'll find is the Israelites picture of the cosmos their cosmology has certain things in common common assumptions that also important differences that are going to stick out in Greater contrast now
 so let's just take in Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 and 2 stripped out here it's the prologue to the seven days so Genesis 12 structured with kind of like a prologue statement that's what's about to happen and why then you get the sequence of six days that are set into parallel columns we'll talk about that later and then the cap with a seven instead is that brings conclusion to what the prologue to Genesis one is a 7-Day structure so you got the prologue you got the seven days and then there's a little ouch oh and that was how God created so here's the opening four lines and how they proceed it's not poetry but it is poetic how the first four lines work. Poetry Birds but it doesn't bear the features of Hebrew people throwing Ricardo again but they are for poetic lines in the other for pros lines that have lot of electricity in between them I'll let you
 I need a very familiar lines in the beginning of this is already we're off to it's a the one you know in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth another way it could be translated this in the beginning of God's creating the skies in the land but it is that in the beginning of God's creating This Guy's in the land now the land was wild and waste in the beginning God created these guys in Landa tell him from both are having dinner in the beginning of God's creating the skies in the land okay. Weather feels weird not good English English great Hebrew in the beginning of the land and the land was wild and waste and darkness was on the face of the deep abyss and the rock of God
 hovering on the face of the waters yes okay so the opening line of the Bible has really odd grammar and what Karen Rhodes called cimtech there's two options one is it the complete sentence which is what are traditional translations do God created. And if the first time you've been listening to this guy's and land heaven in Earth yes the heavens me Heavens are the skies blue skies and the Earth is as doesn't mean globe and see you off for Sky Zone land because that's get this into the world picture a little more so either the first sentence of the Bible is a complete sentence in which case you have to say Okay so the sentences that follow what's their relationship to that opening line cuz it's guys in the land means everything then the whole universe is created everything I got everything under me and everything over me oh I see I always write as a summary statement
 take it as a heading or a summary oh okay well how did that happen now let's get into else get into it what you have supporting that is in Hebrew narrative there's a verb type that indicates that this next line is the sequentially next thing that happened in other words they have a way of building into their verb forms that this verb is the next thing that happened after the previous verse we don't have any English isn't unique way in Hebron also in Hebrew they have a way to Mark a sentence as outside the narrative sequence and is giving you cite information or sometime pausing The Narrative and giving you background information or Flash backing sometimes they have a way to mark this so every line of verse to is outside of the narrative sequence after 10 standard way to start a Hebrew narrative sentence is the word and and then the verb a certain form of the verb do Hebrew sentences that start with a verb first and the verb
 on the subject of the verb to be and was the land waste in Wild know because every line in verse two is different if you want to Mark a line and Hebrew a standing outside the narrative sequence you do and and then a noun and then the verb in English word order really matters we always have to have the noun in front of a very Brothers you sound like Yoda wild was the recipe for the land was wild and Hebrew you can do both and what order do you put it in is really important that the marker to marker for the sequence of events correct another words everything in verse 2 is actually transporting you back into the time of her Swan so let me try paraphrase paraphrase would be in the beginning God created the skies and the land the land when God created me back up and tell you about the state of the land before God created it to its backing you up
 into the time of verse one and now I'm packing the state of the land God created the sky and how did you do that let me tell you what the land was like it was wild and that's how I have been reading it in the beginning God created the skies in land what was the pre-created state of things what did God begin with how do we get there what you got start with the way I don't tell you what land was wild and waste that's what got started with wild and West and darkness was on the face of the deep the best that's how things got started so let's just stop right there so Genesis 1:1 and to assume that the pre-creation state is a dark watery waste land which is very similar that's how every other ancient near Eastern cosmology Kathy Eaves of the pre-creation state is it illegal here in Egypt and Babylon and it doesn't refer to as a wasteland or dark and the one we read Curtis was vast Waters that represented the pre-creation stay so this is an example where the biblical
 author share in common in Assumption about the non-existence they all described the pre-creation nothingness as just water spear Dark abysmal deep Waters the waters aren't nothing not a narc ology find the existence of H2O is contingent on other things that preceded it like that stars by millions and billions of years but that's how we see the world that's how we knew we should not impose upon their cosmology by saying the waters represent nothing I'm actually restating their cosmology in my turn okay how would you restate it in their terms I think the pre-creation state creation is about God bringing order that's the important thing isn't about making something exists when it didn't exist back that's our modern concept of what it means for something
 exist to be created but for them creation is taking something that has no meaning or order and giving it meaning in order so the pre-created state of everything for them was just water watery disordered water that's the state of nothingness and I think if we were to ask them will what preceded that I don't think they'd have a category 4 it is mology is begin with the watery nothingness hear that is their concept of nothingness I think in their world view this is creation out of nothing their worldview in our language yes that's right we put their worldview in our language its creation out of nothing it's just that concept concept of nothing was totally different than the water because of their world how to go down the land was why the waste is land and then what is called in the next to Lyons is the Waters of the deep abyss and the face of the waters Roseland
 does a deeper best I've been picturing waters on land so like this land but it's in a deep Abyss it's like the ocean floor yes not that they even knew about the ocean floor know if anything the waters are what's under the lamp this is the thing that's going to become land is when the Dryland emerges from the waters that's safe to land because it's going to be come later or not because it is land because on day three that's going to say let the waters be gathered and let the Yaba Shabu dry land appear this way in the beginning God created the world can I see you become land at this point began as it's wild and waste wild and West namely Darkness over an abyss and its Waters in the spirit of God at the rock of God is hovering over it and we got it so the relationship between the first line and second line what they have in common is the word land in the beginning God created the skies in the land now the land let me tell you
 that kid again it was a land that isn't technically land yet but it will be if you can in the depreciation state is wild and West which means uninhabited or so disordered wild and uninhabited in each of those interns going to get taken up in the sequence of the days days one through three is going to dress the wild ordering it separating skies and land and dry land in the waters days for 6 or going to inhabit it with creatures and then in Hebrew wild and ways to has a cool it was Rhymes so the land was not ordered and uninhabitable does have the same thing I do know the alliteration that line and the land was wild and waste is also has some parallelism with the following line and the land was wild and waste and I'm not comparing the two
 is four lines we just compare the first to know I'm going to compare the second the third line the land was wild and waste and darkness on the face of the abysmal Waters oh what is the land that's why all the ways to Pismo water start a business means the deep deep Waters because the Hebrew word for abysmal Waters is the word to home to home and I'm pointing at the name Tiamat on the board find me which is the chaos water and I think defensible position that the origins of the word Abyss in Hebrew to home comes from too much related to the akkadian noun for Babylonian to am I to go home tomorrow to the same sequence of Cumberlands so I'm not saying what I'm saying is a shared language is and the word for
 love hold on if you are a Babylonian reading their creation story would be like oh oh so the dog was hovering over what we think of as the chaos Tiamat here is just preordered state of the lamp yep that's right the Deep Waters and once the land emerges on top the to home is the waters under the land also just in two turns the Hebrew word play authors are constantly pinging words off of each other the word to hum the first three letters there that's the word for Abyss begins with the same three letters as tofu wild disorder when you're reading in Hebrew and these two consecutive lines the wildness of the land is linked with the Waters of the Abyss in the next line so much like the land was wild in a Bist yeah and the Darkness is over the face of the the right now the pictures - mole in Egyptian cosmology The Waters at the beginning are neutral neutral and autism just emerges out of them involve
 running cosmology the waters begin is neutral but then they become diabolical and Tiamat and her assault on the land and so here I do think the biblical authors phrasing things to bring up that negative portrait he's winking at the Babylonian neighbors here with describing the land with a word that rhymes with t m at 2 or so a couple other things that God is going to do is speak to the two home the abyss Waters that are dark and roiling and they pose no threat to God like marjuk really has to face down TMF it's an epic battle from to home here in Genesis one however is the to home remains a dangerous threat throughout the biblical story so I'm just started here just a few examples but the two home keeps reappearing throughout the biblical story the word occurs 36 times in the Hebrew Bible the next time that occurs is in the flood store
 it's where the flood comes from ya so in Genesis 7:11 in the six hundredth year of no is The Fountains of the Tahoe and burst open and the windows of the skies were open so here in Genesis when God is going to put a cap on the two home with the land and he's going to seal off the waters above and then the flood story is the D creation of those boundary lines for the sky is Santa home break out again so tell him the threat in the store but it's a threat that God has allowed men Exodus 15 when God overcomes the armies of pharaoh it's the two home that covers over them as they sink to the depths like a stone I thought it was a river for narrative yes still here it's in the Red Sea and its data home the God allows to cover over and it's a poetic depiction of 71 this interesting the poet addresses God
 says you who have shown me many troubles and distresses you will revive me again and bring me up from the to home of the land because under the land is under the lamb has the grave and it's perfect was that dumb yeah so in the biblical cosmology will get into another video underneath the land underworld it's the grave is in the pit and it's the realm of time of the chaos cousin World ocean in there yeah cuz it's the ocean under the waters understand why they think is freshwater and saltwater creature here at the home is just the water is underneath will you know there's water under there cuz they pop up down then and springs and their heads so the point here is that to home will become a way of biblical put can speak about death thinking opening sentences that have Genesis you have Darkness disorder the abyss of the deep which will become a synonym for the underworld and death itself and these
 are the threats to Creation order is going to do is speak to them at overpower them to think of the deep there's a chaotic threat cuz there's a lot of monsters in there and yeah worms and it's not your place it's I can't live here in there yeah you're going to die and we talked about how in Revelation where they talk about there's no Boise there is no more seen correct in this is why because it represents that and just a wondering since yeah oh yeah is that the Tejon The Depths are going to play an important role in the symbolic geography of the biblical story The deeps become associated with all sorts of negative chaos disordered things and so it's this first usage in the opening sentences of the Bible establishes that basic picture that the home is something that is opposed to the good order that God wants for his world the anchor
 the uncreated state that's right
 so the poet of Psalm 71 can talk about a close brush with death as an encounter with the home or the flood story or overcoming Pharaoh is God unleashing the two home on his enemies that's the basic idea
let's compare lines three and four for still in verse to look at and darkness was over the face of the two home Darkness was over the face of the two home but the next line is matched and the spirit of God was hovering on the face of the waters so there's two lines are constructed in all most precise parallelism you have Darkness on the face of the spirit of God on the face of the waters the water is in the to home or two ways of referring to the same reality but Waters is neutral the two lions are perceiving the waters from two different points of view when darkness is over the Earth those waters are two home the chaotic threatening disorder Waters but when God spirit is in the mix the power of God's Invisible Presence the same Waters become ready to go forward and water is good why did you see life because the word for water there
 the number to home correct the word Waters is the word ham I am so it's weird to picking this visually you're right it's not a globe we're just looking at like the Egyptians in the Babylonians the pre-creation state of the waters from one perspective darkness and when the powers of Darkness are over the waters it's the abyss of uncreation and disorder but when spirit of God is over the same Waters then you call the waters by a different Hebrew word am I am at the Mayan bring life they bring life and growth in vitalization to Thirsty people so it's the visual picture has not changed just what time are the two perspectives powers of Darkness versus the spirit of God the abyss vs the Waters of life in school so this is significant because the waters are going to play a key role in the next creation story in Genesis to buy the water's coming up out of the Eden Mountain that are going to go out from Eden and then water the rest of the world and the water is come up as a fountain.
 rate the garden so here's to Scholars commenting on the waters here in Genesis 1 verses guy named Michael Morales says water is commonly conceived in the Bible and ancient near Eastern literature as a symbol of the opposition of forces of life in ambiguous symbol of life and death water is symbolic of death when it's uncontrolled but he got too much or too little is in a drought but it's also a symbol of life when it's a controlled it provides growth infertility so the waters are a perfect symbol of life or death of order and the disorder this summarizes the movement from Genesis 12 where the waters are dark and abysmal to the Waters of Eden in chapter two of the river coming up out of the land the land sits on top of the waters which we haven't got to you and then the water is now controlled Go Mountain Water eaten so from Genesis 1
 the chaotic Waters of the dark abyss to Genesis to the fruit defying rivers of Ethan means creating fruit that's one of those fancy words you kind of know what it means immediately but it's still really there's a statement in the Hebrew Bible this decisive control of the waters is the prerogative of God who Sovereign over death and life in this sense the Deep abyss of Genesis 1 signifies the negative threatening aspect of the waters while the spirit of God hovering over the waters represent the positive aspect of water under God's control so again thank back in Egyptian storytelling the waters are neutral pre-creation reality they actually are responsible for creating everything they're the thing out is with us but Autumn himself the god that is their creator emerges out of the water in the Egyptian the water is our Primary in Babylonian cosmology you have the w
 where is out of which, the old gods who established the world and then the waters are so powerful they threatened the world tiamat's comes out and threatened everybody so in Genesis 1 beginning out of the gate you have all these lines about God and the water's pre-creation stages Waters the waters are abysmal and dark negative but then God's first appearance is he's in the midst of the waters by spirit and then all I have to do is start talking and the waters do exactly what he wants them to it's precisely in opposition to these other cosmology he's or in dialogue with them the Genesis one starts with all the stuff about the waters by the Genesis 1 start with all the stuff out the waters about to skip over it and not even asked why the waters because it was no category for it so one of the things I notice is that and then neighborhood contemporaries the water is before the god
 the god comes out of the water out of the waters in both Egyptian and Babylon in cosmology is correct and then this one there's God exists and the water exists right because the water is their concept of nothingness of pre-ordered creation free creation nothing in the thing that's going to come and bring order doesn't come from the water cuz it's already separated the waters in other words the dark Waters of the Abyss in this cosmology aren't nothing there no sing sing Miss is that which God orders to keep saying that I know hard for me it is hard the dark Waters is the absence of order I get that absence of order and where there is disorder there is nothing in his disorder that there's no sex with in this cuz Mom's real well not from our cousin ology where there's disorder there's no life has no meaning and if that's what you mean by nothing more life has no meaning
 if that's what they mean and we're saying that's nothing would it be better for us to just say no life and no order instead of nothing so what's underneath this is what John Walton I think he revived as God would say it is too philosophical word we're dealing with conflict of ontologist so your ontology is what you think constitutes existence what does it mean for something to happen to this town to be and in our modern cosmology to be means to materially exist and in these cosmology is to exist is to exist within a cosmological order meaning so in that sense I think if we could sit down with life these biblical authors and help them see our cosmology I think they would want us to acquit the dark Waters of two home with our modern concept of nothingness think so I think that we mean by the dark Waters is what you mean by nothing
 what do we mean by nothing but I think that's enough I understand the concept of nothing I mean I think we intuitively think we do but you break it down and what does that mean it just means the absence of a thing cuz of the absence of something is not something that's right nothing is not a thing in the universe even empty vacuum of space is a reality that exists within space that's the closest thing we have did nothing cuz it exists which is itself a thing if you took out everything else in the universe all other matter and you just had the empty vacuum of space it's still a thing was it empty vacuum of space is just what's left over after you're the Big Bang things of expanded so far it's the space between things space between things which is itself the thing is there bass part of the space-time Continuum which is the thing I see if you put something there in that's
 is it would be subject to gravity okay the forces okay so even there is a thing we have is connected to our closest contact with nothing this would be to reach the edge of the expanding Universe right and to see what the universe is pushing out into four billion miles away pass ultimate too late or whatever that having to pay attention the last object floating in orbit of our son question is past Pluto Pluto Pluto not sure it's cool it's two pieces of ice that have merged together to Spears merged what's this one called satellite I forget the satellite name but it passed Altima
 New Horizons probe and here's the thing though yeah it took a photo of 36,000 miles an hour passing each other in space speeding up as it goes I don't know the answer but it's some kind of frozen ice rockball Ultima Thule I think each of those is when the name of the Spheres one is Ultima the other one is to lie I think it's A Spacetime all this day I think this is important to me some reason it seems important to not use the word nothing because that and then presupposes our parents and Old Point is we're trying not to do that in the whole point of time with you. Using the word nothing absence of Life what the water is present is the impossibility
 of meaningful human life and love and Community existing that's what the waters are in the way of a mean where are humans going to live if all you got is water's correct there's no place and I think also this isn't an idea of waters where there's like some cool at Greenlife underneath necessarily is just like know the dark abyss is nothing but where the spirit of God is the abyss becomes to transform God's spirit but actually hasn't changed in just was changed is whether or not God's involved involved so you got this state the image that has to have his water but let's take that away and just think of just pure chaos where there's no life and there's no order and what's the best thing we have for that like a good question I'm not sure
 listen our universe but I think like a black hole give you the same kind of this role like what goes in will not come out there's no order we just don't know it just sucks in life sucks and everything nothing gets away with the scariest thing I could think of and he looks Amigos Miller near us but you're picturing this thing that's just chaos life list absence of life in order that's one possibility is it state that its natural state then you add to it. Presents and now all the sudden that thing is full of potential correct a state of disorder and unproductivity can with the mind of this beautiful being become full of the presence of that the absence of potential but with this being the one who can bring life out of death
 and make things that are out of what is not to Portrait him you think that's what I should be sensing when I read those lines that's what the dark chaotic Waters Darkness was on the face of the deep Abyss yeah well nothingness disorder disorder on productivity and chaos meaninglessness meaninglessness but then the spirit of God is now over the face of the waters waters are the abyss the abyss is water's not have power over the abyss to transform it into something that can has all the potential for life do these are the opening lines of Genesis what's the rest of the Book Savvy about stupid humans making horrible decisions that need God's presence that reduce people relationships and communities in two states of death disorder and violence in every iteration of characters in the book of Genesis you see God taking their stupid decisions and doing Judo redirecting it and bringing the waters the life-giving
 something out of the chaos the whole point is the natural state is to be unproductive in disordered and he's the beginning State and he orders it and keep it as an order that I ordered it and it just keeps going and these cycles and so all of a sudden every state of order and beauty is a sheer active the generosity and Grace of the Creator it all comes out of these first two lines in hair does the universe literally Universe opening on it
 you know to get to that Insight you don't have to spend a lot of time in the Egyptian in Babylonian I don't have to just add more 3D but we spent like an hour and a half
 this is a quote from George Landis another scholar has done a lot of work in this comparative cosmology stuff with the Bible he has a question is Genesis 12 describing the water is as dark as to whom the abyss is Genesis 12 intentionally alluding to the motif of God's conflict with the rebellious Waters or is the idea simply of God's control and authority over the waters for the purpose of utilizing them in creation am I supposed to see God in conflict with Steve no other Clues to suggest the writer may have had in mind the more violent concept it's best to see that God's moving about the water's moving above the waters in power to direct an order so it's not a battle it's his Candace disorder is God's canvas I can buy for my duke disorder is a threat that he has to deal with for Yahweh
 just his neutral canvas he can make the abyss work for him so to speak and that is like the ultimate kind of power yes this is why you able to go to something that is in complete disorder and turn it into potential in contrast to the Babylonian conception where Tiamat has to be slain and annihilated before the cosmos has created the biblical picture doesn't portray the destruction of the waters or the abyss rather their control and ordering by Yahweh within the created Cosmos then he knows me says also has a similar connection to Egyptian creation Traditions accepted in Egypt the god emerges out of others so the portrait is that God can make the unproductive state of disorder work into his purpose to bring about ultimate order it's not a threat to him if you think about it however these opening lines are the only thing that create plot conflict in Genesis one knows where there's no telling
 tensions within the chapter watch God doing his thing it's like watching Dion
 does gay mean happy
 Bob Ross there's no conflict in that shut up
 except for in the opening line there's a little bit of like I guess this could all not be here and it's ordered States that's that's the conflict is the potentiality of non-existence conflict is if a creative powerful being didn't do anything we would be all you have is a disorder disorder which anarchism ologies the cattle they are his canvas in the beginning how do you read that the beginning of what is done the important work here in Hebrew there is a word for is more specific point of time then begin to sequence the word tehaleh receipt refers to an unspecified period of time it can be used to refer to a long periods of time Joe can refer
 the whole period of his life before he is suffering as his race cheat to the previous period of time yep the previous period of time before the time that is the main focus that's the receipt when I first time at the most regular you said just refer to unspecified periods of time sorted unspecified period of time before what we know as now and how things are just now God created and there when we think of the word created we think of bringing something out of nothing else but in the ancient mind creation was an act of bringing order out of disorder do in an unspecified time previous to know God brought order to everything below us and everything above us the lion in The Sky how did that come to happen what was the state what was the canvas with which God begin Cova wild and waste dark abysmal Waters
 Southwest Stark abysmal Waters aren't there how am I am it's not a problem there Waters it's not something to fear or dread it's a canvas for intentional of life so how did God bring that potential out of the dark Waters and got sat in here because he spoke to it and it does what he said his Royal artist acted as the Royal artist because a king all I have to do is say hey do this and nothing will get done and artist is the hardest so the first thing that God does is to address the Darkness Darkness was the first thing that defined wild and white Darkness was over yeah that's right and so God himself becomes the ultimate source of light and he calls the light day God becomes a source of God said let there be light but there be light that there be light and what is the light God called the light day. Of time
 now the darkness that was already there yeah it's already there and now the darkness is contained within an organ system that he is determining by providing white so the darkness he called night and there was evening and morning all the sudden the darkness isn't a chaotic Forest it's just a. Of time that gets its say who got the water you got Darkness hovering over darkness and then he contains the darkness 21. Of time night and the rest of it now has a light and what you're saying is what is that like the only other thing in the equation is the presence of God himself so I'm supposed to as a reader be thinking that the light is God himself I think so because it's going to get screwed it in before the sun becomes an image of God's light Monday for John the Visionary in the Book of Revelation is tracking with all this actually sold Isaiah Isaiah depicts the New Creations he says God himself will shine seven times brighter than the sun ever did
 nutrition is and then John God's purpose within an ordered sequence of darkness is contained and now you serve my purpose which is to perceive the time when I bring quite as the whole story The Bible even right there in day one. Of Darkness the God allows as the vehicle through which he brings about the light I mean why does John 1 begin the light in the beginning was the word we're just with God and the Word was God he was the light and it was light of men and the light comes into the darkness yeah that's right in the darkness can't overcome in the darkness and or understand also God's in control of the sequence of Darkness and Light I mean even when they're sequined times of Darkness God's not lost control of the things.
 Let There Be Me Now know anyways just saying let Darkness now be contained to just the night and it fits within an order in a sequence of like Ruby ordered a Time yep time yeah in order of darkness and night and God's the one who do everything else when he says Let There Be he's providing something other than himself right let there be a separation between the bars let there be a vegetable or whatever plans and stuff in that the sun in the moon and stars this one let there be light would be the only time where is not actually anything he's putting into place he's not making photons there isn't a theme being made here it's rather God has let there be light and then you stablish has the darkness will only get the time allotted for it and sequence of day and night and day and night or not seems either their periods of time their meaningful for humans
 the powerful theological statement about God's will for creation that in its natural state apart from his presents existing disorder and darkness
do this interesting God saw on day one after the light in darkness he pronounces it good day to let the waters be separated from the waters from the recchia from the Dome and God has not called anything good on day 20 it doesn't the day 3 let the waters recede to their place let the dry land emerge God saw that that was good and they forged like to Goods right three it's too it's too good because then they should come in for Humanity light ordered time they to Waters from the waters yeah that's the problem we need that but came from those two areas is no net gain for humans on that day I said it's cuz we're humans needed in the water and his land and food on the land and so you get double good until 3 to make up for the note
 and there's seven Goods in the story writers are seven kids in the story yeah so the water is separated from the waters again this is where Babylonia and is looking for the slain Tiamat slay the dragon and in the dragon is the waters ciccarelli's midea same idea but God's not fighting anybody all he does is speak and the waters as what he says it's a single Horizon the chaotic Waters and then God separate set some Waters go above the sky down that's why it's blue with white waters come down from its insides blue cuz it has water and then there's going to be the waters down below and that's day too and then day 3 is the dry mouth and emerges like I tell me what is he create the Skydome they to let there be the sky dumb but in the middle of the waters and then and then let it separate the waters above from the waters below and so if you're new to this cuz we haven't talked about me to cosmology the ancient view is that above us is a dome and he's worth snow globe that's helpful in the sense of like a big oaf
 searching dumb and above that is Waters again through sometimes that's why it rains and how to get up there God separated the primordial Waters and put some up their water separator from Waters but not a net gain a two and a three is not too dissimilar from our Egyptian neighbors as Autumn that the mound a rising up out of the water so yeah so on day 3 at God's command yeah God's not emerging the waters God commands the dry land to appear as the waters recede and this is the land of Genesis 1:1 was referring to the land cydaea is the waters are receding from it and in the world picture the abysmal waters are still underneath it so it's envisioned as a mountain disc now floating on water is underneath it
 and therefore the pillars of the Earth founded the Earth on pillows and become an image in the Psalms does first thing dry land and then the second thing on day three is let the Earth bring forth cost to go out vegetation plants yielding seed and fruit trees and I wonder if your tree is there going to be an important role in the store and it's already that pun intended there being seated right here on a Monday 3 so they went through three are wild the wild wildness has been ordered has been ordered as 123 and now you've got land floating on top of Seattle to spend it on top of chaos Waters and the cat's water has been split in half and some or above the sky dome and then is vegetation of water surrounding the disk and then the waters under the desk under the land and his visitation on the land and it's all good
 still uninhabited put out no longer why every part actually days one through three each one resonates in conversation with the Egyptian and Babylonian the separating the water is similar it's the same but different is God's Rod doesn't emerge from it. Exists apart from it and God doesn't see it as a threat and I guess the battle as he sees it as an opportunity so this first step to bring the order is to contain the darkness within a. And then to generate source of life into the darkness which is his lights he campaigns of darkness and then he separates the chaotic Waters at half which are Babylonian neighbors would recognize like what you gots what marduke dead ride is Sky chariot
 and yeah I can take all the wind blow it down the road of TMI and then shoot an arrow split it in half off late open and that was A Hard Day's Work the days where I work is just to speak and it was so such a contrast and then day 3 let the waters below the heavens gather and let the dry land appear and you're Egyptian to go and wait a minute autism is the dry land our God is the dry land and your God just speak to the dry land and the water is but that's what he will leave until 3 and it's not referred to as a deity in any way the ladies ride or anything else in the only thing arguably in Munich on to it and talk about is today for things correct yeah that's right
so the super cap on this Psalm 74 here's how we know Genesis one is crafted and worded with an eye towards all of these other custom ologies multiple times in the Hebrew Bible Psalm 74 is a classic example you find an Israelite poet accessing and drawing upon these Battle of Creator versus the Dragon Story Sun 7474 begins with the lament from a we saying oh God why have you rejected us why are you angry and he goes on to save Jerusalem's been destroyed but us is Israel in Israel Jerusalem has been destroyed Mount Zion In Perpetual ruins the enemy has damaged everything in the temple they lifted up axes smashing with Hatchet and hammers burning your temple to the ground first nine we don't see any signs
 there's no profits explain what's happening we don't know how long how long will the adversary revile us and your enemy why do you withdraw your hand there's twelve yet Darkness to whoever her God is my king from of old so with in biblical face even you look into the face of the most horrendous disorder you remember you know this is the natural state of things to go this way this is where surprised to God's Royal creative power he works Deeds of Deliverance in the midst of the earth and here's the line you divided the Sea by your power to split open to see you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters of Leviathan
 reptile figure which is in the Genesis one but there's no talk of God we're remembering this poet's conceiving of creation within the Babylonian type of terms what else is it it's an Israelite biblical poet drawing on the Babylonian marduke come back to put in your way in the planet Yahweh is in the role of my dick and then look you broke open Springs and Torrence you dried-up ever flowing streams yours is the day you was also is the night if I can come back and forth between the Hebrew 1 in the Babylonian 12 did overcome Tiamat he is more powerful than TMS and so he saying listen even yours is the day but yours is the night that's very similar to Genesis one where the night is contained
 so he's remembering the creation was up like a battle but we were just got done saying Creations not like a bad I'm not according to Genesis one so why is he referring to her as a bit these can both be contained within the same Bible and that's fine with the framers of the whole Hebrew Bible they're both perspectives that are valuable apparently most of the psalmist here is recognizing in the Babylonian mythology our creation story that marduke had to slay the dragon and that was a battle and then split open the drag in not just similar to splitting up in the sea and he sang you know God the one who ultimately really did that but in Genesis 1 the way you did that wasn't a battle is artistry yeah actually you know what whatever I said a few minutes ago I think I want a new on speaker. Just occurring to me I think evens here in Psalm 74 we're getting the core claims of Genesis
 one still worked out even here in the mar dook story in the Babylonian cosmology I mean things could really fall apart if Tiamat gets her way she's got her armies of scorpion man and if he doesn't if he didn't step in and Genesis one comes along as just know not only are the water's not ultimately a threat to God they're threats of creation terms of nothingness but they're not a threat to God and he contains the darkness and put the cap on the abyss and it makes it serve his purpose or something similar here I think we sang listen Jerusalem just got destroyed by the Babylonians right is this a moment like marduke like you're being threatened Yahweh Babylonian be Babylonian God is Marduk so they're all getting here
 Genesis 1 my God is factual king and the sea monsters right that Margie thought you crush them but then he says yours is the day yours also is the night babylon's unleashing chaos here in Jerusalem must serve some purpose within your order of light and darkness I think that's what he say that's beautiful even this darkness is something that because you are the ultimate power in the universe it must serve some role in your purpose it's not a threat to you it's because you've allowed it this time of Darkness that's what he saying I get that why then does he say that y'all way broke the head of the monster in the waters off because he didn't you never did that well in a way when he separated the waters from the waters because that's the same kind of thing that I was doing well and more than
 your God who you think just one against our God his decisive victory that made him the Supreme yeah. And your mind was him slang the sea dragon and separating it the water but our God is the one that did that but it wasn't actually a battle it was just him saying so it breaking the head of the monster was him just saying what the frame to the sea monster and a five correct in Genesis 1 the concept is the waters Waters they obeyed God's command and where does the sea monster to the Babylonians fear in the God's world and one for the sea monsters being brought up in the Tiamat role as a face to the chaos and the poet says not even this isn't the ultimate threat to you but all the same you do have to you can see he wrote Genesis 1:1 doesn't have any sort of violence associated with God
 separating the waters but Marty does when he does it and it's so the psalmist here is saying that Marty breaking head of my stuff our god did that and when Genesis one is writing this cosmology the way that it is it's actively aware of this kind of the Babylonian yeah and choosing a different way to frame thing so that their God has no rifle I love that line the day is yours and also than off of the night that's a very similar way of saying y'all way contains the darkness in Genesis 1 he allows it. And can fit purpose but ultimately he is the author of light and got so many Mysteries Mysteries but it's so many profound images here so there you go
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to look at the second creation story in the Book of Genesis the first narrative and the second narrative in Genesis aren't coordinated and juxtaposed in a nice linear sequence there's actually describing the similar type of story but from a different angle with prospective students this one is giving you from chaos and disorder to order and Cosmos in the seven day timeframe and it begins with pre-creation chaos Waters here it's just one long day there's no time markers in Genesis 2 and the chaos is not a ocean water but it's a desert people notices for thousands of years did humans come last in Genesis 1 humans come first in Genesis if you'd like to submit a question for upcoming question response series we'd love to hear from you record yourself asking the question keep it to about 20 or 30 seconds and let us know your name and where you're from and you can email
