throughout the story of the Bible God is on a mission to draw near to humanity to dwell among us and this is the gift God gives Israel when he feels the Tabernacle with his presents and what is real discovers is that God's holiness is both good and dangerous now that God has come to live among his people not cause of the crisis cuz there's a collision between God's holiness and the impurity and death among Israel God provides an answer in the day of atonement for Israel sins are cast out into the Wilderness and this radical gift it makes a question if the Holy One the source of all life and goodness and Beauty lives in the middle of our camp how should we live how should we treat each other what we find is that God gives many rules and rituals and at the heart of all of them is God's desire to transform Israel and at the center of it all is a practice we called the Sabbath the weekly Sabbath
 and then the monthly annual rhythms teach the Israelites that their lives and their time are not their own that their whole existence as a people is dedicated to the purpose of becoming whole become holy as I am holy Sabbath is about resting but it's more than that it's an opportunity to stop providing for yourself and to trust that God will meet your needs and so perhaps it won't be a surprise to find out that while God gives many practices to transform Israel Sabbath is right at the center the practice of chastised for the vulnerable practice of mercy and generosity and of personal moral Integrity they're all bound together as one way of life with one story underneath them and so Sabbath and Holiness are really in next to Cabool I'm John Collins today Tim Mackie and I begin the third movement of Leviticus we talked about Holiness love for God and neighbor a surrendered life a life of mercy and just
 and at the center of it all. Thanks for joining us here we go
 hello Tim Nisan hello hello we are in the Book of Leviticus we have been a little bit we're beginning the third movement of Leviticus in this our first conversation at 3 on the 3rd I got a conversation number seven three sets of three conversations is also kind of biblical right so difficult right now yes this is our seventh conversation on Leviticus in time for many people the fact that you could wring out of a book like Leviticus so much
 I'm using a metaphor like ringing water out of a you know like a washcloth. I feel like the washcloth is still pretty soaked oh yeah oh yeah no skimming the surface to use a different entirely different matter for so yeah we are here entering into the third and final movement of the Leviticus it goes from chapter 17 through 27 and I think my first helped to just do a quick overview of the whole scroll and how it fits into the Torah but then also the previous two movements cuz I had a real coherence and closure moments and so when we come to look at 17 we opened up a new Verizon in the scroll is a significant step forward in the developing themes in argument of the book yeah and we are going to focus in on just one main theme for the section there many things going on and I'll play too
 guidepoint different things out but the main thing that corresponds to a scene video that we met and of course bonds to the readers Journey that was created for people to experience within the Bible project app the focus theme is Sabbath Sabbath Sabbath where the seventh day the video we made is called Sabbath but it's about The Seventh-Day run throughout the whole story of the Bible she'll be tracing that theme will be tracing that theme and the app you can also unlock that thing and we're going to see it at work here in the third movement yes I live in Connecticut first let's get a bird's-eye view before we dive into the details so the Book of Leviticus began from the Launchpad of the last paragraph of the previous scroll which was Exodus and their God came to dwell and live among his people Fire And Glory hovering over this
 sacred tent the got built at the foot of Mount Sinai and the relationship between David and his people however is has already become fraud problems cuz the people have already broken the Covenant relationship they made with a God who wants to live with them like within 40 days of having agreed to it that's the golden calf episode worth backing up even further just if someone's coming in Mount Sinai God's people beg for me to every situation that is good in the beginning God created the sky and the land
 so the biblical story begins to trying to invite the reader into viewing the world and have it in a particular Way by telling the story of our world with a particular take a slant on this land goes like this we live in a beautiful world packed full of potential that has been ordered just why it's not a Perpetual it's organized chaos and God has appointed among all the creatures of the land one particular species to be a partner an image of God's character and purpose you're the world human beings are given an ideal setup and abundant opportunity but also are faced with a choice about how they're going to partner with God and rule the world on God's path the humans make a really poor decision
 but not entirely of their own doing their deceived by dark mysterious force of evil at work trying to work us purposes and so are the human rulers make a stupid mistake and find themselves separated from the life and presence of God that wants to dwell on Earth that's Adam and Eve exiled from Eden which is like a sacred Garden on a mountain by slice protected Now by Angelic beings and fire the place that they were what you're saying is ideal setup yeah which the Bible cause of garden yeah yeah they no longer have access and sexy guarded by angels and fire yeah this is a story about like Humanity's Origins yeah it's also the introduction to the Hebrew Bible which are the scriptures of a particular people group so it's the introduction
 to the story of the world but told from the vantage point of this people group and its convictions about the world which they believe are a gift from God. They believe how they tell the story is how the god of the universe tells the story quite a bold claim believed about the Scrolls but that's getting way ahead of myself so what God does as he allows human Folly to keep spiraling because he honors the Dignity of these image parent creatures but at the same time. Keep stepping in to prevent the worst from happening until the violence of humans get so out of control that allows the world to descend into chaos and disorder and so just as God brought order by separating the Waters of chaos the beginning God allows the Waters of chaos to collapse back in due to human violence Cosmic claps
 otherwise known as the flood otherwise known as Armageddon was another kind of flood but in Greek the Greek Septuagint the word flood is translated with the Greek word Kata Clues Mass which is where we get our English word calculus
 that's where we get Kris Kringle Kris Kringle but a cataclysm cataclysm cataclysmic disaster oh so the word flood that is a cataclysmic event to the collapse of order in the cosmos however what does a single out one family from among that kind of clothes moths and threw them gives them a new chance to do the Garden of Eden rule the world has got the partner on the other side of the cataclysm that's Noah and Noah and his family replays the failure of Adam and Eve and their children of the cycle starts beginning where God keeps selecting one out of the many gives them a chance to represent him and partner with him they blow it ushering
 their Community their family and their own lives into violence chaos Strife of some kind that God honors honors oh well got honors humans decisions to screw up their lives he doesn't step in right away and not all the time sometimes but not all the time which is really annoying for a lot of biblical Arthur's that's why there's so many times in the Book of Psalms that began with people frustrated with God like why do you let it go on this long do something deliver save those are people that are watching the Cascade of human violence and evil spiral there watching the flood watch and innocent blood soak the land like before the flow for the wedding and they're asking for God to rise up and do something bring evil to a cataclysmic an but save
 you're a chosen ones so that you can fulfill your promises through them so this is a Melody that's on replay over and over and over again replace many times through the Genesis Crawl Through The Exodus crawl now in Leviticus God's chosen one family out of all the nations family favorite ham and appointed them to be his kingdom of priests and a holy nation you brought them out of slavery through the Wilderness and then to the foot of this mountain Mount Sinai so they are got invited all of them actually this is really relevant for the sectional of a cat's were talking about God said all the people in Exodus 19 we read this passage many times over the years but it is super important is Exodus chapter 19 verse 4
 God says to the sons of Israel you all have seen what I did to the Egyptians that is your oppressors and how I bore You On Eagle's Wings I carried you through the Wilderness and I brought you here to myself at the sacred mountain now then yes you will Shema Shema listen listen to my voice and keep my Covenant we're about to enter into a partnership with secret agreement so listen to my voice honor the agreement that we're about to make and then if you do that you shall be my special possession among all the nations because listen all of the land is mine I could work with a lot of people here that I've chosen you you'll be my special possession and y'all will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation and those two concepts are key for this third in
 final movement of Leviticus Kingdom of priests there are priests from the line of Aaron Aaron is Moses's brother he's the high priest we met his for kiddos that's right so God selected Moses his older brother and his four Sons to be the priests within the kingdom of priests yeah so if all of Israel are Priestly representatives for all the other nations then within the kingdom of priests there is a special family of Representatives Representatives within the representatives idea of being priest than priests is that anywhere else thought about it talk about in the Hebrew Bible that everyone's supposed to be a priest in some sense explored on the other side of Leviticus in the stories of numbers that we're going to be looking at in future of conversation but there
 it's clear that God's desire is to pour out his Spirit on all of his people so that they all could speak the words of God to each other and listen to the voice of God but because of Israel's continual cycle of failure and Covenant betrayal God keeps selecting out a smaller and smaller group among the family but still calling also it's idea of within the many who are all together to be representative priest before the nation's he selects one particular family
 and the way the priests who work in and around the 10th and all of what they're doing is a ritual liturgical drama that symbolically tells a story about who they are among the nation's so who the priests are among Israel is a ritual drama showing all the Israelites everyday what Israel has to be among the Nations
that's cool and that brings us up to speed to and where we're at in that God gave them designs for this yep tent the Tabernacle and this is where all this ritual happened somewhere God himself comes to dwell and it's depicted as a portable micro Eden the microcosmos and it where it's both eaten but also an image of all the heaven on Earth God came to live among his people and fire cloud and it's good but it's also dangerous and so when the cloud touches down over the 10 at the end of act act to the scroll Moses the one who has been going in and out of the divine presence on the people to have he can't go in
 it's sort of like you buy a brand new car looks dark and then the first day right that you likes ya you go to drive and it's yours and you like the doors won't unlock. You can't get in get in get in so how do I get in this is how you batteries are dead so Leviticus chapters 1 through 7 the first movement is God giving to his new batteries for the key fob you know they're actually there's a little key in the fob if you ever use that isn't mine to yes I had to call the dealership and they had to tell me about that I like how do I get in my car. I like to the key in there to him in what we call Leviticus 127 a whole network of symbolic offerings
 they also tell a story of Israel's complete surrender to the presents and will of God about fostering an attitude constant gratefulness giving back to God what God has given to me but then also an invitation from God even though the Israelites are morally flawed and betrayers of the Covenant God wants them to come here and so he gives them the substitute animals whose life can be offered up and surrendered on their behalf of a blameless life can die and so rise up to God and smoke into the Heavenly throne room and appeal to God on behalf of people who are not blameless and got says all except the intercession of that blameless substitute so that you all can lift near me
 my good and dangerous presents the take away that I love come back to you on that is that why all this was a normal ancient ritual the other nations that do this to trying to like a piece of the gods they never know like is this enough like in my sacrificing enough or need even like cut myself do I need to text message kid like they're just kind of like all this drama around like how do I know that this is actually going to be on the side of these are presented as a gift from Yahweh saying like here's what you could do and know that I will be with you that's right yeah God says in Leviticus 17 which will start with in this conversation God says I have given you the sacrifices to cover for your failures which is backwards yeah normally it's a human offering a sacrifice to God and God says no I've given the sacrifices to you to give to me
 because I want you to come here and mess yeah that's the heart of God revealed here in the sacrifice is not Frank's that's the first movement of and so the second movement begins with the tent being inaugurated the priest being ordained in a 7-Day ritual that Echoes Genesis 1 so Aaron and his sons become like the new Humana recreated over 7 days to work in the new Eden and on the first day on the job but it's pay Aaron's sons decide to just rewrite the whole liturgy and a class of their dad by doing what God it ask their dad to do but just deciding they're going to do it on the Run by taking unauthorized incense fire into the 10th
 and so in Leviticus chapter 10 those Sons die God's good and dangerous Holiness consumes them in Fire and they did so by passing by the curtain with Angelic Trivium on it and then they're consumed by the Divine Fire by reflection of what would have happened to Adam and Eve to just crash back into eating yeah the fire and chair being the guards stationed at the boundary of Eden are represented by the ultrafire and the cherubim on the door to the tent so they go in doing what's good in their eyes and it does not cook it for them and so now you've got dead bodies inside the most sacred Place dedicated to life and holding us in Purity and goodness so big problem they're so will God says to Aaron Burr after that whole debacle is first hey no drinking on this job to haul no drinking alcohol when you coming to do your
 Priestly duties that's one thing reason being is you need a ripe mind that's clear and is able to make sober and wise decisions about two fundamental categories that are important for Leviticus and for the biblical story on this is Leviticus 10:10 to 11 so that you can make a distinction between what is Holy and what is common between what is pure and what is Emperor now watch this what follows in Leviticus 11 through 15 is 5 long chapters about purity and impurity in particular and it's all about how the priests are to teach the people about purity impurity we talked about that that length now as Israel becoming like the health teacher kind of like their pastors Israelites
 learn how to honor the laws of Purity and impurity and there's a lot of impurity surrounding the sacred Temple dedicated to life and purity of in the middle of an a people and so what. Also provides climatically is the day of atonement that once a year all of the impurities and Covenant betrayal and sand of Israel is known for and that the tent is purified once a year from all of it and you like okay that Purity and impurity thing we've got a handle on how to deal with that the member got told Aaron that you need to teach the people about to Binary sets the first is Purity and impurity but there's another one back to Leviticus 10:10 so don't drink on the job so that you can make a distinction Not Just Between the pure and a bit between the holy and the common and that is the summary of Leviticus 17 the end of the book to a third movement is all about
 separating between Olean, link, so what's interesting is movement to begins with a story that prepares you for the whole rest of the book all these new laws essentially yeah the rules about pirating and Purity that launches Leviticus 11 through 16 and once in Purity has set of guidelines around it we come back to Leviticus 10:10 and that we learned that the priests were all supposed to teach the people about what is Holy in common and that's the main theme of the third movement of the box was kind of cool chapter 10 literally give me the program for the table contents are you do the pure and impure but then we pause and we look at the day of the Lord are starting the day of atonement yeah you're more right than you know really I wondered as soon as I said that if you were going to say that the Ya-Ya what is the day of the Lord in the process except the cataclysm
 cataclysmic collapse of the cosmos on the forces of evil whoever they have to be but then the preservation of Remnant out the other side to be the seed of a new humanity and Isaiah is Jeremiah Ezekiel did Hebrew Bible say it so amazing and so we just talked about that and that's right in the center of the book so we do the Purity laws day of atonement and then on the back side of the book in the third movement focusing on Holiness and the profane he has the King James yeah that's right 17:27 you know right now it says it's a live project for me of Discerning the literary Design This section clearly it's a section for the many other Hebrew Bible scholars to 17227 of Leviticus is a big climactic movement of the book
 the debate is what is the intended literary organization within that section and you can make a very persuasive case that there are three parts to the spinal movement can also make a really persuasive case that there's too so I'm on the fence as of the day recording this conversation then I hope that more clarity on this thing about a month or so after working on it more but right now I'm just going to go with 3 17 through 20 does have a meaningful kind of organization that has teams around it was interesting in this section 17 to 20 of Leviticus is it begins with a whole chapter on sacrifices and we've seen a lot of these of Echoes the first
 seven chapters of the book coca withdrawal about that in chapter 17 opens with the similar language as chapter 1 be on with the school and then went 17 18 19 and 20 all focus on our guidelines specifically for the priest and all of the people this is the first time in Leviticus were all the Israelites are addressed by God everything before has been either to Moses or to Aaron and his sons the priests so now we're moving out that this is now calling that's going to be placed on all of the Israelites Kingdom of priests and if you are doing like word count the words for holiness
 just leap off the page in the section there in pink in my study notes and this just like pink everywhere from all the way in the final movement Colinas though when you cut 50 virgins because here's another factor for Holiness is the words for holding us are connected to God's commands and the section is overwhelmingly dominated by the number seven in like every way you can imagine so there are seven sets of commands for the priest in the people in chapter Seventeen to twenty-two and then Within chapter 18 19 20 21 middle of 21 first-half a 22 in the second half of 20 to eat those has sets of laws that are all grouped together in numerals of seven usually 2 * 7 but sometimes three times seven to fourteen or Twenty-One and that leads to the last
 part of this movement which is Chapters 23 through 27 and it begins with a discussion of the Sabbath on the 7th day then outlines of the seven annual Feast of his realm and the Seven lamps are the menorah that the priests or the light day and night and then the Sabbath bread that's to go in to the tent and then the seventh year of the release of the land and then the seven-time seventh year of the Jubilee so you can feel the crescendo and this is a part of how the whole Leviticus scroll is architected on the pattern of Genesis 1 building up to a climactic 7th 7th Day rest that's why we chose the Sabbath team is 7 is organizing principle for chapter 17 to 27 and you could just come right this way
 God has come to dwell among his people the tent has been purified by the day of atonement are purified you mean the tent has been in according to the logic of chapters 11 through 16 has been vandalized polluted by the sins and impurities of the Israelites and so once a year the day of atonement washes clean the reset the reset the sins that have polluted Israel included the 10th or exiled in the form of a goat that sent out of the camp do that having been accomplished that's not the end of the story though all that accomplishes is that God can live among his people yeah but what's the purpose of God living amongst people
 so that they can be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation or that's the program holy meaning of like set apart set apart to be in proximity in service that's right and if you set apart to be in proximity to the source of all Beauty and goodness and Justice and Purity in life and that's going to be in to transform every aspect of daily life among the Israelites and that's why God start so dress all the people now and so we're going to find here are laws about the daily lives of communal experience of living in an ancient Israelite Village for camp and how people are to relate to God and how people are to relate to each other this is the section where Jesus found the second most important command in the Torah which is to love your neighbor as yourself that line comes from Leviticus chapter 19
 yeah so lots of rules around marriage around sex around treatment of the most vulnerable especially the elderly people with disabilities the pool for the Immigrant in orphans special focus on them in the way Israelites Society was structured those were the groups of people that most often became vulnerable that quickly there's going to be laws to safeguard the Holiness of the priests among the people and then there's going to be all woven into their lives these rhythms of time
 and all and patterns at 7 is it a feast the weekly Sabbath and then the monthly annual rhythms a Sabbath teach the Israelites that their lives and their time I'm not their own that their whole existence as a people is dedicated to the purpose of becoming holy become holy as I am Holy actual and Jesus is Calling the section of Leviticus be holy as I am Holy is a refrain in this this movement of Leviticus the Jesus Thrift on in The Sermon on the Mount by saying be complete as you are my father is complete use different word there because it'd be perfect if you have my father's perfect and it's translating the word what Greek word Tallahassee Tallahassee how much means complete is that the way you would translate to Hebrew word holy know it's the way you translate the Hebrew word blameless
 play unless all right baby I was Jesus doing that's a whole rabbit hole for all the people of Israel now that God has come to live among his people and not cause of the crisis cuz there's a collision between God's holiness and Purity and impurity and death among Israel day of atonement resolved that so now what should it look like in the daily lived experience of Israelites and if the Holy One the source of all life and goodness and Beauty lives in the middle of our camp how should we live how should we treat each other that's what the second that all about
 now
 this is kind of what many people hope the Bible will be for them only this Charter Holiness rulebook tell me in my contacts give me all the goods how do I do this write me the list of rules to listen to Immigrant publicly shame a deaf person love your neighbor as yourself you know copy paste
 they're also going to be laws in this section which are when you get to Orchard don't eat of the fruit for the first three years dedicated as wholly to the hours for the first 3 years. OK Google, set about sexuality are found in here statement about not having sex with animals are in here so we need to remember all biblical literature is ancient literature this part of our Paradigm literature in its wisdom for all later generations without the people so we are not the first audience of these commands of these commands are the ancient Israelites Escape slaves who are having their identity reformed in the transition between the bronze and iron
 you know a nation are East and these laws are dialed into that context and so to Simply copy and paste without doing your cultural background homework likely lead in the long-term or even in the short-term too I think this application to see if some of these laws so to wisdom literature there's Divine wisdom for all of God's people have any place in anytime but we will hear that wisdom by learning to read this in context literary context in ancient context and you can see Jesus doing that and you can see the Apostle Paul doing that by how they draw upon a quote from the section about using the server the mail expecially doing that yeah that's right and Paul when he did it kind of famously with don't muzzle the ox yeah he did it by quoting from a law in Deuteronomy about how to treat your animal and he takes it as a wisdom reflection on how to compensate l in a local House Church
 with the increasing throughout history have taken as wisdom for how to compensate for the clergy and other Church structures so we're all using the Bible as wisdom literature the point is to become Piper we're so we're going to do in the rest of this conversation and then in the next two I just want to campus out in different parts to see how the themes of Holiness and stavis are intertwined you're supposed to do and then also there's like love your neighbor as yourself and be nice to people but within the storyline of the tour in Leviticus the practice of Sabbath the practice of justice for the vulnerable to practice of mercy and generosity and of personal moral Integrity they're all bound together as one way of life
 one story underneath them and so Sabbath and Holiness are really in next to Cabool here and so that's kind of what I want to point out in a second
 okay real quick list just reader touchdown on the opening section of this movement Leviticus 17 verse one then Yahweh spoke to Moses saying Speak to speak to his sons and speak to all the sons of Israel so again this is the first time that in Leviticus that all the Israelites are being addressed to them this is what you always has commanded anybody from the house of Israel who Slaughters an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp or anyone who Slaughters it outside the camp but doesn't bring it to the door of the tent of meeting
 to give it as an offering to Yahweh in front of the dwelling place of Yahweh that person will be reckoned that the murderer she not supposed to slaughter animals other than sacrifice has solicited Israelites in the wilderness we can't just take us out of narrative contact while they're in the wilderness traveling through the Wilderness is one place to put your animals stay positive by any animal that you do butcher you need to present it first as an offering to Yahweh and noticed the list of animals in Ox a lamb or goat these are the three main categories of animals that are offered in all the offerings so every life that you take to provide for yourselves first surrender as an offering to me before you get any of the meat in return
 it is a different type of offering isn't like yeah it doesn't say what category of offer idea cuz there's four different kind for it it just says any time you Slaughter an animal to provide for yourself as we travel through the Wilderness whether you do it outside the camp or inside the camp first coming dedicate it to you always this why we pray before meals so the reason for 5 is that so the sons of Israel bring their sacrifices that they were sacrificing out there in the wilderness because a lot of shady sacrifices were happening out there they need to bring all of that to the doorway of the tent and sacrifice them as and then here we get the category so I forgot about this as a peace offering peace offering is one of the main offerings where most of the meat is for the person offering its right and it's a way to kind of reconcile with each other it's a way to offer an animal to say
 thank you to God but then you take the meat of the animal and you invite people and have a big party and say yeah you slaughtered animal agent world you're not putting it in a deep freezer LOL you're throwing a party and everyone's going to eat that's right yeah you kill it at a party and are you going to do that out in the Northern parts of the unknown God that's right and here's the reason why or 7 so that they no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to The Atrium that they prostitute with out there in the wilderness so who's this
 the Arium the Serene Serene we talked about what was the other guy as as well as in the previous chapter 16 mentions a Wilderness spiritual being named as all-powerful God whose name means a powerful powerful spiritual being who is out in the wilderness and you send the goat loaded with the sins of Israel out to him like a garbage truck dark ways to take our sins take our garbage you'll enjoy this send it back to where it came from so now we get an image in the next chapter is good meditation literature technique where you are and like what's that all about when the next chapter you find out why
 you know the Israelites have just been really tempted to go out to the Wilderness and offer sacrifices out there to the game so this is Irene not eating sorry I've been unclear it's the the words to ear to ear to ear means goat horse word for hairy what you saw is called and so to dress up like his older brother Jacob puts on the animal skin out of here that's right so it's some sort of spiritual being a spiritual being referred to as a goat and when you put an email at the end of something like the seraphim is put on a thorough so lots of debate about the dream and
 they are mentioned as desert dwellers dangerous desert dwellers elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible where it seems like it's just referring to like goats to take up residence in the wilderness but here seems like these goat figures refer to something more yeah so like I would be tempted as an ancient Israel I go like hey let's go bring this animal out into the Wilderness a sacrifice of you this go. Dangerous out there where we are the danger dogs yes we are in those little Camp a little place an order with a little Eden at the center of their it's dark just dangerous we've been out here for a long time and he always keeps providing for us this guy who bred the Mana what the what is it from the skies and you'll lead us to Oasis but you know we could cover our bases and appease the wilderness.
 there we got the priest doing the Yahweh thing let's go take care of this to go. So that's it so the Israelites are tempted to shore up their own security by offering animals to the gods as Wilderness and so you always like okay I would how do we do with us okay. Buddy any animal that ever gets killed for any reason always bring him here when we're opening to the theme of sacrifice is not fairing so this is a link back to chapter one but also now for the people everything that I consumed first been dedicated to Yahweh who is my sole security and and provider this is a habit you always asking the people to engage in but it's a form of habit and so you made the joke about is this what praying before meals is about but it's the kind of true yeah right that's a that's a wisdom response is this
 yeah because we don't have the temptation to go and sacrifice things to like go demons should per se but there is a propensity towards saying okay y'all way provides and I should make sure that I am Diversified in like all these other ways and which means chasing after all sorts of other things ya potentially even things that contradict my loyalty to you that way I know that the way that I'm making money is a little shady but you know it got to butter your bread somehow yeah and it provides and it allows me to do good things for my family and my community yeah so what you doing there is your meditating on
 core issue of the heart write the motivations of the heart of the Israelites that are exposed here and you are creating a wisdom principal what is a bring everything and so this is why it sounds crazy but like any animal that you don't dedicate to Yahweh and kill it to end either has murder is like murder this is like where Jesus was the law to take Commandments in the sermon I'm out do not murder and then he says I tell you what anybody who insults their brother saying you empty head will be guilty of murder how to make each other so where did Jesus get this idea that you could equate something that's not a capital crime with murder I guess here we are if you take the life of an animal
 but use it in your own eyes and dedicate it to something that actually your improperly taking the left panel and you're dedicating the life of a precious animal to some force or ideologies or something in the world that is actually a part of the problem here it won't bring life it actually brings death the other you know the sacrificial system back then there was a high respect for Animals I mean he's animals are like enacting this really important role for you and their nourishing you and part of the reason why this improper sacrifice is it into murder is in the next statement here which is in Leviticus 17:11 which is another lie about any Israelite who consume blood will be cut off from the people of Israel
 this is kind of cord a kosher law draining the blood from the meat that's right 1711 for the life of the flesh is the blunt and I have given to you all on the altar the blood to cover for and purify you from your sins it's because of the blood being the life that's what makes it sound so the blood is life so don't consume the life of a creature as if it's yours first drain the blood from it on the ground but if you do that then you're like Cain still in Blood on the ground
 so what you do is you take that life and you dedicated to Yahweh and you say Yahweh you gave this animal to me this animal really Belongs to You its life is yours not mine and I receive it as a gift and I take what you've given me as a gift and I have a party this is a peace offering peace offering and I invite all the people around my tent and share with what God has given to me and ritual forms you to see the world in a certain way that's different than just I can do what I want I can take the life of these creatures and dedicate it to some other loyalty is pretty profound
 set living to 17 wehunt gotten stabbed as yet yeah I know but it'll pay dividends for what happens after this so what follows is a 3 chapter unit what we call Leviticus 18 19 20 and it's our Triad I organized as a symmetry in fact most of the rules articulated in chapter 18 are restated almost verbatim in chapter 20 of cuts like wait a minute I just read this but it has this effect of surrounding chapter 19 and we'll just read the opening and closing of 18 chapter 18 begins speak to the sons of Israel and say to them I am Yahweh your God you shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived nor are you to do what is done in the land of Canaan where I'm bringing you you shall not walk in there statutes
 so you came from an Empire that has their own rituals that has their statutes their way of walking and you were going into a culture of Canaan that has also an established way of living in the world and you are to be a kingdom of priests and holy nation so you are to perform my Justice and my statutes live in accordance with them I am your God and so you shall keep my statutes in my Justice because the human who lives by them will have life Leviticus 18 5 Paul the Apostle love this line equips it few times and has letters so people who follow the word of God who live by the will and command of God will have my wife I'm in the Garden of Eden teaches you that story this isn't just talking about the specific rules that you always giving them in this context it's also a reflection on this med
 yeah yeah when God gives a command following the command brings life brings life and here you always commands are set in contrast to the commands of the ways of life from Egypt and the way of life in Canaan so that's the frame for this list of rules about marriage and sex through have to follow so that's really important like you were joking earlier about I'll just copy and paste these rules well why are these rules stated the way that they are there in dialogue with active cultural practices and Norms in both Egypt and Kanon and they speak to a wisdom of how to act instead that's right it's not that they have nothing to say to us but what they say to us is through wisdom reflection which might mean that we respond to this through a different surface expression of the command copying pasting command my mister
 how to respond to it as wisdom so the 14 laws to follow about people that it's inappropriate to have sex with and it's essentially drawing the boundary lines around the nuclear family the extended family and how many degrees out from Aunt Uncle second cousins third cousins is it appropriate to marry within so this is a deep rabbit hole but what's really fascinating here is God wants to safeguard the sexual integrity and reputation of his people cuz he's calling them to be fruitful and multiply and that's one of the blessings of the Covenant but apparently there are more appropriate and less appropriate ways to do that as a community and so these walls represent away that honor the wisdom of your way but that's set in contrast to both Egyptian Canaanite practice
 so some of them might strike us is really strange like don't sleep with your dad's wife with say it's your stepmom don't marry your sister don't marry your father's wife's daughter so every one of these has some kind of cultural issue in this ancient contacts that it's a dressing but that's what he's 14 laws about Hebrew idiom foods with fascinating hear the phrase used for sex is the phrase to uncover the nakedness where to look upon the nakedness it's a figure of speech is this why then would know if it's kind of like about the sex was happening yeah so this is all parallel to after the cataclysm of the flood God delivers the family of Noah Noah plants a garden with a tent in the garden he eats the fruit of the garden gets drunk and exposed and then his son comes in and the phrases looks upon the nakedness of his father
 so if you read Leviticus 18 for 7 do not uncover the nakedness of your father namely the nakedness of your mother she is your mother don't uncover her nakedness another words to look upon the nakedness of your father here is the figure of speech for having sex with your own mouth as wife so to sleep with your mom is to expose the nakedness of both your mom and your dad cuz it's his wife and she's his husband so this is a great meditation literature example know you go back to that story like yes another words it's a puzzle is a riddle back in Genesis chapter 9 and the key to the riddle you don't come across still live in a kiss chapter 18 is that because we're not native Hebrew fingers or is this like a really obscure Hebrew idiom oh we'll just within the collection of the Hebrew Bible it's the idiom that's you
 just right here and then there is also make sense of why after Noah's son does that it's Noah's grandson Keenum threw him that bears the consequences of hamster in Nazareth ham wrongs his father by looking upon his nakedness but it's hams grandson Canaan the Bears the brunt of Canaan where they're going to be going where they going and God just said don't act like Canaanites that's what this chapter is about so don't sleep with your mom like the Canaanites do and what is Genesis 9 about but a guy named ham food does this just a story of Kayden it's the origin story of Canaan Festival 18 to other things I want to draw attention to Pier One is chapter 21 which illuminates a little bit more than the mysterious as well
 and the goat demon verse 21 verse 21 chapter 18 you shall not give any of your children or offspring to offer them up to molar
 and so profane the name of your God I am Yahweh is another Elohim in the mix yeah it's not offering an animal it is sacrificing children outside so the identity of molasses a big rabbit hole it's spelled the same letters as the Hebrew word Malak which is the word King and it's for sure some sort of deity that claimed to have Royal authority to demand the life of people's children if you want to have this deity on your side like we accumulate did and again the rabbit hole Steve Bond mobile. Why that title seems like a title so offering up your children as a sacrifice profane the name of your God so you're an Israelite people look at you and say all those of the people of your way but they sacrifice their kids to Molech to
 okay so people will see you and the name of Yahweh will be considered like the name of any other deity cuz you can worship me if you can worship at school so I can degrading of you always reputation so it's just important cuz this chapter isn't just like rules about sex and then there's rules about worship this is all about not living like an Egyptian or a Canaanite is about how your family is structured it's about your sexual ethic it's about what you do with your animals it's about what you do with your children it's all woven together as one thing here so that's chapter 18 it's other things we could for there and it's matched On The Other Side by chapter 20 and then in the middle is 9:19 read some of this
 then he always said to Moses speak to all the congregation of the sons of Israel say to them y'all shall be holy because I y'all y'all got them holy become like me every one of you become a source of life and light what time is sweet oh yeah yeah I'm like me yeah I mean it makes sense that these people are living near the fire Cloud if you always glory and life and light that they would begin to take on the characteristic stuff that like Moses did I found out Sinai
 there's three every one of you shall fear his mother and father was kind of sound like Ten Commandments but hear the words fear fear and honor is a synonym fear your father and mother and keep my Sabbath I am Yahweh your God you should not make any Idols or any mountain gods I am Yahweh your God those are three of The Ten Commandments right there but reworded here so honoring your parents who are images of God to you keeping the Sabbath plural
 and not making any idle images of God so it's a little sandwich we're quoting the three of The Ten Commandments but we reordered them to create a little symmetrical sandwich here
 fear your parents who were images of God to you matching that on the other side it is don't make any images that are your own making and then in the middle is make sure you keep my Sabbath in the middle is the Sabbath important section of the book like this and be like okay random rules for being wholly I guess I'll often when you're running through these like yeah this is random sample different sections and see they're all do he Civ together this is about forming a contrast Community that's different than Egypt different than Canaan it's the people of Yahweh these are not the people of Molech these are the people of y'all by and these are people who honor the sexual dignity
 of every other member of the community in a very unique way to a degree that the neighbors were not doing these are people who dedicate everything they have to Yahweh even there every meal every food on the food these are people who honor their parents they don't give their loyalty to the gods that we all here in Canaan think you're normal and man's they even surrender all of their time to Yahweh by resting every seventh day crazy why would you do that there's work that needs to be done filled there's cheap the need to be tended news going to let him graze the field next Saturday and not moving my room so I guess what's cool about the section of Leviticus is that Sabbath is woven into all these other commands and just you know Leviticus 19 it's worth
 when you reap the Harvest of your land don't harvest the corners of the field but leave the corners don't milk your land from Maximum profit leave whole sections of it so that the vulnerable and you community can come and generate value and work and earn a living too so that's the verdict is 19 alongside deal deal falsely some more Ten Commandments don't oppress your neighbor don't withhold the wages of somebody that you've hired don't curse someone who is deaf don't take advantage of the blind do justice and judgment don't be partial to the poor the rich don't hate your fellow countrymen in your heart
 don't take Vengeance don't bear a grudge but love your neighbor as yourself and then keep going these list continues and that culminates again down here in verse 32 shall keep my Sabbath and honor My Sanctuary I am Yahweh
 you're not others the steam if I had more time in my life I was struggling time scarcity but I've always wanted to go and just take like a few minutes and just read all of like the classic Greek philosophers I've just kind of Norman hot spots but so as I understand and probably listening to the podcast you like this is your jam but I understand the big Motif in classical Greek philosophy was striving for a fully integrated life where every decision you make is directed by some core principle that you've determined your life is about because it's very similar to like inspirational speakers today but it's how to make your life fully integrated so the everything you do with your time your energy your money your relationships is all day in service of some but working towards a roll yeah and I just
 and I know what the temperamental thing you know some temperaments are more like that than others my wife, like that in some ways but not in others and I'm kind of like that in other ways and not in some than ours are mismatched but that's essentially black what a section of Leviticus like this is about these might seem all desperate and random but they're really all and service love God and love your neighbor as an image of God
 the way that translates into every aspect of life each law gives us this wisdom principal in the Sabbath is to keep peace here this going to just keep ramping up and importance as you read about the section of book but that's at least what I'm reflecting on
 spider conversation
 send it back to you these can feel like a hodgepodge
 but there is symmetry in order and logic behind how they're presented within the narrative and even within themselves but then also it's a big selection of just like all of life that's right and it's giving you wisdom for how to live in right relationships with people and like is coherent integrated way ya coherent incomplete in that I forgot to mention this chapter 18 as 2 * 7 + 19 * 3 * 7 laws chapter 20 as 2 * 7 long for a total of 7 * 7 months so we're clearly selecting from some larger body of laws this isn't the entire Covenant lock code that they would have had their selections it's right in this section even repeat some so instead of giving you the complete Les to repeat certain ones to make a certain point
 which is common Hebrew way of making a complete statement about something and in the middle of that block of 7 x 7 laws in the beginning and ending of chapter 19 just keep my Sabbath which is leveled up just as much importance is doing Justice to your neighbor and sexual integrity and dedicating everything you have Yahweh is is resting every seventh day dedicating time that you have to to Yahweh yeah because if you could be fully integrated one big block do you need to integrate yes is your time how you think of just being a human living through time or what determines
 how you use your time spend your time invest your time off from the side of the road before time is money what a metaphor sub we haven't talked about everything that we could talk about here but it introduces the Sabbath seem the section Leviticus 17 through 20 everything is organized and 7 and then that's intensity of the number seven is just going to keep wrapping up to the final part of the book which will look at next which is all about honoring not just the Sabbath but Stephen and your feasts and then the seventh year and then 7 x 7 year and all the sudden huge amounts of your life your entire lifetime is dedicated to Yahweh in cycles of time and this is part of what it means to be a kingdom of priests and a nation is holy set apart
