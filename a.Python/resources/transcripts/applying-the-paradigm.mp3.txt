biblical authors were incredibly intentional about the shape of every scroll in the Bible which stories go where what details are given in a story and when are those details get everything meticulously organized and this wasn't just a fun literary game to play the organization of the biblical book goes hand-in-hand with the meaning in the message the biblical authors want to get across to read the Bible Well we need to understand biblical structure you're probably aware of one specific way to organize the Bible chapters and verses very useful it's also important to recognize that that is not a division system original to these girls there were no chapters and verses annotations in any of the original biblical Scrolls which begs the question how were biblical Scrolls
 each of those Scrolls has been organised by their authors to have a series of larger scale movements that organized the flow of the story Into the handful of men pieces that's right movement and Hebrew Bible every Scrolls broken into three sometimes four large movements and movement of scripture is a collection of stories that all work together for example first movement in the Bible is roughly Genesis chapters 1 through 11 and there you got some great stories Adam and Eve Cain and Abel Les Mack Noah and the flood the Tower of Babel let's throw in some genealogies and you can look at all of these stories individually and see their shape and design and message back up and you can also look at them as a whole and you'll begin to see new things good metaphor here is maybe it's like a large tile knows that you can back out and get the whole picture but what you could do is zoom into any one section and then really pay attention to
 the meaning for organization of that you know maybe a two by two square it's on every level from biggest down two small I'm done Collins and this is Bible project podcast stay on the show I talked with dr. Tim Mackey and dr. Carissa Quinn and we look at 3 in Port and skills for reading biblical literature the first skill understanding the structure and this is going to get us ready for reading through the Bible Movement by movement we're also going to look at the skill of seeing biblical patterns what are the themes that the biblical authors want us to pay attention to this is all to prepare us for the new reading Journey that we're doing in 2020 to reading through the Bible Movement by movement and tracing biblical themes thanks for joining us.
 Today we get to start a mega series of massive marathon of a Bible project podcast series don't let that be dancing because it's not something you have to do just call that Mega massive awesome
 year-long Marathon but it's not scary to be intimidated by now so I'm backing off of that okay to do that because it starts in the new year so let's introduce this whole thing but really this is an extension of the Paradigm series we did an episode from our Paradigm series into this new massive modular Marathon right now love you followed along with a Time series you are aware that we talked about seven pillars that explain what type of literature the Bible is and how we should approach it and we're going to be doing is discussing well then how do you read the Bible with this Paradigm what kind of skills do you need and how do you develop those skills so first let's just review the
 yeah we ended with the long series on the podcast about the Seven Pillars that we articulating it's our recovery project we're trying to recover a way of imagining how we think about what the scriptures are and then try and develop a method or skill set that matches what they actually are has a post of what we might assume they are not saying you invented at the only thing we're trying to discover within the biblical texts its negative 2 how the authors wrote and are communicating you and Daniel read the Torah and the prophet in the Book of Daniel there's a scene with him reading the prophets of the Jeremiah scroll how did Jesus and the apostles read and understand the scriptural collection how did the earliest Christians read and understand all of it together what were their Basic Instincts that they didn't say out loud because it was all just take it for granted but that we have to say it out loud because we're in the
 current time a place that's taught us to have different assumptions about the Bible that maybe aren't helpful always or maybe they're just misaligned with what all those earlier people who are much more connected to say yes or trying to discover it and then also 10 name with those things are so that we can practice them to go so there are seven pillars that we've identified as part of this Paradigm and they are Divine and human this is divine and human literature its unified literature Messianic literature meditation literature the Bible's ancient literature its wisdom and then finally it's communal literature and even reading those off for me I'm reading them and it's still hard to remember the order that they got my brother so we've been talking about or just I guess I'm as we've been discussing these we've been thinking about which ones naturally group together better and we've come up with a different order to remember these pillars in the that make sense
 and it seems artistically designs yes so it's clarify what you're saying Krista is that we re ordered them from the ordered we talked about them in the podcast about the men but we've come up with an order that will be may be more helpful to remember so now we've structured the new order something weird like it's its own thing now we're remembering the pillars in this new order as three parts the first part is a cluster of three there's communal right in the middle and then the last part is a cluster of three so it's a pretty says it's under D and the first three are the same Divine and human unified Messianic and we already kind of talked about how we realized that created a cool little cluster about the Divine human partnership the scriptures are themselves the product of a Divine human partnership they are unified by both as an editorial collection editorial
 unified but also unified in terms of a story about a Divine human partnership and that story comes its culmination in the figure of the Messiah who is a Divine human who fulfills the story of the Define human Department that's the first Triad for section is those three have Divine and human unified in Messianic you really liked communal being right at the center of all this is breeding it together in community you can add with it but since we had these the first three and then another three that kind of work together you know taking a cue from a literary structure let's throw it in the middle and make it more of a central piece that you read the Bible in community and that it develops a community like the purpose of it is that we can live as a community as a new type of human Community yeah this is a rich one cuz it both speaks to the origin of the scriptural collection that its origin was
 in a community with in ancient Israel that red and experience these texts as groups but also it was a community that these texts were forming and shaping identity of his at told their story and the story of their hopes of future and that has always continued into the late. Of ancient Israel into early Christianity on the scriptures we read aloud experience the loud understood by groups of people who could help each other understand them so it's communal thru-and-thru theme in our particular cultural context it's not in every Christian tradition but it has been an artist and so we feel like it's worthy to the name it say it out loud on how we should go about reading these get more practical literature meditation literature and wisdom literature so it's ancient literature in the sense that it was written by an
 ancient Community are scribes and 2/3 overtime yet in a different part of the world in a different context then I guess most of us and all of us yeah and we change the title of this pillar in the course of the conversation member used to be contextual Overture but we changed it to ancient cuz I can speak to ancient language ancient culture and time yeah it just comes from a different all of those and come across things that seem really odd a lot of a lot of times it's a product of the culture that's different than our own and we have to leave space for that it's meditation literature that's the sixth pillar it's meant to be read and reread meditated on just like someone talks about meditating on scripture type of way to read literature
 write it for produce at tapping into a very ancient and very beautiful literary approach to such a way as to have multiple layers of meaning and if you follow the design cues and know how to read it along the grain of its design so to speak it will keep revealing more layers of the more you become familiar with the whole collection and read every part in light of the whole hip meditation meditation so it is literature that leads to wisdom that's not a list of principles that tells you exactly what to do it's meditation literature that leads to wisdom set of text have anything to say to people who live outside in the time and place other than that ancient setting and typically this is speaking most to I think a contemporary Paradigm of how to engage the Bible that we've just called less
 helpful which is the reference book of the rulebook comes roach because there are rules like moral ethical rules in the Bible don't murder you know don't lie that kind of stuff but there's actually not as many as you might think and there are enough rules to cover every area of human life and relationships but wisdom literature is designed to form people who have moral compass that the lions with God's wisdom so that no matter where they go they can be informed from the scriptures about what like True North is so it shapes people and communities to be wise image Ferris ruling the world into the future and the point of reading these texts and I love that this final Triad ends with wisdom for how to rule the world with God as human Partners cuz that brings you back first Paradigm the Divine human partnership the Divine and human yeah literature at the unified with the partnership story that we need the human and divine one
 the Messiah to come and rescue us so yeah that's it that's the Seven Pillars just cuz we have some distance to know from what we had all this conversation this is a great piece of work I'm going back and look at it I'm glad we got here I'm going to take this with me for a long time the other really cool thing about this is that it begs the question how do we develop this Paradigm or how do I how do I read the Bible with this Paradigm what do you do with it other than I actually read the Bible and what we've discovered is that there's actually very practical skills that once you've on-boarded this Paradigm or while you're while you're attending on where this Paradigm these skills will get you there and what did we realize was that a whole library of videos have been getting at developing these feels kind of I don't know how
 consciously you were doing that but like as you were as we were making themed videos and how to read the Bible series and word studies it's all became like skills for the parrot yeah we just have developed more precise language for this stuff we set out to do when we started our project announcement I could do a drum roll on this wooden table I would but my cousin audio problems
 okay John Collins you have something you want to share with the world and actually I want you to share it because you were kind of at the Genesis of the idea you came back from some meetings and shared with me this idea so I remember learning it for the first time so what is it John well yeah so we are developing our own Bible project app and I actually have been historically through this project been against building an app for Bible project actually so we had some friends design like a reading plan app and that's called read scripture and it's really cool we can actually make it a lot of people think we did make it that's really wonderful app that we didn't make and I was great just like yeah you guys go make a nap because I've had no vision for a nap I thought if we just have a really cool mobile experience for our website why do you need a nap I was visiting a like a VC guy down in the valley you know like just he's in this world and he start explain to me why
 you need a nap when what you can do with an app and it just started opening my imagination to what we could do with a nap so then we went out and started developing one and it is releasing in January and what we really wanted to figure out what how do you learn to read the Bible while you read the Bible so we wanted a way for you to get access to all of our material but then to not just watch a video and be like oh great awesome I watch the video for I listen to a podcast but that this can translate into learning to read this letter and actually doing it with your community the Apple be like this really interconnected web of resources where everything we've ever made it is all interconnected to the learning experience and learn skills we have somebody's new on our team really neat person and he was telling us about how he would show theme videos in his church like in the class setting and in for somebody is
 play new to reading and understanding the Bible he said the video theme videos come across like a magic trick that it was as metaphor is so somebody would watch it be like when I read the Bible I just find genealogies and stories of violence and like cool stuff about Jesus how did you get the Water of Life to see and really fascinating but that must be something that only those people can do I'm just going to watch them do it exactly it's something you watch the video sing Video in the Bible and so you know just so you know how sometimes you watch instructional videos or building a Lego set with my kids and there's these you can shoot pellets like little cannons it off or would like like you know a boy and a girl in the picture on the back of them firing the little Cannon but then underneath it it's this little picture of like a human face with one of the little projectiles going into the eyeball and that it's his
 like it has like it don't do this do this at home
 I just thought of it cuz it was yesterday
 tell you to shoot your eyeball out about logos on is on the back of a lot of things don't try this at home or it's implied in a lot of encourage people to learn the skills so that you can try this at home we want you to learn how to read the Bible and get cool get the good stuff that we've been trying to show everybody tricks are designed to kind of confuse you and misdirect so that you think something like magical is happening but really was just a slight of hand or something and we're not attempting to do that but I think there is a sense of like there's some sleight-of-hand going on because there's this whole layer of skills you know we're using that we haven't been really really transparent about not on purpose but we just haven't been like all these are the skills and let's develop his skills together to find them so clearly as in a Time series
 do in the app there's like in the very center of the app is going to be a tab called skills and you're going to find our whole Content Library organized into three skills and then you're going to be able to see all the related content we have podcast episodes and quizzes and notes and all sorts of things so they can develop those skills and that's a way to access the content our content in the app also while you're reading the Bible if there's related skills nearby you can get to it that way and those three skills we want to walk through what are they John what are the skills they are style structure and pattern
let's go over these one at a time and let's start with Styles what would it would we mean by the skill of styles what we mean is the Bible is a collection of Scrolls ancient Scrolls and they are written in a variety of ancient literary Styles different types of narrative various types of poetry various types of prose discourse and we covered this in our how to read the Bible series how to read the Bible podcast and videos are organized along the three main literary styles of the Book Literature but each one has stops that's that's basically it and you engage you come to different types of literature with different expectations actually hears a metaphor is that we use Year many years ago to ensure this is very similar to the kinds of expectations that we all bring when we enter into a guy like a grocery store if you go have your normal grocery store you have this internal map of How It's organized and what to expect from it and what to do with it that you already know in like gave you
 watch or you just like figured it out you know but you really have exposed before you your assumptions about grocery stores when you go to a new one just know this and I will drive across town to get to a familiar one you know what the best thing is is when you're on a road trip or like visiting somebody in another city and you go into the Trader Joe's in like it's exactly the same know it's so disorienting to go and do a different grocery store because of familiarity it's like there's something about familiarity that is comforting and makes you feel like I know how to do this and I can do it fast and efficiently I know what I'm doing and if you're in a new grocery store has happened to me so many times where I go to where I think the thing I'm looking for it to be like I normally if I see like the chip aisle in the sauce is not going to be far away but not at all grocery stores do that so I'm have to separate Zone cuz it's by the beans for whatever grocery stores
 two literary style expectations so so you going to grocery store expecting certain parts to have certain things and you feel if I if I'm in a certain I'll like the bread aisle I know there's going to be muffins here I know there's going to be exactly hot dog buns but if I need the salami that's somewhere else and you wouldn't expect to find there black coffee like the whole other Zone and no one again like when you go to a grocery store they don't have people they're handing out maps in fact that's frustrating yeah oh my gosh so we have a store called Fred Meyer and I think that's just a Northwest store but it's a Kroger brand they're huge because it's like a grocery store but then they've got like oh yeah pliance is a girl like Carol and games and everything you want but then the grocery store itself because we're the Northwest and you got to have the organic section
 they like started having like the regular groceries in the organic section of groceries but then they have like an area that's just for special Cheese's and another area that's just for special whatever so sometimes you like want to find something and there's like three potential spots in my being it's so frustrating I once looked for kimchi in Fred Meyer for an hour it was a really good
 okay so the equivalent is all pairable the equivalent to this is you know sitting down with the Psalms but maybe let's say you're in a theology class at your church or in school and you're trying to understand the Bible's portrait of like human nature and so you know maybe you'll have some narratives about to eat Garden of Eden story you go to Paul's letters cuz he's didactic it seems and works through this an idea systematically but then you might go to the Psalms and you're pulling out some sentences from the Psalms and whole question is like did any biblical poet sit down and think I'm going to teach about human nature in this poem like usually Palms have other agendas and didactic information transfer you know so that's it like should what should I go to biblical poetry looking for what should I expect what are the expectations and what are the organizing principles of different kinds of styles different kinds of text
 okay so be really clear how those metaphors working is when I'm in a section of the grocery store I have a certain expectations of what the fine there and how it's designed and how I exist in that part of the grocery store yeah that's right and I'm the same way the Bible there's different literary Styles or literary genres poetry narrative discourse and when I'm reading this course Paul's letter versus reading a poem and say the Psalms when I'm in a different section of the literary Isle of the Bible I have expectations of how to navigate to the expectations will help me notice certain things but I've also might make me blind to other things that are right there but that I don't I've never taught or don't expect them to be significant therefore I don't really see you them or pay attention to them so that's basically it and then each of those subtypes narrative poetry posters course there's subtypes to them
 three types of narrative poetry discourse has subtypes that all are doing different things they're like different Isles of the store and we need to develop the skills for learning what to expect when I walk into Jesus Parables vs. chemical structure this is something that for me early in my education of biblical studies so I'm in my early twenties and I was just introduced by the same Professor you were Weird School the same place by our Bible study methods Professor that the organization of a book A book goes hand-in-hand with the meaning in the message the biblical authors want to get a raise and function I don't believe it it's red design and message so if I hadn't been told that I would have known to look for that but that was one of the first things I have ever taught and so that's just
 then a topic that's just inherently interesting and valuable to me because from the beginning I might encounter with the Bible it's just had so much pay off learning how to study what we now call literary design or structure of biblical books so that's the reason it's important how the biblical authors organize what they're saying is just as important as what they're saying let's begin and end and then how different units are organized within so what kind of patterns they create to describe any chunk of text whether big or small we have other specific words for like the larger level units all the way to the micro-level so you can have a macrostructure and a microstructure on the unit size you're talking about a picture with start at the largest level which is a collection called the Bible scriptures
 the scripture remember the word bible never appears in the Bible to describe the whole collection of the collection of Bibles a collection of the word bible is a Greek spelling in English the Greek word top the boss man's book Greek translation of the Hebrew word pfeffer between scroll scroll what we call books are Scrolls a collection of Scrolls is the scriptures you got its biggest level is a collection of writings called the scriptures or the Bible then when you go down into the Christian Bible there's two sub collections the Hebrew Bible what Chris is called the Old Testament and then the the writings of the Apostles or what Christmas called in New Testament the two overarching macro collection of collections
 each of those have a sub sections of what we call them so the Hebrew Bible is organized into three sections the Torah the prophets the writings and then the New Testament has kind of a macro divisions in terms of there's a huge Foundation narrative the gospel Xanax 5 Scrolls and then after that comes the letters with the writings of the Apostles that go from Paul into the revelation of each of those sections consist of a number of Scrolls and we call these books in the Bible
so what's interesting is they're as differences between modern Christian Bibles the division and number of Scrolls and how the same scrolls are divided up within the keep Revival set for example if you go to books when I get a Bible today you'll see in the Old Testament a book called 1st Kings and then another book called 2nd Kings but those are considered one work there one literary work cuz they are they originally were and they tell one story correct this right in the Christian Bible those two books called ezra-nehemiah those are ones in the Hebrew Bible they were written and designed as one unified literary work when we open first or second Kings or Ezra or knee and my always see chapters that start at the beginning of each of those books so we might think that there urgently two separate works either one scroll actually get this to the next layer down which is this house
 scroll organized so if you open Modern Bibles let's just go to the first book of the Hebrew Bible Genesis you open it up and it has a big one in front of the first words meaning chapter one and then there's little number subscript numbers dividing sentences up there called versus chapters and verses every book in our model Bibles is divided up this way into chapters and verses and they're very it's very helpful system actually so useful we can all read the same thing at the same time is very useful it's also important to recognize that that is not a division system original to the scroll there were no chapters in verse annotations in any of the original biblical Scrolls from the 12:15 yeah stick it up their ass and then the versus later there were different paragraphing traditions in many different manuscript histories but the actual chapter and verses I have a medieval origin so that's interesting in
 the Jewish tradition after the Hebrew Bible if you're educated in traditional you know Jewish educational setting so I can your neighborhood you Shiva something like that you are not taught there isn't a chapter and verse division didn't the Scrolls in those systems and then that tradition each paragraph of every biblical scroll has a one-word title usually based off of the key word in that paragraph and so if your Rabbi says everybody open up to par shot then you know like I'm going to what Christians call Genesis chapter 22 so you don't learn numbers in the Jewish tradition you learn keywords so it just goes to show that how we organize it is based on traditions and in our Paradigm recovery effort we want to ask but what's the original design organization of the Scrolls that the authors want to highlight for us and turns out that it's different than our modern chapter and verse structure
 so Genesis for example the author has designed the scroll through large-scale patterning broke in the book into four sections that we're calling movements we've adopted the term come from naturally Symphonies have Symphonies I'm working right now but the term movements I'm really happy with this I think it's a very helpful way to think about it right so scrolls are broken down into movement with usually three to four or five of the size of the scroll right so something small is Ruth has four and something as large as Genesis for the scroll of Ruth is four chapters in my Bible oh yeah so sometimes the movements will correspond to Chapters sometimes a lot of chapters 58 and so these movements are like so we'll spend many chapters do we have four movements in the Book of Genesis and they don't actually course
 on the chapters are they end in the middle or near the end of a chapter of each of those movements has lower levels is like scales down into lower level groupings of smaller units units within those units think of like the traditional Russian nesting dolls where there's a large dog and medium small small smaller so difficult literature is organized like that and a great example of this is actually the first main literary unit of the Genesis scroll has such a clear structure you can't miss it cuz it's organized in the seven days of creation story and as a shorthand it's easy to refer to that as though that's the Genesis 17 take creation story but if you go read it the 7th day has been chopped off of chapter fun and made into the first three verses of chapter 2 why I have
 no idea it's like the least helpful organization like why would a chapter begin in the culminating last moment of a story sets a good example seems like like the six days definitely are really unified in the seventh day is different so maybe that literary structure is highlighting a difference but it still is the seventh day of creation and it still has those overarching literary structures every literary markers with the keywords of the opening line of Genesis 1 1 and 2 the author gives a very clear signals of the closing of literary unit and that's a Biblical authors do this they give Clues through word usage and convinience transition pieces the beginning of a unit the ending of a unit and it requires the skill set to learn how to pick up the signals but when you do know you can say the biblical authors have given in organizational design so how all these
 pieces of a scroll fit together and when you follow it turns out the chapter two visions only sometimes helped me see that being on the same page and they are an interpretation of where units end so a lot of times they're they're good but sometimes they are paying attention to ancient conventions so we're re-evaluating some of that far and in the continent we have is Tim what you've done with read scripture which is showing the structure of a scroll and you don't talk in terms of movements and this concept of movement is also something that you've developed even further with a group of Scholars can you elaborate with so there's going to be a have a refresh of these walkthroughs eventually but what I think people have already seen with those videos is how wonderful it is to see how scroll is laid out its design
 because it helps you not get lost in the details so I don't remember where you are and why you are where you are and how it relates then to the overall message of that scroll also gives a guide for maybe how much to read at a time or how to trace a theme through a section instead of just sitting down and reading as much as you can or a chapter a day or something to know that there are movements or even smaller units and you can read through a defined section a text that the author was shaping as a whole and look for a theme within that section I think that's a really big payoff to
so as we get deeper into movements this is where we start talking about smaller literary units and I don't think we're going to be able to talk we're not going to address that level of smaller level organization yet in the app we're just going to start out with this basic idea of the biblical collection consists of subsection suneet subsection has Scrolls Scrolls has been organised by their authors to have a series of larger scale movements that organized the flow of the story into these the handful of man pieces and the main skill we want to help people develop is how to trace a line of thought for a theme through a literary movement as a whole and that connects to the third and final scale yes well and we didn't talk to him about how the smallest level of literary units are just reading lines of Hebrew
 and seeing how how each line is designed so like we have these videos called visual commentary videos where will jump in and we'll just look at like maybe even just two verses that has like four or five lines or the whole prologue to John which was probably I don't know 20 lines and you can see actually the literary design of scripture at that level to design goes down to the level it probably goes even beyond the level of the line but that's what we're looking at in a good way to think about that as if you've read poetry. In Hebrew poetry and you see two lines right in a row that seemed to say a similar or same thing you can tell they're designed to mirror each other and play off each other that doesn't just happen in poetry it happens throughout narrative to but each line relates to the next one is designed intentionally until that happens yet on the micro-level all the way up to the macro-level and it's the same kind of skill that you use Apple's levels
 a good metaphor here is maybe like a large tile mosaic like on the floor on the wall and so when you back up from it you see like well this is so beautiful it's like a picture of whatever the Mosaic is that what states of portrait of a I'm thinking of these mosaics of a synagogue called your office right now. We talked about it it's cool ancient synagogue from Lex I think the 3rd or 4th Century Haydee and there's all these cool it's some of the oldest tile mosaic depictions of biblical stories in the synagogue was cool so some of them are big and you can back out and get the whole picture but what you could do is zoom into any one section and then really pay attention to the meaning for organization of that you know maybe a two by two square and then you could go in and just look at the organization of a little 6 inch by 6 inch square and be like oh my gosh like that section is super intentional to the crates the effect when you zoomed out but you go in and like there's all these cool ways.
 an organized that way that's basically it's on every level from biggest down to small litter a design and structure is a very meaningful way that stuff quasars communicate their messages and so we want to help people develop the skills to do that we're going to start with this in the app in 2022 with helping people see larger movements of biblical Scrolls everyone to read along through the Torah and movements and it's going to be larger sections then chapters and each movement has its own shape and its own Costco gas and so like in the Genesis scroll this four movements and they kind of follow and really four main characters and within each movement we're going to be tracing a Biblical theme bring us to the third yes skill safari-style structure and now are 3rd skill is patterns patterns
 so if you see there's been given a meaningful structure at every level of organization what is it that tells you it's meaningfully organized in a tile mosaic it'll be color patterns little bo here is like an orange stripe that goes down in the section but when you really zoom in you say all that's an organization of these orange tiles in this pattern to create the effect of a line through that whole section of the Mosaic so when you're reading biblical literature the analogy for the parallel to color in a mosaic is words is a repetition of words over a different expanses of a scroll connect ideas in the reader's mind that help you see a progression or development of whatever ideas signal by that word so these are things we've been showing and do in our video content podcast for a long time now we call them various titles but we've organized it all in a way that was helpful I think you were the first one to organize the switch on how we've been doing pattern or just a little bit
 Devil's yeah yeah this example or analogy of a mosaic seems really helpful because there could be up like this pattern of orange tiles and then a splash of orange somewhere else that is just coincidental or not related but if it occurs in the same pattern and then if it occurs another time in that same pattern again then it increases the likelihood that that's of related pattern it's not random and I think that happens in the biblical text to it's like you can go through and see a word that's repeated and you have to ask the question is this intentional is this a pattern being developed is there a cluster of repeated words is is this this random or is this a pattern in it so that's kind of the scale we're wanting to help the audience develop as we go through as he is to see where are the repeated intentionally and where they're forming patterns so this can happen at different levels of scale just like the structure so we'll start with the smallest smallest
 level would be the studying in individual word in a maybe a smaller litter a unit so the word create Genesis 1 or beginning so one skill to develop is how do you find out what the meaning of word is an ancient Greek Hebrew Aramaic represented in the translation for every reading like how do you study words in the Bible just to figure out what they mean in the first place if you are wondering about that then so we have we made video content about this you. Chris have both written words study videos and have conversations about them on the podcast so words are the basic building blocks for the basic tile of the Mosaic of the scroll and mixing metaphors now so that's the lowest level meta for developing skills to learn how to study words in the Bible lowest level of the next level up is when a word or related words gets repeated throughout a number of units in sequential order or just gets repeated
 at a larger like a literary movement of a scroll and you keep seeing this word or this image and when you see that happening and you compare the different places where the Pyrenees notice coming alitiz what you watching is a theme but there's our word for it yes it is like a keyword but then also its related words like it's synonyms that you are seeing that it's it's ripping off a bigger idea that's right that we call it seemed any of our theme videos are examples of this weather it's the Water of Life water in Genesis 17 de narrative water in the Garden of Eden narrative is water in the flood story and so on and you usually what happens at the waters to compare where you like all this connected in the threat and the same thing happens every time with water or so it's reversed been intentionally their things like that that when you're tracing these themes you can see the meaning
 the text you so ugly in that case you could study the trace the word actual word water but related will be related images that also carry that seeing forward like stream River bring bring Orwell Orwell or see would see and let you go throughout the biblical story biblical authors can pull up any of those water words and be activating and caring for the steam to learning how to study a steam through that the app is teaching is how to trace its creative movement yeah that's right so the main skill is how to how you can do this at home you can do the magic trick by studying themes throughout larger sections of the typical school that's what the apps going to focus on for 2022 really excited to be clear a section of the app is going to be hey let's read the Bible Movement by movement tracing different thing
 so you'll be developing to skills a structure skill where you're seeing how Astros broken up into movements and then you're developing a pattern skill which is your able to then find the theme and watch the theme develop annual it will do a new theme for every movement that's going to be just one section of the app you can then get to another section the Apple was going to have all the skills and you can then like develop those skills at your own pace and kind of see how our Content Library is organized that way
 so we're not quite done with patterns that was a little side bit there but an important one when you back out from just looking at one story like water and a Genesis one story or water through a section of stories notice is another level of patterning and we call this narrative patterning so this is where a whole network of words that you would maybe not think are related but all of a sudden they'll be a story that starts using a whole bunch of words related to an earlier story and with the biblical authors are doing is teaching you to see how these two narratives are units are patterned after each other so for podcast listeners you already know this is how the Garden of Eden narrative for example the failure narrative Adam and Eve of the tree that whole story is filled with so many words that you wouldn't think are related garden tree Bush beautiful eating good Desire C
 take nakedness these kinds of things and these are unrelated words apparently at least in terms of their meeting but they're connected in one story story in a sequence in a sequence and then you'll watch it later story about Abraham and Sarah going down to Egypt will start to use a lot of those same words again and the narrator is trying to invite you to see those in comparison to each other so do you call them both up in your mind and they become a point of meditation to reflect on those two stories together plus narrative patterning and then you can't scale up even one level up bigger for what we're calling Melody which is another term for using from Symphony so this would be a whole sequence of literary units like a creation narrative with the 7-Day pattern to the number 7 then a failure narrative than a division story that leads to a crisis where God brings about some kind of
 decreation but rescuing a Remnant and delivering them so that they can try and become Adam and Eve 2.0 that sounds like such a complex story you wouldn't imagine it would be repeated anywhere but you're saying that's a Melody that gets played out over and over across Seas larger spans of texts and all the words in sequence in them can get repeated in a whole later section of narratives like a section of the Abraham story is organized in the same repeating patterns are Melodies so that's that's a level that will start to explore in the future right now for what we're going to do in this year it's going to be studying how squirrels are organized into business and then how movements you can follow key repeated words and images through to trace the theme that's a lot that's a lot
 skills and the rabbit hole goes deep and all of them but it's a great way to organize and I found it so helpful I think everyone else will as well and what it really does that gives us a roadmap for how did then plug in the holes for the content we're missing we don't have a lot of good narrative patterning content yet or we haven't talked a lot about the melody quite yet or literary units and how they work within the movement we haven't done a lot of work there yet so it shows us where the work is to be done here at my project and so we've got a lot of work cut out for us and we were super excited to jump in but again next year reading and movements tracing themes the very first movements you've already said is Genesis 1 through 11:00 and we're going to trace the theme of Holy Spirit holy spirit is one of our theme videos it's the theme of God's we walk the word Rock in Hebrew is breath or wind or spirits and it shows up a lot in the first
 play Genesis yeah so we chose that word for that theme I guess because it's a group of words to look at in this movement it doesn't mean it doesn't occur elsewhere it doesn't necessarily mean it's the most important thing but it's a skill that we're wanting to practice and it is one of many important things in Genesis one through like I have feel describe it better but there's going to be like it interactive reading experience so you can read Genesis one through eleven in this cool way that will kind of guide you to help see the repeated pattern throughout that we would like you to do is read through just went through 11 and if you get to the pattern you find the pattern and then you can see what God's rock is doing there and then you'll go when you collect all these basic lyrical of headset work on them links throughout the movement will be like actual words will be will be something to make the words look special little invite you to click on
 find a mule collector you'll be able to reference him later and we'll do that Holy Spirit and movement and then we'll move to Genesis movement to which is Abraham Meredith and we'll do a new thing and we'll do that throughout the whole Torah by the time we're done we're going to have understood the structure of the Torah and so will I've done a number of themes through all the movements and this is all building towards a Bible reading experience where eventually you could be in any movement tracing any theme but it's going to take us a while to get there this is we're going to start and it's going to be wonderful and the app is going to be available wherever you download your mobile phone apps and and so we really encourage you to get the app and start this reading experience with us on the podcast we're going to actually next year go through and discuss all of these hits in more depth all the all the hits for the themes in the movements and so you can fall
 song in the podcast as well to even get deeper into this so that's it thank you we have one more episode this year and it's going to be a short episode or reflect on the year and then we'll see you in the new year reading the scroll of Genesis good time thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week is the last week of the year we've invited our CEO Steve Atkinson to join us for an end-of-the-year recap going to look at everything that we did in 2021 and have a moment to be able to thank you for joining us this year after that it's January and we're beginning a brand new reading Journey we're going to start in the first movement of the first Scroll of the Bible the scroll of Genesis and in that movement we're going to trace the theme of God's spirit the basic image of ruoff is breath
 visible energy that I breathe in and breathe out that's raw and then I look out in the world and I see the ruoff blowing in the trees and the grass and that's an an amazing energy and it's the very thing that I take in God's invisible energizing presents ruoff is a metaphor whatever Beautiful Mind is behind all of this the first uncaused cause so just be that generates and animates all of this since the things that this must be a result of that being raw Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts and Gumball and Zac mckinlay are the editors and Lyndsay Ponder with the show notes Bible project is funded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything we make all of our videos with podcast and the new app that you can download to get ready to do the reading Journey with us it's all three because of the generous support of people just like you thank you for being a part of this with us
 I feel sad about Bible project back in 2014 or 15 I first heard about Bible project a long time ago my favorite thing about the Bible project is how clear and accessible every video is and how the drawings at layers of meaning that can take you deeper into the text I also like that wow it's accessible for my children it also introduces new areas of study to me even though I study the Bible for many years now she references with our original text to give us the right way of approaching the Bible we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus or a crowdfunded project by people like me find free videos study notes podcast classes and more at bible project.
