hey this is John at bible project right now on the podcast Tim and I are discussing how to read the New Testament letters these letters are short books near the end of your Bible they're letters from the early church fathers like the Apostle Paul Peter and the written to emerging Jesus communities around the Roman world now if you like me these letters are actually really familiar because well they're kind of the most approachable books in the Bible if easy to preach they've got a lot of firing verses that make good bumper stickers and motivational posters but one thing we've been really hammering on in this series is that these are letters meant to be read as a whole stop reading the letters as a grab bag of conspiring versus I think that's not a helpful practice however you want to read through
 the whole letter and understand how it all works there will be certain lines the pot and so reading in context in the situational contact doesn't prevent you from having his parents Bible verses what it will do is actually help you understand me some more we're going to look at the situational context of the New Testament letters meeting who are the people that the apostles were writing to what were they going through what was their world like and as we peek behind the curtain will discover there's a lot going on what Americans call 1st and 2nd Corinthians people in the UK call it 1 and 2 Corinthians actually 2 and 4 Corinthians in 1st Corinthians chapter 5 Paul says in the earlier letter that I sent to you and then what you find out is that they wrote a letter back to him with all these questions then instead of writing a letter he came in this
 did in person and it went terrible to hear about this second they had a huge fight and they were really rude to him and insulted him and so he left and then you go and what caused the 2nd Corinthians the letter of t r a letter written out of heartbreak and grief and they found some way whether the letter or report to apologize to him and then that's what he writes what we call second cut the ends so we don't have the letters tears and we don't have 1st Corinthians already you're like oh this is complicated that's all today on the podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 so we're talking about how to read the Bible Bibles big book yes it is we've been talking about it for a while because there's a lot of different types of literary genres as they say yeah we are towards the end of this series talking about how to read the New Testament letters letters from the circle of the Apostles his closest followers or people that encountered Jesus and are writing letters to networks of house churches in cities around the ancient Mediterranean World there you go there's 19 of them yeah yeah and they are packed with very memorable Bible verses
 that I grew up on your experience of them was it there like what repository is a nice little one liners good one-liners yeah if you ask them what their favorite verse is probably coming from a letter yeah they miss Psalm perhaps but probably a letter I think we talked about this as we started this conversation about their simultaneously the easiest parts of ninja Testament for some people the most approachable my writing to you and you said yeah I'm there you you know I don't live in ancient ponti Sr galatia computer is writing but you do I follow Jesus and so did also it feels like the Apostle writing it is explaining to you things which other places in the bible stories and there's poems and there's wisdom in your kind of like you have to be a detective
 yeah and you're piecing it together yourself and your someone just breaking it down for you let me explain this for you it can appear that way but yeah well I think we're trying to do with this conversation and this particular video is to say they are actual letters written actual people there and so while I am a follower of Jesus and these texts are for me the part of the gift of the prophets and apostles in the power of the spirit to speak to God's people about people all times the way they were in the someone else they were written to a specific audience and the way that it is God's word for me has to take into account that was an Apostolic letter to somebody in the first century that is the way that it is God's word for me so yeah it was a basic Point anytime you are reading someone else's mail which I hope it's not
 it's a federal offense to email and you can read both sides good point we've all had the experience of listening to one side of a conversation between people who know each other half in at a specific moment in the relationship and there's a bunch of prehistory and then there's a current that of circumstances that motivate why people say what they say that's the way of context we're looking at now but we look at a couple others I think the phone by 4 will work for this purpose so that's four layers of contacts were going through what is where do these letters fit in the overall story of the Bible which is creation and then humans deciding I don't want to partner with God and his terms the fall Corruption of humanity and then singling out one family through them to renew
 this partnership with Humanity that not working Jesus coming to be the faithful Israelite and the true human and his life death and Resurrection being the climax of the story and then now we get to the letters so that's where we're at in the whole Grand Story and again they're the first paragraph of Romans two serves up so nicely that the apostles are commissioned by the Risen Jesus who is currently ruling heaven on Earth that's the true human image and he is sending out Emissary we talked about how the word Deputy for the apostles didn't quite work for you I was thinking about that the other day I was thinking what about Emissary it's not a word we use all the time though for some reason maybe it's in the news more something deputies growing on me or Royal or official
 anyway the Apostle see themselves as emissaries of the cosmic ruler of the Nations and the opposite his goal is to summon the nation's to bleeding Loyalty The Obedience of faith and so that's it the letters are written to networks of house communities that have signed on to give their believing loyalty to King Jesus and an analogy to the phone conversation let's say you overheard me talking to my mom on the phone call and in this part of the story of my relationship with my mom you know I was a kid I grew up in houses with her and then I left the house I got married I have kids and now she has grandkids and that's where we're at in our relationship the whole Grand Story of early but then there's another layer contacts which is we talked about last time which is where my mom and I live in human history the city
 nation that you live in and so we talked about just the setting of the Roman Empire that's right and someone just the fabric of life and what what Paul was dealing with when it comes to all sorts of issues social economic yep gender and then I'll discuss the situation contacts what you calling app which I imagine just being what is the situation we're in right now to pronounce the letter yeah so in the conversation with my mom what spurred the phone call correct was I just calling to say hi what was someone that you're close to any correspondence it's just assumed as part of a much longer conversation and relationship so you can Jump Right In For example and just like start on something really specific yeah you don't need to go through all the pleasantries right now what's the weather is what we do have
 almost all of the letters begin with a similar form there's a few exceptions that are important but almost all of them begin when we actually talk about this in the second video which is about the literary form of first-century letters and how to follow your train of thought but yeah that's more about the history of the real a relationship so yeah that's basically yet so when we're picking up the letters the L the letters was written by someone to somebody they knew or to a group of people that they know for specific reasons that are not always stated as explicitly as we might wish but that's because they're not written to me just like you don't talk to your mom with me in mind listening in or let's say you and your wife and up on a phone call do not like talking to her with me and mine you know that I can understand as I sit across the room so in the same way
 what we have to do this detective work to figure out what's the situation here and how does that help me put into context the things that Paul or Peter the John decide that's that's the basic Point turns out it takes a little effort because sometimes it's not quite clear and I just thought we could do is just profile a handful of New Testament letters and point out how you develop the skill kind of show how you develop the skill of reconstructing or Imagining the situation prompted the letter so shall we yes
one stop reading the letters as a grab bag of inspiring verses I think that's not a helpful practice versus right absolutely Series in conversation somebody who's familiar with the Bible who wants to take their reading skills and inside a treasure hunt for yoga versus if I sit down and really craft a letter and make it well organized to someone I'll be really disappointed if all they did end up doing is never actually reading the whole thing cuz it just reading paragraphs at a time and then selecting a sentence out however if you want to read through the whole letter understand how it all works there will be certain lines that pop the reading in context in the situation in context doesn't prevent you from having aspiring Bible verses what it will do is actually help you understand them even more so this isn't about I found over the year
 that people taking sentences out of context in the letters create more challenges than it does help people that's at least in my experience but maybe that's not everybody else except the concrete is put it and just start collecting observations about anytime the author mentions the purpose of the letter or something happening among the address he's the prompted the writing of the letter so let's do with a short one letter to the churches of galatia 6 chapters 15 minutes he packs like what would take me to page to write into three sentences but
 Alicia is writing some people that he knows and within the first paragraph he says why he's writing the letter you get it very clearly he says I invest six I'm stunned that you are so quickly abandoning the one who called you by the grace of the Messiah for a different good news different gospel and impulse mine is whole reason for existence is to be a Herald of the good news the Messiah Jesus that should create a category in my mind and you're okay and what have you helpful to know what this other gospel is and maybe some more details deserting how big of a deal is this really a few people was at the whole church was it really messy was it just a little bit of a problem use trying to stem off
 direct answers do you have to be at the detective you have to become a detective of these letters so somehow this phrase different gospel a different good news is being propagated by somebody on to the Galatians and so what you have to do is as you read through you have to start paying attention to what are the core issues at stake here cuz he's not going to just like you wouldn't look over to me while you're talking to your wife and be like hey Tim about this right now because the whole letter multiple times even put it together okay so it was interesting is right after he says he's stunned that they're being compelled by a different good news he goes into an autobiography about his story of how he gave his allegiance to Jesus and he starts with a line saying I want you to know brothers and sisters that the good news that I announced
 like I didn't make it up so you have to say like okay why does he have to make this point so if we're doing is when we watch one of the Apostles really ride a point we have to start to assume like somehow is matters this matters or in this case why does he need to make this point that his gospel is not made up but it's the real thing apparently some people are questioning there's somebody telling the Galatians that the good news of falling out too it's not the real thing now does he come out and say that not quite but you can reconstruct the situation in your mind who were people called Raven Queen Alliance between the lines or at least among Scholars this is called Mirror reading reading reading idea that with the letters two different metaphor for the phone conversation only hearing one person is saying that what we are looking at in the letter is a mirror
 and the mirror is reflecting real circumstances but you don't have you can't actually see the real circumstances all you see is one angle of the reflection of the circumstances in the mirror so what you have to do is look at the only angle we have like when you're driving you look in your rearview mirror so you can see what's behind you but you only see it from one angle and one perspective not a complete picture of ugly people you might need to do is let the mirror your rear-view mirror talk to you two then look over your shoulder to do the safety look over your shoulder real quick do you do those my side view mirror was gone for a while I just fixed it I did it myself I would like you to hear out the door and then thing I feel really accomplished so yeah you took your car door apart and put it back together prising Lee easy YouTube while I'm just watch it tutorial and Mason and the side view mirrors actually just because
 there's that big warning there like objects in this mirror are closer than they appear objects will be closer in real life and they appear on your mirror but it's it's a partial it's the person and then you'll get another angle on the reality help you understand the reflection in the mirror so that's the skill or trying to cultivate and the letters what's for what's the looking behind your shoulder yeah we can't we can't cultural context can help but will we have to do is reconstruct what we think we would see if we could look over our shoulder and everything so we'll talk about some criteria some helpful criteria for me or reading or but I just been trying to illustrate the need to work through Galatians quickly but not that quickly here
 story of how he was a zealous Pharisee and he met Jesus Jesus appeared to him practice world rocked his world so much she had to go to Arabia for some years and not talk to very many people process it process what happened then he talks about how he met with the original Three James Peter and John in Jerusalem to be like hey I met Jesus and this is the vibe I'm getting what he's all about and working this out yeah and Arabia and here's where I'm at the other Apostles I went to only Jacob or James that is the brother of Jesus and later he's going to go see is at 3 and they're going to give him the thumbs-up Galatians 2 he starts telling the story about you know I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas and I took the sky Titus who was not Jewish he was actually Greek and he wasn't circumcised he brings up circumcision
 the first time and he says he wasn't compelled to be circumcised when we were going and meeting with the Messianic Jewish leaders in Jerusalem but then he says there were some faults faults Brothers siblings who were spying on the freedom that we have in the Messiah to make us slaves equation is Two Rivers for so this is where we're going to be to see our profile of the different good news good news comes from followers of Jesus but did you read on through the letter there there Messianic Jewish missionaries who are going following Falls Trail after him and then try to clean it up trying to break a board that you're not actually fully in the family of Jesus yet cuz Jesus was the Messiah of Israel and Israel he fulfills all the Covenants
 with God's promises to Israel so you need to become a part of the people of Israel to become a part of the family of Jesus and all the at issue here is circumcision so all the sudden then circumcision becomes like one of the main front-burner issue for the rest of the letter it's all about circumcision I don't know how that strikes you but this was like what crisis for boy growing up in the church that's become normalized conversation for some reason but it is weird strange yeah that whole letter is wrapped around yeah this procedure but this was a very important sign of a being a part of the Covenant the abrahamic come in early sign symbol simple who's a symbolic behavior that had a whole story and world the attached to it we can do a theme video on circumcision
 is Gotti video that that would be what the rest of the letter goes on is Paul's trying to show how this is contradictory to the good news it's backwards that doesn't make any sense he's going to tell story about how tall he and Peter were in Antioch and 2:11 which was the first and it real fully multi-ethnic International Jesus net worth of Peter in public the rug with a bow thing to do I mean Peter Peter and essentially Peter was up there eating with non-jews and yeah it was fine with it and then all the sudden he calls the men from James but what he means is these Messianic Jewish missionaries come up to Antioch claiming to represent James
 Jerusalem brother Jesus and when Peter see some shows up he backs off and stopped hanging around on juice won't eat with them anymore and what Paul says and 2:14 is when Peter did this he was not it's interesting verb reading then IV when I saw that when they were not acting in line with the truth of the Gospel that word acting in line here is 14 tsp is not accept not except yeah but it's the word orthopedic it's where we get orthopedic it's literally walking to walk in a straight line so the good news marks out a path and for a church leader who belongs to one ethnic group to stop associating with other followers of Jesus who aren't a part of his ethnic group he sees this as compromising the gospel out of step with the gospel yes so blessed pause so you begin to build his profile here whatever the different gospel is in
 Elations it's a gospel that raises ethnic differences above the unity that Jesus followers have in the Messiah and the means by which the crisis is happening in Glacier is around the symbol of circumcision which is the ethnic boundary line that marks not into some chips new
I doubt we're actually getting a lot of backstory here totally wouldn't have needed him so much backstory and he could have just been like there's his guys another gospel and then he can just launch into what else he wants to say and then we're like the mirror reading becomes even really difficult got it if there are actually are some challenges that work but you can put together a lot. It's within the first couple chapters but you have to be told that you need to learn how to do that or else you want do it actually what I would do is I would skim passed this part cuz I'm in Hunt for the like good verses to meet you know so cool it's just something I can preach written as a geology essay
 letter and if when Paul gets into theology mode it's always in service of the situation in the Pastoral crisis or tissue that he's but he's addressing to pretty much every section of the letter then you can go through and you can see that it serves addressing this issue so we talked about this line already in the series about reading the letters when he gets to Galatians 3 and it talks about the first 26 you are all sons of God through faith in the Messiah Jesus you were all baptized in the Messiah you closed yourself there's no Jew or not Jew or Greek even wider than the situation at hand there's no slave or free there's no male or female you are all one in the side Jesus and if you block them side you are all children of Abraham which is probably directly contradicting what these other people are saying you're not children of Abraham and less you get the code right through the snow so here's what's great about Galatians 3
 verses 26 and 28 which I just read what we're watching Paul do is address one crisis of a different gospel the different gospel is somebody introducing some boundary line some category of ethnic value or ethnic rank right social Rank and saying this is what really defines the people of God and Paul's responses know Jesus the Messiah who loved me and gave himself for me and for people of all Nations is the real center of gravity and if you have given your allegiance to him that's what the fines the people of got Allegiance alone believe in loyalty act it's a life posture trust and loyalty so when he says this is famous for his questions 328 there is neither Jew nor Greek that's the issue right to English
 Greek being any other type of a Greek society the Roman society Titus earlier who was Greek and yeah I mean I think it's fixed phrase by that point alcohol to the Jew first then to the Greek but it's the way Greek as an icon of other beads Ovations that's right so he says the gospel breaks down barriers he brings up neither Jew nor Greek that's the specific issue that used to dressing in this letter includes two other pairs neither slave nor free so that's not the issue in galatia the well we stay we know if that's right but it is the explicit issue in his letter to Philemon there is neither male nor female in other words what we're watching Paul Paul has a theology now we're getting to that if you were to ride a theology book yes we're getting a little hint what that would be switched over to Unity
 in the body and his theology dictionary theoretically but we don't get what we get is Paul applying his theology in specific situations and then he'll give us a little paragraph or a little few lines that you can tell like a man if he had written a Systematic Theology these would be like a header for a chapter titled so he can you know what you're saying is through this is situational contacts which was about circumcision also we get it gives a spotlight that then we can look at and it gives us a view of a grander theology correct even though he's addressing one situational contacts when he is now waxing on about something much grander where slaves and Masters or slaves and freedmen
 not eating together the same table he would also be just as like riled up to write a letter to all part of the same Paradigm for him that's right it's there was a church that was letting gender power structures and Dynamics divide them at the church he would be just as riled up and write the letter to the laodiceans or something enough for the point is this here yeah he's he sees this boundary line as a category that then prompts us the readers to be like what what's this what are what are the boundary lines in my setting that will be identical but they'll be the same kinds of issues that I need to address with the same type of theology in my setting at the big ones you had totally Nick back and I'll make sure I'm trying to think of another one so the point is is that when we read the letters as really locked into
 situational contacts it doesn't trap them in that context. That's the way that we're going to discover how they can speak to other people in other cultures and times and it's not by neglecting their situation contacts this actually I think it would be helpful in the video to pick one and work with it you want to do it
 I just want to do some short ones cuz they're you know I was just looking so this is a church that he planted Phillipi this is going to cultural context back step-by-step Philip I was a Roman colony in the city that was declared a Roman colony and then a lot of it was retired military would retire to the colonies and they could be given they would be given in the state as like kind of their retirement package from military service in the colonies they would essentially build these colonies cities as little miniature Rams they would build the street patterns they would build the architecture they would build it to look like rum and the goal was basically to spread Roman economy power infrastructure throughout the ancient world but then all of these military personnel who get to go be the leaders of these new colonies feel like the emperor they are like little empress
 it's a it's actually great domination strategy if you're an Empire build little Outpost here and you give money and power and property to people who get to pretend like they're a little a the great idea if you're into that world domination kind of thing so is one of the commonest so Paul chose this is a city where he would go start a house church and then probably a couple house churches by this point and to plant House Church where people would be giving their allegiance to King Jesus so he's writing this letter from prison you're going to find out the opening paragraph So he says Paul Wright Paul and Timothy talk about why Timothy in the next video so I can video to God's holy Jesus at Phillipi an opening paragraph goes on to say thank God for them and in the first sentence as he says and all my prayers I always pray with joy because of your partnership you purchase
 Haitian in the good news from the first day until now so some reason why he's writing to them this cuz they are Partners in his mission of announcing the good news is interesting so he's going to go on to talk about how he's in prison and he knows that they are concerned about him and he wants to let them know that actually you know it's actually laying in prison but this prison time has given me a mazing opportunities to talk about King Jesus with the guards with the officers and really cool stuff Happening Here in the prison body goes on to talk about and then oh yeah 1:27 he says so whatever happens with me I want you all to and Ivy has conduct yourself conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the good news of the Messiah. And I think I'm an ESP okay what you got 427 let your manner of Life be worthy of gospel of Christ
 verb is Paula to a my parlor 202 is connected to our politics let your political behavior and not in the American sense never the Greek word polis is the Greek word polis has to wear to bi-city let your public Behavior so he's not just talking about like your way of life the way you guys or something what he means is live your life as a member of the city in a manner worthy of the good news that Jesus the Risen Messiah is the true king of the world Republic life your public life let your public life and service in the city tell the story that Jesus the Messiah is King the true king of the cosmos and he's in prison because of the Roman power if he doesn't get to have a public life right now yeah totally but he knows that they can and so he wants his boldness and stuff
 for the good news of Jesus to inspire them to live there public life worthy of good news about Jesus and he's going to all of a sudden start telling them to get along hey let's start getting along it says in Chapter 2 he'll just start saying okay you guys know if there's any encouragement if there's any consolation if you participate in the spirit please make my joy complete meaning stop bringing me grief by having the same mind being united in love and in the spirit stop being selfish and need retells the story of Jesus who gave up his great status and honor to die shamelessly so that you could be exalted and given the name Yahweh and then 2:14 stop grumbling and disputing so we're getting another picture here is it one he's grateful for them he knows they're in a difficult spot having to live on the public stage in a Roman City
 can be challenging and there's a lot of infighting and division people are frustrated with each other so he goes on to tell stories about like Timothy Hay you guys know Timothy oh man. Timothy he puts the needs of others ahead of himself you like puts hold up Timothy is this model of somebody then finally in 2:25 we hear this he says listen I'm going to send this guy epaphroditus back to you you sent him to minister to me in my needs and all the sudden that first, but he said thank God for your participation in the gospel what you can read on is to find out is that the Philippians sent one of their members aphroditus to go give them Paul money and food and presents and that's why he wrote the letter but I prefer diet has also told them that like hey there's some people who don't get along he's actually going to name two of them and 4:2 it's two women leaders in the church you odia and some 2K
 he says 4:2 I urge you odia and some 2K to live in harmony he says these women have shared in my wrestling for the gospel these are co-workers with Paul he's like these women are awesome and they've been important leaders in the middle of the Gospel of Philip I together with Clement that they're in a fight right now epaphroditus told me please urge them to go swimming that Patrick Titus all told him yeah that's the correct then finally he says it down and 4:14 he says it was so good of you all to share in my troubles as you Philippians snow in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel when I sent out with from Macedonia no other Church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving just you guys you guys were my sole Financial sponsors for ISSA
 even when I was in thessalonica you sent me a add more than once and listen it's not that I want your money what I want is for something to be credited to your account. I've received the full payment I've got more than enough I'm amply supplied now that I've received from epaphroditus the gifts that you sent there a beautiful offering got through the place so it's not till the end at the end of the letter that you find out the real practical circumstance of that app Aphrodite's came with some really great stuff Cash Cash Money Cash survive in a remand prison cuz your friends taking care of you so just all of a sudden Philippians I feel like pops all of sudden you were set to go re-read it now and all these different sections of the letter will take on
 the resonance new significance when you realize that this is the this is a dynamic so this is the skill to cultivate there are some letters where it's difficult or almost impossible to do a thorough mirror reading there somewhere it's easier but I'd love to look at one that you think is impossible oh okay all right let's talk about the letters to the cartoons
but here's the interesting fact what Americans call 1st and 2nd Corinthians for what at least I know what into a lot of sense cuz there's no apostrophe s t and you are what we call one and two Corinthians is actually 2 and 4 Corinthians in 1st Corinthians chapter 5 Paul says that in the earlier letter that I sent to you and 5:9 he mentions that he's already written earlier letter and then will you find out is zero a letter back to him with all these questions about his first letter which apparently they thought was unclear or had some stuff that bought them and he references the letter that they wrote him in 7:1 now about the things that you wrote to me so there was 1st Corinthians then they responded with the letter then
 is writing now this letter which is actually the second letter the second letter but we call it first then what he finds out is that they didn't like this letter this letter either and so they write a letter back to him then instead of writing a letter he came and visited in person and it went terrible you hear about this in 2nd Corinthians they had a huge fight and they were really rude to him and insulted him and so he left and then he wrote and what he calls in 2nd Corinthians the letter of Tears a letter written out of heartbreak and grief and they found some way whether the letter or report to apologize to him and then that's why he writes what we call Second Corinthians we don't we don't have the letter two years so we don't have the letter of tears and we don't have the very first letter 1st Corinthians
 interesting so already you're like oh this is complicated this is a whole long drawn-out drama call spent a year-and-a-half and can we learn the book of Acts he knew these people really well and there was a lot of really messed up stuff going on in this house churches in Corinth and so when you reading 1st Corinthians Paul is in like very personal emotive kind of mowed and posture and he'll very quickly refer to things that there's a whole backstory to that we just simply don't know right now opening paragraph in 1st Corinthians 1 second one says starting verse 1:10 he says okay so I appeal to you heard you brothers and sisters in the name of the Lord Jesus Messiah that you all agree with each other and what you say and that they're stopping divisions among you but that you'd be United in mind and thought so there's a theme here yeah
 impulse lighters by the tribal cultural boundary lines that humans love to create to give themselves value so yes the church is splitting for what reasons for saliva well my brother and sisters some people from Chloe's house have informed me that there are quarrels among you so who's Chloe she's apparently there's a group of Jesus followers that meets in her house and they have somehow reached out to Chloe reach out to Paul or what he says is some people from Chloe reached out so what I mean is this one of you is saying I follow Paul but another group is saying I follow Apollo's and yet another says I follow k-phos
 and in yet another says I just followed the Messiah so we've got really hard this church is divided based on their favorite church leaders and theologians and pastors and their life bad-mouthing each other so yeah I love this paragraph he says is Christ is the Messiah divided was it Paul that was crucified for you were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I did not baptized any of you oh well sorry I did Crispus and Guy us so that none of you can say that you were baptized in my name that's in look he has to remember some more people do it yes yes I also baptize the house is Stephen us and Beyond. I don't remember if I baptize anybody else that's not the point through 17 Christ and send me the baptized but the announce the good news
 not with wisdom and eloquence less the cross of the Messiah be emptied of its power and so he goes on which is like a tangent but that's another seem he's always kind of talking about it's an elegant yeah yeah the first weekend to see here are the divisions in the church is launches them on this will tangent paragraph where is like recalling on the spot I'm not listen to you all I hope that ties you has anybody while those two people like I just I mean the humanities by really shines here clearly he's just in the moment and has given us the gift of this paragraph in Holy Scripture so when it goes on for the next couple chapters is to talk about how the message about the cross doesn't fit the categories of what Greeks and Romans
 sitter and high society eloquent reasonable wisdom this kind of thing he still writing the same here of the popular teachers and speakers right to Paula's was from the book of Acts is that he was from Alexandria which produced Premier philosophers and public speakers and people think of Pallas has a better Communicator than Paul he could preach preacher and Sao Paulo knows it into these chapters 1 through 3 to talk about how listen to doesn't matter how powerful you are and speech like it's cuz that's all about status members and the honor shame rankings your family pedigree but your ability to speak in public told the story about your education told the story about what kind of family you came from cuz one of the Core Curriculum in Roman education is rhetoric public speech
 cated oh yeah but apparently wasn't a very good public speaker and you're like well he can work you can work like it wasn't it no it wasn't him who is it is I like the all-nighter house. That's right at least the point is according to the Corinthian standards yeah they think he couldn't breathe and so he gets as long as long the fence so again we have to put together here from reading for 1st and 2nd Corinthians this whole back story about how they thought Paul was not a good public speaker he brings it up and second Corinthians more so there is some of their challenging there's some that are nearly impossible like in 1st Corinthians who's been a challenge for me reading for a long time First Corinthian 15 you know where we're going I think so yeah it's about baptizing for the dead the whole chapter is there some Prince Ian's who think that the wrestler physical
 Resurrection from the dead is ridiculous and logically impossible and therefore Jesus resurrection from the dead must not have been his actual physical body being transformed I think it's ridiculous that we go through a whole complicated long throw line of thought showing out no New Creation The Resurrection body is physical it's a different kind of physical but it is physical but he does in verse 29 he is lying here that says now if there's no such thing as a resurrection he's trying to poke holes in their logic what's going to happen what people do who are being baptized for the dead if the dead or not raised at all why are people baptized for them and here's another reason why would I endanger my very life all the time for the good news of the Risen Jesus if there's no such thing as a resurrection I just moved on so there's some practice connected to baptism
 where are the dead ones what's that he just exactly what I'm not going to go into the whole books and stacks of books are written on the topic but the point is why you can't there's no mere reading that you can do to reconstruct that out of letters people have varying degrees of confidence with being able to reconstruct this practice and what it meant and why they did it but it's not referenced anywhere else in the New Testament there may be some other references to something like it and other Jewish literature of the period and it's very difficult to know what he's talking about here this is a good example where we have to say okay we'll give our best to inform scholarly guess and these are the things I love me the most letters of this is written for me well for you or to you well but even even for you to me like you know I guess I have to say this was written for me
 even their Bible was written for me in terms of its designed by the spirit boards people got but this if it was really written for me specifically it probably would be a lot more back story so I feel like I'm just feel like I'm eavesdropping it was written for me why do I have to eavesdrop ya know I think I know what you mean when you said for me this is what I have and in God's wisdom this is what we have but I'm he's dropping yeah there's nothing for it. This is a moment of disorientation when you realize oh what the Bible is is different than what I expected it would be there and those are always challenging moments that force you to expand your picture of who God is who I am and what these texts are
 and why they were given to God's people by the spirit and we're reading the mail or we have two people now and it's my understanding it as someone else's mail that I think it actually can speak to us but in a matter like this and 1st Corinthians which is if the baptism for the dead this is a moment where we just have to say lost to history in terms of certainty about what's happening there and the if the spirit wanted us to know more about that then I guess the we would have more information but apparently that's not the main point here was point stands and that he saying yeah yeah does the resurrection of the physical Resurrection happen or not correct and so what is things he points to his there's this practice people are baptizing themselves on behalf of people who have already died now if Resurrection doesn't happen why are they doing that correct they obviously did
 play Resurrection as a physical thing endorsing he's not promoting it and we don't even know if these people are just farmers and not I would assume that they might be I guess I kind of assumed that they are as he's trying to think of every reason possible to expose The Logical inconsistency in their thinking right and often times yeah good debater will create a list of reasons that aren't of equal value to their them personally but they're just trying to really Drive their point home it's clear he's in that kind of mowed medially in the next breath. Transition and also why would I put myself in physical harm as another correct he's just he's moving through a list of reasons that's right
where we going from here to look at the basic point that you can read through the letters as a whole and begin to build a profile of the situation situational contacts so sometimes it's easy sometimes it's hard so yeah a Next Step there's a handful of Scholars who have really written some insightful essays on this to help can I give you a little tool set for doing this kind of mirror reading to understand the situation in context I want explore them cuz they can give us some guard rails on this practice the skill and then I want to flush it out with an example that I think we could use in the video that could be pretty cool and that's the situation contacts with Paul's letter to the Romans so fascinating read that in light of the situation of contacts so I think that's what we should do next picture listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast if you're interested in submitting a question for our upcoming question response episodes about how to read letters
