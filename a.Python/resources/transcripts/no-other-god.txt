[Start of transcription 00:00:09]No Other God
Jon: Hey, this is Jon at The Bible Project. Last week on the podcast, we
began a conversation about the identity of God in the Bible, and we
quickly ran into a problem. 
Tim: The word God in English is a terribly confusing, unclear word. 
Jon: In Hebrew, the word translated as God is the word Elohim.
Tim: Elohim is a word that refers to a type of being, a spiritual being. And it
can refer to spiritual beings of all kinds. 
Jon: And that's the big takeaway from last week. Elohim, translated in your
Bible as God, doesn't strictly mean the all-powerful Creator God. It
actually refers to a wide swath of spiritual beings. Lowercase g gods. 
These beings exist, they have power and they're referred to in Scripture
often.
Tim: According  to  the  biblical  authors,  there  are  other  Elohim  spiritual
beings, and those spiritual beings, as Paul the Apostle call them, can be
called gods or lords. Like beings that do have power. 
Jon: So, the Bible talks about other Elohim, but the Bible also has verses like
this. "I am the First and I am the Last; Besides Me, there is no Elohim."
So which is it? Are there other gods?
Tim: So  is  monotheism,  even  a  helpful  word  to  describe  what  ancient
Israelites believe about Yahweh among all the other Elohim?
Jon: Why there's apparent contradiction, we'll get into that today on this
episode. Thanks for joining us. Here we go. 
All right. So we're talking about God. So the last hour was really trying
to deconstruct what do we mean when we use the word God. And then
we talked about the ambiguity of that word in English, or the confusion
it can create because most people think when you use the word God,
you mean the God of the universe, the monotheistic Jewish Christian
God. That's kind of the capital G God. 
But we use the word God to refer to like Greek gods.
Tim: With a lowercase g. No Other God
Jon: With a lowercase g. And so there's all that. But I feel like if you just take
that to the side and kind of just forget it for a second, and then just
come to the Bible and try to think in Hebrew...
Tim: Or Jewish Greek. The new Testament Greek. 
Jon: Or yeah, Jewish people speaking Greek, you kind of get a different
language that creates little different categories. What I found the most
helpful was, in Hebrew the word Elohim, which we translate as God, is
probably better translated as spiritual being. Because it can refer to
Yahweh Elohim, God of Israel, it can refer to the Gods of Egypt, it can
refer to the manifestation of the spirit of Samuel, and it could refer to
demons  -  were  all  examples  that  we  looked  at.  So  it's  this  broad
category of spiritual beings. 
And so where we left off was then in light of that, what did Jewish
people mean when they say, "There is no other God but one" because
they do believe there are other Elohims? So they don't mean there's no
other Elohims. So when they say, "There's no other Elohim, but one,"
what do they mean? 
Tim: Yes, that's the question. And the famous line in the Shema, "Hear O
Israel: the LORD is our God, Yahweh is our Elohim," Yahweh is one. Or
some translations of it in English go "Yahweh alone." So does that one
mean that there is only one Elohim, one God? Well, that's the question.
So here we get into a whole other discussion and it is actually still a
raging discussion in biblical academic studies about terminology. What
terminology we bring to the Bible is monotheism, even a helpful word
to describe what ancient Israelites and Jews believed about Yahweh
among all the other Elohim.  
Jon: Right. 
Tim: If you look up again, the main English dictionaries out there, if you look
up the word monotheism, the definition given is the belief or doctrine
that there is only one capital G God. 
Jon: And that's why they say. "There's no God, but one." 
Tim: There is no God. Yeah, that's right.   
Jon: Right? No Other God
Tim: So it seems very simple. The problem is the English word "God." And
we're not going to repeat everything from the last conversation. But
that's so not helpful.
[00:05:02]
  
Jon: Well, okay, but here's the thing. You went to ancient Jewish person and
you said, "There is God but one," they will go, "Yes." And then if you
said, "So you believe that there's only one God." "No." 
Tim: Yes, yeah, good. That's a great way to put it. "No, that's not what I
believe." 
Jon: "That's not what I believe." 
Tim: "Of course, there are other Elohim." 
Jon: As so you'll be like, "No, no, no, you just said there's no God but one."
Right? 
Tim: Yes.
Jon: So what's the confusion here? How is this happening?
Tim: So the meaning of this phrase, "One God," does not mean there are no
other Elohim. What it means is, there's only one supreme, all-powerful
Elohim that is above all the others and has no rivals among the other
Elohim.  
Jon: Now, in Dictionary.com, when it says, "The belief or doctrine there's
only one God," That's capital G God.
Tim: It is capital G. 
Jon: So, I think that's what they mean. They mean, there's one supreme
God. 
Tim: Ah, okay. No Other God
Jon: Because if you said, "Well, are there angels? Are there demons? Are
there other spiritual entities?" They're like, "Sure, but there's only one
God." 
Tim: Yeah. The problem is, therefore, we go into the Bible with that category
of capital God. But then we have all these other instances of lowercase
"god" or "gods". 
Jon: And then what do you do with that? 
Tim: And then that doesn't help us. So some scholars in this debate have
tried to introduce more nuanced vocabulary. So there's a Hebrew Bible
nerd named William Horbury and he proposed we use terms, he called
it Inclusive Monotheism. Meaning, Yahweh is the supreme deity. 
Here's what monotheism meant to an ancient Jewish person. Yahweh is
the supreme deity in association with other divine spirit or powers. So
we just say, "Let's teach the word God and just say, 'In relation to other
spiritual beings'." 
Jon: That's what I've been saying. 
Tim: Yeah, exactly. He would call that Inclusive Monotheism. I think that's
helpful. Then what he would say is, Exclusive Monotheism would be
denying even the existence of any other spiritual beings. 
Jon: So I feel like what I grew up with was somewhere right in the middle,
where you would go, "Well, there's other spiritual beings, but there's
no other gods." 
Tim: Right.
Jon: Meaning the Canaanite gods weren't real. If they were anything, it was
just demonic. There's no pantheon of gods in which God reigns chief
among them. There are a bunch of other spiritual beings. 
Tim: Right. Yeah, okay. Totally. Yeah, this gets so muddy so quick because of
our vocabulary. Because according to the biblical authors, all across the
Bible, there are other Elohim, spiritual being. And those spiritual beings,
as Paul the Apostle called them, can be called gods Elohim or lords -
like beings that do have power. No Other God
Now, remember what this whole thing in 1 Corinthians 8. Paul says,
"The idol is not a god. It's not a pellet. It's a piece of wood." And then
he clarifies in 1 Corinthians 8. Now, I'm not saying that there aren't real
spiritual beings out there. And he says, "I'm not denying the existence
of spiritual beings with power - lords" 
Jon: So we need you ask Paul, then, "Okay, you're saying there could be
other Lord's Dominion, why can't they also be represented by that
piece of wood? 
Tim: They could be. They could be or they could not. 
Jon: But he's saying they're not. He's saying that they're just a piece of
wood.  
Tim: It's just a piece of wood. But that wood could represent a real Elohim
that has some authority or sway or power. And if that's true, you don't
want to go into that temple. That's bad news. 
Jon: But wasn't he saying that you can eat the meat, don't worry about it? 
Tim: Yeah, he says if it's in your home, do it. 
Jon: Oh, but don't go in the Temple and do it. 
Tim: But if other people are gathering in the name of—
Jon: So he didn't think that the dominion of that Elohim, that spiritual being
could actually affect the meat in such a way that you would? 
Tim: Right. No. He says, "The meat belongs to God." The meat belongs to
God. 
Jon: There's no like magical mysticism where the meat becomes—
Tim: No. His concern is that when you gather with a group of people in the
name of what could be a real spiritual being and get yourself in the
presence of that being, it's not good. 
Jon: It's interesting because he's trying to be very nuanced and decisive
about how he's instructing his fellow Jesus followers to deal with a very
difficult cultural reality, which is that there's this practice of sacrificing
meat to these idols. No Other God
[00:10:07] 
Jon: And he saying there are other gods and deities and we need to worry
about it. So don't go and participate in thi practice and hang out with
those people because that world is real.
Tim: There's real spiritual beings. 
Jon: But if you're hungry, and you got some of that meat, eat it. That's fine. 
Tim: Yeah. Thank the God of Israel for making the heavens in the earth.  
Jon: They didn't actually poison the meat. 
Tim: Yeah, there's no spiritual poison or curse attached. Yeah, that's right.
That's  what  he's  saying.  And  he's  saying  this  to  a  community  of
followers of Jesus, some of whom are ethnically Jewish, and it would be
total compromise to go down and get your meat from there. 
And then you have others who are not ethnically Jewish, or maybe they
are Jewish, but they don't have these scruples or cares. And so they're
like, "It's just whatever. It's just a steak."
Jon: Yeah, and so those cultures are crushing in Paul's life.
Tim: Those cultures are crushing within the Christian community. And so
that's the dynamic that he's navigating here. But in no case does he
ever say, "These other spiritual beings don't exist." 
Jon: Right.
Tim: And so all the way back to this Bible nerd, really smart guy, William
Horbury,  is  saying,  "Okay,  well,  let's  distinguish  them.  Inclusive
Monotheism is biblical monotheism. The Yahweh is the chief supreme
spiritual being in a populated universe of spiritual beings. And let's use
the word Exclusive Monotheism to describe that you're denying even
the existence of any other powerful spiritual beings." 
Jon: I just think that our understanding of the population of spiritual beings
is pretty limited.  No Other God
Tim: Well, when you say limited, what do you mean? 
Jon: Well, as soon as you start talking about spiritual beings with dominion
and stuff, I just don't know...
Tim: Yeah, I got it. 
Jon: ...where are we. But you if say angels or demons, I kind of a bit of—
Tim: Categories. 
Jon: Yeah. And so what I wouldn't call those are gods. I just wouldn't use
that word. 
Tim: You wouldn't use the English word. 
Jon: Yeah, I wouldn't use English word.
Tim: Even though that is the word used in the Bible.
Jon: No, the word is Elohim. 
Tim: But in your English Bible...
Jon: In my English Bible, the Word of is God.
Tim: ...the word lowercase gods is used to refer to those beings. 
Jon: Yeah. I think I've always understood it was like God's with an asterisk.
You know. Like when I read that, it always...Because kind of like, there's
only one God, so they don't mean actually, God. They must mean
something else. So it's like built into the way that I was told to read the
Bible was this understanding that that was the wrong translation. 
Tim: So  fascinating.  So  let's  live  in  that  world  for  a  second.  I  gave  an
example right here of why I actually don't think William Horbury's
suggestion is very helpful. 
Jon: I liked it.  
Tim: Read Psalm 97:9. You read it for me. 
Jon: Okay. Psalm 97:9. "You Yahweh, are Most High over all the land." Why
is it parentheses Elyon?No Other God
Tim: Oh, that's the Hebrew word.
Jon: For Most High?
Tim: For Most High. Elyon. 
Jon: Elyon. "You Yahweh, are Most High over all the land; you are exalted
above all Elohim." 
Tim: So what you're saying is, the normal translation of that and all the
English translations is gods. You are exalted above all gods. And what
you're saying is, before sitting down today, you would just have a little
asterisk to say—
Jon: I would do one of two things. Yeah, there's an asterisk there. And I
would do one of two things. I would go, "Okay. All these so-called
gods, all these cultural ideas of gods, He's above all of them." And/or
that word “gods” is not referring to a supreme being like God. 
I guess, I don't know if I would have said it this way and able to
elucidate it like this, but I think my tendency would be to kind of
downplay and be like, "It's not really a god." Because anytime that kind
of stuff came up in Sunday school, church youth groups, that was kind
of the answer.
Tim: Yeah, whatever these—
Jon: It's not really God. And then why does it say God? Well, because I don't
know what the answers were.
Tim: So this is in a song of praise. This is a song whose whole purpose—
Jon: I didn't grow up with any songs like that. 
Tim: Well, okay. I'm just saying this is an ancient Hebrew song. 
Jon: Right. You wouldn't get away with the hell song that says "You are god
of other gods."
Tim:  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I'm saying this is ancient Israelite
song increasing the honor and the status of Yahweh the God of Israel.
And one thing you could say to increase the honor of the God of Israel
is to say, "You are exalted above all the other Elohim." No Other God
[00:14:57] 
It seems to me that for that line to be a statement of honor and praise,
by definition, means that these other Elohim are real and that Yahweh
is just more powerful than them. Otherwise, it's empty praise.
Jon: Right. 
Tim: Like he would never go to like a horse race. I've never actually been to
a horse race, but you wouldn't go to a horse race and be like, "Oh,
yeah, number 10, he's faster than any unicorn." You'll never do that.
Right? Because this is like, "Well,  unicorns  are real.  So  what? Why
wouldn't you compare them? There's no  other horse on this track
faster than number 10. That would be real praise. 
Jon: But all horses come from the same...it's like they're the same taxonomy.
Tim: Exactly. That's exactly my point. 
Jon: But  if  you  came  and  you  said  there's  no  other...I  always  have  as
difficulties with horses. But let's say with like cats. If you went to a zoo
and you saw lion, and you said, "There's no other feline like this lion,"
you have this massive category of feline...
Tim: Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure, sure, sure. 
Jon: ...to refer to cougars and house cats and little critters that live in the
desert. 
Tim: Yeah, good. 
Jon: But this one is different. And there's no other one. That's the only one.
Let's just pretend it's the only on the planet. 
Tim: Yeah. Let's actually use the lion, like the Saharan lions. 
Jon: The lion.
Tim: The lion.No Other God
Jon: But there's only one.
Tim: There's only one, yeah.
Jon: There's only one lion like a lion.
Tim: There's no other feline like this lion. "You are exalted above all other
felines." 
Jon: Yes.
Tim: This is a way better example than the horse. Yeah. Actually, thank you
for this. It's very helpful. I'm going to use this in classroom. 
Jon: Oh, nice. 
Tim: Yeah. No, that's actually exactly right. Elohim is a word that refers to a
type of being, a spiritual being. And it can refer to spiritual beings of all
kinds. Just like feline is a class of animal of which there are many
different species, one of those species is the supreme - the kings and
queens of the species. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, that's exactly what's going
on.
Tim: So  here's  why  I  don't  think  Exclusive  Monotheism  is  helpful  then
because  this  term  Inclusive  Monotheism,  monotheism  that
acknowledges the existence of other spiritual beings. But that's not
what the word monotheism means. In modern English, monotheism
means the belief that there's only one God.
Jon: Capital G God.  
Tim: Sure. But that's just so unhelpful to me.
Jon: Yeah, it is unhelpful. But think about this way, right? Can you say,
"Inclusive Monotheism is saying - let's take the feline example again -
the lion is the supreme, feline in association with all other felines of any
type." Cool, got it. Exclusive Monotheism: There's no existence of other
felines other than the lion. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. 
Tim: Because no ancient Jewish person or Israelite ever believed that. So
why do we even need it as a category? 
Jon: Got it. No Other God
Tim: Exclusive Monotheism.
Jon: Right. 
Tim: That's a total modern enlightenment.
Jon: Because our word God doesn't do the same thing as the word Elohim
does. 
Tim: Got it. That would be the same. So it's a service—
Jon: It's a translation problem. 
Tim: Yeah, yeah.
Jon: So in English, it makes sense, but the problem is, is now when you're
translating Hebrew text and Greek texts from Hebrew thought, it stops
making sense. 
Tim: Yeah, that's right. 
Jon: Okay. 
Tim: Yeah, you got it. So with that category—
Jon: Let me tell you something. Exclusive Monotheism denies the existence
of any other lion except for Yahweh. Right?
Tim: Yeah. 
Jon: There's no other lion— 
Tim: There's no other capital G God. 
Jon: The thought experiment would be, there's only one lion on the planet.
It's Harry the lion at the Portland zoo. Is the only one that exists. 
Tim: Yeah. So it's about to go extinct. 
Jon: Yeah, it's about to go extinct. Although this one lives forever. 
Tim: Okay, fair enough. Fair enough.
Jon: And so you would say, "There is no other lion but Harry the lion at the
Portland Zoo."No Other God
Tim: There's other felines. 
Jon: There's other feline. 
Tim: Tigers, cougars.
Jon: And so that's like saying, "There's no other God but there are other
spiritual beings." It just depends on how you're using the word God.
Tim: Yeah, in English. 
When someone's saying Exclusive Monotheism, I think what they mean
is there's no other lion, even though—
[00:20:00]
Tim: Right.  Well,  in  which  case  there's  no  difference  between  inclusive
monotheism. 
Jon: Exactly. I think that's what I'm trying to—
Tim: Yes. So in which case let's just use the word monotheism or...again I'm
trying  to  summarize  an  academic  debate  that's  been  going  for
decades. There's even more nerdy terms that have been thrown around
like monolatry.
Jon: Monolatry?
Tim: Yeah. So if idolatry is worshiping idol, monolatry means the worship of
one. So some people use that to describe what's going on in the Bible. 
Jon: Monolatry.
Tim: Yes. There are many Elohim, we worship one Elohim. Some people have
proposed the word henotheism.
Jon: Heno?
Tim: Heno, which is the Greek word, one.
Jon: Heno mean one?
Tim: Henos. No Other God
Jon: Henos. One...?
Tim: So one theism.
Jon: One theism. 
Tim: Which is the belief in...It's not about belief, it's about...
Jon: It's about one supreme. 
Tim: It's about allegiance to one. Yeah. And these all just arise just from—
Jon: And it's not just allegiance to one. It's the belief that there's only one
that has supreme power. There's one above all.
Tim: Which is why we give our allegiance to Him.
Jon: And why we give our allegiance. 
Tim: Correct, yeah. But the point is, of course, in the ancient world that was
a contested claim. That's what the Israelites believe about Yahweh, but
that's what the Moabites say about Chemosh. And that's what the
Sidonians up north say about baal. And that's what the Babylonians
claim about Marduk, right?
Jon: That they are the supreme. 
Tim: Yeah. Each people group believe that it's God was the Supreme God. 
Jon: There's a debate going on. 
Tim: Yeah. So what we have in the Bible is the Israelite claim that Yahweh is
the Elohim of all Elohim. 
Jon: Some people are like, "No, the leopard is the best feline." 
Tim: That's right. 
Jon: "No, it’s the panther." 
Tim: Yeah, that's right. It's a contested claim. 
Jon: Yeah. 
Tim: I think we're achieving clarity with how we're talking here. No Other God
Jon: Got it. 
Tim: So there's other possible objections.
Jon: Picking up what you put down. 
Tim: Let's say you're reading a passage in Deuteronomy, where God says
something like this. God says, "Hey, I showed up and cloud and smoke
on Mount Sinai and you were shown these things so that you might
know Yahweh is God; besides Him, there is no other. It's only Him." 
Jon: I think it's those kind of verses where Christians will say, "Yeah, there's
no other God.
Tim: Exactly. No other gods. 
Jon: Monotheism.
Tim: Yeah, other gods don't exist.
Jon: Don't exist.  
Tim: And just a few sentences later Moses says, "No one take to heart today
the Lord Yahweh is God. In heaven, above earth below, there is no
other." So I'm going to translate it again using Elohim, and you'll see
what's happening. 
In both of these cases, in Hebrew, the word "the" is put in front of
Elohim. In Hebrew "Ha Elohim." Deuteronomy 4:35. "So that you might
know that Yahweh He is the Elohim. There is not another besides Him."
Meaning  there's  not  another  "the  Elohim."  There's  no  other  "the
Elohim."
Jon:  But putting a "the" it means "Supreme."
Tim: Yes, He's Elohim of Elohim. 
Jon: So Exclusive Monotheism is just putting an article in front of Elohim.
Tim: Yeah. What this passage isn't doing is denying the existence of other
Elohim. It's saying, "Yahweh is the chief Elohim. There is no other chief
Elohim." 
Jon: Got it. No Other God
Tim: Like what you're doing with the lion. 
Jon: Yeah.
Tim: So when you come across these phrases, "there is no other" it's not
denying the existence of these other spiritual beings. It's denying that
those other spiritual beings are the chief God, the chief Elohim. 
Jon: Yeah. I mean, that makes sense because, you know, it's very clear then
that  in  Hebrew  thought  there  is  other  Elohim.  So  it  has  to  mean
something else. 
Tim: Yeah, yeah. 
Jon: So you're saying by putting the article "ha" is implying that a specific
supreme Elohim? 
Tim: Yeah. It's one feline, the chief feline among all of us. 
Jon: He is the lion, there's no other lion beside him. 
Tim: That's right. The other way you can help understand these passages—
Jon: That's feline. Yeah, the feline.
Tim: The feline. Yeah.
Jon: Which we wouldn't really do in English, right? I mean, it'd be kind of to
poetic in a way. I mean, it would work but it's not a typical way of
talking.
Tim: The lion is the feline of all felines. 
Jon: Yeah.
Tim: Yeah, I guess that works. 
Jon: That works a little bit. 
Tim: Yeah.
Jon: But you wouldn't say the lion is the feline. There is not another beside
the lion.No Other God
Tim: Sure, if you're really pumping up the rhetoric. Which is what these
passages are doing. They are making a claim. 
Jon: I think it's way more confusing in English than in Hebrew probably.
Tim: Oh, I see. I see.
Jon: I don't think our article "the" does the same work as a Hebrew article is
doing. 
[00:25:04] 
Tim: I understand? Yeah, go it. 
Jon: It could, but it doesn't naturally. 
Tim: You are "the" fast runner. There is no other.
Jon: If you come into a building, you're like, "Who's the boss?" No, because
there's always just one boss. 
Tim: There's always just one boss. Yeah. You need to go in a place where
there's many bosses.
Jon: No, you go into a place and you want to know like, "Who's the person
here who can get something done? Who's the guy I need to talk to
who makes things happen?" 
Tim: Or gal.
Jon: Or gal. Who's the person?
Tim: Who's the person. 
Jon: So you'd walk into a place and you'd say, like, "Who's the dude? Who
do I need? Who's my man or woman?" When I say man, it's gender
neutral. 
Tim: Yeah, you mean the human.
Jon: The human. Right? It's English. That's how we roll. No Other God
Tim: Yeah.
Jon: I  would  sound  weird  if  I'm  walking  around  being  like,  "Who's  the
human?"
Tim: It's not a phrase you will use. Let me bring it back in then we can land
this particular plane. The other helpful way to understand there is no
other passages in the Old Testament is to look at other times that
phrase is used but not talking about God. 
There's a really helpful example in the Book of Isaiah where Isaiah is
mocking the propaganda of Babylon. He quotes from this propaganda
of Babylon and so he says, "Here's what the king and queen of Babylon
say of themselves. You Babylon say to yourself I am and there is no one
besides me." So it's the same exact phrase as in Hebrew "Yahweh is
God; there is no one beside Him." 
So what the king and queen of Babylon are not saying is "I am king
there are no other kings in the world." 
Jon: Yeah.
Tim: It's actually pretty intuitive to—
Jon: Got it. So if there was so like "Game of Thrones," the whole thing is
about who's really the king. Like who rules the Iron Throne? That's what
the whole thing's about. It's a game of thrones. Who's the actual King?
Who's the rightful heir. 
And so if like Queen Cersei, I don't remember all the names, but if she
was like, "I am the one who rules Iron Throne and there's no one
beside me," well, there's lots of other people claiming.
Tim: Exactly, yes. 
Jon: But she's just saying like—
Tim: It's rhetoric.
Jon: It's rhetoric.
Tim: It’s rhetoric. Again Michael Heiser. This from a different work. Actually
from  a dictionary  entry. But he has put on this thing about otherNo Other God
Elohim. He says, "A close reading of these passages in Deuteronomy -
that  we  looked  at  -  and  Isaiah  shows  that  these  denials  are  not
claiming that other Elohim don't exist. Rather that Yahweh has unique
and incomparable qualities comparison to other gods. 
Yahweh is preexistent. He's not created, he's uncreated creator." At
least that's the claim. His role is Creator of all things, including the
other Elohim. He can save like in Exodus, right?" 
The focus is on Yahweh's comparable status and the powerlessness of
the other Elohim. It would be empty praise to compare Yahweh to
beings that don't exist. The biblical authors assume that they do exist
but compared to Yahweh, they are no thing. They are nothing. 
And I think that's exactly what's happening in these "no other God"
passages. Which helps us go back to when Paul said that idols are no
thing in the world. There's something similar going on here. Those
idols might actually represent a real spiritual being. They might not. But
in comparison to the One God, they are no thing. 
Oh, yeah. Actually, this is where all the logic of making fun of idols in
the Bible. There's actually many poems making fun of idols. I have just
one example from Psalm 115. It's the most elaborate. It goes on to say,
Psalm  150,  "Our  Elohim,  He's  in  the  heavens  –  meaning,  he  rules
overall, he does what He wants - but the idols they're just silver and
gold - People make them - They have mouths but they don't talk, they
have eyes they don't see, they have years they don't hear."
This is not an argument saying, "There are no other spiritual beings."
This is an argument lampooning idols. People who have convinced
themselves that these pieces of wood and stone are embodiments of
divine being, and that they have power, so we'll kiss them and bow
down to them, and make little close for them." It's saying...Yeah, there
you go. 
[00:30:00] No Other God
Jon: So,  in  Jewish  thought  then,  are  there  other  Elohim?  There's  other
Elohim with dominion. In which case, what if you did make an idol to
celebrate and represent that Elohim? 
Tim: Sure.
Jon: Sure, the idol can't speak, but that Elohim is real, and if you're trying to
connect to him, that's—
Tim: Yeah. And I think that's ultimately why Paul says, "Don't go into the
Temple of Zeus, and call upon the name of Zeus with other people, and
eat the sacrificial meal to Zeus." Because what he says is, "Listen, you
could be at the table," and then he uses a Greek word to refer to a
lesser spiritual being. The Greek word daimonion, which gets translated
as demon, which is another very unhelpful English word because we
think  of  little gargoyle,  right? Little horned reptilian creatures  with
wings and pitchforks.
Jon: Oh, I actually usually think of—
Tim: You don't think of that?
Jon: No, I don't. 
Tim: Oh, good. Oh, that's good. 
Jon: Yeah. I think of...I don't know what I think of. I just think of when
people cast out demons and stuff... 
Tim: Oh, that kind of thing. 
Jon: ...it must be something much more inferior. 
Tim: Okay, yeah. A spiritual being that has a destructive influence on human
behavior. 
Jon: Yeah. But I wouldn't call it God. 
Tim: You wouldn't call it Elohim. But the biblical authors call it Elohim. 
Jon: I didn't say I wouldn't call it Elohim. I said I wouldn't call it a God.
Tim: Well, you  speak English.  So what are  you  going  to...Yeah,  spiritual
being. That's, what you'd call it. No Other God
Jon: Yeah.
Tim: I think what Paul is navigating is some idols are just pieces of wood.
They don't represent any real spiritual being. And it's so ridiculous that
people bow down to it and are afraid of these things. But some of
them might actually correspond to a real Elohim. In which case just
swear off going to those buildings at all. That's Paul's advice. 
Because you could be in touch with a daimonian, which is a Greek word
meaning lesser spiritual being. The point here is just to say, these
biblical passages that say there's no other Elohim besides the One God
doesn't mean that these Elohim don't exist. It means they're powerless
compared to Yahweh. 
Passages that make fun of idols as being not real, once again, isn't
denying the existence of other Elohim. It's just saying those idols, sure,
aren't the Elohim.  
Jon: Yeah, cool. 
Tim: There we go. 
Jon: That makes sense. I didn't get to land the plane with my other thought
experiment with if went into a business.
Tim: Oh, okay. All right. Let's play that out. 
Jon: Let's say you want to buy a car.
Tim: Okay. You want to buy a car? 
Jon: Yeah. So you walk into the car lot, and there's a bunch of people
standing around, and you're like, "Who do I need to talk to to buy a
car?" And they go, "Oh, go talk to that guy. There's no other guy but
that guy that you need to talk to?"
Tim: Yeah. No, that can work in English. There's nobody else. 
Jon: There's no one else, but that guy. 
Tim: No one else but that guy. 
Jon: Yeah. "Go talk to Rick. There's no one else but Rick." No Other God
Tim: Yeah, that's right. And you're not saying no other humans exist.
Jon: You are not saying “no other human.” You're not even saying there's
no other car salesman there. You're just saying like, "Oh,...
Tim: Rick's the guy. 
Jon: ...Rick's the guy. Talk with Rick. Rick will hook you up."
Tim: There's nobody but Rick. 
Jon: He'll get you a Suede. 
Tim: Yeah. I feel like that's normal English. 
Jon: That's normally English. 
Tim: Nobody but Rick.
Jon: I mean, you probably wouldn't say it that way, but you could. 
Tim: You'll probably say, "There's nobody like Rick. Nobody can get you a
car like Rick."
Jon: Yeah, yeah. "Don't deal with anyone else, but Rick." But you could say,
"There's no one but Rick." You could and you would follow, but you'd
be like, "There's other people here." 
Tim: Yeah, that's right. It's a weird way to put that.
Jon: It's a weird way to put that. But you'd be like, "Okay, I get it." But since
we come with the category of there's no other gods to say that you
would look around and you'd be like, "Well, yeah, no, duh. There's no
other car salesman here. Rick is the only guy." So yeah.
Tim: Yeah. All right. So having made that that just raises another question.
So the Bible doesn't deny the existence of other Elohim than Yahweh.
Yahweh is an Elohim. No other Elohim is Yahweh, but Yahweh isn't
Elohim. And there are other Elohim. 
So who are they? And what's their relationship to Yahweh. They're not
as powerful as Yahweh, but do they have any power? What role do
they play in the biblical story? What role do they play in the world in
the past, today? Let's talk about that. Then that's the natural question. No Other God
[00:35:01] 
The  biblical  authors  actually  have  a  storyline.  There  is  a  biblical
narrative ark that spans from Genesis to Revelation about these other
Elohim. So that's what we should talk about next.
Jon: Thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible Project podcast. Next
week, we continue our conversation on God and how he isn't alone.
God has a crew. 
Tim: Bible nerds, biblical scholars have come to refer to this category or this
idea,  this  theme  as  the  divine  council.  It's  language  and  imagery
depicting God as like a commander-in-chief of a staff of Elohim. 
Psalm 89. "The heavens proclaim Your wonders, Yahweh: Even your
faithfulness, in the assembly of the holy ones. Who in the skies is
similar  to  Yahweh?  Who  among  the  sons  of  Elin  is  compared  to
Yahweh? He is the great God, - which is the Hebrew word El, not
Elohim - He is the great El feared among the Council of holy ones. He's
revered among all those surrounding him." 
So the question is, does God actually seem to interact with the world
through some kinds of mediators or delegated authority figures? 
Jon: Today's episode was produced by Dan Gummel, and today's music was
made special by Tae The Producer. The Bible Project is a nonprofit
organization. We're in Portland, Oregon. You can watch all the videos
we make, listen to our podcasts, download other resources. It's all for
free at thebibleproject.com. Thanks for being a part of this with us.
Ashley: Ashley  Song  and  I  currently  live  in  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.  We
recently used The Bible Project when we were going over the Book of
Philippians. To introduce our daily devotions in Philippians, we showed
that video to the students, hopefully, encourage them to start daily
devotions. These are students who are kind of new to Christianity, new
to the concept of daily devotions, and I hope that it kind of help them
see that the Bible isn't something that we can understand. They can go
ahead and try and read and kind of learn something from. 
We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We are a
crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes,
