we've been tracing a theme that we've been calling the chaos Dragon read the story the Bible is today's episode we come to a story that employs all the major motifs of this thing it's got chaos water it's got a great sea monster except the story doesn't call the creature a sea monster the story just calls it a great fish that's right today we're talking about the story of Jonah thrown into the deep Abyss swallowed up by death even the belly of the Sea Beast can become a vehicle for God's Redemptive purposes than the world the story of Jonah is a Twist on the themes that we've been talking about we've seen Spiritual Beings become chaos Dragon we've seen humans become dragons but now Jonah is the chaos Asian the story of Jonah is a way of exploring in the tale of one rebellious Israelite is real failure to truly be a mouthpiece for God's character
 among the Nations who oppressed Israel the people we thought were the chaos Monster they end up repenting and the actual sea monster and Jonah the great fish in the Deep Abyss it becomes a vehicle of God's Redemption Jonah flips the script and makes us ask what if I end up repenting God's really insistent that Monsters can't get turned into glorious images of God they can be recreated reversed and rescued they can be ready today to Maggie and I are talking about the chaos Monster in the squirrel of Jonah I'm done calling to new listing the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
hi here we are we're talking about the dragon dragons but you know they have the way into really talking about the prince of the power of the air and it turns out I mean yeah so in this series of conversations we started with Genesis 1 and noticing that Recreation state is a realm of disorder and desolate this described as a Wilderness and as a chaotic undulating Waters and how can it be both the Wilderness and chaotic Waters great questions victory images that have the same symbolic meaning of Realms that are devoid of human life and that are in ancient imagination impossible for humans to establish driving
 communities there and there's a Third Realm it's also Associated which is the Realm of Darkness the darkness that the darkness was over the Deep Waters okay desert Darkness bought it all in Genesis 1 verse 20 verse to this is the states and which life cannot exist opposite of order life goodness Beauty Community were talking about in terms of the realm Realms of chaos and this team isn't about the rounds of chaos but if this was a thing about the rounds of chaos that seemed ends the story of the Bible and with those Realms being destroyed right yeah or having passed away cuz the ending images of a mountain of dry land no more see his face being so permeated with God's own light that the sun in the moon are no longer necessary there's no more night
 and then it's a garden on top of the mountain Cosmic Garden great you know that's interesting but it's been a few minutes reflecting on the story of the Bible begins with God separating those Realms so that life can flourish and then it's good the separation is good or the Realms the Realms are good ya got separated light from dark and he's because the light good yep. Saw the light that it was good now I think one way to think about Genesis one is God creating, if I perfected ending state but what it feels like we're saying it was a beginning State the separation was just the beginning of the end state is when you no longer need the darkness has gone the water is gone the Wilderness is gone begins with the separation now life can flourish but the separate
 I have to be completed so that one where I'm goes away and only one realm exists yes that's right and the garden is a pocket a little seed of Heaven in the middle of the chaos surrounded by chaos right the desert out there is surrounding the land the darkness that comes every the east of Yahweh has determined that the garden that is infused and Source by God's Own Divine Life will eventually spread to all reality but what slithers into the garden but a creature of the Wilderness that wants to confuse and deceive humans who God wants to use to spread the garden and to not trusting God it's agent of chaos is it that brings us to the theme that we've been exploring which is the creatures of the chaos around the chaos creatures and each of those three
 Realms has its own Associated kind of iconic chaos creature in the sea has the sea dragon
 the desert has a variety of creatures but prominent among them is the snake but also lions and scorpions and jackals jackals scream like banshees and then also deviant stars above yeah now we can talk about the origin or the reason why there's chaos creatures in the first place and when it comes to the stars above we know that they were put in place to be rulers of the sky ordering the Cosmos on God's behalf reflecting God's lights and that when they wanted to not stay within their domain and ribelle they were not happy with the position that God gave them there was some sort of fall those creatures had some sort of heavenly father both Genesis 3 and Genesis 6 story about the sons of Elohim
 and Genesis 11 with Babylon all feature in some way explicitly or implicitly the all of the Heavenly rulers now the Sea Dragon the origin story of the Sea Dragon is God just put some in yeah but that's the origin of the snake to in the wilderness it's one of the creatures that God made but somehow the Sea Dragon become a creature that God has to destroy and I think that's where there's a little bit of confusion in my mind just a little yeah how did that happen it feels to me like it was just a creature that God created you know that Chris Lyons he created all sorts of creatures that I should be afraid of and there's just this idea of a monstrous sea serpent and I feel like if I want to have a category of like it's okay it's out there and its own domain you don't have to be scared of it it
 I can praise God it can like be aligned with God but at some point it becomes something that I do have to deal with yeah well aware that you need to know about and fear and hope that God will deal with out the deal with it in that I will confront it exactly yes yes so I think I'm pretty sure this is how it works that the dragon is introduced them day 5 of Genesis in the waters it's the chaos creature in a casserole and then you're introduced to a snake of the Wilderness the crawls into the garden and then you're told about the downfall of that snake a decision that it makes that leads to the ruin of the human images of God and to its own self
 I think we are to see the backstory of the Dragon in the story of that snake another that's how the snake becomes got sent to me the story of the car cuz once you go forward the snake was a dragon can be interchangeable and then even the words for the dragon or the snake the Hebrew word stunning or not hash can be swapped interchangeably later in the Bible and as we leave the garden later biblical authors can either bring up the imagery of snakes and their Destiny or the sea dragon and it's Destiny and they are I think two ways of talking about the same thing until sometimes biblical authors will downsize the importance of the dragon snake relative to God's purposes in the world so you get Psalm 104 that's just like a dragon is just out there playing
 and you have other problems where in Isaiah 11 the new creation and is described as a place where babies will play with cobras look like the things have been removed but other times when the biblical poet really wants to emphasize God Is the Victor Over the Sea Dragon there you get the arm of the Lord smashing dragon head so I can Isaiah 51 or you spell in the Dragon Blood that's right and those are all places where the dragon is viewed in its kind of cosmic sense there's been this other major thread we've been following the ghost from the garden story where the snake is right there as a voice in the year but then in the Cain and Abel story you don't see a snake yeah you just hear that there's something called sin that wants to consume cane than that if he doesn't rule it and he apparently doesn't coz he murdered his brother and then the rest of the day
 story you can talk about violent human rulers
 as dragons agents of the Dragon so he can speak that's the kind of the Twins Red we've been tracing and also the Stars know what we are going to do is turn our attention to the Book of Jonah which is a really interesting Twist on all of these themes
 okay so the Book of Jonah it's like it's just next level next next level you know how when we were kids in The Simpsons came out it was like I was really brilliant and clever both cuz it's a kid is genre it entertains me but then also what I noticed was like all these adults really liked it and they got all of like the pop culture references the like a of ancient history of references and and that's kind of what Simpsons The Simpsons was brilliant at was every joke and made was really two or three jokes working at multiple a multiple layers yes and I think that was even a Montreux in The Simpsons is like never just tell one joke every joke has to be at least two or three jokes by means of cultural hyperlinks right yeah I think about it a joke would like makes sense on the very sick
 call child this level of like all that was funny slapstick he's kind of funny yes that's the joke but then the joke is this another layer of actually tell me something about the stupidity of humanity yeah like and I'm thinking about just the pride and arrogance or just the buffoonery of humans actually know the joke is actually about culture in about like something happening at a societal level that we're all wrestling with and it'll be doing all three think it's okay that we have Jonah Works Jonah is simultaneously working at the all humanity and God storyline from Genesis 1 through 11 lots of hyperlinks to that it is also working with the story of Israel and its Covenant sojourn with God
 I'm Exodus 19 on to the Torah and Prophets but then it is also working with many of these common motifs stories misic symbols of Israel's neighbors in Babylon by Syria and Canaan in Egypt it's just it's doing all of it it's really a remarkable piece of work and of course what's great about this kind of conversation is that the thing that we want to focus on in the story of Jonah is the thing that the stories most girls who are famous for the great whale the big thing that consumes Jonah in the waters
 so first let's just get contacts real quick it's a story about an Israelite Prophet named Dove son of my faithfulness Jonas Audubon the time it seemed of Jonah ya mean stuff and then I'll meet I means my faithfulness which is ironic an extreme cuz he's absolutely Unfaithful it almost every step of the story so he's called to go to this city Nineveh a capital city of the Assyrian Empire which in the narrative setting when he lived because John has a reference One X in the book of kings and in this time. When this area was on the rise to go to Capital City
 of the biggest baddest Empire on Earth at the time and the city that's going to destroy you and your family and everyone and everything you care about in the future generation I go to that City
 and cry against it because its wickedness has come up before me. He is going to be home Jonah doesn't want to do that so God throws a storm at him as he tries to flee on a ship and then when Jonah finds his way off that ship into the waters he finds a huge Sea Beast to transport him to the place where God is calling him and then he Praises famous prayer in the belly of the Beast and it vomits this response to vomit him up onto dry land and he goes to Nineveh and he preaches a 5 word sermon and the whole city ends up like repenting of their sins and turning to God and it makes Jonas so mad he become suicidal and so he goes out to the desert
 the sit in a tent In the Heat of the Sun and me to bring curses on himself and I got he would rather die than have to live in a relationship with a God who wants to redeem and forgive his enemies is less us forget Nineveh a capital city of Assyria yes yes these are the guys that will come and take out Jerusalem yeah that's exactly right these are and all of the northern tribes of the Northern Kingdom of Israel as well yeah with violent Warrior Kings exactly right these guys are the surface they are at either the dragon this is the dragon. Send going and preach to the dragon to write the atrocities of Nineveh are well-known and described in ancient literature and depicted even
 so that's the basic storyline the iconic scene is the Jonah Rises up from God's call and he eats fleas and he goes to the west and where he starts going is all of these places that are associated with images or ideas of the Garden of Eden tarshish was a place from which gold and apes and peacocks were imported when Solomon was building up Jerusalem in the temple he goes down to the town of java which in Hebrews yasso but it's the word beautiful and there's many other Lolita neko's so he's trying to instead of going to the place that for him is like the worst place on Earth he's trying to go to find a little idea of Hawaiian Paradise somewhere and you know what the world's going to hell in a handbasket I'll be on the beach with my
 slushy cocktail drink or whatever that's kind of the same here ya know that I mean we read the song Hey the Raging Sea below go up to the mountain yeah that's right I like let them let them fight it out destroy themselves go find refuge in Paradise which I suppose if your call was to go to paradise but his call was to be that of the suffering role of physical profits go to the go to the chaos go into the mouth of the Beast and so God brings a storm and what do you meet someone on the ship in the storm are all of these non-israelite Sailors who are like so in tune with the will of God
 even so that when they roll dice to see whose fault it is on the ship like it turns out like the Jonah's name rolls up so to speak so he tells them to kill him by throwing him in the waters
 so Jonah doesn't know he's going to get swallowed by a fish there's no way that would be in his mind is like a way out of the situation so he's pretty certain like he's giving up his life so it's the first little sign you could say oh maybe since the first Nobel thing he does in the story Maybe
 the men don't want to do it but they eventually do it they throw them over so here's our profit getting thrown into the store the chaos Waters right and they're in the chaos Waters wearied 1:17 Yahweh a pointed a huge fish to swallow Jonah
 and Jonah was in the innards of that fish three days and three nights great fish the great Phish the name for fish in Hebrew is dog really kind of makes it easy to remember is you like well it's an animal dog with a sound which I guess if you spelled a d a g in English you would say I want to say bag that's not rough dog hot dog dog and then the word great so weird God allow its use 14 times in the short story of Jonah the city of Nineveh is great
 the wind is great on the sea the storm is great the fear of the sailors is great the fish is this word gist means huge huge fish then none of us a huge City Jonah has huge displeasure at God's mercy then he has huge happiness about the little plant that grows up over him the word huge is used a lot of story this is just a huge fish
 and it swallowed them up and it's so huge that apparently he can you know live in it for a little bit or is in a state of living death of the where you know the pain to be slowly ingested over the course of days and nights in the innards of a huge fish me. Read that sentence you got all the Skype golden he's good. Like all that's a bad way when you finish that sentence but then from the belly of the Beast Jonah press sweep raises prayer and when he finishes his prayer which is essentially like I cried for help when I was going down you cast me into the deep that's the Deep Abyss from Genesis 1 verse 22 chaos realm Into the Heart of the Seas the currents engulf me
 from the depths of the Grave you heard my voice is going down in there you are Lord heard my prayer in your temple is not thinking about Jerusalem from the depths of the underworld to the highest height you heard my prayer in your Holy Temple
 and so he vows a new vow of dedication to God and God's response and Yahweh commanded the fish and it vomited
 Shirley supposed to shut off the vomiting is the means of Salvation feeling out he's swallowed up and then spewed out by the Sea by the Sea Beast so it is the word fish it's not the word Dragon I mean not a leviathan dog the big dog a huge sea dog is a huge Sea Dog so naturally this is become a whale in the popular imagination popular retail length of a hard day what is really fascinating is the first what's fascinating is this thing became a lot more in the history of art it's only in the modern. The people have imagined this this awhile so
 what we need to remember are the two aspects of the Dragon taming strategy in the Hebrew Bible sometimes the big sea dragon to show that it's not a threat to God's power will be to depict it as just another sea creature just like those fish the psalm 104 Praises God for all of his works that are in the sea and swarms without number animals small and huge even Leviathan which you formed to play in it it's just a
 just another beautiful sea creature
 and then there are no such strategies to use the dragon-slaying meth so popular in Israel's culture in the surrounding cultures to depict you always bashing the head of sea dragon to make the same basic point that it poses no ultimate threat to his power for purposes we also talked about how God can use the Sea Dragon for its own for his own me yes yes used it as Babylon to destroy other nations exactly right so more than once Imperial leaders of the ancient world Syria Egypt and Babylon are described the dragons in biblical poetry Jeremiah Babylon as a dragon that swallowed up Israel into it stomach and spewed it out it's like the same imagery and even vocabulary as the Book of Jonah
 so that's interesting this imagery of Israel being swallowed up just by its enemies is an image that appears in Lamentations chapter 216 which reads all your enemies have open their mouths wide against you they hiss and gnash their teeth they say we swallowed her up
 in Hosea chapter 8 Israel has swallowed up among the Nations as a way to refer to the northern tribes of Israel being taken out by Assyria
 so getting swallowed by enemy Nations is another way of activating the Sea Dragon image
 so I think what's happening but I don't think a lot of people think what's happening is it in Jonah that the story of Jonah is a way of exploring in the tale of one rebellious Israelite
 it's a way of reflecting on Israel botched vocation to be a kingdom of priests among the Nations another words at the way of reflecting on their failure to truly be a mouthpiece for God's character and purpose among the Nations and so Jonas Journey where his Rebellion leads him into the belly of the Beast only to be spewed out and then to do a partially okay job but yet to have the nation's respond with ultimate praise is going to force God's chosen one into a conundrum
 what if the role of Israel in the storyline actually succeeded of all these nations that have been trampling on top of that people for centuries I think that's what's being explored and so what if Nineveh or Babylon if they started to praise Yahweh what if our enemies and repenting what if the vision of Isaiah of all the nations at peace bringing their gift and praising Yahweh for the actually came to be and then all the sudden at the end of the Book of Jonah is depicted like caned
 literally was like Cain hyperlinks cuz he gets angry hot with anger about God showing favor to these others and so that's what the Book of Jonah as a whole is about and so it really they're strong resonances with Jonah getting swallowed up by a beast and then spewed out with the storyline of what the role of Babylon swallowing up Israel in Exile and then Israel getting it back out on the other side
if all of that is in play
 then what's the logic of downgrading sea dragon too bad of a huge fish right there to use tiny nor the life in pieces are there a storm raging storm water heater with the dragon a huge Sea Beast swallowing up a human in your luck all you had to do was say ton in and it would click into place but instead it's just a huge fish fish exactly right so one of my favorite commentaries on the story of Jonah by Scholars Philip carry such a great writer to do so is take on why the author of Jana uses the first dragon taming strategy which is just to downgrade the dragon to a big stash he says it this way he says the gray
 fish is a Comic version of an ancient nightmare
 the great monster of the deep that represents chaos and destruction the flooding and undoing of the world
 in bearing witness to the power of the god of Israel scripture often reckons with the nightmares of ancient near Eastern mythology and puts the image to its own uses Jonah the nightmare turns into accommodate we talked about this I think in the last conversation that these are the ancient horror stories yes he's alright nightmare stories yeah yeah exactly the creature that swallows up Jonah is not one of the terrible monsters of the deep it's just a great big fish called a monster if you wish it's no big deal
 wherever you go in the world Yahweh who created it is there before you and can prepare a way for you even if that way is a great big fish
 so what he detects here is that you're both downgrading the dragon but then you're also saying that even the belly of the Sea Beast can become a vehicle for God's Redemptive purposes in the world so the Sea Dragon at the Sea Dragon represents the disorder of creation of Health
 then even the undoing of creation
 can become a place where God's purposes are carried through to their next step and what the next step is actually is the next important step in what is something I'll point out but that's the first step McGuire from a dragon to assess what are the taming Dragon taming strategies is that God can use the monster for the purposes and that seems to be employed here to that's right yes God is using the sea monster to rescue Jonah normally would think this is like a punishment and it kind of fits the consequences of us choices of let him hear it is it's like it's like a Joan has thrown into the ocean like him descending into the ocean the deepest place in the ocean is the belly of a monster of the but it actually becomes a place where he can be safe
 until he spit back out and that's interesting but when I just think of like God saying I'm going to use Babylon to take out other corrupt Nations leaders but then I'm going to deal with Babylon yeah that's in my mind to it's like okay great it's a fish but it's still the sea monster in. Still got a deal with that right now God's got to keep playing it so that we're both downgrading the dragon to the fish and we are making it the yeah the agent of God's purpose as he deals with the servant his rebellious servant through so he is in the innards usually translated stomach but it's the the main the inner parts gots the intestines yeah three days and three nights
 be a little sticky so three days and three nights along with 40 days or 40 years 40 and three are common periods of time associated with stories in the Bible where somebody face is a choice it's going to test their faithfulness to God or not the trial and what we see is during his test he recognizes that if it weren't for Yahweh all that would be left for him is death itself that you always deliver to that the last line of his prayer is Deliverance rescue salvation is from Yahweh and then he gets vomited out of the innards of the fish so the fish ends up turning into like so if Kerry said the way through Death Becomes a way through them yes yes
 deep meditation hear that the death of God's chosen one actually is the vehicle of him turning in to this witness to the nation which is what Jonah coz on to doing just that it's a check this out like you can't make this stuff up in Jonah 1:17 when the fish is first mentioned he's called Dog Guard Dog is this coronavirus Hebrew the goal is what god or goddess is huge huge huge dog noun common meaning masc4masc noun Hebrew like many languages in the world have grammatical gender feminine or masculine for the first time it's in its comment or masculine form
 then when it says then Jonah prayed to Yahweh is God from the innards of the fish inexplicably this word fish is done and that is the feminine ending so very explicitly shifts to a feminine noun is now to Big Mama fish giving birth to him with a living creature in its belly what's that about what is that about so one thing is certainly is not as an accident like it's very intentional and it has to be connected to this the way that the Sea Dragon is being repurposed here
 as a fish that can actually carry out the rebirth of God's rebellious chosen one so once again this is from a commentary by a Jewish commentator Marvin Sweeney on Jonah and he says this ceases interpreters have noted that the Hebrew term for fish changes from masculine form to the feminine form although the shift remains problematic why is it doing it that has presence in the belly of a fish suggest the imagery of pregnancy for the fish and the new birth or the new creation of Jonah or another scholar James Ackerman is a really great essay on satire and symbolism in Jonah's pawn shows how Jonas poem could be read as a genuine confession of repentance or he shows out could be read as
 total upside-down satire of thanking God for death and that his death is the Salvation from having to do the will of God is being rescued from God's will that I don't have to do it because that's in that's why I jumped in the water like fun to have the complete opposite meaning every word in the poem could he says it this way he says the male fish that ate Jonah
 now becomes a female fish for Jonah once he enters our entrails the point is forced upon us further as we hear Jonah from the belly of a female fish sing a misguided song from the womb of sheol namely the grave here so if that's what's going on and it seems like it is then this sea Dragonfish belly Becomes of womb out of which is born a whole new Jonah who then goes on to do the will of God and luck that we reluctantly that ambiguity in this character through the rest of the book but maybe you can track through Isaiah and Jeremiah and they both talk about whatever the new version of God's covenant people will be on the other side of Exile it's going to have to involve a new birth and they use imagery in two.
 about the new seat in the new family that God will bring about and Jonah just his stories fits right into that dark but the belly of the CB becomes the womb that rebirths him that's the suggested imagery of why the fish changes from a masculine to Avengers as well and to the degree that the sea must have represents death itself which we've met sitting on crocodile swallow up death when he's talking about slaying the Leviathan then being swallowed by the sea monster is the most as a very graphic visceral image of
 dying and being in the belly of a of a sea monster is like the Ultimate Death then for it to become a place where you can actually live for 3 days and then be reborn suddenly the belly is like you said a womb and so death loses its horrific sting yeah you know that's right now becomes the seedbed of New Creation that's really a very suggestive damage and it is no coincidence then why Jesus Drew upon precisely this image from the story of Jonah was it when this is the story he's in the temple and he's like
 the only sign I'll give you is the sign of Jonah well so Jesus go to Matthew 12 John Matthews version he's still up in Galilee he was just in a synagogue and but there are scribes and Pharisees their HR represent the religious leadership of this realm
 and then he exercising a demon cast of Blue mini dragon out of a guy and they accuse him of being in League with the elves of all that is the prince of demons in the ruler of death forces you must be in League with the dragon to be able to drive up many dragons so to speak and he says well that's a stupid thing
 I'm at the mama dragon a dragon a dragon or is it was he says the Satan cast out the Satan Witness Kingdom crumbled he's divided against themselves no no no no I'm in partnership with the spirit of God so then he has a bunch of things to say about that and then with the Bible nerds and Pharisees say to him is like okay so do do is do a miracle do a sign for us then we believe in you and what he says is an evil and adulterous generation which is what Moses
 exactly what Moses called Israel in his final column to them cause of evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign
 and no sign will be given to you well except this one
 what's a good line you won't get any sign except the size the sign of Jonah
 just like Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of and what's interesting is he does not use the Greek word for fish he uses the Greek word chaos which I have pulled up here is Elidel and Scott classical Greek Lexicon which is the word for sea monster. Dragon notes not the rock on so it's not Dragon but it's Kate. And it's used in The Iliad and the Odyssey for sea monster Homer's Iliad north of the monster which to which Andromeda was exposed Andromeda do you know that I don't know that story
 the Greek myth oh yeah Greek mythology and dramatize the daughter of the king of Ethiopia open side and sends sea monster big sea dragon satus pass is the word chaos to see in that fish something more than just my calls at the sea monster calls it the great twist in the story I didn't realize it so just like three days and three nights in the belly of the monster so will the son of Adam
 be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth in the Underworld and death you want to sign the sign will be that through death life will emerge you're going to kill me them with the people of Nineveh in the people of Nineveh turn the Gods on Jonah came and I'm telling you somebody greater than Jonah is standing right here and you're not listening to me
 so the first part of the sign is you're going to kill me that's your first sign and then implicit it is through the three days and three nights is that you're going to lease the sea monster on me and kill me but we learn from the story of Jonah one of my stations this way Jonah is that what you think is the agent of death could become the one with life and so. That feels like the deepest part of the sign yeah you're going to kill me but you're going to unleash life well yeah you think that this is also a cane and able moment here cuz the Bible nerds
 of Israel are being depicted as looking on Jesus as this undeserving rebellious younger brother is leading is real astray and they are going to write conclude that it's right to kill this innocent man within that frame The Gospel Store is show Israel's leaders some of them ones with power partnering with the snake to spill innocent blood in the land and Jesus lays on top of that the imagery of Jonah story that they will step in League with the sea monster to kill me but God will use even that sad act of violence and death to turn it into a vehicle is rebirth in life not just for Jesus himself but actually for Israel and for all the nations which is true of the storytelling
 so I'm sorry if Jonah godson's the sea monster in this story you get the sense of like they're sending the sea monster and talk about Babylon coming and ravishing Nations the prophet Isaiah can think of that as well actually that's God sending the sea monster but another way to think of that is like that's Nebuchadnezzar and his arrogance sending the sea monster and the seems to be like an ambiguity hear that maybe it's back to one of the things that you love to point out often is that the phrase from Joseph Joseph what humans intended for evil God schemes for good the saving of many lives and that does seem like
 the story here of
 you would think the story of Jesus would be to go and cut off the heads of the sea monster but we're going to find is the story of Jesus is being swallowed up by the sea monster and then letting the sea moss to kill him but then being reborn spit back out into a new life and then it would be an epic battle sea monster yeah but who said the sea monster yep these are classic questions we'd rest of the few conversations going this year is about the way is biblical author is three symbols talk about God's agency or causation in the world
 you could say will God allows Babylon
 but that's God allowing Babylon so in a way what God allows this is what God causes and once then that's what the Joseph story is exploring to is that will use my violent brothers did this but God had a bigger purpose that work and all the sudden we're talking about a classic tension in Jewish and Christian conceptions of God agency which is God's Authority power and sovereignty and will and then human power soccer team will
 and protestantism this is Calvinism and arminianism but that's just a Protestant version of a much older conversation going back to even in ancient Judaism right when you get to even chase this kind of attention back to why did God create this is what the book of Jobe assault took a job is about this can you read the opening with what we're going to do the Psalms and Joe the next and the next conversation together no separate although the songs are going to pose this question to cuz the Psalms are going to say aren't you the one who slayed the dragon in the past so Teddy did you retire at the cigar are you done cuz there's more dragons and they're eating us and what are you doing about it you're doing nothing
 that's a summary of Psalm 74 and 89 sometimes the dragon is Unleashed and the people who get hurt by never know why and what are they going to do how are they going to relate to God if that's the situation where as Jesus is operating from the mindset to say yeah the dragon is coming for me and you are going to be his agents and it's okay cuz there's something coming out the other side of that God has planned through me for the whole world
 so maybe it's this part we're to the fact that the Bible is a collection with a unified story but the perspectives that it offers on these complex matters is not they're not all the same just different perspectives within the same collection within the same story
 meaning meaning is the chaos Dragon Gods opponent that will be defeated in the end yes to the degree that the chaos dragon is the manifestation of death itself and Chaos itself yes that needs to be put some of that threat
 is the chaos dragon in God's world for a time during the stage of the story where Heaven on Earth or existing intention with each other yes that's what Joe B about it can God use the chaos Dragon for a purpose in which case sing does God allow it or does God use it for you know these are meaningful distinctions sometimes in these conversations have it so we'll talk about that when you get the job but one thing the Bible doesn't give us a simplistic answer to the problem of evil John that's where we are right why did God create the chaos dragon or why is he allowing this long interval between subduing the chaos and bringing about. Why this long interval of tentative
 interval of tension is yeah where we're at and so yeah just stop it the power guy just coming into it so there is that
 but I do still wrestle with wipe create creatures of Chaos in the first place well but is the chaos creature itself essentially chaotic and evil and I don't think the biblical authors thought of it that way no in fact important Lee I think they didn't think of it that way which is why Leviathan the monster is sitting there on day five and called part of God's good creation I still get hung up here because I get that so in the same way the Stars host of Heaven they are created as creatures that are good displaying God's authority to rule the cosmos explain God's light but they can also turn but I think the tension I'm feeling is there also associated with the Realms of chaos yes that's right to that degree
 there is something about being a creature of the realm of chaos that is a little suspect to begin with you know so even if begins good it's not really a surprise yeah the creature of the realm of chaos becomes the cast monster yeah what's that all about like so in other words we have an image for the opposite of creation to see the Wilderness to Darkness God could have put new creatures in those Realms that's right but that's not what he did
 why populate Realms of chaos with creatures with creatures associated with my whole hang up with why create humans to rule the cosmos with God that's a that was a kind of a dumb move right like is certainly a move that's created a lot of complexity and paint a lot of complexity in pain yet but we're not creatures of the chaos around work they're creatures of the good realm and often do I don't mean literally that we can be awake at night and not do stuff at night but
 my current way of understanding it has been that those good creatures of the dark and the Wilderness and the Sea they're associated with chaos Realms because they are often agents the main agents of taking God's good creatures and dealing out death and pulling them back into the nothingness from which they emerged. Does that mean that they are essentially in their nature evil and chaotic and I don't think the monotheists conviction of the biblical authors will allow them to say that that's true
 cuz if it is a creature than it is in its Essence a creature made out as an expression of God's goodness like all reality is and so if it's currently an agent of evil or death in the world that's because it has deviated from God's purpose for it now but in in this realm that word imagining New Creation there's no more chaos Waters there's no more chaos creature there's no more yapping of the sea can exist in New Creation so the rule even though you want to make a distinction and he's not bad the way we think of evil he doesn't have a place in New Creation but neither do liars and do chores and murderers and write like the list at the end of in the Revelation so in other words
 agents of chaos and death have no place in the new creation because they actually don't they're not even a part of reality if we mean God is the ground of all reality who is the community of Eternal self-giving love so anything that's not in on that party
 won't participate in the new creation
 however Gods really insistent that monsters can get turned into glorious images of God
 they can be redeemed they can be recreated three birds and rescued and that is the story of so many of the characters in The Bible now is it the fate of just a few is it the fate of many of the fate of all cast of these are Big debates and well and is it just afraid of humans but we also have this image of the Cobra indication that's exactly right and there's one Cobra getting like being the pet of a baby and then there's another snake that's eating dust eternally and I just leave the Serpent's food so
 it was interesting these are questions that I've been in last couple years trying to read a lot more in early the earliest Bible nerds of church history and these are all the questions they were jamming on having to work out talk about like early church fathers 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Century origin and Gregory of Nyssa and Cyril of Alexandria they were all all these questions about like well can a demon ever repent and participate a new creation when you just read it they're asking that question here telling what a weird question to ask but what they're really probing is the stuff we're asking right now what's the nature of evil and what's the nature of chaos and possible the darkness can be turned into light
 because the biblical authors speak in a primarily symbolic key it requires a lot of medication would like figure out exactly what they are and are not saying OK Google where you go and the mama says listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to summarize where we been talkin about the chaos dragon dragon is not a rival to God but it is a rival to the inhabitant of creation because the opposite creation which to order today's episode is brought to you by our podcast team producer Cooper Peltz associate producer Lyndsay Ponder bleed out of their damn double editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey mix this episode and Who provided the invitations for the annotated podcast in our app and all the music in this episode was provided by Bible project staff the Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to
