welcome to the scroll of numbers or is it called in Hebrew through the Wilderness we just got through the Book of Leviticus where Israel is can't at the foot of Mount Sinai for an entire year they're ready to pack up and go through the Wilderness into the promised land many of the stories and the places in the place that we're going to find in the Book of Numbers mirror the stories we found in the book of Exodus and that's because Israel has already gone through the Wilderness when they left Egypt on their way to Mount Sinai in fact what we find here is that the Torah is one large chiasm with the Book of Leviticus right at the center Leviticus is at the hearth and then the two Scrolls on either side access numbers match each other there's a Liberation from slavery in Exodus and then through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai and then the numbers we go in reverse they leave Mount Sinai go through the Wilderness on the way to
 do ab and when they get to Moab there is a great deliverance from a foreign King who wants to bring curse and Death on them whose wife Farah at the beginning of numbers we get an explanation of how Israel's Camp is to be set up with a tribe of Levi standing between Yahweh in the Tabernacle and Israel and then God commissions the tribe of Levi to be the priest and assistance of the Tabernacle and he says look I have chosen the Levites from among his real to serve as substitutes for all the firstborn sons of the people of Israel in the selection of One Tribe out of the many swapped out for the firstborn what that means is that this tribe is now the extra special tribe that's in the slot of the Passover being the firstborn is about being uniquely responsible and extra layer of responsibility and representation of the Father the Levites as a clan are put into that place as soon as we
 all these details of how is real is organized and the role of the Levites it's important to remember the entire biblical story how God called all Humanity to live in proximity with him and so this is all matching back onto the Garden of Eatin Out of the Dust of the land god forms one unique Priestly representative pair to get to be closer to the presence of Yahweh than anybody else but it's dangerous that's what living is taught us many times over that you always present is both good and sustains our life and it's dangerous and can end our lives so as Israel gets to leave and go to the promised land we feel the anticipation but we also sense the looming danger this trial is going to royally fail their being set up as the Adam and Eve Royal priests lot and then everything's going to go wrong and it's specifically Levites who are highlighted in the number scroll as
 really blowing it big-time many times over so let's take a journey into the Wilderness thanks for joining us here we go
 hey John here we are again talking about guess what are we are we're leaving Mount Sinai
 and going into the Wilderness Yep this is the scroll of numbers which is an unfortunate name yeah yeah yes we are taking a long like most of this year to walk our way through the Torah the corresponds to a whole set of reading experiences that we've created for the Bible project app and so these match that so we are waving goodbye to Leviticus and we are saying hello to numbers but your question was about the name we didn't have a question you had a comment about that so the name of the scroll numbers comes from the Greek translation version of it that was made in the second temple. Marcos middle second temple period around the 200 BC so in Hebrew tradition the scroll is named Bahamut bar which means
 in the wilderness which is both of our catchy title and get you in the right mindset yeah uses for the place to this whole book is going to take place in the wilderness and in fact in the phrase in the wilderness is the 1-2-3 fourth fifth word of the scroll the opening words are and you always spoke to Moses in the wilderness almond bar in the wilderness as a more accurate title cuz the whole story takes place in the wilderness numbers is just paying attention to something that happens in the book at a couple points they made that there is a census numbering of the Israelites that happens in chapter one and then again in 26 and those are important for the structural flow of the book but they don't summarize everything that's going on so I go for in the wilderness I get behind that now this isn't the first time we met is real in the wilderness no it's not
 you're right they have gone through the Wilderness they rescue from Egypt they go through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai and there's a bunch of stories of them in the wilderness is not in the Exodus girl yeah that's right and then they kept out of Mount Sinai and they get the Tabernacle Blueprints and then the book of Exodus ends with Technical biltz and we read through the Book of Leviticus yes we're still at Sinai and they're getting just more information about how to do the rituals with the Tabernacle and how to become the set apart a holy nation that the kingdom of priests I forgot that's what Leviticus is and so now they're going to pack up and they're heading towards the promised land so they can go through the Wilderness that's right yeah and so that actually on the macro-level since we're kind of in between two Scrolls of the Torah let's just back out real quick and get a macro view of the story so the Torah is a five scroll collection that's one of the first
 main parts of the Hebrew Bible the door itself is like a unit of the Bible literally in it now the narrative at the end of the Torah just continues ride into the next call Joshua that comes after I mean without a hitch but there is a meaningful conclusion at the end of the fifth book of the Torah that draws the story of Moses to a close before you transition to the Next Generation so it is a meaningful five scroll prologue to the whole heap Revival known argues this everyone has interesting cuz it's a fluid narrative from Genesis into Deuteronomy and then right on into the next goal after it so the narrative is cohesive on through Joshua Judges Samuel and Kings but there's a very clear clues that the story of Moses marks a milestone moment and there's a literary closure at the end of Deuteronomy
 so I got the car and then after that you've got the prophets and the prophets have to dig Parts the first is the narrative prophets Joshua Judges Samuel King sometimes called the former prophets former prophets that's right and that continues The Narrative of Israel entering into the land after Moses death and then there's bad blood in Exile then you get the four Scrolls of the latter prophet Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and the scroll of the 12 prophets are all the the strange names are all strange names yeah that's right and so that ate scroll collection of Joshua Judges Samuel Kings Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel in the cold at 12 makes up the center of the Hebrew Bible and then after that I'm in your in my English Bible that's broken up yeah yeah that's why are English Modern English Bibles have adopted a different ordering system altogether
 that is helpful in one way and helps communicate certain things about the shape and message of the Revival but it's not the original shape about the original shape of the Hebrew Bible at the collection has a question and then the profit I said profits and lot of profit that's right and then lastly come the writings which in medieval manuscripts have a variety of orders but there's actually less overall variety and then exit there are clues of the intentional design of the writing's to begin with the book of Psalms and the phones have a five-part structure matching the five-part structure of the Torah on the other side of the profit
 the former prophets the ladder profits and then the writing's begins with another 5 part Mega scroll Jesus refers to that collection has the song Jesus refers to the he reliable as the Torah Moses the prophets and the Psalms referring to that when we zoom in to the Torah what we see is the Torah is designed as a gigantic symmetrical composition of Scrolls and the Scrolls on the outer ends Genesis in Deuteronomy match as book ends or in I guess in your image. They're like the two loaves of bread and a sandwich spread and both of them come to a climax with a great patriarch in Genesis is Jacob on his deathbed and in Deuteronomy it says Moses on his deathbed and they both invite all of Israel to gather around them and they say let me tell you what will happen in the end of days
 the retirement and then Jacob others this long poem addressing each of the 12 sons who will become the Twelve Tribes Moses sings a long poem that addresses each of the Twelve Tribes and then also forecasts the whole history of the profits they are about to read some Moses becomes the prophet of all profits announcing everything telling you beforehand everything that you're about to go read in front so those are bookends and then in the center of the Torah or three Scrolls Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Leviticus is at the heart and then the two Scrolls on either side access numbers match each other and you already paid attention to it that there's a Liberation from slavery in Exodus and then through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai
 they're at Mount Sinai for Leviticus in the numbers we go in reverse through the Wilderness they leave Mount Sinai go through the Wilderness on the way to Moab and when they get to Moab there is a great deliverance from a foreign King who wants to bring curse and Death on them who's like Sarah the beginning so there's a great deliverance from a foreign power that wants to bring death and stuff arrow and a guy named block the king of Moab are very parallel so the whole Torah is a gigantic chiastic yeah and it's not just cool art there's an important message that work there
 I just don't like 10 things on the table we can talk about I guess I know we should keep moving cuz we got to get into numbers so you said yeah that's the big picture phone number to situated in the whole Hebrew Bible and in the Torah and it's the back end of this kind of central part of the Torah where Israel comes out of Egypt through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai that's where we've been with them and now they can go back through the Wilderness new Liberation into the promised land will talk about this in a few conversations when we get the middle of numbers but the design of numbers is very when you reading through it it feels like a hodgepodge of stories and laws the whole tour it sort of feels it numbers really really feels that way like if you were already feeling that way next with us and Leviticus did not just what's going on
 so that parallelism between Exodus in the wilderness Journeys and the numbers in the wilderness Journeys is really significant so this will mean more by the time our conversation get to the Wilderness Journeys but both Wilderness Journeys house is real complaining for lack of water God provides water from a rock they complain for lack of food fresh meat and God provides quail and Mana there's a battle with one of their relatives Called amlactin Moses is exhausted and doesn't want to leave the people anymore his father-in-law Jethro up here is in both stories and there are songs that the people sing poems that they saying when they're in the wilderness it's true meditation literature style the design of the Torah and sub numbers actually doesn't make sense on its own as a scroll you can't read it independently of the Torah
 because everything that is doing is picking up things on the other side of Leviticus and matching things in Exodus and to really get what numbers is doing you always need to read the matching narratives in Exodus to see the important differences and similarities that's what you mean by meditation literature you give to one part of the Bible and you can read it on its own real magic happens when you read it in relationship with all its corresponding narratives exactly so you're saying that you said a lot of these narratives happen in a very similar way in Exodus and your counterparts mirror account on the other side of Mount Sinai yeah the backwards down the other side of Mount Sinai now we've read through God coming to live with them getting set apart as holy the Purity laws be like the day of atonement
 all that stuff is now in her mind yes and now we're asked to reflect back again on very similar stories of Ghasts and grumbling and that's right wondering and the author of the section of the story assumes the reader has fully internalized everything up to this point and so there's going to be a lot of assumptions made on the part of the reader to be able to track with hyperlinks to earlier parts of the Torah so I'll do my best as we talked through to point out where there's a meaningful link backwards that's what makes the Bible so hard to read exactly right is that the authors are expecting a lot of you high demand kind of literature is the farther you get into it I really like stories where they just like I've laid it all out here and explain your goal is to remove those High bars
 whenever you write in that's what I've Loved about working with you on this project for so many years is I've learned from you the art of trying to assume nothing in the heart of the The View over the reader and biblical literature is the opposite so interesting and there's and there's an important role for that but that to me is more the role of Art and art explains things in a certain way but yeah I'm really drunk suggest clear yep like concise leave nothing assumed the Hebrew Bible as anything but that yeah it just is what it is you know we just have to reckon with I feel like we've been Reckoning with that fact for seven-plus years do we have like the way you said that right there just a part I just was like oh yeah that's that's what's going on
 so we are going to tackle the numbers scroll and three literary movements and to be honest real time I am still neck-deep in the number scroll trying to discern the literary boundaries that the author has put there and I feel like I'm very close but I just like all things with the Hebrew Bible I just need lots of time to sit with it so the numbers scroll or I'm going to start calling it in the wilderness in the wilderness in the world in this scroll has three major movements it begins with Israel still at Mount Sinai so they're still there from when they arrived they're halfway through Exodus to Exodus chapter 19 and so they're going to leave Mount Sinai in the middle of chapter 10
 and so that first section where they're at Sinai and then just leaving Mount Sinai has the first big block literary movement and the main focus is about organizing Israel around the Tabernacle little gives you a verbal description of how the camp is arranged with the Tabernacle tent in the Middle with the priests and Levites camping around it and then all the tribes arranged around it and then that has implications for the Holiness and purity of the camp so there's lots of laws about that cuz that's the first big movement and then they set out from the mountain sorghum be focusing on what's the name then Temple so we're going to use in the app we're going to use our video theme video on Temple but the temple is the brick-and-mortar version of the tent Tabernacle that's in this story it's a mobile Temple Earth so we're going to be focusing and then our conversations you know here for the next three conversation
 we'll focus on the main theme of this which is arranging Israel's whole life around the center of God's presence in the Middle East first movement 2nd Movement is when they get out into the Wilderness and there are seven narratives in the wilderness where are the people Grumble complain don't trust God or just straight-up rebelled against Moses and Aaron and God and so these are the Wilderness narratives that spanned from chapter around 11 to the mid-twenties around 24 and the 7 testing narratives and it's really interesting they booked and they sing songs little travel songs when they set out into the Wilderness and they staying travel songs when they come to their destination in the early twenties of numbers and all of these are mapped closely on to the Wilderness narratives of Exodus except
 rebellion of the people is even more heightened so we're going to focus on is the same thing we focused on in The Exodus Wilderness stories which was the seam of the test and the word test is only used in one of these stories but it's When God says I am fed up with these people you know they tested me 10 times here in the wilderness which accounts for the seven testing stories in numbers and the three testing stories in Exodus Noel so cool okay so God's been counting for this is one election numbers is one kind of unified try out at the heart of the Torah so that seems a test that will talk about in the middle of numbers and then once they get through the Wilderness they arrived on not in the promised land but right across the Jordan River in What's called the land of Mo at the Fords of Moab modern-day Jordan
 Red Cross the Jordan River and so they're the people start preparing and receiving guidance for how they're going to live once they cross the river in the end of the land and so the seam of the land promised land is the major theme for that book that we're going to trace so Temple for while they're at Mount Sinai the test or is it go through the Wilderness to move into and then the land minute three as they are getting ready to cross the Jordan so that's the overall shape shape of numbers for the next two conversations were just going to camp out in these early chapters is really fascinating stuff that probably most of us have struggled to stay because they're just really odd parts of the book
alright well it's so it's good to start by reading Numbers chapter one then you spoke to Moses in the wilderness by mid bar in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting on the first day of the second month in the second year after they've come out of Egypt Earth the second you know I've been camped out at Mount Sinai for a year now almost a year they arrived on the first day of the third month of their first year member of the year the calendar was reset bypass over here when they left Egypt correct so I took them 2 months to wander to go through the Wilderness from Egypt to arrive at Sinai and they arrived on the first day of the third month then they've been there for I guess 11 months and this is the first day of second month of second year and what they hear is
 take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel by their families by their fathers households according to the number of their names every male had a head so they're going to count the heads of households as them I may like the patriarch yep that's right yeah so this is going to be a patriarchal culture structured by men who are heads of households but going Generations so they'll be like you know a guy in their 60s who's got if he has multiple stands then he'll be the father of multiple Suns and so on on down literally counting the like oldest of those men all the all the men so this is one of those places where the Hebrew Bible authors take for granted and inhabit in ancient patriarchal culture and so what it means is that the number given at the end of the census isn't all the
 adjust the men who wear hats of households it's not kids correct not unless their adult 20 years and up prayers and essentially and also whoever is able to go to fight an army is being formed here between Army roster that's being numbered here so chapter 1 is essentially have Lyft it tells you the list of each of the 12 Clan head rulers of the Twelve Tribes and then it just starts Counting
 it isn't just staying the phrase take a census is to lift up the head to take up the head I think it's referring to Counting people by their heads that's our English raised to take up ahead so this is Numbers Chapter once when it has the name numbers in the Greek translation tradition and by the time it gets to the end of the sentence in verse 46. All the numbered men were 603550 lot of people totally yeah and so then if you can't spouses and children
 you know this is where you have a couple million by application up to a couple million people that itself is a the numbers of numbers are a rabbit hole under themselves yeah I mean like the greater Portland area is about two million people so that's a couple million people just like the size of the greater Portland area where we live I mean that's a small City compared to the biggest cities in the world in America but it still has a lot of people yeah and I would imagine a lot of people in the ancient world yes exactly right so there's a long history of discussion and debate in both Jewish and Christian tradition about these numbers and I don't want to get caught in this trap off I'll just say one thing in terms of the cycling of themes throughout the Hebrew Bible this is a be fruitful and multiply part of the storyline I mean it's a lot of people
 a lot of people so the numbers are definitely communicating on a literary level that is real has been camped by the little portable eaten here at Mount Sinai I am here in their little eating in the wilderness they have been I've been fruitful fruitful and multiply in terms of how to make sense of these large numbers and The Logical implications I mean it just both the logistics of that many people moving through the Wilderness of all the animals required the feed the people of all of the manure created by these people cuz when you get the narratives of the people it seems like there's a much smaller crew cuz all the people can come gather around the tent for example right yeah that's what it says on all Israel came and stood by him there's no like football stadium that's going to carry that many people so there's even there's a tension between the numbers and then the presentation of how many people
 in the stories because Moses can say in the hearing of all the people in that kind of think so for anybody who wants to go down this Rabbit Hole just to a lots of colors and bring about this there's two that I found really helpful one scholar named Gordon Wenham is written commentaries on almost all the books of the Torah it's an older S8 it's actually public domain you can find online is just called large numbers in the Old Testament an older study but you summarize is kind of the history of how people have made sense of these and then what are some possibilities when I'm as a follower of Jesus he has a high view scripture as a Divine and human word it's great I say another essay to buy scholar David Phelps and essays called a defense of the hyperbolic interpretation of large numbers in the Old Testament it's published in a conservative theological
 academic Journal called the Journal of the evangelico theological Society so he has a very high view scripture as a Divine and human word and he has done research about the way numbers function especially in the West in ancient near Eastern literature and it's par for course to use exaggerated numbers for rhetorical communication purposes and so he just makes an argument that that's the most likely explanation for these but he gives a very thorough history of the discussion and it's a really you know you'll learn a lot but what nobody disagrees with is that the literary message of this is that Israel has been fruitful and multiply before the mountain yeah it's interesting that that is already been thought about by the conservative edge of the Bible readers
 you would think would go hey if it says this number if this number sure Bible says it I believe it and so important a moment where to say we're reading cross-culturally and so the difference between what I say and what I mean is 7 everyday in my marriage and with almost all my friendships like there's what we say to each other but then we can contact tone of voice figures of speech the style in which were writing or speaking all shape what we mean by what we say and so this is essentially stopped his argument is that ancient authors what they meant when they listed large numbers was to make rhetorical be logical points and if that's what the devil authors mean by what they said then we will wear
 honoring is what people intended to communicate and I think that's what we should have for when we read the Bible at least I think so and this is a rabbit hole so let's not go down it yeah but it's very exact number I know I know it is very specific number yeah it is so and again when I'm infested essays to get into it they get into it so what we get is this picture of the 12 tribes very orderly list all the people arranged by families and cam what a contrast from like the ramshackle crew wandering in the wilderness complaining angry
 at the foot of Mount Sinai when Moses came down and saw the golden calf he saw dancing and mixing and what he says is they're out of control so this is also but this is a beginning Motif in the section of numbers is about the order of the people
 and so structure in order of these lists in the literary symmetries and design of these lists it's all super precise and that itself is part of the message is just like Genesis one like the super dialed in literary design structure of Genesis 1 is part of the message you also get this sense of Don't Mess with these guys so yeah yeah that I mean they just given the Tabernacle and are set apart as holy gods among them and now they're organized and there's a lot of them this is a force to be reckoned with and they will be on but let's remember like this is a rags-to-riches kind of story they are still in the wilderness but because of God blessing they have become in order fruitful well-equipped people group who can fulfill the task the cops called them to
 so how the Twelve Tribes are listed and remember this thing about the number 12 12 tribes Jacob had 12 sons but his most beloved Son just us had two sons and at the end of Genesis Jacob adopted those two sons at his own so actually not as thirteen Sons so the way it is 14 well he counts the two suns in the place of his son Joseph so just depends Manasseh and after I am okay and you count them as Joseph just 13 and so how do you get the number 12 again will it's not the list of Jacob's 12 sons it's his sons and grandsons and what were told right here after the census is that the tribe of Levi is not to be counted along with their brothers and that's because they're not going to fight partly and they're not going to own land and they are set apart from
 Brothers salute wait till the Levites are at 13th tribe will there are thirteen tribes and the Levites are not counted among the 12 I never knew this really I never knew that wow yeah okay so there's 13 tribes did you go in the Levites are not among the 12 okay and this is the moment where that's really highlighted phone numbers 147 the Levites however don't count among by the father's tribe nor take them up on the senses rather the Levites you shall appoint over the tent of the testimony over all the Furnishings over everything belonging to the 10th they're going to carry the 10th carry all the furniture they're going to care for it this is their job
 so there's that out from among They don't serve in battle their job is to be facilities and maintenance for the 10 and then from the tribe of Levi there is one family from Aaron and his sons that are the high priest who actually go in and out of the tent the Levites our facilities maintenance and there's no no and they in fact there's a hold long description of why they shouldn't come near the tent the priests have to go in and cover everything was cloth like that before they like them then or disassemble Ark of the Covenant everything else to get specially covered by priests and then believe I can come in and take everything down okay
 so the Levites in the priests are set apart they're not counted so that's the first thing that you learned she's got the 12 plus the Levites set apart so that's the very end of chapter 1 verse 48 54 chapter 2 comes along and we turned our attention back to the 12-step this time and we're going to count them again and we're going to come to the same number again 600-3550 but this time we're going to start to group the tribes together by their number to mounts are artists represented this in our videos on numbers do you get this picture it's a verbal picture and it's really detailed and it matches in many ways the detail of the verbal blueprints of the Tabernacle on the other side of Mount Sinai at the end of Exodus so you get this picture of the Courtyard at the very center of the camp Courtyard of the temple Courtyard of the Tabernacle and then you get the priest their camp and their tents are right in front of the door of the Court
 and then the rest of the Levites Camp around it there's three tribes to the Levites and so on the remaining three sides does a Levites and the priests around it are like a first ring around Tabernacle in the middle and then when you get are the 12 tribes are divided into Triads Place North South East and West Oak at it and the tribe who's placed at the front of all of the tribes is Judah the front meaning like the direction of the on the east side because the Tabernacle situated and that you enter from the East and you head West to the back of it exactly the front of his the East correct the Judah would be on the east side of it that's right Jude is always depicted as at the front and then I mean it's it's in a long list and lots of detail
 that's boring to read from our standards of exciting literature but if you take it as a literary statement of matching the fruitful and multiplying chapter 1 of the senses now you got of the extreme order and Arrangement and design the orderliness of the fruitful and multiply and that concentric Circle tent in the Middle with the Levites around it and then I've been around this is all riffing off of the precise little descriptions of the concentric circles of sacredness in the Garden of Eden story of the tree of life in the middle of the garden then you have the humans who are called to work and to keep the Levites job description right here in chapters 1 and later on and screen for is there a pointed to working to keep the tent it's the same exact phrases that Amanda's job in the garden to work to keep the garden to work in to keep it
 that was in our Temple video right he wants my attention about so the Levites are described as the elect chosen tribe out of the many to become the Adam and Eve Representatives surrounding the inner garden with the fruitful tribes all around it so it says it's the truth or tribes are like the fruitful trees of the garden and then after that outer ring of the tribes is just the Wilderness Maps exactly onto the three concentric rings of Eden in Genesis chapter two so that we're hearing in terms of The Melody of the steams these are out this eating music or hearing this we begin numbers yeah I wouldn't totally yeah it's interesting though to is that concentric three ring design this is we doing
 do things because it's also describing the three levels of the Tabernacle itself that's right the holy of holies and then really quiet place and then the courtyard and that is also mapped onto Eden tree of life in the middle holy of holies yet the holy Place being the garden it again at the outer courts being Eden Eden itself and then outside of that is a Wilderness what you're saying you can take that same structure and take it up a level levels in the Hebrew Bible organization in terms of like yeah it works at this level of organization and now it's go to another level of organization in Seattle that really is eliminated this for me it's the work of David Andrew Teeter and you called it was like fractal zoom in to the smallest details of Any Given Tennessee pass till then you'll see levels of concentric are symmetrical design but then when you zoom out at every level though
 the mirroring design features and this is a good example of fractal School especially in sections of the Hebrew Bible that are trying to Echo the order of Genesis chapter 1 in of Eden will use lots of symmetry in concentric ideas so the whole tent complex in the middle of the camp is now becomes like the tree of life then the Levites around that become like the garden Keepers and then the tribes around that become just the land of Eden around and then the Wilderness outside yeah that's cool
 first chapters 1 & 2 Wii next turn our attention to the Levites in the middle of chapters 1 & 2 you know who all we know is that they're not counted among the other brothers and their set apart to serve tent so that little note at the end of chapter one gets selected out and then really focused on what we call chapters 3 and 4 so in chapters 3 and 4 number for the Levites finally do get their own separate census and numbering unto themselves that's what happens in chapter 3 and then something really significant this is awesome happens in verse 12 of chapter 3 I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel yeah I know as a substitute for all the firstborn of Israel
 the first of every womb among the sons of Israel so the Levites are mine or 13 all the firstborn of Israel belong to me since the day that I struck down the firstborn in the land of Egypt I set apart as holy to myself all the first born in Israel from human to animal they are mine I am Yahweh this is cool to you well the election of the first born out of the many this is God's choosing one from among the many let me backup so remember in The Exodus story when God was bringing the tenth and Final Act of Justice on Egypt's evil death of the firstborn and it's a flood of justice that well take the life of every firstborn in the land even Israelites everybody indiscriminate
 but only the firstborn yep and that's significant because the first child is special yeah there's a general cultural backdrop of the whole Hebrew Bible of ancient near Eastern practice of the firstborn son in a patriarchal culture is seen to be the representative image of the father and has pride of place among all the other siblings and so in ancient Israel there's a law that the first born son was to receive a double portion and firstborn Sons can be held accountable in Waze for their father's choices in a way that's different than the siblings and they represent the father in a unique way but just general cultural practice and what you see in the Hebrew Bible is God constantly
 subverting that practice choosing the second by choosing a latecomer early Comer late coming sibling and elevating them to the position of Honor so this is a major theme in the Revival in fact we've decided to make a video about it they're going to start you and I are going to start working on soon I'm really excited about it so that's a no teeth that already has been happening and it actually begin in Genesis 1 and 2 with humans were the latecomers in Genesis 1 there's a last creatures in Genesis chapter 1 in the six days of God creating their the last creature but got elevates them as the rulers of all the other creatures the last will be first exactly yes and that continues with the first two sons in the Bible Cain and Abel and God chooses and favors the second son over the first which makes the firstborn angry and so that pattern continues with Abraham and his brothers with
 I have a nice time with Joseph and his brothers the song okay there's that whole thing when we get to Exodus Farrah as he begins to enslave and want to kill off God's chosen ones he targets the first born son's if you can order that they are killed or thrown into the water when the first born son dies practically the second-born son is now the first born son yeah yep that's right okay so but you taking the first born son yeah I mean that's horrible but if you're trying to like stop a family
 you're going to have to like take out all the sons are exactly and that's what pharaohs order is his third attempt to kill all the boys, yeah that's right so what Ciara did to the Israelites and taking their stands God brings back on Pharaoh's head and all of Egypt in the tenth plague it on the night of passover but God provides something that Pharaoh did not which is for anybody who will listen to the word of the Lord God will have mercy and they can be spared by offering a lamb as a substitute and that's Passover Lamb the blood on the door and so on and so in the Passover descriptions in the access crawl God says that all the firstborn of Israel as of this Night Belongs to Me I provided a substitute for you and so their lives actually are mine then that's the logic of Passover that's what's being appealed to right here
 is that all the Israelite firstborn belong to Yahweh Yahweh is going to elevate this one of Jacob's sons Levi and set them apart from their brothers as the special ones to live and work in the Eden space and what y'all was appointing here is that the leave lights are going to get swapped into that place of the firstborn of Israel so there's a Long Count taken of how many Levites are there then there's account that's taken how many first born sons are there in Israel right now that belongs to our way and then they're all swapped out and there's a little remainder and so they have to offer some other stuff to the tavernacle to make up for the remainder of a ritual of sorts to like signify that the tribe of Levi this is so hard to understand just as the firstborn of Israel belong
 but they all belong to you and something meaningful sense to yeah that's right there's just there's some sort of ancient logic which is the firstborn have some special status and God having spared this first born I mean even targeting in the first place is still hard for me to wrap my mind around but that's something about that it's striking to come to the heart of family yeah and blessing yes which I don't this was a themed video conversation on first born I want to get into it more but yeah well it's a lot of this also has roots all the way back and how that first born seem continued into the story of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis where Abraham and Sarah's sins against Hagar and Ishmael catch up with them and Yahweh separates Ishmael and Hagar from
 Abraham and Sarah and then he also demands the life of Isaac as Ascension offering and then at the last minute the last second he always provides a substitute in the wife of Abraham's first born so that the family can continue to flourish but now the future of the family as of that moment of the substitution is recognized as a gift cuz God could have like a logical story is God could have demanded the life of the firstborn but he doesn't want to kill what he wants is to use Abraham to bring life and blessings to all of the nation's but now it's clear that the wife of Isaac and therefore the life of this entire family Exist by the mercy and generosity of God except the logic of the store here of their agendas so that Steven is being developed here and the selection of One Tribe out of the many swapped out for the firstborn what that means is that this tribe is now the extra special
 tribe that's in the slot of the Passover Lamb the firstborn of Israel was substituted for the Passover Lamb that pass over the firstborn children of Israel in these are the people standing right here listening to all this these are the ones who know this is access generator and so those people whose lives were substituted by the blameless Passover Lamb God now says okay guess what I'm going to put it in the slot and so I guess that the logic of the swap yeah I don't get the logic of this lot are okay at this lot so what is the slot to slot is the people who are going to live and work in and around the tent and the altar so there's a sense of like hey since I saved your life or sporn you now on service to me that's the logic and God is saying actually I'm going to use this tribe to be in service to me in the special way you guys are off the hook for that task yeah yeah
 when is about being the uniquely responsible and extra layer of responsibility and representation of the father and so the Levites as a clan are put into that place and so this is all mapping back onto the Garden of Eatin with Out of the Dust of the land god forms and points one unique Priestly representative pair in the Garden of Eden as both blessing to get to be closer to the presence of Yahweh than anybody else but it's dangerous and that's what Leviticus taught us many times over the yahweh's presents his Holiness is both good and sustains our life and it's dangerous and can end our lives just like a sacrificial Sam and so being in the proximity to the tent and being facilities and maintenance actually puts this clan and unique level of responsibility and privilege and also a unique place of danger that
 it's going to be explored in the but we're setting this up for the scenes in the book cuz a whole bunch of people from this clan are going to rebell against Moses many times over throughout the course of the story but what's going on here oh yeah I'd like to dig deeper and we're going to have to when we were at the same video and just the thing that I'm wrestling with just a flag it is at times God seems to really care about the logic of the firstborn that this ancient cultural logic of the firstborn and then other times he seems a completely subverted and not care yeah mostly subvert the most Lisa Burks like he is right here well he's elevating adapting it here is elevating a tribe does not the firstborn but putting them in the place of the firstborn now the firstborn tribe would be the firstborn son of Joseph which would be right well Jacob's first born. I have Jacob Jacob's first born son was Reuben
 but Ruben did something terrible to his dad's wife and so he lost out and then the son who gets put in the well adjusting the next two sons in line after ribbon are Simon and Levi and Jacob was so ticked off at Simon and Levi for the fact that they slaughtered a whole village of Canaanites and anger that he just qualifies them for what when was this in the gents the scroll and so it's the fourth son Judah and then his beloved Son Joseph who are in competition for the role of the firstborn have a God and not the competition that continues on through the whole thing of like the firstborn is automatically the one out of the womb first but then there's this like some politics after that sometime and what God loves to do is disrupt the politics and Elevate people who don't deserve it and the places of unique honor and responsibility but then when it comes to bring Justice on
 all of the correction and neither can he uses the logic of the first people I see yeah that's right like he's like yeah I know the firstborn is so significant like that's what I'm demanding so yeah yeah I just want to wrestle with all that more so what's significant here is that again for this temple theme in the early part of the chapters one tribe is being selected out of the money to represent and serve the many in the temple and that's the tribe of Levi and then a subset of them the priest but they are swapped out for the first one so it's another subversion of the firstborn theme have been here but also it puts this whole tribe now in the unique and dangerous role of the mediators forgot the presents and we're preparing for a seam in the book is that this tribe is going to royally fail their being set up as Adam and Eve
 the priests lot of great what could go wrong and then everything's going to go wrong and it's specifically Levites who are highlighted in the number scroll as really blowing a big-time many times over to where we're going to be a replay of the hall Genesis 1 29 storyline you mentioned this I think in the last conversation I have laws dogs like the election of the Adam and Eve characters yes but now we hear that yeah I've been bad going to happen. Yeah yeah so we're not there yet right now it's just a tribe getting elevated to a place of honor that wouldn't have otherwise had that honor and that's pretty cool so that's the takeaway from this opening chapters of numbers things are about to get little more complicated as you might expect but for the moment let's just notice
 that must you know to look for it you would just read this is really boring list yeah these are the senses chapters there's the numbers of numbers this is this is a stuff you're just like why am I reading this again that's right so if you are using the classic like criteria of telling a good story with deep characterization intricate plot tensions then the tour fails on that count at the section however if the goal is a Biblical authors is to tell an epic narrative that is recycling a core set of teams over and over and over again over the course of multiple Generations using all kinds of diverse literary forms to do it then this is a homerun but we have just echoed the early chapters of Genesis 1 the order got trading order in the middle of a chaotic Wilderness of God pointing at people to be fruitful and multiply and then elevating
 among those a special Royal Priestly group who's in the place of honor and exist in proximity to the Eden on Earth and that's exactly what number is 144 it's all the time and it's all packed with verbal hyperlinks in similar vocabulary to the opening chapters of Genesis and that's how people go out to do it they love doing this stuff man so but it does like you said set us up for expecting something expecting something to go out and that's right and so what is going to go wrong well that's what we'll talk about next thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue in the first movements of the scroll of numbers in for a little bit here is essentially what we call Numbers Chapter 5 and 6 and this section it's a straight-up riddle it's for random will paragraphs each one by its own okay I get it but you're like
