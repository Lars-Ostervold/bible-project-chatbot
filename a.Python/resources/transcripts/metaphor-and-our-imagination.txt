Jon: You don’t have to read much biblical poetry until you find yourself 
surrounded by metaphors. "The LORD is my shepherd. I am the 
clay. God is the  potter. Jesus is the bread of life. The LORD is my 
rock."  
Tim: Metaphors can be a way an author or poet crafts a unique way of 
talking about something.  
Jon: A metaphor is taking one idea, usually something very tangible, 
something easy to understand and mapping that idea unto a more 
abstract experience. So I know what a rock is like. It’s sturdy. I’ve 
held a rock in my hand, I’ve had the experience of trying to move a 
large rock across the field, I’ve stood on a tall pillar and felt its 
strength below me.   
Now, I have this other experience that’s a lot more abstract. And 
my abstract experience is feeling that God is ultimately 
dependable. Map these two experiences on to each other and you 
get the metaphor, God is my rock. And while most biblical 
metaphors are easy enough to understand like that one, we have 
to remember that every culture develops its own various types of 
metaphors that will seem strange to another culture. And this is 
true for those who wrote the bible.  
A great example of this is how bibli cal authors constantly use the 
image of tumultuous waters to describe the experience of danger. 
Whether it be the unknown, dangerous people, dangerous 
situations, and even enemy nations.  
Tim: Why is somebody thinking like this? What does it take to produc e 
a poetic imagination that thinks in terms of these images instead 
of other images?  
Jon: This episode is Part One of a three -part conversation on biblical 
metaphors that we should be familiar with. But first, we need to 
have a conversation simply about wh at metaphors are, how they 
work, and how you are more saturated with metaphors than you 
ever imagined. Even how — 
Tim: Our very understanding of reality is itself a metaphor.  
Jon: This is the Bib le Project Podcast, here we go.  
So we have a series of videos on how to read the Bible.  3 
 
Tim: Yes. We had one whole conversation about the art of Biblical 
poetry.  
Jon: Art of biblical poetry.  
Tim: The unique styles, techniques, conventions of Ancient Hebrew 
poetry, and we saved for its own topic just because it’s so 
fascinating and rich. And to me, eye -opening which is how 
imagery and metaphor works in biblical poetry, which is similar to 
most poetry is image -driven language. But at least as we’ll see, the 
biblical imagination, pun intended of imagination the...  
Jon: How’s that a pun?  
Tim: Well, sorry, it’s a nerd pun. We’re talking about imagery. The 
biblical...  
Jon: Image -ination.  
Tim: Image -ination.  
Jon: Image -ination. To image things for.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. Biblical imagery, the biblical imagination has its own 
encyclopedia that you need to learn how to fill and then draw 
upon as you’re reading.  
Jon: That’s interesting.  
Tim: I have found over the years of teaching that teaching people what 
the meaning of these basic images are in the Bible because they 
are not im ages that are common to modern reader.  
Jon: I almost feel like we need to stop at this point just to talk about 
what does that mean for metaphors to be basic to our 
understanding.  
Tim: Yes. Oh, yeah, we will.  
Jon: We will talk about that.  
Tim: Totally. Yea h, yeah, yeah. I think the conversation should first go to 
what our metaphor is and how do they work, and then getting 
into a unique way – biblical...  
Jon: Because when you say that the biblical portfolio of metaphors is 
something that we can become aware but are not aware of 
necessarily, but in every  day of our life, we do have our own 4 
 
handbag of metaphors that we’re very aware of and may not even 
be aware that are metaphors.  
Tim: That’s right, yeah. We’re born into a metaphor called imagination 
that we ar en’t even aware of for the most part until someone 
draws attention to it. I’m excited about this video and this 
conversation. I thought, however, as we’ve been doing with these 
conversations is beginning with a reading of a biblical poem...  
Jon: Cool.  
Tim: ...that I think will be a perfect segue - It give s us all the raw 
materials to work with.  
Jon: Sweet. A reading. Great.  
Tim: Yeah?  
Jon: Psalm 46. “God is our refuge and protection, found to be a great 
help in times of distress, therefore we won’t be afra id when the 
land shifts, when the mountains totter into the heart of the seas; 
its waters roar, they churn, mountains quake at its swelling. Selah.”  
Jon: Which means?  
Tim: Nobody knows what it means.  
Jon: Selah.  
Tim: Selah. It’s a Hebrew word spelled in E nglish letters. It usually 
indicates some kind of pause. In this case, there are three Selahs 
that break the poem in the three stanzas. That was just the first 
one.  
Stanza two.  “A river whose streams make glad the city of God, The 
holy dwelling places of the Most High God, God is in its midst, it 
will not totter; God will help it when morning dawns. The nations 
roar, the kingdoms totter; He raised His voice, the land melted. 
The Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our tall fortress. 
Selah.”  
Jon: Selah. It’s a common response thing.  
Tim: Final stanza. “ Come, behold the works of the Lord, Who has 
wrought desolations in the land. He makes wars to cease to the 
end of the land; He breaks the bow, He cuts the spear in two; He 
burns the chariots with fi re. “Be still, and know that I am God; I will 5 
 
be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the land.” The 
Lord of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our tall fortress. Selah”  
Jon: Psalm 46.  
Tim: That's Psalm 46. So let’s just be coming out of this  conversation 
cold. So I’ve been thinking about Psalm 46 for a long time and 
then I'm prepping for this conversation, so I have a bunch of stuff 
on my mind. But I’m curious when someone comes at Psalm 46 
fresh.  
Jon: I have this experience when I read most  Psalms, which is, this 
would be a really thrilling poem if I lived in a time where this kind 
of word mattered to me.  
Tim: Like what?  
Jon: I don’t know. Actually, maybe I’m just not using my imagination 
well enough.  
Tim: Like war? Battles?  
Jon: Yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah, I mean, well, there’s earthquakes.  
Tim: Okay, all right.  
Jon: There's still that stuff.  
Tim: Earthquake.  
Jon: There’s still nations who are roaring.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah.  
Jon: Yeah. So interesting. I’m going to take that back. I'm was not 
thinking. I’m using enough contextualization  in my own mind.  
Tim: Sure.  
Jon: Yeah. There’s a lot of very violent images. Feels very catastrophic.  
Tim: Yes. 
Jon: Nations on the brink of melting down or tottering as it says, 
nations roaring, lands shifting, mountain quaking. Violent imagery.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah, totally. I mean, in each of the three stanzas, there’s a 
core action taking place of quaking, earth quaking. In the first 
stanza, it’s mountains crumbling into the sea while the pounding 6 
 
surf, roaring and  churns and eats away. It’s sort of like a stormy 
surf pounding on the rocks, and eroding the hillside.  
Jon: Right. It’s pretty powerful.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. So there’s that. The second stanza it’s not the waters 
roaring.  
Jon: And he’s saying, he won’t be afr aid when there’s that kind of 
crazy...  
Tim: Yeah, that’s right. When the waters...  
Jon: ...intensity.  
Tim: ...are pounding at the rock, we’re not afraid because who is our 
refuge and protection? God is. For the whole first stanza is the 
poet depicting stan ding on a big piece of rock surrounded by...  
Jon: Just the churning ocean.  
Tim: ...churning waters that are eroding and crumbling into pieces.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Time:  And he’s not freaking out. The poet’s not afraid.  
Tim: Why is that? Well, let’s consider more. In the second stanza, 
instead of waters pounding , and roaring , and causing erosion, it’s 
the nation ’s roaring. But the nations that are roaring like the ocean 
waters are themselves, the thing that are tottering. Not the land 
anymore. And what is the sturdy  thing in the second stanza, it’s 
not just a rock now, it’s the temple. The holy dwelling places of 
God Most High it’s where God is, right? God is in its midst. And 
notice what is coming out?  
 
[10:00]  
 
Jon: Why is it plural, dwelling places?  
Tim: Yeah, I know. Yeah, it’s called the City of God, the dwelling places, 
and then God is in its midst. The city that has the dwelling places 
of God.  
Jon: Isn’t there one dwelling place?  7 
 
Tim: Well it’s one building, the central building. But then there’s the 
courts an d all those rooms around it - the large courtyard, the 
precincts.  
Jon: Is this one of those plural  like heavens?  
Tim: Oh yeah, plural complexity?  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Yeah. One thing that has all kinds of different components to it. It 
could be what’s going on here. I didn’t look up the detail. Notice 
how the two stanzas actually overlap with each other. The first one 
is... 
Jon: Yeah, I did notice that.  
Tim: ...the poet standing on the rock that is God while the pounding 
surf erodes the rock. Now, you realize th is overlapped with that is 
the image of the nations...  
Jon: Pounding against...  
Tim: Pounding on...  
Jon: ...the land.  
Tim: ...Jerusalem where the temple is. But instead of the rock crumbling, 
it’s the kingdoms crumbling when God raises His voice and the 
land melts. And then there’s refrain mid way through the poem 
here.  "The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our 
fortress."  
Jon: What do you mean a refrain? Oh, because it’s said twice?  
Tim: Yeah. Verse 7, “The Lord of Host is with us, the God of J acob is our 
fortress,” is the middle line and the final line of the poem. The 
third stanza leaves the water and rock imagery and it’s, “Behold 
the works of the Lord who brings an end to all wars by breaking 
the bow, cutting the spear, overcoming the chario ts.” 
Jon: What does the word wrought mean? You wrought.  
Tim: I know. It’s literally the word do or make  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: But in English, I just liked it. I think it’s the King James, very poetic 
King James.  8 
 
Jon: It does sound poetic.  
Tim: Yeah. The ideas of  the Lord as a worrier who brings the end to all 
wars. So He overcomes the threat of the pounding waters and the 
nations and He doesn’t end to all of their implements of war. And 
then God speaks in the culmination of the poem. “Be still, know 
that I am God .” “I will be exalted among the nations, exalted in the 
land,” and then the refrain again, “the Lord is with us, God of Jacob 
is our fortress.”  
Jon: When you first read the burning of the chariots and the breaking 
of the bows and cutting spears in two, I d idn’t read that in context 
of en ding war. I kind of just saw it.  I just was like, 'Yeah, He's going 
to fight back or He's fighting." But it’s like for the purpose of 
ending the chaos.  
Tim: Yes. 
Jon: And then "be still." And you can imagine what’s the stillness of the 
water after that.  
Tim: Yes. Exactly, of the water or of the battlefield.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: Because the stillness comes after He makes war cease throughout 
the land.  
Jon: Yeah, right.  
Tim: But in the developing imagery of the poem, the nations are the 
waters.  
Jon: Right. Yeah, the chaotic waters is the battlefield.  
Tim: Yeah. So notice you have three stanzas and think of each of them 
as a little transparent piece of plastic or something.  
Jon: Yeah. It’s like how Disney used to animate.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. Yeah. So the first piece of transparency is like a small 
island rock.  
Jon: Getting pounded by the surf.  
Tim: With the poet standing up there and God is his fortress, but he’s 
freaking ou t. He’s trying not to be afraid because of the pounding 
waves are eroding the rock. And then lay on top of that a picture 9 
 
of Jerusalem where the nations are attacking Jerusalem but the 
temple is there, and God is in the midst of this temple and the 
nations  attack, but then melt and totter like waves recede after 
attacking.  
And then on top of that is an image of God is the one who brings 
about the tottering of the violent nations so that the calming of 
the storm, like the calm after a storm on the beach and  the still 
battlefield after victory’s been won, is the image of God victorious 
over human violence and over creation’s violence. And then the 
poem ends.  
 
[15:20]  
 
Tim: So core images in this poem, God is a rock.  
Jon: Yeah, I’m familiar with that one.  
Tim: Yeah, it’s a pretty standard one.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Read the Psalm.  
Jon: You’ve read any or sung any hymn in the church?  
Tim: Yeah, God is a rock.  
Jon: On Christ the solid rock I stand.  
Tim: Yeah. And that’s pretty intuitive universal. Rocks are strong, 
they’ve been around for the whole time.  
Jon: Yeah, build the house on the rock.  
Tim: All that kind of stuff.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Yeah, they’re sturdy.  
Jon: Sturdy.  
Tim: Stable. So that’s a pretty intuitive image to make sense of. But all 
this stuff ab out— 10 
 
Jon: That one’s in my handbag of metaphors.  
Tim: Yeah, you’ve got that one ready. But what about the rock being 
assaulted by the waters?  
Jon: Well, you know, that’s interesting because what I have picked up 
throughout the years of reading the bible, i s understanding how 
important the waters were as a metaphor, which it took a long 
time to begin to see that. And actually , after the first time , it was 
brought up to me was I was really tripping about why isn’t there 
going to be any sea in heaven?  
Tim: Yes, that little line in the book of revelation.  
Jon: Yeah. And there's no more sea.  
Tim: There was no more sea.  
Jon: I remember I have friends who are surfers and they’re like, "Really? 
No sea in heaven? Come on."  
Tim: Totally.  
Jon: And then someone br ought up like, "Well, look, the sea represents 
chaos. That’s the first time I ever heard that. Then  you start 
reading through the B ible and seeing that that’s one of those 
metaphors...  
Tim: That’s right.  
Jon: ...that we just don’t have in our metaphor brie fcase.  
Tim: Correct.  
Jon: You know, it's like keep changing the metaphor for that.  
Tim: Your handbag or your briefcase? Well, it depends on what job 
you’re on to do that.  
Jon: Right. Like satchel. My metaphor is satchel.  
Tim: That’s right. See, yeah, you g ot rock, you got waters, you have 
some holy dwelling place in a mountain with a stream running out 
of it, in center of this poem.  
Jon: Yeah. That’s a metaphor or is that just — 
Tim: Well, that’s a good point. Sorry, it’s an image.  11 
 
Jon: It’s an image.  
Tim: It’s an image here. We’re going to need  to figure out what to call 
this video. Is it just metaphor or is it imagery in biblical poetry, or 
it is imagery and metaphor in biblical poetry? Because they’re a bit 
different but they kind of illuminate each other.  
Jon: We’ll go into it.  
Tim: Yeah, we’ll look into that. Then the last thing is this image of the 
battle, the still battlefield where God is victorious over the nations. 
And then God as a fortress. So there’s all these overlapping 
images. Some of them sound Bible -ish, God as a rock. There’s a 
temple involved, but this whole thing of the waters exalting the 
rock and the rock is connected to the temple and there’s a battle 
ongoing in the nation.  
Jon: And the waters represent the nations.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got to read through the poem a couple of 
times to realize the pounding surf is equivalent to the pounding 
nations - The roaring surf.  
Jon: That would have been a typical kind of metaphor to have used 
back then when the nations were like chaos wat ers. 
Tim: Yes, correct. I think we’re going to see. That’s a really core biblical 
image. So here’s the thing, anybody can read this poem in any 
translation and be like, "Oh, the world’s crazy. Chaotic waters, 
nations, God’s in control. He’s going to bring peace. Be still and 
know that I am God." I’m thinking I'll write a song about that.  
Jon: Yeah, the powerful line.  
Tim: You get it, you know. You can get it. So the question is not about 
the basic first reading. The question is about, why did this poet 
bring together these images in this way? And what significance is 
there, this connection of the rock, and the waves and the temple 
and the nations ? Why is somebody thinking like this? What did it 
take to produce a poetic imagination that thinks of these image s 
instead of some other images?  
Jon: Like if you were to write a poem right now about how you find 
refuge in God amidst of chaos, like what images would you use?  
Tim: That’s a great question.  12 
 
Jon: And it probably wouldn’t —I mean maybe it would be a stormy  
coast.  
Tim: Yeah. If we lived in that stormy coast  
Jon: Lived in that coast.  
Tim: To be honest, living, having grown up, you know, right in the heart 
of Portland and remember the years that I have lived in Madison, 
Wisconsin, going to graduate school, i t was a much smaller town 
and it was quiet. It was just quiet.  
Jon: Madison is?  
Tim: Hmm -mm.  
Jon: Oh, I didn’t imagine that. It’s a college town.  
Tim: It is a college town, I mean, if you go right to the heart of 
downtown, but it’s not a huge city. I just  remembered it’s just 
quiet.  
[20:00]  
 
And when I moved back to Portland, the contrast was [stuck to 
me? 00:20:03]. It's always you're hearing sirens, you're hearing the 
trains down in the industrial district, the airports - you know, all 
the planes of Orla ndo and Portland are flying...  
Jon: Right over you.  
Tim: ...Over East Portland. And traffic and it’s just — 
Jon: The background noise.  
Tim: So I’m just saying, in my formative imagination, silence, one of the 
main things where my mind goes when I think of stillness and 
peace isn’t about earthquakes, and rocks, and waves . It's that 
noise, it’s silence  and solitude. And I think that’s just because as a 
little kid growing up here, there was a constant city background of 
noise that I wasn’t even aware of...  
Jon: Until you got out of there.  
Tim: ...until I moved away in my 20s. That’s an example. Your formative 
imagery for conceiving of the universe, how can it be otherwise, 
right?  13 
 
Jon: Right.  
Tim: Your brain’s, our minds are shaped by our environments and they 
give us the categories to think in - the frame of reference. So there 
was a professor literary theory, I don’t know if he’s famous or not, 
his name is Umberto Eco.  
Jon: That’s a cool name.  
Tim: He’s Italian. He wrote , "The Name of the Rose" which is his mo st 
famous novel made into a movie. Anyway, yeah, profound and 
obscure. He developed this phrase though called every literature, 
whether it’s a poet or an author is working out of what he called 
an encyclopedia of production.  
Jon: That’s the phrase, encyclo pedia of production?  
Tim: That’s the phrase, yeah. And actually every human, but usually 
human sort of try and express themselves through words are 
drawing upon what he called an encyclopedia of production. And I 
like encyclopedia even though almost none o f us even have them.  
Jon: A Wikipedia.  
Tim: Yeah, we have the virtual encyclopedias. But the point is, it’s this 
big, collected body of reference knowledge that you draw upon to 
make sense of your world. And our brains are constantly stocking, 
creating a n encyclopedia. His whole point was that human do this 
individually from the moment you are out of the womb. You’re 
collecting sense data, and having multiple experiences about 
what’s soft, what’s hard. You’re forming your encyclopedia. And 
then individual  humans to this and then communities do this, and 
then how cultures do this and so every culture when literature is 
created, draws from its own unique encyclopedia of production.  
Jon: And then he calls this encyclopedia of production because it’s the 
encyc lopedia by which you produce ideas out of?  
Tim: Correct, yeah. That’s right. So anytime a work of communication is 
produced, you're drawing upon...  
Jon: You're drawing from the encyclopedia.  
Tim: ...it's cultural encyclopedia. I don’t know why I like —it’s a 
metaphor. But I kind of like it. It’s just helpful to think every culture 14 
 
has its own. And many cultures overlap certain entries in their 
encyclopedia like sun and water.  
Jon: Right, right, right.  
Tim: And light and dark, and life and death. But many enc yclopedias 
are full of unique entries based on whether you live in the city or 
the country.  Whether you…that kind of thing. So the question is, 
first of all, how does a culture in individual’s encyclopedia of 
imagery get stocked? How does that get stocked and how do 
those images —  
Jon: Which is that another great metaphor?  
Tim: Yeah, yeah, that’s right.  
Jon: Immediately, it made me think of stocking trout in a lake.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. How does it get filled and how do our brains draw 
upon encyclopedias as  we are making sense of the world? What 
role does imagery and metaphor serve in how we make sense of 
the world? Which is kind of the big question you were asking at 
first. 
Jon: Right.  
Tim: Is it just the way we dress up and make our language sound 
pretty?  
Jon: Yeah. Is it just something we use every once in a while to really 
drive home a point or is it something more deeply rooted in our 
psyche?  
Tim: Yeah, yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So that’s an interesting topic to talk 
about, and I think —so let’s talk abo ut that. And then second, in 
light of that conversation, what is the uniquely Israelite, Jewish, 
Biblical, cultural encyclopedia that the biblical poets are constantly 
drawing upon and writing their poetry out of?  
Jon: Yeah, cool. I think a lot about consc iousness in the mind and the 
one thing that becomes very apparent is how our metaphor for 
how we even imagine our mind working has changed over the 
years.  
Tim: Oh, man, yes. The thing about this conversation, I thought about 
that too.  15 
 
 
[25:02]  
 
Jon: Yeah?  
Tim: Yeah. You go on. But…  
Jon: I know, you know, when steam became a new invention and was 
revolutionizing industry, it became a metaphor for how we started 
thinking about things. Pressure and valves and all these things.  
Tim: The gears are turning.  
Jon: The gears, yeah. So we started thinking on a metaphor about 
steam and gears as to how our psyche works. Yeah, you just use 
the phrase like "my gears are turning ” or “let me turn on that. ” Or 
hotheaded, maybe even comes from that. I don’t even know.  
Tim: That’s interesting.  
Jon: But then when computers came out, it became a new metaphor 
and we started thinking about computation and our brains work in 
processing.  
Tim: Processing.  
Jon: Yeah, let me process that. And so the way we think about our own 
rationale  has changed over the years based on the technology.  
Tim: That’s right. Conceptions of the universe and how it works, you 
know, in terms of the universe as a machine, operating with gears 
by laws. And again, I’m not a science nerd, but I know enough to 
know that once quantum physics got involved, that 
straightforward gear model of the universe — 
Jon: The closer you look, the more it started falling apart.  
Tim: Yeah. just you need a totally different way of explaining it that’s 
way more organic and whatever quantum physics is. So it’s 
mathematical but it’s not gears. It doesn’t work like gears. So yeah, 
those are good examples. The steam engine machine brain versus 
the computer brain, those come from two different —even from 
the same culture, just at two diffe rent time periods.  
Jon: Yeah, a century later.  16 
 
Tim: That creates a different encyclopedia of production. And so when 
somebody writes a poem about how the mind works — 
Jon: They’re drawing from that.  
Tim: They going to draw from two different types of encycl opedias. 
Two different types of poem imagery.  
Jon: Those aren’t the only two. I’m just kind of spacing as to what they 
would have been otherwise.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah.  
Jon: So that’s totally true. So this should be the time to bring up Lakoff.  
Tim: Yes, that’s  right. So first, this is interesting. The word metaphor it's 
a Greek word spelled with English letters.  
Jon: Oh, Is it? I never knew that.  
Tim: Hmm -mm. Meta phora. So meta is...  
Jon: Yeah, beyond.  
Tim: ...with or coming across.  
Jon: Oh, across?  
Tim: Hmm -mm. In some senses depending on the context. And then 
phora is from a Greek word phero, to carry. So to transfer.  
Jon: Oh, cool.  
Tim: Of course, I  to transfer, to carry across the associations of one 
thing and carry them to another thing. That’s th e basic idea. You’re 
talking about one thing as if it’s another thing.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: To carry the association’s, the ideas usually connected with 
machines and you’re applying them to the brain. So that’s it. 
You’re talking about one thing in terms of an other thing. So just, 
actually, so we can have clarity in our conversations, this is in the 
notes here. Metaphor is actually just one kind of a larger category 
of...You can call them figures of speech.  
Jon: All right.  17 
 
Tim: Or non -literal language, though t he meaning of literal language is 
debated.  
Jon: It’s like quantum mechanics. You start looking closer enough.  
Tim: Until it falls apart. Yeah, that's right. So metaphor is talking about 
one thing as if it were another. “My wife’s a ball of fire. ” Whereas 
the moment I explicitly draw attention to the comparison, “My 
wife is like a ball of fire, ” then that’s called , in literally terms , a 
simile.  
Jon: Yeah, that always seemed kind of a weird distinction. Like what’s 
so important in throwing in the word like?  
Tim: Well, it’s as if in the simile, "my wife is like a ball of fire, ” kind of 
like I’m backing away.  
Jon: Yeah, you’re hedging a little bit more.  
Tim: Yeah. So what I’m saying is...  
Jon: Metaphor really embraces it.  
Tim: That’s right, yeah. It’s almost like you’re committing to the image 
more.  
Jon: It tells you to suspend your reality - we’re going in.  
Tim: Yeah, that’s right.  
Jon: Simile is like, yeah, we’re going in but don’t worry.  
Tim: Yes. When I say, "My wife’s like a ball of fire," I’m saying th ere are 
some things that my wife and fire have in common.  
 
[30:02]  
 
Tim: Not everything but some things. When I say, "My wife is a ball of 
fire," I’m forcing you to go through the thought process of being 
like, you can’t actually mean that." But there are  some really 
important ways that his wife is like fire. What are they? What could 
they be? It’s like you’re pitching the ball in to the listener’s court.  
Jon: Yeah.  18 
 
Tim: So… other types of speech that are kind of like this is - we talked 
about these before  - metonymy.  
Jon: Yeah, we have. And synecdoche.  
Tim: It’s synecdoche  
Jon: Synecdoche. We have a whole pack of episode where I 
mispronounced this word more and more. That’s right, I forgot 
about that.  
Tim: So metonymy is you refer to something not by it, but by 
something it’s associated with. So, Hollywood produces lots of 
great films. So Hollywood’s a place associated with...  
Jon: Or can I use your wheels? Oh, no, that's the other one.  
Tim: Oh yeah, wheels is Synecdoche. You’re using part of the thing...  
Jon: A part of the thing.  
Tim: ...to refer to the whole thing. But also in synecdoche , you can use 
the whole thing to refer to part of it.  So you would say like, "The 
US won a gold medal in the Olympics."  
Jon: Oh, okay.  
Tim: Something like that. So what you mean is that by the whole of US 
is one particular US citizen.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: So, part for whole, whole for part.  That’s synecdoche. Metony my is 
association.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: The pen is mightier than  the sword.  
Jon: So you’re not talking about the pen and the sword. You’re talking 
about war and communication.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. War versus communication.  
Jon: Yeah, cool.  
Tim: So these are all types of figures of speech and in all of them, 
usually you’r e drawing upon images. Verbal pictures. Which is why 
a more basic way to talk about what I really want this video to be 19 
 
about is actually imagery in biblical poetry. And metaphor is one 
particular...it’s one way to use images, but it’s not the only way.  
Jon: Let’s solve that then. You said earlier you weren’t sure.  
Tim: But metaphor is also a common enough word that —it just sounds, 
I don’t know, which sounds more interesting. Which video you’d 
be more interested in? Imagery in biblical poetry or metaphor?  
Jon: I would probably click on metaphor first but — 
Tim: Exactly.  
Jon: But if I click on metaphor and then it was —metaphor was just part 
of it and it was really about imagery, I might get confused.  
Tim: And that’s what I wondered like from —I think in our cu lture; 
metaphor has come to have a broader meaning. To just mean 
using images and word pictures and figure of speech 
metaphorically.  
Jon: Interesting.  
Tim: None literal speech is metaphorical speech. Namely — 
Jon: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Tim: Using images instead of – 
Jon: Well, that’s fascinating.  
Tim: I have certainly come across that in terms of classrooms.  
Jon: That’s how people tend to mean it.  
Tim: Yeah. It’s metaphorical. Is that literal or metaphorical?  
Jon: Got you. And they don’t say literal or symbolic. They say...  
Tim: Yeah, symbolic might be used sometimes. So just keep that on the 
brain as we’re talking in terms of what will be the appropriate title.  
Jon: Literally, keep it in my brain.  
Tim: Okay. So you and I both are interested in the ways  that brain 
science interacts with literature studies here.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: And the way poetry and metaphor isn’t just — 20 
 
Jon: It’s doing something to your brain.  
Tim: Correct. Or it’s expressing something that our brains already 
doing.  
Jon: Oh, okay.  
Tim: Yeah, in other words, metaphor can be a way that an author or 
poet, crafts a unique way of ta lking about something. So like, 
instead of saying, "I’m having a hard day and I don’t understand 
what’s going on in the politics of our age," I write a poem abou t 
standing on a rocky island that’s being pounded by chaotic surf or 
something.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: So that’s creating a metaphor. But the question is, that poem was 
created by a human. In this case, a human who we believe that’s 
inspired by the Spirit of God  to write this poem, and what does 
that tell us about how that poet that sees and makes sense of his 
world.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: Not just how he wants to talk pretty about it.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: But how does that poet make sense of his world and that our very 
understanding of reality is it itself metaphor. That’s the basic idea 
here. So yeah, you’ve read the most accessible and popular 
authors on this, how the brain makes sense of the reality is 
through metaphor is a couple of guys, George Lakoff and Mark 
Turner .   
 
[35:04]  
 
Tim: So when did you come across their work?  
Jon: Is it Turner? The book I’ve read is "Metaphors We Live By." It's 
Lakoff and Johnson.  
Tim: Oh, and Johnson. Okay got it. Then the other one which is a little 
more academic is "More Than Cool Re ason: A Field Guide to 21 
 
Poetic Metaphor." That’s George Lakoff and Mark Turner. So 
George Lakoff, literary — 
Jon: Literary guy  
Tim: Literary, cognitive theorist. Something like that.  
Jon: How did I run into it? I don’t know. I think I just saw it on a shelf, 
and I was like, “That’s a cool title."  
Tim: Yeah. "Metaphors We Live By."  
Jon: "Metaphors We Live By."  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: Yeah. And then I read it and I was blown away.  
Tim: Me too.  
Jon: Blown away.  
Tim: Yeah, me too. It’s like having somebody point out to you that 
you’re wearing glasses.  
Jon: For the first time.  
Tim: For the first time, and you had no idea you were ever wearing 
glasses.  
Jon: Exactly.  
Tim: That’s what it was like for me.   
Jon: Yeah. Oh, man. Yeah. Highly recommend reading that book.  
Tim: Oh, totally. Really. Their basic point is a poet can talk about one 
thing in terms of another and we call it metaphor.  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: My wife’s a fireball. But what their whole case is,  is that our brains 
are making sense of complex, unfamiliar experience data, 
constantly. And what they’re doing is using pre -existing categories 
from past experience.  
Jon: That are usually more concrete.  22 
 
Tim: They’re usually more concrete and familiar, and  then as if we 
project our experience of the past on to this present unfamiliar 
thing.  
Jon: I think everyone would say, "Yeah, okay, of course, I do that," But 
then they start showing how embedded it is in everything.  
Tim: In consumption of reality. Yeah, that’s right.  
Jon: They start unpa cking it and you realize like, “ Holy cow, I didn’t 
realize all the metaphors I was using to explain things."  
Tim: Yes. It’s pretty simple. It’s kind of a way to break  down what our 
brains are doing. They talk about two cat egories of how we 
process metaphors and think in metaphors. They use a word a 
source domain and a target domain.  
Jon: Yeah. This is geeky. It’s so funny, I would never explain it this way.  
Tim: You wouldn’t?  
Jon: This is the nerdy way to explain it. Maybe  I would . I don't know.  
Tim: Oh, interesting. Got it.  
Jon: This is probably the best way to explain it.  
Tim: This is trying to break down —none of us are aware that this is 
happening.  
Jon: Yeah, you have to really...  
Tim: But they’re trying to recreate what our brains are doing.  
Jon: Yeah, I love it.  
Tim: It’s really fascinating.  
Jon: Your source domain and your target domain.  
Tim: Source domain and target domain. So this is a quote from "More 
than Cool Reason." We use a metaphor to map certain aspects of 
a source domain on to a target domain, producing a new 
understanding of that target domain. This is where for me, the 
word map as a verb entered my encyclopedia.  
Jon: Oh, really?  23 
 
Tim: Yeah, it was through their work, and it was very helpful. To think in  
terms of like on our smartphones, we can do this.  
Jon: We can map something.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. You can either turn off certain features of your map or 
turn them on and so if you turn on a certain feature, it’s like a layer 
laying on top of your map that a ll of a sudden you can show like a 
grid of Portland but then you can turn on the layer that turns on...  
Jon: The satellite images.  
Tim: Yeah, like the satellite images.  
Jon: Or bakeries nearby.  
Tim: Or on Google Earth, you know, you can turn on street nam es or 
you can turn them off.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: So you use mapping. It’s like our brains have already mapped 
previous experiences and then we take that map and lay it on to a 
new experience. So they use this metaphor of time as a thief. In 
the metaphor “time is a thief, ” part of the mapping is 
super imposing.  
Jon: Our idea of what a thief is.  
Tim: Yeah. Actually a metaphorical understanding of time as a 
possession.  
Jon: Oh, right, that would be more basic.  
Tim: Yes. 
Jon: Time is something you can own.  
Tim: Time is a possession. And then what we do is carry all of the 
feelings that we have about our possessions...  
Jon: They can be stolen.  
Tim: ...And we map them on to our experience of time. So when I say 
the word, time is a thief, what their point is, there’s  actually a 
deeper conceptual metaphor underneath. It’s a metaphor — 
Jon: Wait, wait. What?  24 
 
Tim: When I use the phrase "time is a thief"...  
Jon: Which one is more basic. Possession is the most basic.  
Tim: Correct.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: Underneath saying, "time is a thief," which is an interesting figure 
of speech. Underneath that is a conceptual metaphor that time is a 
thing you can possess, and we carry all of our emotions and 
feelings about our personal possession and we map those on to 
our experience of time.  Just think of all these phrases. "I lost time 
yesterday. ” “I gained some time by getting to work early. ”  
 
[40:00]  
 
Tim: “Man, he took up so much of my time yesterday."  
Jon: "That experience stole years from me."  
Tim: Yeah, totally. "I've got time to spa re today."  
Jon: “I got some spare time. ” 
Tim: “I got some spare time. ” Just like "I have spare change or spare 
cash."  
Jon: So the source domain is possessions?  
Tim: Yeah, my stuff.  
Jon: And the target domain is my experience of time.  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: And t ime is such an abstract thing, how do we talk about it? Oh, 
let’s talk about it like a possession.  
Tim: Yes, yeah.  
Jon: Even though, if you really start to think about it, you don’t own 
time.  
Tim: You don’t. It’s not your possession at all.  
Jon: Although you do. I mean...  25 
 
Tim: But in a way , you have certain control.  
Jon: You have an allotment of it. You have an allotment of it.  
Tim: Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: And so when it’s gone, it’s gone. So what’s the closest thing to 
that? Well, I have an  allotment of cash or an allotment of things 
and when it’s gone it’s gone.  
Tim: Yeah, that’s true. The difference  is that, there are some possessions 
that if you choose to, you don’t have to give them away, whereas 
time you always have to lose it or give it or spend it. Time has to 
be spent.  
Jon: Time has to be spent. Yeah.  
Tim: Time is money.  
Jon: Yeah. You could  write a poem about that. It’s a very interesting 
insight. You have to spend your time. You can't save time like you 
save money.  
Tim: Yeah, that’s right. Yeah. So here’s an interesting question, is this 
economic, money, possession, metaphorical conception of time, is 
this universal to the human experience?  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: Did the ancient Israelites talk this way?  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: It turns out that they didn't. Like you won't find these ways of 
talking about time in the Bible. You won’t find them in all ki nds of 
cultures around the world, but you find them in our culture at 
least. So I’m not an expert on this metaphor, but it’s very 
interesting. So that’s a good example.  
Jon: How would the Bible talk about time?  
Tim: Oh, just differently. Gosh, that’s a who le theme video.  
Jon: Yeah, seriously.  
Tim: The Bible’s conception of time. Pretty simple to grasp. You take 
your experience and all of the feelings associated with one core 
thing and you map them on to some other experience.  26 
 
Jon: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. There’ s five metaphors I was thinking should be 
reimagined.  
Tim: Oh, yeah. Good.  
Jon: One is, I call it Love is a trap. It’s probably a better way to think 
about it. But people talk about falling in love.  
Tim: It’s something that happen s to you.  
Jon: It happens to you, and you...  
Tim: And passive.  
Jon: Yeah, it's very passive. You become captivated with someone. 
Captivated with someone. Like you’re a captive. Well, I saw a dark 
side of this and it made me think like, "Oh, this needs to be 
reimagined." We just ta lked about time as a possession, time as 
currency, “I’m wasting time, ” “my mind as a computer, ” I think that 
needs to be reprocessed. E motions as a disease. "My emotions 
flared up ” or my... And then my body as a battery, “ I need to be 
charged." You know what? Maybe that’s a good one, I don’t know.  
Tim: Yes. 
Jon: Because we are very — 
Tim: Okay. So here’s the interesting...you can do these little mental 
detective stories then where —so those are little phrases, 
metaphorical p hrases but the —to apply Lakoff and Turner’s  
Jon: It has to really — 
Tim: Yeah. There are actually some deeper core  metaphor  that that 
phrase is just one expression of. L ike "time is my possession" can 
manifest itself in all of these different ways. "I lost  time, ” “I gained 
time. ” “He took my time. ” “I spend time." Those are all ways of 
talking about one core space in my brain. Time as a possession. So 
question is, when I use any given figure of speech, is there actually 
a deeper conceptual set of glasses th at I’m wearing that I’m not 
even aware of?  
Jon: Because it weaves together to create this tapestry which is your 
underlying metaphor.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  27 
 
Jon: He brings up some really classic ones like time. And then you have 
one down here, "life is a journey." That’s a good one.  
Tim: Yeah, okay. So that’s the first point is that how our brains work is 
mapping from one set of experiences o n to another experienc e. 
Second  is they want to make a distinction between these, they call 
it, basic conceptual metaphors. These deep underlying metaphors 
that we’re not even aware of, they wanted to distinguish those 
from poetic metaphors.  
Jon: Got it. Because those are the o nes that are generating the poetic 
metaphors.  
Tim: Correct. Yeah. The basic idea is, think of it like…To use a metaphor 
image. Think of it like a well that’s connected to a deep whatever.  
 
[45:03]  
 
Jon: Underground spring.  
Tim: Underground spring. You know , someone can draw a bucket down 
the crack of the well and then bring it up and then do something 
with that water. And the water comes from the underground 
spring, but they’re different  
Jon: Yeah. Then they can make some Gatorade with it.  
Tim: But then yo u make Gatorade with it. You know it’s something 
nobody ever thought of. That’s the basic idea. There are basic 
deep metaphors that we’re not aware of.  
Jon: The basic ingredient.  
Tim: Yeah. And what we come across in poetry are like surface 
manifestation s of deeper underlying metaphor. So they talk about 
basic conceptual metaphor. Life is a journey. Think about how 
many unique poetic expressions you can come up with that live off 
that core idea. You can talk about people being lost. You can 
literally be l ost or you can speak about being lost as in terms of 
not knowing your vocational direction.  
Jon: How to make the next decision in life.  
Tim: How to make the next decision.  28 
 
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: When you talk about figuring out the right decision to make, we 
talk about finding my way. Jesus and wisdom letters in the Bible  
uses these two path s or two roads images all the time of like the 
right path and the wrong path. Narrow is the gate, broader is the 
road type of thing. The famous Robert Frost Poem, "two roads  
diverged in a wood."  
Jon: Wait. He isn’t talking about hiking?  
Tim: So yeah, all these biblical proverbs. "The heart of a man plans his 
way, but the Lord establishes his steps." So life is a journey. So the 
deep underlying metaphor that our brains are co nstantly drawing 
upon to make sense of day to day experience that gives meaning 
to our choices. We talk about "fork in the road" moment. “I met a 
fork in the road. ” That’s a good example. It brings...  
Jon: Life as a journey is a basic one and it manifests in all these 
different...  
Tim: All these different ways.  
Jon: ...tons of phrases, poetic expressions.  
Tim: That’s right. Yeah. They talk about people are plants.  
Jon: People as plants. I’ve never heard of this one.  
Tim: Of humans , the way we talk about e ach other is so much with 
plant language.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: We talk about kids sprouting. Actually, a more common one is like, 
"She went to college, man, she blossomed. She’s blossomed." 
Offspring, or in the Bible, the Hebrew word for children is seed. 
Human children.  
Jon: Yeah, okay.  
Tim: Is the same as — 
Jon: The name of what plants grow.  
Tim: Correct, yeah. Seed. Yeah, you look upon your seed. Meaning you 
look upon your children.  
Jon: Yeah. That’s always a weird one when you read in the Bible.  29 
 
Tim: Yeah, sure.  
Jon: The seed. Please don’t use that.  
Tim: That's right. Unless you grew up in a farm.  
Jon: You called kids seed in farmland?  
Tim: Well, that’s a good point. So people are plants. Some of them have 
to do with just experience in the human body.  So, up is good and 
down is bad. I mean, it’s just everythi ng. Whatever. "I'm feeling 
down.”  “I’m flying high." We use special figures of speech 
constantly to talk about a good versus bad.  
Jon: Even the word depressed.  
Tim: Depressed. Yeah, correct.  
Jon: Pressed down. I'm on the top of the word.  
Tim: On top of the world. Yeah, I got a leg up on this situation and — 
Jon: A leg up. That must come from something. Where does the come 
from? A leg up. Like a rock climbing metaphor?  
Tim: I don't know. That's a g ood question.  
Jon: I think one really interesting one is, argument is war. Did you read 
that one in Lakoff's?  
Tim: That was in "Metaphors We Live By."  
Jon: Okay, that's "Metaphors We Live By." So your claims are 
indefensible or he attacked your weak point s or his criticism is 
right on target. The most argument won the argument. You’re 
talking about all these war metaphors.  
Tim: Man. Okay, that’s a good example. Also, it’s a good example of 
what does it mean to reimagine.  
Jon: Yes. And so I thought about that...  
[crosstalk 00:49:13]  
Jon: Yeah, and I thought, "What can you imagine it to?" And the one I 
came up with is, argument as journey go to life as journey. 
Argument as a journey.  
Tim: Yeah, sure.  30 
 
Jon: I don’t know what the phrases would be but like tog ether we’re 
walking side by side; we’re clearing a path. That’s the metaphor. 
And if that’s the metaphor, you’re not fighting each other, you’re 
journeying together. I don’t know if that will work, but — 
Tim: Yeah, that’s interesting. I think the main obstacle to your argument 
is this.  
Jon: Right. So we might have to clear the path this way.  
Tim: If the logic of your argument works, then is brings you to this goal.  
Jon: Yeah. Where that argument is heading, is a place I wouldn’t want 
to go.  
Tim: You too k a turn right there in your logic that — 
Jon: Yeah. And I guess we do use that sometimes. We use that 
language.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. But the point is that the moment you have on 
argument as war instead of glasses, then you’re not aware...  
 
[50:09]  
 
Jon: You’r e trying to demolish and fight back. You’re trying to hold 
your ground.  
Tim: Correct. It predisposes you towards a more aggressive style of 
argumentation.  
Jon: And that's the most fascinating to me about "Metaphors We Live 
By" is not only are they the glas ses that we see the world through, 
but then they change the way we live in the world because we’re 
looking at things in a certain way.  
Tim: Correct.  
Jon: Which then speaks at how powerful having a new poetic 
imagination can be.  
Tim: You know, gosh, I was  thinking about this. I was in a conversation 
with somebody. They were pointing out to me the way that digital 
capitalism, online commerce is reshaping the way that generations 31 
 
growing up with eBay and Etsy, it reshapes how they view 
possessions.  
Jon: Oh, okay. You can get anything in your house in two days.  
Tim: You can get anything and anything in your room can be sold on 
Craigslist in a matter of minutes. And so they’re talking about how 
the Craigslist, whatever, eBay’s - I don’t know how prominent eBay 
is anymore - but it is the mentality towards your things that’s 
different. And then it begins to shape...  
Jon: It’s a transient kind of mentality.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. Your possessions are more transient. And then it has 
the potential. I don’t know how, but it  remains to be seen how we 
will reshape our language about possessions when you view them 
as—  
Jon: You don’t buy things. You’re leasing things.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. You purchase things to use them for a while until 
more to your advantage. That’s the exampl e of a set of metaphors 
towards our possessions that’s been waiting to be developed.  
Jon: Yeah. That happens where if our culture changes enough, we start 
to live in a different reality in which we don’t have a good way to 
talk about it until we do.  
Tim: Oh, yes. Okay,  
Jon: You know, and it will materialize.  
Tim: Yes. I have an example of this in the notes, but I’ll just relay it 
because it was really interesting. This was about the development 
of the concept of force fields in modern science.  
Jon: Oh, rig ht. Okay.  
Tim: And really it’s the use of the word field.  
Jon: Okay, right. I think you mentioned this to me.  
Tim: It was a physicist, Faraday. Michael Faraday? Daniel Faraday? It’s a 
really important physicist.  
Jon: I know the last name , Faraday.  
Tim: Michael Faraday. Yeah, Michael Faraday. This whole institute, you 
know, physics dedicated to carrying on his legacy. This is mid -32 
 
1800s. He’s like pioneering physicists. So he developed the 
concept of the magnetic field. So what we’re talking about is, 
when  a magnet...  
Jon: The effect that a magnet has.  
Tim: Totally. You know, the classic thing. If you threw a magnet on the 
table with little pieces of iron around it, it exerts a force. Or a force 
in a traction brings certain of those little pieces of iron th ey just 
stick to it.  
Jon: And there’s a real space around it which it works.  
Tim: Correct. There is a space around it where the attraction is strong 
enough to actually move it. So the whole point was about, what 
do we call that?  
Jon: Yeah, what do we call  that space.  
Tim: So he developed the metaphor, field, which was used, according 
to Oxford English dictionary at the time, to use an actual — 
Jon: Plot of land.  
Tim: Plot of land where everything in it is the same thing. It’s a 
cornfield. It’s a wheat fiel d. So, it’s a field dedicated to a certain 
thing and everything in it is the same. And then you can have field 
as a metaphor of steady. So a field of research, field of whatever, 
quantum mechanics.  
Jon: So yeah, that was always a metaphor at some point. F araday was 
like, "There's something we need to talk about, but we haven’t the 
language for it yet."  
Tim: Correct. So he adapted the English word, field and it actually 
changed its meaning. Because magnetic field is not like a wheat 
field because a wheat f ield doesn’t have more wheat in the middle 
and less wheat on the outer rings.  
Jon: What I love is that almost all language is that way.  
Tim: Correct. That’s right.  
Jon: And that’s why I’m always fascinated by etymology is because if 
you look into it, you' ll usually find the basic metaphor behind the 
word you’re using.  
Tim: Correct.  33 
 
Jon: We can play a little game right now just to find metaphors to cool 
words.  
Tim: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, totally. You can do this all day. That’s why I’m 
reading Lakoff and Turner.  But for some reason , I like this one 
where it was like he introduced...  
Jon: That’s a great one.  
Tim: ...the word field and the world actually underwent transformation. 
And now we use the word force field or magnetic field as if it is a 
thing. And the who le point in this book that I was reading about 
metaphor was, it’s not a thing. It’s just there’s a space around 
magnet  
Jon: It’s the effect that’s…  
 
[55:00]  
 
Tim: ...that you can describe mathematically why there’s this attraction 
between those and not the  other pieces of iron.  
Jon: So what is the thing?  
Tim: What we’re using, we’re using the metaphor field to describe...  
Jon: A phenomenon  
Tim: ...a phenomenon  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Yeah. That happens within a certain degree of space and we use a 
metaphor, a field  to talk about that space.  
Jon: Cool.  
Tim: And it reforms the meaning of the word.  
Jon: I think of myself as an explainer is the term I like to use. What am 
I? What do I do with my life? I like to explain things. I’m an 
explainer. But the word explain has a cool metaphor behind it.  
Tim: Oh, I don’t know what it is.  34 
 
Jon: Ex, out, pl anare...it’s Latin. Expl anare. And pl anare is plain. It 
actually before it came to me to explain something what we think 
of it, it meant to basically just like iron out or sm ooth out like a 
fabric or anyt hing else. Explore it l ike expl anare. Or it was also 
used to explain the blossoming of a flower. So you've all these 
plains that unfold - fold out. So it’s an unfolding. It really mean s 
unfold. I remember being in  Multnomah , wher e we both went to 
school, and there was this brand new metaphor everyone was 
using where they would sing in class, let’s unpack that. First time I 
ever heard that.  
Tim: Oh, really?  
Jon: Let’s unpack that idea. And everyone...  
Tim: Yeah, sure. Like it's a p iece of baggage.  
Jon: Yeah. Like we had this box in front of us and we now got to open 
it up and pull things out. And I’d never heard that before, but I 
noticed all the smart people used it. So like, "This is an important 
metaphor."  
Tim: Totally. Yeah.  
Jon: And I think that’s the idea of explaining is you’re unpacking, you’re 
unfolding things, seeing like how it all works because we do have 
ideas, well, packages of ideas I’ll give to you. You know, like every 
one of our videos is like a package of an ideas . 
Tim: That can be unpacked for — 
Jon: But then you can unpack it more. And that’s the role of an 
explainer.  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: Unpacking it in such a way that you go, "Oh, that’s everything in 
there. Cool. Let’s pack it back up," and now I have that thing.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah, that’s good. And what are we referring to? We’re 
referring to an idea. We’re referring to the concept...  
Jon: Abstract ideas  
Tim: ...in our brains.  
Jon: Right.  35 
 
Tim: But that we both agree exist in the world can be unpacked in these 
ways. I just realized, we thought of one in the meeting this 
morning. Broadcast.  
Jon: Oh, right.  
Tim: Which I think in English, originated for scattering seed, a farmer 
scattering seed and then it got adopted as a metaphor for...  
Jon: Radio.  
Tim: Radio.  
Jon: Television  
Tim: Television. For broadcasting.  
Jon: And also this morning we realized we’re broadcasters.  
Tim: Yeah, that’s one way to describe The Bible Project. We are media 
broadcast.  
Jon: It makes us sound really important  
Tim: Bible Project Broadcast .  
Jon: Broadcasting, not live.  
Tim: Okay, so this is all pretty intuitive. But it’s so intuitive we don’t stop 
to think about it. Okay, so here’s the next step.  
Jon: Thanks for listening to this episode, The Bible Project podcast. This 
episode was edited  and produced by Dan Gummel. We are a 
crowd -funded, non -profit. We make videos that you can find for

conversations are Tim and I getting prepare d to write this scripts 
for the videos.  
In the next two episodes, we’re going to look at two biblical 
metaphors that are woven through the entire biblical narrative but 
are hard to see with our modern westernize. Looking forward to 
those conversations. Th at’s for being a part of this with us.
