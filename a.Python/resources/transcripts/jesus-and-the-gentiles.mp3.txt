has the gospel authors are portraying the story of Jesus and its meaning of there's these two plots of the Hebrew Bible that have been running throughout the whole thing there's God's purpose for all the families of the Earth but then to bless them and restore them he chose one particular family but then that Family itself becomes is fractured and violent and split apart as everybody else and so solving the fractured families Abraham problem is the way of addressing the fractured Human family problem so the gospel out there was going to tell the story of Jesus with their eye on both of those now Jesus for the most part is laser-focused on the family of Israel his own people his extended family like Matthew 15 where a woman comes and asks him to heal her demon possessed daughter but she's not in his realize she's a candidate then Jesus answered and said listen I sent to the lost sheep
 the house of Israel and she's not my responsibility but then there's this story or do you just seems to completely deconstruct what it means that you have a fan Jesus's mother and brothers come to visit him and Jesus just dismisses them and says you want to know who my brothers and sisters are it's whoever does the will of my Father in heaven right from the beginning of the Jesus movement there was a redefinition of what the family is and Jesus had a very expensive non traditional view of the family in the story of Jesus Jesus having defeated death and proven that he is the true Israelite. We used to bless all the nations he goes to his disciples and he says it's all authority has been given to me in the sky is normal and go therefore and Make Disciples of all just blah sheep the house of Israel but all nations and I'm with you by the end of the age Matthew clearly for G to show
 to the Venetian to the Nation Podcast today we're going to continue our series on the family of God and we're going to look at Jesus how he came for Israel to be the true Israelite to bring blessing to all the nations thanks for joining us here we go
 let's continue talking about this theme of family. We are into the story of Jesus we got there we've arrived to this point in any theme video conversations cuz sometimes it takes us a while yeah yeah yep and so you've been laying out for me this the argument of sorts that the ideal that the Bible presents is that all Humanity really is one family and that that doesn't mean we're all going to be the same in fact we're going to be very different and when we try to make everyone in the same when we went this Babylon project yeah it was not good there's a sort of a simulation kind of bored like bored really bored unity and then it kind of and then someone in power can then say
 hey everything everything about me and that can be corrupted so there's a sense of like how do we find Unity while maintaining our differences but respecting each other yeah yeah that's right so in a figure like Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon you can get focused in on one person or in Genesis 11 is focused in on one culture and their language is about the individual or a corporate manifestation of this Borg like assimilation Unity benefits at the expense of others which reflects on the difference of male and female as being different one image of God and then that concept gets expanded out to family members and siblings again who are all different yeah who are we are actually one family in the way the narrative develops and then it's the sad fracturing of that ideal Unity through all of his sibling rivalry
 Trace dinner last couple conversations so I felt like last time we were talking about this I felt this discomfort between okay that's cool and beautiful but it doesn't seem like the mentality that the Israelite Kings had and that Israel has a whole had have you reflected on that much more o that this perspective yeah oh yeah sure but that's true of the whole Hebrew Bible the Hebrew Bible doesn't represent what most ancient Israelites thought it in the minority materials from all these periods of Israelite history but the sea Lodge at the messaging of the final shape of the Hebrew Bible represents what a minority within Israel thought about the meaning of their history do you say you're right most of the kings were they wanted to be more like Canaanite Kings and they wanted to be so you're right
 most Israelite Kings wanted to be way more like the Canaanites is in God's covenant people for sure but that's the whole argument of the books of Samuel and kings was in the kingship and monarchy was just a huge dead end that was why God destroyed it a dead end from the moment that it started so if you've taken seriously image of God phone and then the table of Nations yes that's right he takes seriously Trace all these ideas and then you see God ask tell Abraham you going to bless all the nation yes he has one family to be a vehicle to restore blessing to all their families right what you just saw spiral out of control so the astute reader should be saying let's all act like one human family again even though we're not all the same Nation or same tribe that should be this kind of undercurrent of thought as a reader the Bible now
 time to go through but the Highlight moments in the Abraham story when he's not deceiving foreign Kings and causing plagues to be Rain Down On Their Kingdoms is like when he has a dispute with a foreign King name of them black about some property and they work out an arrangement and then make a covenant and so the Covenant stops a conflict from happening just like in the flood story would God makes a covenant that he won't enter into catastrophic Cosmic conflict with humanity and so what you watch them is the covenants become these peacemaking tools and so one of the ways that Abraham will bring a blessing upon the nation's is by modeling good covenants that help people make compromises and learn how to be brothers and sisters even though they are different kingdoms it's a design pattern about these covenants to bring peace that model God's covenant of Peace in the Flint flood so that's
 one of the ways that it goes forward but there's as many divisions and fractures in Abraham's family and Beyond this there are those little moments of unity to become a little little flashes of unity usually quickly go away yeah just just like my life is tension of the ideal for Humanity in the families of the earth it's kind of like the expanding universe theory where is just like man this thing is just seems so spread out now Humanity seems so divided just within the narrative world of the Bible and members are all siblings cuz they all come from dark table of Nations and so you're just like how are they all going to be brought together and again this is why in the last episode we focused on the prophetic hope especially prominent in Isaiah talks about the reunification of the family at the cessation of war and conflict Yahweh gets in there dries them all to a place
 and then teaches them how to sort of all the nations let him up at his vision of all the different nations coming to Jerusalem as epicenter and saying okay got to University our way and we can all live as brothers and sisters yep that's a cool Vision if you think you always good and so a man we can spend a whole series just on how the book of Isaiah develops that Motif cuz I seen chapter to where we read we have to read from chapter 6 to you but there's a whole elaborate Motif working its way through all the parts of Isaiah about that exalted holy high place the new Eden with a nation stream up to you chapter 11 it's a seed from the line of David goes up on that high hill and all the nations are looking to him to bring them peace and then you discover throughout the book that that seed of David is carrying on his shoulders the calling of all of Israel
 that the whole nation never thought about and then it's the same as suffering servant Palms where he's the servant is high and exalted and lift it up just like the temple in that opening for him and what he does on that high place is give his life and suffer for the sins in the Bible it's in the death of the many and then we get to chapter 6 of Isaiah and all the nations are coming in to listen to that servant whose anointed to bring good news so it's really cool how the book of Isaiah develops to this but it's a major my teeth the reunification of the family in the exhausted Messianic King and I'm having dinner with me together then that's just in the Hebrew Bible but we're not even to the New Testament cool let's jump into the gospels then yeah continue this theme
the dynamic at work in the gospels then is that as the gospel authors are portraying the story of Jesus and its meaning there's this to these two plots of the Hebrew Bible that have been running throughout the whole thing there's God's purpose for all the families of the Earth but then to bless them and restore them he chose one particular family selection that we talked we talked about the last name Abraham but then that Family itself becomes is fractured and violin dough and split apart as everybody else has any problem and so solving the fractured families Abraham problem is the way of addressing the fractured Human family problem so the gospel authors are going to tell the story of Jesus with their eye on both of those and sometimes they overlap in the same stories which will see some examples of the opening page of the New Testament I think so
 the genealogy and Matthew won the genealogy in Matthew chapter 1 if we read it we could put someone to sleep with this episode just like my sleep so we won't read the genealogy allowed I commend it to the podcast listener during your Bible on and I checked out what you will notice it is that it's a three-step genealogy that goes from Abraham to Jesus and three steps and it's really scream at it cuz there's fourteen Generations in each one goes from Abraham to David from David to the Exile and it's a it's a text out to Jesus and a Max I'll have to do it it's a patriarchal genealogy except that 4 Points there are mentioned in the lineage of those four women are Tamar from The Book of Genesis chapter 38 Rahab from The Book of Joshua chapter 2 of Ruth
 Ruth and then the wife of Uriah the hittite that is Bathsheba 2nd Samuel 11 so the presence of these four women in the genealogy has interested readers since the gospel is written what it what's the significance of their presence here is it a typical to add women to a genealogy in the first place it's just out of the three times fourteen Generations covered so they were three times 14 chances to mention other matriarchs but these four are mentioned so what's up with that certainly it's Matthews doing something here he has tracked with a design pattern in the Hebrew Bible that is related to this family is God's team member in our last conversation big one for that we traced with how all of Abraham's kid becomes the father of many nations through Ishmael and then Isaac becomes a father of two Nations through Israel Jacob passage Esau but then we noticed how those
 this mail send Theresa were the sons of lot Abraham's nephew actually re-enter this is real story by marrying into it so there's this idea then the Hebrew Bible is not I don't know binary there are righteous people who are not from the chosen line and they're people from The Chosen line who are really terrible and so what we have here is the presence of 4 Non Israelite women what all for these women have in common that she was going to be like well she's the one potential she's married to Mary Uriah the hittite he said to be the daughter of elyon which is could be interpreted as a as a Hebrew name with which means maybe she was in the family this round but she's married to a gentile a gentle she's married to a headlight okay what all for these women have in common why would Matthew see all of these women is connected in some way will judah's wife she's a
 Tamar Tamar is a Canaanite Judah so this is one of the twelve of Joseph and Judith takes a wife who's a can tonight well actually yes he does marry a woman and then he finds Canaanite wives for his sons and one of those wisest Tamar so Rahab is a Canaanite and she's a prostitute in the city of Jericho Ruth is a moabite a descendant of lot so both Tamar and Rahab are descendants of ham from Noah Ruth is a descendant of Moab who's the descendant of lot Abraham's nephew and then Bathsheba is married to Uriah the hittite and hittite sorry again descendants of ham that's interesting they're all from one of these parallel unchosen lines yeah and the genealogy could have hidden that yes I've stepped it highlighting it
 names for women who come from the unchosen parallel lines in the Hebrew Bible but yet all of them finds themselves as matriarchs of the Messianic yeah they've been included in and instruments of God's purpose in bringing about the birth of the Messiah the surely one part of the strategy here these four unchosen women from unchosen lineages and God's purpose are woven into bringing about the chosen one if you look at each of these four women stories there's all kinds of design pattern hyperlinks between them so more than one of them is involved in some shady potential sexual liaison at night it's like she's a prostitute oh yeah that story and so a father-in-law sleeping with a daughter-in-law view rehab is a prostitute in the men go into her house at night
 and the truth has that odd situation with Boaz at the threshing floor at night or she pulls up his rope and exposes him and he says make sure nobody sees you when you leave but all of them end up making bold claims upon the lion of Judah or David or on the people of this realm actually Tamar's boldness and deception of Judah that ends up proving her faithfulness to the lineage actually save the Messianic line by disguising herself and deceiving and having sex with her father-in-law and actually that's how the land of Moab came into existence was lot's daughters after Sodom and Gomorrah it gets toasted his daughter's get their dad drunk and get pregnant by him in a case to preserve the seat to preserve the line that's what most of these women are involved in is the men in these stories are
 obtuse or foolish or just straight-up Wicked and so these women resort to clever plans to continue the line of the seed and in so doing they actually save the line of the Messiah tomorrow does us to go to Jericho when Joshua sends them and then we're just told her she end up in the interesting but yes she eventually she gets mentioned and then marries into the lineage of the Lion of Judah by marrying Boaz and the best Shiva you know who's taking by David and there's other hyperlinks between all these stories but they're interesting examples of how through unconventional means through surprising people God has been at work to reunify the nation's to bring through the Messianic speed here I'll just read Richard Balcom
 essay on this in a book called who this great in the book called gospel women studies in the named women in the gospels too many women disciples named in the four gospels and Balcom is done and exhaustive research on all of them as fascinating book so pieces here about Matthews genealogy he says Jesus is identification and Matthew one is the son of David is capable of many meetings but the presence of these Gentile women highlights the inclusiveness of the messiah's Roll to be a blessing to the Nations as well as to save his own people for their students from their sense is the davidic Messiah role to be that of a new Joshua who will again lead obedient Israel to drive out the Canaanites or do these Canaanite women in Jesus's ancestors require a more positive relationship to the Gentiles all of this is at stake later and Matthew's gospel in the encounter Jesus has with that Canaanite woman in Matthew chapter 15
 she may as well have stepped out of this genealogy in order to press her on New claims on the line of David just like Tamar Rahab Ruth and Bathsheba each did in their own way in other words this category of the Canaanite woman gets Revisited in the story of a Canaanite woman who gets very pushy with Jesus and He commands her for it that's it turns out through this is the woman at the well story know what story is this child and she won't let Jesus about the dog Jesus. The point is even out here in the genealogy you have this little introduction of a melody of the role of the nation's in bringing about the Messiah which means that Matthew wants us to keep that theme humming in the background because in the next chat in the birth story of Jesus in Matthew chapter one this is this is famous this is like Christmas Story
 when the angel appears to Joseph and says don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife the child conceived her in her is from the Holy Spirit she will bear a son and you shall call his name you sure which means Yahweh delivers she always saves so you should call his name y'all always saves for he will save his people from their sins if you're not paying attention you'll just kind of universalize this and he will save Humanity from their sins but there's a specific about his people people named like the people of Israel so right from the birth stories get Matthew wants us to see that Jesus is on a mission to deliver his family because the save all people he needs to first save his people correct if you haven't tracked with the logic of the subplots that God chose
 Israel to be a blessing to the nation the sign if Israel's off the rails then kind of save Israel to then be a blessing to me about the Jewish Messiah on a mission to his own people to restore them so that they as a group can become the instrument of God's blessing to the rest of the families of the land that will be at the story that makes sense because the genealogy told me that God is already woven into the arrival of the Messiah all of these different Canaanite women so these women are all very unconventional it how they were used by God Compass the survival of the seed and so that does raise the question of that the president may be this descendant then of all these cannot women will save his people from their sins and some surprising
 counterintuitive way so what we're going to do real quick is just session the gospel of Matthew for this team and we'll see is Matthew has just kept the melody going of the mission to the nation's as a whole is what this is all about and so as you pay attention to when non Israelites appear in the story if it's super interesting but up till now if you're reading it's too late the stories about Jesus coming to save his people that's right we do know that's a subplot to the bigger plot which is Union of all of Heaven in Earth and all of humanity being God's image as the family of humanity but right now this is about an Israelite man who's coming to save Israelites
so let's think about the significance of another famous Christmas story of the Magi the magic yeah the wise men are yes you know my boys that's how they sing that Christmas song these three kings from Orient Are as though the place is called Orient Are Corey and tell her that's why I said I'll just ask me where is Orient Are remarkable for the hyperlinks in the design patterns going on we don't have time to check it but it's quite remarkable that it is sorceress I mean the the word Magi
 they're astrologers and Sorcerers and astrologers is not even know it's like that's that's like we're not talking about like finding out what you're going to go like no no this is yeah these are like Consultants to the king should I go to war or not so I'll let me read the stars and you looking so and this is prohibited in the Torah or Israelites to do this kind of thing but here comes he's tagging Sorcerers from the East who have seen a star with cool is that they come from the East and then there are the treasures in the same as Treasurer you know there's nowhere in the story that says there were how many there were how many beds are there at correct will be just three Treasures that there's three Treasures which has become so what's interesting is that the gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh that list comes right from the list and Isaiah 60 of what you are we supposed to go
 frankincense there oh yeah that's right and then later in the chapter it says they're going to offer up offerings on my altar which can include animals food or incense and so this is a little you know I think it's a Memory that Matthews preserving Joseph and Mary had this remarkable Matthews told it in such a way as to activate all of these hyperlinks to the book of Isaiah in the bunch of other places in song it's so the wealth of the Nations is being brought to the new Temple Isaiah streaming in and then they're going to bring the gifts bring all their gifts to contribute to the the new Temple which is the new Cosmos the new Heaven and Earth place and Matthew retails it so that the nations are bringing their guests for a little bit would you let the baby Jesus because he is put forward as the place where I want that's cool totally cool so just to let you know so his mother
 is this in Matthew chapter 4 Jesus gets baptized and then he goes into the Wilderness in Matthew chapter 3 in form and then after he's tested you know for sure whether he's going to be faithful to his commission as the suffering King and after he comes out of the desert we're giving the summary the end of Matthew chapter 4 and sexually summary that's going to pave the way for all of chapters 5 through 10 Matthews give me some map right here at the next two chapters of the book I'll let you read this paragraph here and just noticed what he highlights about the people who are coming to Jesus I'm at the 4 verse 23 Jesus was going throughout all Galilee teaching in the synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people the news about him spread throughout all Syria and they brought to him all who were ill the suffering with various diseases and pains demoniac
 black dicks paralytics and healed them large crowds followed him From Galilee and the the capitalist capitalist Ellie and the capitalists and Jerusalem and Judea and from Beyond the Jordan and the next sentence and Matthew is Jesus all these people he went up onto a mountain his disciples came he opened his mouth and begin to say and The Sermon on the Mount so this is a this is an international crap this is an international crowd or you would say it's a national will you said it's a multi-ethnic crowd from within the larger region yeah so North to Syria which is still the region is called Siri today but then also up in Galilee and the decapolis to decapolis has a network of 10 sounds up in the Galilee region and Jerusalem and Judea and the other side of the Jordan
 yeah which was which was where that humans were and all of these other tribes is on but not as for lying to so he's explicitly saying that he's attracting to himself yeah I'm a multi-ethnic international crowd from within the region and that's the crew he does is Ramona to yeah that's the narrative setting is that Jesus is gaining lots of attention and so he's going to see the crowds and his disciples came to him and he opened his mouth and begin to teach them which is his I think it's his disciples but the whole point is that it's Jesus has got his crew but the backdrop is both Israel and the nations are these on Lookers so to speak yeah yeah so Matthew this is from commentator Craig Keener he's has has good Insight on why Matthews giving us a little geography lesson here like what why is this important
 to get this information to Craig Tina puts it this way it's Matthew wants his readers to know how widely the word about Jesus bread and he's also interested in the geographical distribution of that popularity by Syria Matthew probably means not the entire official Province but the region to the north North East Palestine although many Jews did live in the decapolis these Jews hearing of Jesus in a predominantly gentle region allows Matthew to point his readers to a geographically expansive Gentile Mission another three points in the gospel of Matthew where there's this kind of like commissioning and the beginning of the kingdom of God spreading it's right here it happens at the end of chapter 9 where Jesus sent out his disciples and will look at it in a minute and then the next step is at the end of The Gospel in the Great Commission where Jesus says go out to all the nations took her is saying Matthew was actual
 where did this in a way to say that even though Jesus is mission is to the family of Abraham you know you couldn't contain it even from Jesus's begin ago the nations were were wanting to get in on the Jesus thing
 when Jesus start talking in The Sermon on the Mount has the famous blessings the Beatitudes you know I don't know when this episode will release but we're beginning work on a whole video series on The Sermon on the Mount yes super excited that is exciting yeah that'll be good that's going to be so cool going to be a so exciting part Series right yeah I think it's still pretty wet videos it'll be and then but you and I are going to crawl through the third light mounts coming I'm so excited so near the beginning he has this moment where he looks at his disciples and what she calls them something in Matthew 5 verse 14 he says you all are the light of the world a city set on a hill camp be hitting me one light a lamp and put under a basket to put on the lamp stand that gives light to every one in the house so let your light shine
 four people in such a way that they may see your good works glorify your father who is in heaven a light shining in the darkness a city set up on a high hill these are both images taken from the book where they are then we looked at one of them so exalted Sion for the Nations and actually in the poem and Isaiah 60 lirette an episode or two ago it began with a rise Shine Your Light has come but now Jesus up on a high hill and his community of disciples are the light in the city interesting well yes although expected I suppose if Jesus is coming to save the Israelites and the mission of Israel is to be the city on the hill correct the city the nation the people whom God uses to bless all the other nations the other nations can stream up and they are going to reflect God's wisdom and go
 that it makes perfect sense for Jesus to get up in front of Israelites and say it is our calling cuz we were supposed to be just the kind of thing you would expect it is where you would expect totally so I just totally that often and if you don't get that hyperlink to Isaiah if it sounds like a pretty word picture yeah this is a fully loaded headed for connected to the the family of God seem so what's interesting is that after Jesus give The Sermon on the Mount he starts to go out and Matthew is put together 10 stories of different people from that list of sick people coming to Jesus 10 stories about Jesus where is either he'll somebody or does some sign or wonder one of them is a Roman soldier who is the course definitely not an Israelite and what's interesting is the Matthew notes how he tells the story pays
 this is on the fact that Jesus is surprised by this Soldier has faced a military leader of the occupying Force the occupying nation that makes life in your ancestral and miserable a bunch of frustration about the police right now real time and they are they are citizens of the same country so imagine like law enforcement around us that are from a different country now telling you what to do and their many people around the world who are in next week. Yeah I imagine yes this is a law enforcement of foreign occupying nation that makes life for your people on your land miserable so they
 persona non grata and he begins to beg bag of Jesus we have a video where I think Rose did the storyboards for the singing I'm Philip I love this how to season the gospel of the kingdom when he comes up to Jesus and just falls on his knee and I thought I'd write such a power and he's like they threw him in this like super he looks like a marine which is remarkable like I'll come enter and all that is real life house I might be not kosher food in there they don't follow any of the Purity laws and the guy says no you don't need to you're like me Commander so just say the word and when Jesus saw this he was stunned and he said I haven't met anyone in Israel with such great trust I tell you many are going to come from the East
 then from the west and will recline at the table with Abraham table from the East and the West Was Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the heavens so the family of Abraham in the table of Abraham will become open to many but he goes on the children of the Kingdom there going to be cast into outer Darkness where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth what is already beginning to encounter here is resistance from the leaders of his his own people it's a country becomes a contrast so here you are representing someone from a different Nation you can come and partake of the feast with Abraham's family but many of Abraham's on children are for fitting it becomes the tragic inversion is that Jesus
 is actually rejected by his own family but finds even a more friendly reception among the nun chosen in the end we're back to that seemed open with the fork and I went to these unconventional non showzen lines God works a surprising plan with Messianic seat that's an interesting way to tell the story it is such a tale story because it's almost like at the same time saying hey here's the divine plan choosing this family it's both giving you the divine plan while also subtly showing you how the plan needs a back-up plan and that there's going to be this massive reversal of sorts in many ways this team was already work in the Hebrew Bible we haven't even talked about the Book of Jonah but maybe waise this is what the Book of Genesis about in the form of that God's mission is to
 Nations nut store you don't forget it Assyrians at but it's God's Own Covenant people who become the biggest obstacle in God's mission to the hands here and there's a similar similar thing coming out here where it will be Jesus is on family that becomes sibling Rivals who want to destroy God's plan
 so in Matthew chapter 10 worst kind of taking to her to Mathews hear Jesus now sends out those disciples that he's trained Through The Sermon on the Mount and foretold in Matthew 10 you give them authority to do everything he's been doing and so he sends them out and Matthew 10 verse 5 he says Jesus sent out the 12 instructing them don't go on the way of the nation's we're on the way of the Gentiles don't enter any city of the Samaritans which is like their half-siblings of the north rather go to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as you go and now it's saying the Kingdom of Heaven has come here just exactly what he's been doing for like the last chapters so it's very clear Jesus had a laser focus but the nation's kept showing up to get in on the party and now he gives the 12 a laser focus on the family.
 restore the family that's why I guess that's not very exciting not this point you kind of work specting it it it is interesting that that those kind of details were puzzling for sure for sure kind of like why Jesus just to the Israelites right now you know the endgame start the endgame and then I think you said we're going to get to the story of the Canaanite woman that one in particular is just kind of like woah just feels really strange that you can Jesus have such a almost myopic perspective when it comes to his his mission right there and then the Jesus has with some of his followers and Matthew 12 with his mother and brothers show up outside of the house for a teaching and they wanted they want to talk to him and I Matthews actually
 leaving out a comment that Mark had where his family thought that Jesus had lost his mind in Mark's version of the story about how they think that he crazy that computes Amy he said he's acting he's acting unnormal so he just wants to focus in on the family Dynamics and someone says Jesus you know your mother your brother's those are outside they want to talk to you it's in a normal exchange you know a normal person would say oh cool can you guys wait a minute. I'm just going to 7 working as a moment to like become the Riddler you know how he does thing and so he responds to the guy talking to them you'd be so weirded out if you were the guy last question Jesus said to the guy who told him who is my mother who are my brothers and then stretching out his hands to the disciples in the room he said
 my brothers and my mother you know anyone who does the will of my father who is in heaven and let's just pause here that's the number one titled Jesus used in The Sermon on the Mount Falcon for the father and the Father in Heaven Father in Heaven the one you means but what does it mean to do the will of my Father in Heaven it means to to live by the teachings that I just gave you a few chapters again so whoever follows The Sermon on the Mount is my brother my sister and my mother I mean so he's got this big view of the family of humanity in mind which is yes I can yes that I mean he would agree she's would agree yes this is my family but his point is my picture family is much bigger and yeah he's on tethering the idea of the family of God from the physical lineage of Israel and participation in the family of God is way
 Beyond physical lineage NT Wright has a great way of putting this in a quote that I've attached to your Society is from Jesus the victory I've got in a peasant Society were family relations provided ones basic identity it was shocking in the extreme in first-century this thing that Jesus to set it for Century Jewish culture for which the sense of familial and racial loyalty was a basic symbol of the prevailing worldview this saying cannot but have been devastating Jesus was proposing to treat his followers as a surrogate family this had a substantial positive result Jesus intended his followers to inherit all the closeness and mutual obligations that belong with family membership in the close-knit family base Society but this was not just extraordinary really challenging at a personal level it was deeply subversive at a social cultural
 political level I still feel the sting of a Jesus says today and you know modern autonomous individual mobile America you know where family belonging is important but not nearly to the degree it wasn't a culture like this yeah to the degree that we still feel this obligation to take care of our our families you know other parents age where as well as our kids are growing up or having grandkids is kind of loyalty to our family and this Society you've got to like 10 x that something as to the degree that that society would have found that as how important family was and there is very good argument that we need to take family more seriously in the Western World then we do now at least we've gone way too far then you get something like this and you're just
 Drake on that and it's like don't take that too far yes they're worshipping family because there's something going on I really feel that tension as well yeah because if you laugh like you said hey I'm I'm going to go with my family and I'm going to go do Jesus work at me like 10 blousy you should do that you know there's how many generations of wounded children are there whose parents you know neglected the health of their own children for the sake of whatever Christian Ministry you know people that were absentee moms and dads and so but it's at the balance I'm not big. Matic about that at all I'm just saying right from the beginning of the Jesus movement there was a redefinition of what the family has and Jesus had a very expansive non traditional view of the family and you just have to sit with that
 there's no simple or easy Revolution there
is another story through chapters later where Jesus is trying to get away from all the people walking to him and so he goes up into a non-israelite region in what Matthew calls Tire & Seed on modern-day 11 on basically and goes into an honest for light City Lights so what Matthew makes very clear is he doesn't mean a woman of Tyre and sidon it's a Canaanite woman what is the specific land of Hill Country down south where Jerusalem and Judea in the northern tribes of Israel call Sarah Canaanite woman and so he's clearly activating the memories from the genealogy Rahab the Canaanite Tamar the Canaanite the Canaanite woman comes up to him and she began to cry out saying have mercy on me Lord son of David my daughter is Harsha laid being demonized
 and Jesus just gives you the cold shoulder he doesn't respond now that act itself is capable of multiple interpretations isn't it so in Mark's version of the story he calls her the syrophoenician woman the women of Syria and finisher which is the region where she lives. Matthew calls her the Canaanite woman perhaps that's where she was from yeah but I think that may be specifically to call out that thing you call out that she's a Canaanite a descendant of the people that Joshua Jesus's name say expelled from the land and Jesus is a descendant of a bunch of Canaanites women so it all comes into this moment of how is Jesus going to relate to how is this new Joshua going to relate to the Canaanites that's the question here so it heightens the tension in the scene so it could be the Jesus as brushing her off with a silenced
 it could be that he is testing her at Matthews told the story in a way that Jesus has motives remain really understated you have to be doesn't say why it says that he didn't answer her yesterday so what's interesting is he didn't answer her his disciples come to him saying listen to sleigh shouting at us send her away then Jesus answered and said listen I sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel never this way said she's not my responsibility in the store is almost impossible to account if you don't get the dual layers of the plotline but even if you get the dual layers is kind of like alright Jesus I get it yeah but can you at least talk to her and let her know this so however Jesus has also did that thing for the the Centurian so why
 we're making a hard and fast Rule now so people have interpreted uses statement and his silence and different ways some people think he's brushing her off some people think that he is intentional kind of like God with Moses and the golden calf When God Says leave me alone but then that's what Moses doesn't do and that ends up accomplishing the will of God which is for the reconciliation with his people there's some a similar Dynamic here where Jesus a silence actually compels her to keep moving towards Jesus even more aggressively a lot like Taymar did we do that and a lot like his did the fellas and yeah actually I remember reading Philip Yancey talk about this is that kids go and he I just remembered him saying he said you just had his tongue firmly planted in his cheek when he said that that was his interpretation
 do you want to engage I'm going to make this interesting yeah one way or another Jesus turns this into a test of her tenacity that Jesus wasn't like this with most hurting people who came to him but he discerned something here that he makes this woman step out on more of a limb than he does with a lot of people ask so she doesn't settle for the I was sent to the lost sheep of Israel she comes back again and lays down in front of him and says Lord help me he answered and said that he speaks in a riddle it's not good is their children sitting at the dinner table you don't take the food for your kids and give it to the dogs
 that was again people have dogs have both negative and positive images in Jewish culture there were very few people it wasn't like the house to Magic Animal the way we think of it you know if the dogs usually have a negative connotation but Jesus uses the form of the Greek word for like little dog tiny dog puppy so it's a contrast between little kids and little a little puppy and you clearly he means a domestic house pet cuz he questioned the priority and so what Jesus does what's a woman does is pick up his riddle and then turn it back on him and she's like but you don't starve your little puppy you know if the kids don't finish your food you give it to the puppy and Jesus says how great is your face or woman you know what do you ask for it will be done all of a sudden Jesus doesn't play hard to get
 like the game is up and all the sudden he's just super open with her what amazing for us to hear what he says in the center in the riddle yeah I know there's more that I need to find your hair in the story but this story is even more scandalous it's it's a hard story because Jesus is aloof for reasons that Matthew least concealed but then he like actually just misses her but then at the end he does give her what she needs is but the story The Last scandalous when you understand this duel a duel storyline that uses does have his laser focus on Israel and so that takes a little bit of the bite out of it but but not completely there's still so much here to Brussels through for sure all of all of the tension but there is something with the moment that she presses in and won't let go.
 is this the moment that he just healed completely he doesn't he's not playing hard-to-get anymore it's something that she just completely flips correct it wasn't like okay you got me what I'll give you a little bit her daughter from a distance that's a remarkable thing that he does this is very similar to some of these puzzling odd stories in the Hebrew Bible that I think are there almost as narrative Parables that there's multiple layers to it and I need to think about the layers in this one more but all the same the point is that this follows this pattern of the life and healing power of the kingdom is leaking out to the nation's even though Jesus is on the laser focus to know
 so here's what we're going to we're going to skip over the Passover week and the passion in our conversation right now what's a passing represents is Jesus's mission to Israel the ghost of the capital city of David the temple he confronts the leaders of Israel and while the Roman Governor an honest reliable is an important figure in Juice view he's kind of a bit player is confrontations with the high priest and the powers actually I just realized there's an important story when Jesus is lifted up high and exalted on his execution thrown the first person to recognize who Jesus is truly is a Roman Centurion who says truly this was the son of God so right through its these Gentiles who recognized Jesus it's his own family who ends up resisting and persecuting killing him and yet even this doesn't for God's plan
 did this is just like the Joseph story about the Joseph story is All About in the Book of Genesis and so noticed the shift at the look at the list just look at the last paragraph of the Gospel of Matthew the Great Commission the Risen Jesus comes up to his disciples and says all authority has been given to me in the sky is normal and go therefore and Make Disciples of not just the lost sheep of the House of Israel but all nations baptizing them teaching them to observe the Sermon on the Mount and I'm with you until the end of the edge Matthew clearly for G the shift to the the mission to the nation's here so you can see right from the first paragraph to the last paragraph and that shift is because he's done the thing for Israel that stuff that's right he's shown I am Israel's King I am the faithful Israelite and I've done the thing that is real has need
 what to do and now that that solved let's get back to the plan which was Israel being a blessing to the nation's threat to know you as an extension of me my disciples go out and spread this so that you know the four gospels even though they were written years after the events in other words the oral memories of all the things that Jesus said and did we're being cold and memorize and recite it for decades and then were put into writing these compositions we called the gospels so the the written form of the gospels is taking place now decades into the mission that Jesus is committing right now Matthew is crafted this account with the knowledge and experience of that expanding mission to the nation's and release stated the theme showing like this wasn't just an about-face Jesus did at the last minute
 it was actually woven into his genealogy the mission to the nation's he didn't even have to do that because if you've been reading the Hebrew Bible correct I think it's easy to get that plan lost in the shuffle because it's not this like in your face kind of theme but the fact that not only is Jesus coming back to that plan you've already seen it was seeded throughout the whole gospels what you're saying Jesus on Earth speak to the the Jesus the people hung out with the first-century Palestine part 2 of this the mission to the nation's is going to be led by Jesus and the spirit and that's the story that we called the book of Acts which is where the family of God begin to expand and create a multi-ethnic and racial tensions the tensions that come along when people have different families
