the Bible wants to explain the world to us it wants to reveal to us the meaning of life it's doing theology it's doing rigorous reflection on the bultema questions about who God is who we are what are the problems with humans what are the possible solutions for a puffins what's God doing about it if anything like that's what it's about but the Bible doesn't do this like a reference book like a theology dictionary it does it slowly with stories and poems that all taken together develop themes that invite us into deep reflection in fact you might be reading the Bible and think this story is a lot like that other story are these details they seem really familiar but did I read something kind of like this before the local stories working this way we're later store is armed
 Don replay and intensify earlier story and it keeps building a feature of biblical literature is that it's meant to be meditated on it asks of us to slow down compare contrast consider and slowly it reveals to you its meaning that you would only get this when you're reading these texts backwards and forwards an up-and-down comparing parts that you wouldn't have thought to compare but once you follow the design cues is aluminex it brings illumination into what it's about today on the podcast I talked with Tim Mackie and Carissa Quinn about the fourth pillar of the Paradigm that the Bible is meditation literature thanks for joining us here we go
 okay we are continuing on this conversation on what is the Bible what is the Paradigm by which we read the Bible to do that Tim Krista and I have been walking through a bunch of notes on seven different attributes that's right over the years of our project we've been working on it we developed the shorthand for how he described the Paradigm write 3 using the Bible that it's a unified Story the least Cheese's describing clarifying what that means which is really cool because I think what we're doing on the podcast and in videos probably a lot of people listen and they like it but think how do I do that two weeks we've heard that in classroom to like I want to practice more and I don't know exactly what it is you're doing or how you're reading that way and so now we're talkin about this lens or this perspective that were approaching Bible with us we're packing that through seven different attributes
 one was at the Bible is human and divine human and divine the second attributes of biblical literature is that it's unified it's a it's a diverse collection made it to Larry Styles been over a thousand years but has one unified story and it's the unified collection the third attribute is that it's Messianic litter and that's one of the key ways that key way it's unified about what is it about that's what we talked about the last episode that it's about God as humans unable to fulfill this calling of being God's anointed rulers of creation and God providing a sign to to do that on our behalf so that we can then join him and doing that and so this is going to be about the fourth attributes of biblical literature which were saying
 is meditation literature and this one this is complicated but also really amazing and I'm really curious how we're going to Wade through it in a way that doesn't leave my mind numb can I just say this to maybe set the stage I think in contemporary culture when we talked about meditation we talked about emptying your mind and just kind of letting thoughts pass through and just going to be a blank canvas that's not the kind of meditation we're talking about were using the word meditation because the Bible uses a word that's translated as meditate in Psalm one specially which I guess you'll show us but it's not the kind of empty your mind meditate and it's a kind of like releasing of the focusing of the mind on something certain things certain thing that will result in wisdom and abundance in life so how is the Bible meditation literature and how does that implicate
 how we read the Bible so we crafted a sentence in the sentence reads as such ancient Jewish literature that is artistically designed to interpret itself and encourages a lifetime of rereading and reflection artistically designed to interpret itself and it takes years of not just reading the tree reading and rereading and then reflecting on what you have reread and we're at that's part of defining what meditation is its Jewish its artistic and it's meditation literature to find out I was re-reading things many times and then reflecting focused and focus why one interesting place to start the conversation on this point is I can't remember if this was just an impression I got from entering in
 I'm a conservative Protestant Christian culture in my early twenties but there was the sense that we Church communities the Bible College I was a part of where you know a lot of things in life are complex and they're even complexities that you think about see ology and God philosophical questions but ultimately do you boil it all down it's pretty simple and just read the Bible face value and you'll get it it'll just tell you what to do and then do it or dictionary I believe it settles it kind of mentality day like you'll be set. It's accessible we can understand it affects our lives so things are good all-around but you wouldn't say that about a Christopher Nolan's film okay alright I just watched tennis
 then I have since been obsessed with watching explainer videos about 10 and I finally am getting it it's it's it's actually a very almost precise example to the way biblical literature work we do I buy him a lot when we talk when you were just talking we're having lunch and you were talking about the origami of autumn sure how I read what you just said yeah but it just made me think of Mike this is how Christopher Nolan right all right so just for an audience and I just Googled him so is the movie where the one whole premise is that the bad guys in the movie have found a way to reverse time and so will the storyline of the movie is a constant going forward then they'll be a pivot and then the storyline will start going in reverse but also forward forward for you the viewer butt back over the storyline
 you just covered in the last 10 minutes and then over verse again and go in the back and so it completely Benz your sense of time cuz you're constantly doubling and tripling back on the same scenes but seeing them from a different point of view and it messes as a linear experience it's very difficult is but if you re-watch it which I haven't done but I've watched explain his of it that walk you through it I can see if you watched it for 5 times you would begin to see it and how brilliant how much thought and meticulous care went in to crafting that movie if you watched it and you took away the expectation of chronology disappointed which many critical reviews are still watch movie think I'm going to enjoy watching a movie in the be really satisfied afterwards you can hit that you can watch it and go what is 3 of a single
 character on the same in the same scene because if you're doubling back and then you double back again will be a moment where there's three of the same character in the same scene and the first time you like how are there three of the same person in the same seen the first time you kind of like I knew what I was getting into it so I kind of was hanging but even still I was not stuff. Okay so here's what's even more and I actually have had my friend also Hebrew Bible scholar David Andrew Teeter cuz I watch the movie with him to explain it to me the concept of these all these inversions is all based off of a very famous Roman a Latin word puzzle that was found inscribed on a wall in Pompeii called the satyr Square this is so perfect for what were you planning on doing all this cuz I just brought a Christopher Nolan on a on a lark why wasn't planning but this is perfect
 listen to the podcast Johnny Krista a Google sator Square
 also I didn't say you are square and all the movie that school and it's right in the middle of the word goodness that's how the thing at the back roads end of the line of five words that are each have five letters is Latin words tenet Opera rotas the whole thing is what do you call that a palindrome palindrome no matter what direction you look at it it's spelled the same words backwards up and down side to side in reverse the song and the middle word is tenant the middle letter is n which you can flip it and so if you look the name of the bad guy in the movie of State or the first one the movie begins with the scene at the Opera a rapper is one of the names of the companies that the key pivot in in the food and wrote us is the Little Machines of people in entered
 access to all my goodness does Wikipedia says the earliest example of the score dates from the ruins of Pompeii which some Scholars a tribute to pre-christian Origins such as Jewish or mithraic and he was showing me something early Christians adopted this because if you take out the letters that spell the word paternoster Our Father what's left is the letters Alpha and Omega
 do these words mean anything and yes okay yes say the words a farmer or silver Arapahoe is a proper name tenant is the word has Opera is work and wrote a sword for plow so the sower or the farmer named the rep oh has or does his work by means of the plow but even that is just a little yes it's a little memory device to help you remember the puzzle the whole movie characters it's all it's a movie that's implementing the inversions and symmetries of time okay sorry it was a long it was already too long of a rabbit drowned the whole point is that the movie doesn't read or watch like a linear sequence of time it'll take you to a scene invert and then you're going backwards through that scene again from a different point of view then we'll invite again and you'll go backwards and each time you go through the same idea or seen you get it
 deeper perspective on the meaning of that I'm biblical literature is designed to work in almost precisely his container which is why how biblical literature Works in that way would you alter the past and in videos through what we call a design design pattern Sylvia stretch of a Biblical narrative was just take narratives right now there's also a poetry but we're each of the stories or scenes in a story are modeled upon and replaying an inverting in some way what just happened in the previous scene I'm trying to think when we would have talked about the Cain and Abel story and how it is replaying and intensifying the failure of Adam and Eve of the tree story about that many different type of Adam and Eve family tree
 read it maybe to memorize it she wants to really think about it and then you meditate meditate on it and then you read the Cain and Abel story you'll notice so all these key words from the Eton story popping up again but never the same always an interesting replay but you have sinned as a character in The Cain and Abel story that wants to consume its desire is for Kane God says if you do what is good you will be exalted if you don't do what is good it's a choice between good and not good like a parent's it's all God asks Adam and Eve like where they are and how we asked Cain like where's your brother to brother blame Shifting the blame shift so I can you redeem your kind of like I feel like you stories are patterned after each other correct that's right and then here's a good example of inversion of the language and ideas in Genesis 3 it's a snake who you suspect of some kind of spiritual being something more than just a snake but
 on the surface and they're out of a snake talking to a woman and she takes what is good in her eyes in Genesis 6 which is at the opposite end stands in a mirror relationship to Genesis 3 a story about the sons of Elohim the Spiritual Beings who see that women are good and take them for themselves so it's the exact same language women Spiritual Beings seeing that what is good and what's taking but in one case it's a woman taking looks good in light of a Spiritual Beings deception in Genesis 6 its Spiritual Beings taking women because this is a picket biblical stories working this way we're later stories are modeled on replay and intensify earlier stories and it keeps building and if they can the last episode you brought up the example of the creation of building where like the first time you see kind of a d creation is out of me you were exiled from the garden so just kind of like scattering that's right going out but then the like
 big one after that is the cosmic water is coming back to D create on day two. Separates Watters from Watters and then the beginning of the flood is about the windows of the heavens opening in the springs of the deep first thing in the separation between the waters above and below collapsed and then you get to the Tower of Babel and again you get this image of a scattering out just like Adam and Eve were scattered after trying to attain to the level of Elohim your name great and on their own behalf they're scattered out it's right and then you brought up how you get into Genesis later in Genesis and you get to Sodom and Gomorrah and it rains fire and that vocabulary of raining fire is supposed to connect you to the idea of training water so it's another right and there's 10 more
 really unique vocabulary items inside story the link back to Unique vocabulary in the floods because you might not put those things together but after you become really really familiar with the flood story and you know the words and they're in your mind and you don't have to recall the necessarily by reading then when you read the Sodom and Gomorrah story you would notice more naturally when words are reused things are pattern on earlier thing is you read sequentially through based off of vocab words that are either used in the same way or in a inverse way so here's here's how it's like tenant or the square is that in your mind when you see that a later story is all of a sudden you're saying I'm seeing a lot of vocabulary from
 the flood story what you are in your mind being asked to do is to go back and upload for the most part these texts were designed for a community that would memorize them like in your mind so you supposed to upload the flood story and then read the Sodom and Gomorrah story as if they stand next to each other and then what you'll find is the stretch of text from the flood story to the Sodom and Gomorrah story is designed as an elaborate chiasm with all the matching corresponding parts in between and then all of a sudden it's like you can read the story backwards forwards inside and out my cousin you mean a sequence of things happened and then it reverses sequence just feel chaotic when you like I can't I see there's a general storyline random here for like why is that repeated
 twice what does a great example yeah that's right but those Stan precisely as mere inversions at matching places in their respective contacts and so where are you get the meditation point is that if I see that ass later story is recalling an earlier one I'm going to take both stories pull them up and then just re-read them read read it and rethink it but now just alongside each other so now go read the flood story and then go forward and read some of the more story as if they are next to each other and all sorts of new things will pop
well when you read them next to each other what are you looking for upload our conversations from how to read biblical poetry the fundamental communication strategy of biblical poetry is repetition of two sometimes three lines that are similar but with little variations so someone how blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the path of Sinners or sit in the seat of mockers three ways to say basically the same thing don't hang out with the rock group the point is look at the matching words walk stand set-up being so just going along with standing positioning yourself among sitting settling in so first you walk East and then you not
 sequential its progression through the sacred Square down the line the counsel of the wicked Council path and seat Wicked centers mockers in your mind you're supposed to take each of those words out of the linear sequence and start them. Them together and cross the line and it's about comparing and contrasting so that little thing we just had with walk Stan's it would only happen if you lift each word out of its linear context and start matching it with what it corresponds to and so it's the same thing with meditate on the meaning of a flood story then meditate on the meaning of Sodom Gomorrah story you'll notice lots of similarities to this human violence there's an outcry that raises up to God so that God has to respond God responds with rain but in one of the reign of water that undoes the creation in the other at the Reign of Fire will God did promise that he would never let it rain in the flood
 first down again so if you ran the flood on Sodom that would be going against God's promise and the flood story God delivers a Remnant goes forward and then intercedes on all After the flood in the story of Sodom Gomorrah God allows Abraham to intercede on behalf of a Remnant inside them so they're similar but they're also really different yeah and so it's in comparing and contrasting that you gain further insight into both the most basic level when you noticed a similarity between to text lots of repeated words are pattern that's what similar what's different and how do the differences move the story forward the differences eliminate both stories this is just the same as compared to think it's the way that you learn about real any reality is to learn about one thing and then there's another thing those are similar but they're also really different everything is a metaphor
 back to that like I said we think we compare the relationship to each other we're all sitting at a table the three of us think about how facial recognition works over the course of a life I see thousands of faces and everyone's similar you can both have noses you both have eyes of hair but then you're all so different and it's precisely the similarities my brain says humans and is in the difference is that my brain says John and so it's a very basic actually way of apprehending reality but this is a very focused its way of focusing using comparison and contrast to help you understand what these texts are about this makes a lot of sense when you think of it as literary art but I think what might feel uncomfortable is that will then to what end cuz I was just like okay I thought about the world a little differently
 or they gave me a feeling or gave me an Insight charge me up whatever like but isn't the Bible supposed to do more than that like it like how is what's the real payoff back to the previous point of what it is about let's go through the points Vine God has chosen the unique vehicle of ancient Jewish literature
 to tell a story that leads to the Messiah and it's a unified collection Story one of the unique ways that this literature communicates is not through straightforward narrative sequencing of either a story or of a a train of thought even though it does have a linear that's the way it communicates that story is through a unique literary style that we're calling meditation meditation literature it's a kind of literature that's constantly doubling back on itself automatically literarily to help you gain deeper insight into each each respective narrative in a way it does is what we mean. In our little sense where he said that the Bible interprets itself the way you know what the fudge story means is by knowing what the Sodom Gomorrah story means that the way you would know what either of the means is by comparing and contrasting them and gives you more insight into each
 the flood story is designed to help you understand the flood story and the flood story is designed to help you understand the Sodom Gomorrah story more and what I understand the story is more and I guess it may be getting to the next at a time which is its wisdom literature review help you understand God's relationship to human evil how God responds to human evil is the customer but also different how God has Mercy is displayed in the stories is someone at all so different the role of the intercessor of the anointed intercessor is similar and different so it's a way of actually giving it's doing theology it's doing rigorous reflection on the ultimate questions about who God is who we are what are the problems with humans are what are the possible solutions for a what's God doing about it if anything like that's what it's about but it's doing it in this unique way different
 how we consume novels and stories and movies except for movies by Christian and so just like watching a Christopher Nolan films can be very rewarding like the first time I watched the mental using the Midtown but you finish it I feel that way but then that's part of the Bible that feel like tenant you watch it and you're just like all the man that feels like a chore I just I think I got it but I don't think I got it there's something there but man I'm tired now and it was an app like it once you just kind of keep at it keep mining it and it was created within a subculture other people who mastered this mastered this way of writing and reading and it's all it's all so clear when you read the literature produced by the people of the Dead Sea Scrolls for example they knew they understood this and they
 right exactly the same one and the way that they will commentaries on biblical books and you can tell that they process the literature in this way the way they gain insights from it. There's rent about to say that the gospel author is Paul they're tracking it will say things are we like have the stories about this or this is now a type of this in your like like like aren't you pushing this way too far. Yeah you wanted something interesting the word type type type type ology I mean Creek the words to pass and it's the standard Greek word for pattern pattern which is repeated pattern is 514 I have it here because I brought this up earlier never the last death rain from Adam and tell Moses even over those who would not mend in the likeness of the offense of Adam who is a pattern or type of him who was to come so Adam is an image of the Messiah
 the failure of Adam puts in motion story and a cycle that repeats creating the need for an anointed representative to undo What atom has done this basic idea is what explains why biblical stories and poetry feel so repetitious often so sometimes overly wording and then sometimes so unclear with lacking Black Sails that you think you would need because the instincts narrative and poetic instincts that we have is modern readers that we have our disfungsi mentally different about the biblical authors conceived of literature and writing writing you by talking about this in terms of like connecting at Stories the stories but this also happens when you're in a story I've seen you show what's this you're in a story and each line of a story is also doing its own little say tour
 weird repetitions kind of given within a story of like you just told me that you're not telling me that again and it just feels clunky but then you see like how you're telling me it again because you it's a mirror and in the center of this is something one of the key word key something he designed like the movie tenant will be like you walk through a set of words and ideas too eccentric and then you walked back out repeating the mall in reverse order see the whole thing and then see what's on the outer see what's in the middle of that you compare the matching parts and he meditate on it that's what someone means when it says the last
 just to make that point you're making John at set this happens on the level of the line but also the letters whole story and story macro story has three sons Noah has three sons of Abraham has Isaac and then Jacob who become 12 of 3 + 12 so you have the one becomes three Adam you have the one becomes three Noah then you have the one Abraham Abram Who Regeneration three generations who become 12 just follow the story and you just hang out that's the number of characters involved and then you blow it out then you got a Moses and the Book of Deuteronomy begins with Moses saying man I'm just running solo here I can't do
 Salon in so he appoints these judges and turns out the judges are going to be corrupt and they're going to fail and so who become the ones who carry on the legacy of Moses 3 + 12 three prophets Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel plus a scroll of the 12th Moses becomes 3 + 12 to get it 131 becomes 33 becomes 12:00 one becomes 3 + 12000 gosh that's like on the macro-level organized on these somebody's brilliant or talk to my friend and a cheater who get who gets this way better than I do you would only get this when you're reading these texts backwards and forwards and up and down and comparing parts that you wouldn't have thought to compare but once you follow the design cues is illuminates it brings elimination into what it's about
so let's go to someone you should have read along time ago to bring me to get out of this conversation so we read the first line how blessed is the one who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked stand and sit in the seat of mockers rather this blessed ones Delight is in the Torah of Yahweh and in his toy he has meditated a day and night which is itself I Got Talent drum that's true I'll just do a quick I've done it and other places but I'll just a guy. Not the most common word in Hebrew and if there's 25 times and it appears and Joshua chapter 1 where Joshua was told to hug on the Torah day and night job says my lips will never speak in Justice and my tongue will never have
 I'm treacherous yeah so this is kind of an active meditation to my tongue won't utter a tree stump an opening line where the nations are a guy a futile plan to rebell against got her scheming scheming the righteous hug as wisdom or not really active but at least it's it's not that passive emptying of yourself it's like this constant uttering when I remember you owe Yahweh on my bed I hug you through the night watches I hung up on you what is he sleeping in this situation I remember you on my bed I forgot on you in the night walk
 brain does at night like the flips over to sleep mode it's just like it's doing its own processing deer. Some 7711 12th I will remember the Deeds of y'all way I'll remember wonders of old I will hug you on your work and Muse on your deed that one and Psalm 63 were both about remembering so not almost like the purpose of meditating is to not forget but to actively remember who God is and in this case remembering what scripture is another one for just as the lion hog has over his prey now this is what the word kind of most technically means right how God is an onomatopoeia
 the discussion hug when I heard that the kind of this from you did you just say that anywhere could be like that if there's a word that means a sound if you say it like in a low Mumble about yourself classic onomatopoeia words are like room woof woof meow meow the words that are spelled like the sound the sound of eating
 so the whole portrait it's a slow quiet murmuring where you are repeating something to yourself as a form of thinking about it and remember chewing on it you put on ya if you put all these pieces together it's a low sound of that animals make but it's what people would do if they're scheming a plan in the corner
 meditating at the night talking to yourself at night I do that or in your hand and this is what the blessed person does was there for a day and night with you by error or the Torah which is often the shorthand for the driveway so you quietly recited aloud to yourself as a way of focusing is hot supposed to gain insight and understanding going all the way back and the result is a life that resembles the Tree of Life in Eden tree you will be a tree planted by streams of water not just yields fruit when it's supposed to but the leaves never fall off like the seasons have no effect on green all these stories and poems would be such a source of Perpetual wisdom that they bring a vitality and life to the mind and heart that will have a discipline focused on meditating recite
 stores on someone there's a school contrast between walking in the step of the wicked still like doing this active Thing versus kind of quietly meditating and how that establishes you as a tree you know I asked you like okay so you're comparing and contrasting and yeah floods Dora vs atem go I'd like to what end and to the end of finding life and actually just you doing the exercise with the first verse of someone really connected the dots for me when you said okay stand sit or know how does it go walk walk stand sit in the house and that progression just started to feel really like more meaningful it's like first you like walking in Direction and then you kind of plant yourself somewhere and then you're like settle in that place and where you doing that is really really significant if you're doing it amongst the wicked and the sinners in the scoffers
 nurses then we're supposed to be doing it is planted by streams of water and then just like meditating on that progression like also just makes it more meaningful makes me want to really think about like yeah what direction am I walking cuz pretty soon I'm going to stand there and pretty soon I may be planted there and like that's what meditation literature is doing is helping your mind the imaginative part of your mind yet really like capture something so that it's meaningful to you and it starts the shape of you and we're being asked to meditate in this way on literature that's designed in this way but to get you to think about God God's purposes me all right yeah so you're turning what's the nature of human failure
 Genesis 12 11 you have a robust like diagnosis of The Human Condition and only a page 12 you know I kind of thing and so it makes you a wise person that's the claim right here early and wise and full of life have a question that this brings up actually I think when you were when you started talking earlier about the numbers 31 become 31 becomes 33 becomes 12:00 and for me and maybe others that feels like watching tenant for the first time like wait I don't what do how do people not how do we not get discouraged by the complexity like on the one hand this is so exciting and discovering a pattern or discovering a comparison and seeing how it works that's like the most exciting thing to me I mean in my field in life but I think it can be discouraging to that
 this is really complex when you start doing numbers like a white boards and that's so I have all the sympathy in the world because I probably should have the number but it also has like number patterning it's an important convention used by the biblical authors I mean the the number seven in Genesis 1 and very clear that patterns of 3 + 3 + 1 + 7 are meaningful to the book authors and they use them maybe it was just flip it and let's just say wherever my current level of understanding is about trying to make sense of the Bible there's always more and the more will likely push the boundaries of what I thought was like possible with literature will almost always pushed beyond my experience with Biblical literature is that it constantly challenged is my assumptions about what it is and like keeps getting more awesome the fact that it's meditation literature means it's
 dika and it's complex yet but it also means when we read it we are going to see everything but that's okay the meaning of the first or even the 50th reading and I think we've also talked about it in relation to like a symphony where it's like you can listen to a symphony and enjoy it and have a good experience or even you little bored because just like I don't know it's going to be repetitive but it's still music and it's still like I kind of get it but then the more you understand music theory and instrumentation I'll stuff it just becomes unpack more more more more so I think reading the Bible can be discouraging but then also just like any good art it should be able to be able to approach it as an amateur and still appreciate it cuz I guess the Hope or maybe on one read through a section
 or a text you notice something and that's exciting and encourage you but you don't have to feel like you have to see it all in that moment for us to hold everything in our head at once and I'm not sure that's how these texts were designed I mean maybe there was a small circle of super nerd Jewish prophets and scribes hanging in Jerusalem. All they did, who paid for all this but like all they did was just readin compose this literature and studying nerdout on word play stuff but for most Israelites throughout most of history of these were text the lived in their minds and they send them and Deuteronomy 6 talk about it when you're sitting when you standing when you walk on the road when you're in your house when you go to sleep when your eyes and they would sing them they would recite them and it was over the course of a lifetime that these texts form for Deuteronomy 6 uses the same language as someone on you when you walk when you see
 it's that's the passage about passing on these things to your children and all your mind The Words which I'm commanding you today will be on the heart teach them to your son's talk about them when you sit when you walk when you lie down when you get up when you said when you walk by then get up but it's the shift of saying when I feel like I don't understand everything it's an invitation to another reading as opposed to I'm not getting it told you I was taught to read the Bible to where would give you its secrets on his first reading and I would get discouraged I'd have a little devotional time and then I'd be like I don't think I got it and then I feel like a failure and that actually makes me not want to read the Bible anymore and had some
 I'm early twenties I just thought you know maybe maybe it's okay if I just read the Bible and don't get it maybe maybe it's shaping me in ways that I don't understand and so my goal isn't to like try to understand it but just to spend time in it just take it in and that was freeing then solve the puzzle for me but like that was the different shift from like this is a Geology book that I need to understand to meditation letters medication literature
so we've had conversations about what exactly to call this aspect of the Paradigm this fourth point cuz meditation literature is not self-explanatory it requires this conversation either is Messianic literature so I'm looking at our notes and I see we've flagged like we thought about naming it artistic meditation explains what aspect of it but it still requires explanation which case I wonder if the shorter version 2 meditations by Nature seems to be artistic in some sense it's a representation of something so super dance literature designed in the unique way of unique cultural style from ancient Jewish people it interprets itself and encourages a lifetime of rereading and reflection
 I want to go down the rabbit hole with this one I take one of your classes in the classroom so Genesis we got three classes in Genesis up now right or is only two up now at all and will have to stop reading story in this way to practice this would be to read one song at a time because the Psalms are so highly structured and their individual units even though I think there wasn't together into a hole so you can look at two lines just like we did with some one first one and you can just ask between this line in the next what is similar what's different with moving forward and then after you do that for each line at the song you can look at the different parts of the song and like from this part this part to the next one
 moving what similar with different it's it's just a good like mental practice I think I just noticed something when you were doing a little meditation but I've never noticed before so I have noticed versus 1 2 3 have three parts opens with three lines how blessed is the one who doesn't walk doesn't stand and sit on the idea there's the lights in the tour of the Lord in the Tory meditates that's a little couple of rain Saturday and then the last line is for them has a plus one who be like a tree planted by streams of water filled with fruit and season with the weather whatever he does a prosperous was interesting and what you just noted and I'd never thought about is how planted is very much a contrast to sit in with a golfer's you like being established yeah I heard that earlier when we were reflecting to I think something you you would said made me realize that like the second half or this first verse 3
 reflecting back on first 100 Penguins mirror each other you can live in such a way that you get planted in the wrong place yeah or you can be planted as a tree of life and what's the pivot between the differences to Middle Line meditating on what your delight and source of meditation is so you can that is a little interesting to just to compare Delight in meditation you Delight in what you meditate on the things that we are imagining things that we love to but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night so you see that those two lines and you ask what analogy or comparison is being made here the light and meditation a three-part design the outer paragraphs marry each other in terms of one ends with sitting and want the third one begins with something planted
 yeah that's a great example of what I'm talking about the sitting eliminates the planting planting mix you re-evaluate the sitting but each one of these three parts that has itself these dynamics that make you sink internal to it about and so on and this visit and this is just the first three verses of thought it's the first half of someone and then the second half so this is about the the blessed one and the second half is about the wicked so then you see it contrasts between those two halves and you can ask that same question was how does her and yeah the one how to relate to the other day and I think the songs provide a really good place to practice break up in the parts start asking how the parts relate and comparing and contrasting so you're at the classes are place where I'm kind of pissed but the good stuff all right so that's meditation literature the next attribute of biblical literature is that it's wisdom literature
 and that is what will jump in next how is the Bible wisdom literature yes I want to help the shift from talking about wisdom literature as one section of the Bible as in like the Proverbs in the Bible vocabulary used the biblical used to talk about all of the literature is described it all this wisdom literature what does that mean what does that mean connected really fast because we're talking about being planted as trees of Life the whole purpose of the tree of life was for gaining wisdom and wisdom is so that we can be God's image in a way that actually brings life and flourishing and so how do you find wisdom and how does the bible give you wisdom let's read the Divine and human unified Messianic story to find out
 next week

 I'm from a little town called Dade City Florida I first heard about the Bible project through a YouTube search actually as an artist specializing in oil painting I was curious if there was a way that the visual arts be used as Kingdom work I'd seen plenty of examples of singers and actors and other creative using their giftings but I wondered if visual art can be just as effective when I found the Bible project I not only became intensely inspired but I was hooked I use the Bible project for my own personal face lock and it's really helped me understand the Bible on a deeper and more contextual level when I love most about the Bible project is the way that Tim's John and the whole artistic team really layout scripture through Visual Arts tree we believe that the Bible is a unified story that leads to do this where crowdfunded project are people like me find free videos study notes podcast classes and more at the Bible project.
