hey this is John at bible project you've been listening to this podcast much you know that our mission is to explore the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus that The Punchy little phrase we use as a shorthand for our conviction about how the Bible should you read the unified story that leads to Jesus but what does that actually mean and what way is that unified is it really just a story and how is the whole thing about Jesus and what about the Bible teaching us how to live good lives and how about the Bible being God's word for beginning a brand new series unpacking our conviction about what the Bible is we're calling it The Paradigm series what is our Paradigm for how to read the Bible a paradigm it's not something so much that you think about it's a framework for understanding reality that you take for granted and then you think within that and so it's actually very difficult that back from your own Paradigm and Pinker
 you have to be exposed to other views of reality and understand them and then understand how your own differs and then you begin to Lexi the fish bowl that you've been slamming on but I've never seen glass today we're going to discuss three paradigms that we often bring to the Bible that while having really good intentions behind them will actually leave us flat-footed when we try to understand the Bible on its own terms these three paradigms are the Bible as a theology dictionary the Bible is moral hand book in the Bible as a devotional grab-bag I call it a reference book mentality in relating to the Bible another words reference books play interesting role in a person's library now there's you know online encyclopedias you know when I get on Wikipedia do usually that I have a question I need I'm confused and somewhere in the Bible does want us to understand God it wants to form our moral character and it wants us to discover in a very personal way
 but it doesn't do it as a reference book The main thing we want to say is the Bible actually is capable of addressing my question and felt need the way that it does it's not like reference book it can actually do those things but in ways that I can take some adjustment it's going to take a new paradigm so emphatically what we're attempting to do is a. A paradigm set of expectations in a view that it is native to the biblical literature itself the way that it was designed the assumptions with which it was designed and created and we're looking for a paradigm that in tune with what the Bible was designed to do all that today on the podcast thanks for joining us here we go
alright you ready I'm ready Bibles unified stories of Jesus remember how that phrase came to be something we say a lot we can reconstruct the genealogy of the phrase in all our notes conversations but I don't remember now another seven years then to the Bible project project and it's also become kind of our mission is to help people experience that yes as they read the Bible and it's easy to remember and marketing word marketing both memorable and it gets something across very quickly right after as you is that how I read the Bible i c b s your Paradigm yeah yeah and then I think quickly you go oh sweet well it's unified coherent all the pieces should work together
 it's a story there's a lot of Buzz about story and centered on Jesus and then that is very beautiful and so all together I think it's like okay other something here if people really last on to it including us and so what we're going to do is really unpack it and make sure that we're really clear as to what that means when you go deeper organization we want to help people experience the Bible a certain way that also raises the question when you hear it how have I been experiencing the Bible is that how I experienced the Bible and if not why not and what does it involve then to engage the Bible this way I'm pleased with it as a tagline for what we're doing with all of our content but it also begs whole bunch of questions than you
 contact bright and as time goes on we'll use it more we realize that we need to unpack it right and I've realized we've been using all this other vernacular sometimes like it's wisdom literature literature and so how does that all work together what do we mean when we use those phrases and how does that fit with this idea that unifies Feliz Jesus so that's what we're going to do that we've worked out at least as far as we consider the moment seven different aspects to what's involved in that short. Murray brakes for calling it a paradigm our approach to the Bible rates the short hand has been for us the Paradigm and so if our mission is expensive Bible to this Paradigm then what is a spare time and like you said is it the Paradigm were coming to bible with and then how do we adjust our Paradigm maybe we should not take for
 I said that the word Paradigm a normal where the people use what is that mean I know it's a it's two Greek words at the compound word from Greek is it looking it up right now and I think it's coming from new me to shower display oh I see if there's a word para digma which means a pattern of model or president or example para the side next to para and dignity dignity to show so it's something you put alongside another thing to illustrator explain it or fill it out that's a little different than how the history of the word but the 20th century began
 be used in the more specific philosophical sense as a logical conceptual structure serving as a form of thoughts within a given area of experience or the 20th century that's worth kind of co-opted so originally just meant to illustrate something I'll bring alongside an illustration help you understand something actually hear it this is an classic Greek dictionary by dalan Scott Cactus the standard dictionary classical Greek so you want to read the New Testament or Homer or Play-Doh is your dictionary pattern or model original use of an architect's model first used in Herodotus interesting and then of examples were models who platonic ideals and platonic philosophy there's reality but then there's these non-physical ideals and those are called powdered egg mass definition
 Paradigm it's not something so much that you think about it's a framework for understanding reality that you take for granted and then you think within that and so it's actually very difficult to step back from your own Paradigm and Tinker with it and you have to be exposed to other views of reality and understand them and then understand how the first and then you begin to like see the fish bowl that you've been swimming and but I've never seen the glass kind of thing left in my way of thinking about paradigms yeah so it would be a really good concrete example of my bring home I don't know why it just came to my I think people understand maybe are you an optimist or pessimist and is a simplification but like you can have a paradigm and understanding of how the world Works which makes you anticipate problems and then get deflated by problems or just anticipate them and why
 stop them practically and so that's kind of would you call that a paradigm yeah it's a set of expectations I bring the reality that have helped me make sense of my life experience right but then sometimes they don't make sense things happen that don't fit my understanding of how the world works right relationships work and then I'm either going to find a way to explain it within my existing Paradigm where I'm going to let it cracked my Paradigm and force me to maybe see the world in a new way. There's good examples psychology human psychology developed children develop models of Human Relationships paradigms from their family Origins and they did we'd all develop our own ways of dealing with grief or conflict you know but then what often happens to a young person in their teens or 20s is their circles a relationship widen and their ways of thinking about relationships that were formed in one
 the setting we not put them to work in other relationships but maybe it's totally different Dynamic and usually that's when people begin to discover new pair that they need to see a therapist needed to see a therapist is somebody outside myself pointing out like what you assume this about people right and it's constantly causing this problem in your relationship why do you assume that about people and that kind of thing well wow that's how I was interesting that a crisis of Paradigm often leads you to need a guide because it's actually really difficult this equilibrating and can be scary and then emotionally taxing a lot of times when I would have very firmly believed Paradigm Shift begins to like Fallout underneath you and then it's like that's right sometimes it does come together in a book or a relationship for an event that just cracks your view of reality I think they're all
 people in times for the mapping slowly over time certainly been my experience so he probably happens different ways for different people I think of a word that I also hear people uses a frame the metaphor of the picture frame yeah and I think Paradigm is kind of really big picture or sometimes if you're just going to a specific conversation or something that needs to be moderated I hear people say something like hey let's let's bring this up this way and another was like let's set this as a boundary of like how we're talking and thinking about this issue then that kind of biggest question is like was there a another frame that would be better right and why this Frame vs. that frame and framing issue actually gives you a lot of control over then how the issue is then it's right disgusting discovered in parenting this is a term amusing I introduced the term reframe in conversations I'm having with
 9 year old son cuz he and his brother already his brother Stephen there in the patterns and he's already operating out of a certain Paradigm of their relationship and so whenever I see a conflict Brewing all like taking the side to be like buddy okay member the reframe you're approaching your brother as if their scarcity you don't have everything you need and he's a threat to you getting what you need. Yeah I think there's enough for both of you it's an abundance. I'm kind of a new frame and we need to refresh and this was College when all this woke up to me I felt like I've been living in The Matrix and it was a feathers or you don't get started helping young adults expose the paradigms of them but to begin to critique them and hopefully improve them
 so was a habit that I learned to develop to self critique can be suspicious of my view Reality by definition it's something you don't know and don't notice about your own patterns of thinking until 3 difficult to be suspicious of your view of reality you have to have your reality like get up and operate when a paradigm is so robust and all-encompassing I noticed that then we start using the word worldview that everything gets attached so your views physics matter who you are and relationships to evening purpose all of it I think that's some point I stopped using the word world because it wasn't self explaining and I just walked in view of reality the little monkeys
 The Theory of Everything we all have a theory of everything that we're operating out of so that's big picture is what we are using this language to do is to say everybody comes to the Bible with a pre-loaded paradigm what it is what it's for how to engage it what to do what constitutes skilled engagement is booked and it's vitally important that we bring out the paradigms into the open so we can take her with them cuz there are some more helpful paradigms that are more in tune with what the Bible is to do and then there are a charitable way is to say less helpful paradigms and we don't so much focus on those so I think it might be helpful to just profile kind of where we've landed with how to pinpoint what are some unhelpful paradigms and then reframe to say we can actually do any of the same things that are unhelpful paradigms want us to do but
 frame was more in tune with Bible
maybe as a way to start I could tell you like one paradigm shift that occurred to me before we worked on this project and then I love for you to try to place it kind of in then our current thinking but I grew up with the Bible and I grew up with a paradigm that my relationship with the Bible is that I should daily been timing it and call like a quiet time and I should be able to read a portion of it and then interpret it and then apply it to my life and then walk away with having a most kind of mastered that section to the degree that and now I get it and now my life is going to adjust towards what I just got here so that was kind of like the task at hand all in 20 minutes or less than my prayer involved or you're like feeling the love of God
 well prayer was at separate disciplined I suppose but I just think it Delia you can put them together I'm sure but yeah but then also there should be the sense of like now I have connected with God he spoke to me and so my experience though was I would open the Bible I would read something and I would just be like what did I just read and I would have so many questions and I would just kind of be flustered and then I feel like a failure and then I would not want to do it anymore and then I would go long stretches of not doing it and then you kind of have to like pretend that you still are because that's kind of like sure we're supposed to be doing and to kind of bear is saying that you can pull it off it's a what hack is to just find that paragraph or that it really does seem to you as if you keep going back to that
 can I get a collection of those and then that cycle through those that's kind of one strategy that didn't become my strategy must have just became like a void it and then be like okay I'm going to try again and then go for it it didn't work out with this was like the cycle and then I'm like in Bible school this is still the cycle even at bible school at which you went to because you thought you could get handle ya get some new and get a handle on it and it just continue to be cycle and so I found some freedom and I felt like this was a really spiritual moment with God and I where I felt God kind of telling me like stopped reading the Bible that way I want you to just spend time in the Bible and that success even if you come out confused lesbian and in the same way that like when you have a good friend you just want spend time together and you're not like you know did I like learn something and I'm going to fly to my life or you know today
 you like taking a step in a relationship and just like time is the point and that it'll work on me without me knowing how it's working on me that's the thing I forgot they like it'll just work on you without you realizing it suggest if you open it up and you read it then that success and that was a paradigm shift for me that felt really really refreshing now didn't actually solve I still avoided I feel if I did it because it was still really confusing it made me feel less guilty before I don't think I've ever heard you say will you decide that way that's cool to know that seems like an important step it seems like some of what you were letting go of there was a lot of internal expectations you have yourself right and I guess of the god that you would meet as you read the scriptures that maybe it was a little less
 like the I don't know a caricature of frustrated teacher sorry what I mean is it sounds like you had a paradigm shift of who the God is that you're supposed to meet if you read the scriptures and that you were losing inside of caricature of like the gods have like a frustrated teacher waiting for you the clue and yeah the number to put a performing and so this is frustrating and you ready yeah that's a significant shift and I don't have to be in control of how I learn this it'll work on me without me realizing and yes we're cuz I kind of like I mean you might know this about me I want to be good at the thing that I'm doing and if I'm not extremely frustrating I just lose and I lose interest if I feel like I can't be good at it
 you can't lose interest in the Bible as a Christian you're not supposed to be allowed to step for me which is kind of like really embracing that I've lost interest in the Bible are becoming like a post Bible Christian before that because I couldn't lose interest but I couldn't Master it and so I just kind of was just like I'm just going to believe that this if I spend time in it it'll work on me so yeah that is a great way to put it from the the Paradigm of a teacher first-rate teacher to just be patient my poor Storyteller articulate. Right now it sounds like that was an important development that I think probably needed to happen before you approached me with the idea of making explainer videos on the Bible in the world have you been in the previous mode I think our our journey together more frustrating or possible cuz you would have been in a different place but it sounds like you had kind of become more open-handed
 Bible is supposed to be in do in your life which may be kind of just may be more open to some New Perspectives that you hadn't really thought about before you speculating it's his to be about the Bible and you probably just didn't sit down and think I'm going to change how I'm thinking it's something that happened to Montecito what happening to it yeah and it was a moment of actual Freedom like sometimes we talked about a Time supposed to be scary but Paradigm Shift can all send it be like wow okay feel a burden released that's true yeah that's right especially if your Paradigm was creating more and more critical attention and it was helping you understand and living healthy way so yeah well we wanted to do then is articulate together what we have discovered about the next stage of a paradigm shift both for you and it
 one that I've been undergoing since I really a first encounter that's probably a year or two in the following Jesus and trying to read the Bible and I didn't have the guilt thing I just had the bewilderment of like I don't understand this but it's hard to actually important to reflect now you know back on what you first thought cuz we just thought develops on something it's hard to really remember but I remember being really compelled by Jesus really stirred by the parts of the Bible that are like the heartwarmers in the one-liners and let you know good stuff about the just so much bewilderment about how all the rest of it the laws and regulations and sacrifices and sex scandals and all of that Divine violence how it all together so they mostly bewilderment and curiosity that drove me but then I met within the first couple years I encountered some paradigms so we just all the sudden like the light bulbs were coming on so regular
 but I just couldn't stop paying to go to school and I didn't for over a decade but that was my long Paradigm development and then in the projects you've been going on that with me so we're going to attempt to articulate where we're at now and what we've discovered and we had some tension was saying is this our Paradigm mile project sometimes we call our Paradigm because we're using it because it's been our experience attempting to do is Adopt a paradigm set of expectations in a view that it is native to the biblical literature itself the way the Bible thinks of itself the way that it was designed the assumptions with which it was designed and created and we're looking for a paradigm that's in tune with what the Bible was designed to do with use a lot of illustrations over the years of like if you think a cookbook is a grocery list
 you can make the cookbook work for you yeah actually that's great grocery list I suppose cuz you you can get groceries that will cook some meals there's a list of food in the beginning of you know every recipe so I could be a guide but it probably won't help you at the grocery store do a number of other things you probably need more than just what's on that recipe so it's not a very good grocery list the grocery list to do a bunch of other things like a grocery list and get you groceries for the whole week notice for one meal you won't get a bunch of other things that you need so we can't give you everything that you need to accomplish a certain purpose but then also you miss apply or misuse what the cookbook is for cuz it's meant to do a bunch of other things than just give you a grocery list so I think that's kind of a silly example but it gets the point across the way that you view what a book is for would hook.
 yeah we'll ship it and how are you pressing when you get out of it that's right and so what is liable to happen is that you'll both Miss what that text was trying to communicate with its own agenda and I'll sometimes and that's sad but then also I'm likely to miss use it as I make it do things that it wasn't really designed to do and it's like a double double whammy so you can think about their other examples but I like the cookbook so that's basically at what are ways paradigms that we come to the Bible with and when I say we what I mean is in different parts of the tradition Orthodox Protestant and Catholic and then within each of those their sub Traditions but there are some common patterns underneath those that at least I've observed and so I think might help real quick latex kind of name of those not to do a big pretty job but just to name them cuz I think we will and you know those of you listening will recognize your own experience with the Bible in some of these ends
 what we want to do is move forward to say what are some of the expectations and a paradigm come to the Bible with the native according to its design that will really eliminate and unpack and it's the Paradigm that we are operating out of his we create all the videos and classes online contents on a project
 yeah so there's three paradigms and you talked about this before we haven't never talked about it here but maybe like an interviews and other podcast of such three kind of less helpful Peridot X and Y find interesting about these three and we'll go through them is I think all three of these played into why I was stuck with the Bible One stock where than my kind of Big Owl I was like okay I don't stop Master it's about letting him asking me but then staged to stock which was like I don't know if that's even working I don't even know if I need this book but I think behind both of those was because I was being driven in some sense there one of these paradigms and I was hitting dead ends because this was the Paradigm there's three is these unhelpful paradigms manifest themselves I have found language but I'm happy with that gets underneath all of them like what are all of them have in common so the language I put two I call it a
 Prince book mentality in relating to the Bible another words reference books play interesting role in a person's Library Online encyclopedias and not way but you know when I get on Wikipedia or when I turn to a handful of dictionaries and encyclopedias it's usually that I have a question I need I'm confused you in some way I'm bringing my question to totally the resource and so I don't read it from front to back right how you treat a reference book a mature relationship with a reference but means knowing where to find the answer you're looking for the answer where the part is it will address the need question confusion and I think that reference book approach gets expressed in a number of different ways three different ways that we've named and the tears the trick is that it's not bad to come to the Bible with felt needs questions we can make sense that you would want to treat the Bible has reference
 I guess that's right I think the main thing that we want to say is the Bible actually is capable of addressing my questions and felt needs but the way that it does it is not like it can actually do those things but in ways they're going to take some adjustment so forgetful approach of this is being introduced to the Bible at the sea ology dictionary a theology reference book so who and what are human beings who were what is got what's good what's bad what's the problem in the world and what people is there a solution what has God been doing how many angels are there so yeah how old is the World by what process is physical processes did the world as we know it come into being how does God make decisions about things operate how do I make sense of suffering or evil
 was he who he really says he has said he wasn't the kind of thing how should we do Church how should we do I talk with my friend who is dealing with this issue in their life. And so in my first year Bible College I went to a couple Systematic Theology classes and that was basically the approach it was like God yes it was and it was like a systematic explanation from this Traditions point of view but is always based in the Bible that it was by turning the pages in The Bible in Reading one sentence for reading paragraph lot of my classes were like cuz she had Anthropologie soteriology like underneath that approach makes all the sense in the world the biblical text is designed to shape my view of reality and of what's true about the world able to have a knowledge
 about something the Bible is a kind of text that is designed to generate worlds and shape our imaginations in our view of everything so the question is what modes of engaging the Bible are going to accomplish that task best and so one Paradigm Shift we want invite people to is that a reference book skill set will not allow the Bible to do what it's designed to do. It's trying to accomplish those things shape our view of everything but not in the manner that a reference book does it's doing it through a different means that we'll talk about that one person can I ask though let's not throw shade but like you can get really Fart reading the Bible as a reference book I mean I was taught in school to do that and there was a textbook that did it still really popular and what's the place for that of course yeah it's a whole discipline in our tradition that has the word systematic theology at the attached
 I think it here's the trick though I didn't get it it's like knowing what game you're playing basketball or tennis and so if you're going to take was designed as a basketball and try and do something else with it it's just good to recognize OK at which we're doing something different we're going to take this basketball and derive principles from it and apply it to a different game with a different set of rules let's not pretend that we're going to play tennis with a basketball let's just recognized created a new ball and we are the ones who are creating it but now it's tennis the soccer with tennis and soccer together is it are you kicking a tennis balls are you playing tennis with your plate as for the sockets is baldy actually have well so you're you have a ball that's a little bigger than a soccer ball but it's yellow and fuzzy like a tennis ball and you kicking it back in your sleep
 specs of your phone talker so it's might be about it and I'll G all I'm trying to say is geology is a creative constructive attempt to take the core convictions that arise out of the biblical story and then to build a New Perspective to address things that the Bible didn't explicitly address so that the texts of the Bible weren't designed to address those things in a comprehensive why ya could also be just cataloging the things the Bible is addressing but in a new way I think the point to call out and that wasn't made clear to me when I sat in my first two snacks y'all two classes that we are remaking the Bible we're taking the Bible and we're rearranging it to address set of topics and in a way that was not the agenda of the biblical authors and so what we need
 is super self aware that the parts of the Bible were selecting to speak to this without question or felt need are actually the faithful connection that we're making cuz it's very easy to take parts of the Bible that we're not designed to address XYZ and then make them address XYZ and in so doing we're liable to either miss you certain texts or tonight not actually hear other parts of the Bible that really are trying to do that but because of my own social location or tradition I have been trained to hear those parts of the Bible I just hear the ones that my tradition is taught me to pay attention to and so it's just a tenuous Enterprise but it's important cuz I think the biblical story is the kind of story that's meant to help God's people move out into creation and have wisdom addressed all kinds of things that the biblical out there's never imagined and never thought to speak to split hairs but I think that the idea here that is it's not a Systematic Theology is a problem it's that
 the impulse if you're do Systematic Theology is to come to the Bible has reference book and then when you do that when that's your frame repair them with the Bible is then you start finding things and doing things that the Bible's not doing and start missing things if I was trying to do but you just aren't saying cuz you're using the wrong frame but then there's that if you're refusing a good frame good. I'm at the Bible is and then you want you as an exercise go away and then try to systematize all the things that you think the Bible has been communicating to you it's a contract that easier to lecture wrap your mind around or to organize it's translating the language and ideas of the biblical story they both went into a new type of language OK Google list of things like that right that's not a bad thing I've been doing it for Millennia but it's just important to point out that some things are lost in that translation effort and that it's
 translation exercise and so it's by Nature going to be a statement of systematic theology on XYZ is it going to be in need of lots of revision and cross-cultural input yeah because it will always be limited to the problem isn't doing Systematic Theology the problem is treating the Bible out of theological dictionary that's right for me what redeemed my understanding of what Systematic Theology is and what it can do was in seminary and it was really just sitting in classes with Professor Gary Brashears mentor to me he's on her board of our project and what he would always first do is pose a question whatever the class of questions are who was the God was the nature of evil and really the class would just be a sustained reflection and reading interpretation of key biblical passages as a whole and so it was a way of merging what we've come to call biblical theology with understand we understand the prologue to John the first paragraph of John
 as a whole is what it's doing now let's draw from that right now what can I say it's okay she and about got a summary about the nature of Jesus in the Adidas humanity and so on I think that's what the best of systemic the emotions have been doing throughout all their history if there's this by product that comes when I Got Talent introduced to read the Bible then I come to Bible as if I would take a very but that's right and I'm trying to find the verse that becomes a group text for this or that it's more just saying what's understand what each project is designed to do and then make sure that we don't overlook a culturally literary sensitive biblical theology approach was thought that what the Bible is drive the car and then let our attempts to systematize it make sure that they are they're always playing what he called second second fiddle something important that just
 means we need to not let the water Harmony Harmony that I love to read have helped me understand
so and if I part of you don't do Systematic Theology that something I've heard you say number is like a word study video where will look at one word all of its uses build up a quarter of the words meaning but usually we fit into the story The Bible so the way that it's written here is that there's a good intuition a hunter in the Bible as a dictionary and that is the intuition is at the Bible should shape my view of reality it was true about the world got myself and others they should we were saying that's what these texts have always done and were designed to do yes but how does it do it it doesn't do it as a reference book or you find the Bible answers and it does it as does it through the medium of narrative and poetry and for Century letters and and then we'll get to this but the becomes meditation literature and look at my phone
 cuz it's just instead of coming with the logical questions is coming with moral or ethical questions so another predominant reference book approach to the Bible is treating it as a as a moral handbook or rule book and you had a lot of traction or experience of this sort of thing but it's tricky because if you pay attention just a little bit you realize there's no consistency in a kind of how that's done to this rule here cuz Paul said this in this letter over here totally yeah and so see how you're saying there's these unspoken assumptions at work we're in each Christian tradition it differs from choosing these are the parts of the Bible that we take his face value
 moral guidelines but then there is a way to explain why that's different than the part to appeal to Outsiders to that tradition whether there are other questions or people who just who don't follow Jesus or didn't grow up around the Christian tradition it's confusing and in christianized culture has historically christianize cultures it's very confusing to people who are followers of Jesus to say times that Christians in public appeal to this book it's usually when moral issues over this moral conviction cuz it says this in the Bible and so people don't follow Jesus that trains them to that the Bible is a moral rule book that's primarily what it's designed to do and then people don't follow Jesus will read the Bible. Often start at the beginning and then they'll get to select the law codes in the Old Testament and they're like what you tell me if this is from your moral handbook you know about stoning somebody who break
 the Sabbath or whatever so if even inside and outside the tradition feels inconsistent people can sense that pretty easily that's my liability and moral handbook my tradition it was with the Old Testament laws there was kind of this understanding of like you're not doing those things all know even though it was like but that one there except for the Sabbath but there was certain ones in there that we're really important to point out but then obviously the other ones you just like course not but then where I got a little bit more strict was New Testament letters in the New Testament ladder sure that's a rule but then even there you were fine opportunities to kind of get a little bit series on how to read the New Testament letters at length in the same letter you'll find greet one another
 in the church with a holy Kiss drink a little wine don't just drink only water and also appoint deacons and elders and you know it's like all these instructions and which ones are binding from The Book of Psalms are really strong impulse to want to have the Bible help us decide what is good and bad because we don't want to go off the rails and there's this this concern of like if you don't treat the Bible as a rule book or if you can't at least find enough rules in the Bible that keep us in the rails and it's all going to just fall apart we've been problem at izing this approach to its name what does also has a right intuition underneath that the Bible the texts that are in the Bible were designed to give instruction and guidance to God's people about what is right and what is just and what is good and beautiful so that people can live in a certain way in the
 the vision of what it means to be human righteous is a set of texts that are designed to shaped people who know how to discern what's good and bad and without a doubt that's what they're designed to do and they explicitly talk about that what we're talking about is how you engage the Bible to help it do that in the life of a person or a community and worst thing as a reference book what do I do in this situation turned to this page turn to the sentence that's not an approach that engages the Bible the way it's designed to do that that's what we're saying and not saying and this one's really scary because the fear is that if you approach the Bible in a different way then we're all going to come to our own conclusions but is actually right and wrong and then what it was even mean that the Bible's Authority maybe I can make it say whatever I want to create whatever rules I want out of there and that has been happening in history of Judaism
 and Christianity all along and it has forced people both to listen to each other and together listen to the guidance of the spirit in concert with listening to the scriptures and it has been both a unifying and separating experience throughout tuition Christian history and Sophia points all the way back to whatever moral or ethical Guidance the Bible is giving it's not a systematic statement of that as such if it was it would be a lot more clear to a lot more people throughout the less you know the ammonia so the way that communities get moral and ethical guidance from the scriptures is a dynamic process and the way a given tradition has developed a way of doing that it's very easy to think. That's the way it ought to be done and I just think there are better more helpful helpful ways that communities do that but it is a dynamic process process
 would you say that the Bible does have an agenda and the process should be aligning us with the agenda that the Bible has the community wants to align their lives here is a playground go explore and then come back with whatever you want first story of humans in the Bible is about who gets to Define what's good and what's bad and God gets humans are God that's what the whole story is about about producing people who can discern what's good from what's not good and the Tourette's self the Bible itself was thought of as the tree of life that supposed to bring you to help you understand absolutely no moral or ethical formation of people in their character and of communities and how they live in the world but the question is how do I get the Bible
 has a handle of treating it as a rule book will get you that allow the Bible to do what it was designed to do all sorts of traditions with all sorts of positions do you think that if we all come to the Bible reading it and it's grain through the correct Paradigm this will align more and more should it because the Bible doesn't jenda right shade if it actually is telling us what it means to be truly human what it means to really be righteous what it means to do right by the garden others to be rescued by God all these things it really has a clear stance then yeah we do should be this alignment happening for sure however the communities that are going to embody that ethical Vision that moral Vision what it means to be human will be a whole bunch of diverse Expressions because the Human family there's so many different cultures it does seem to me
 week or Universal convictions that are kind of cord to the human nature and experience as a rule in the Bible does Moses kids and it's also a rule we live by and it's a rule that you would anticipate every Christian and any contacts no matter what should always live by so then I'll send your kind of like oh well then the Bible does have rules and so I need to find more of those in the Bible do not murder so is formulated as a moral guidelines in the Ten Commandments Jesus himself quotes it says there's a lot more to give these case that is examples about how anger and dishonoring people publicly making fun of them call them then evaluate them a happy little thing language that this it
 is akin to murder and all the sudden do you like well is there a rule anyway or of don't ever make fun of somebody belittle them seems to be with Jesus is getting at now we're to the question of aerobic tells you what to do wisdom literature is about forming certain kinds of people who needs in Rubik's because the spirit and the core conviction that are expressed in different rules are written into their character I think this is the vision of human beings that Jesus was trying to paint it just what we call The Sermon on the Mount does with that room I do not murder kind of shows you that if you just you just come and go kid has a role did not murder and then I'm going to not do that thing I'll be good let's meditate on it what's underneath that and now all the sudden it's not just whether or not you're killing someone it's how you can see the language you use towards people become a rule of life of a weight of mono
 during our behavior and we're honoring the Bible That's wisdom literature does also and a narrative and meditation literature is recognizing there is a lot of other ways the Bible address is murder that are through moral rules Cain and Abel begin the major motif of depicting violence murder it's a profound exploration of the meaning of murder and then follow the train about Motif Through The Narrative of Genesis to 2nd Kings and it's a sustained meditation on the problem of violence and murder in human human communities and if you don't have radar to know that there's a narrative exploration of this idea this moral issue if I'm only looking for rules I'm going to miss out on all this other stuff to buy was trying to say because I was looking for a reference sentence for it so that's a good example of how using the Bible as a rule book will all miss out on what other things the Bible is trying to do and then I'm likely to not even
 used correctly the more rule cuz just taking the Ten Commandments statement at face value Jesus himself shows no it's so much more underneath that I've been a few days before where I'm kind of working through this and certain Traditions Protestants Ghibli Twitchy when you like the Bible is not immoral handbook and what we're not saying is the Bible isn't trying to shape our view of what's right and wrong we are saying that question is how does it accomplish that goal and it actually does it in ways that many Christians haven't even talked to imagine yet in powerful ways but we need to learn how to not hear the music to speak
scary I think for four other people may be an illustration is as a teacher I'm I've been thrilled to discover the world of digital white boards for sale chalkboard when you have white boards and now then I get better director screens that was an overhead projector. Yeah that was Next Level so I give me your favorite like digital drawing app this app called procreate so I use it as a digital whiteboard for just very do you know simple drawings of someone but then a couple of her showed me stuff they've done running artwork and I realize like oh I'm using procreate it as a whiteboard out of but I'm nowhere near tapping into the true capabilities of this time but I'm using it it's working I use it and it works good for what I needed to do so what we're saying is kind of like that that's between the Bible is immoral and book you can make it do
 those things but you're going to miss out on its full capability and likely probably miss use it on some occasions with that Paradigm approach may be that we have lost weight and I think there's also a fear that this is just an excuse to reintroduce numerals that are more socially acceptable or more palatable instead of just being firm with like there's just certain things we need to have rules and convictions about that are going to be easy there is a whole other Dynamic that is actually treated in the storyline of the Bible which is that the way God's people Express faithfulness to God has developed throughout time because God is working in and through people in their cultural context and so the idea that gentle non Israelites who might eat foods that have been sacrificed other gods but that like take them home and have them that was such an appalling idea for
 I'm at the earliest Messianic morally repugnant you did not just like theologically you know a sense of morally offensive that was something that was a paradigm shift that the spirit has really communities through and so throughout church history different Traditions have developed different views about how that process works some traditions think that that Dynamic and development continues apace and some say it continues up to a certain point it doesn't shouldn't continue at all since you know the statements of the Apostles in the moral guidance of a gift and so that the other territories that we're not trying to get into so much I think we're trying to just say is let's honor the way that the biblical texts are designed to form people's moral World Views and what traditions and people are going to go do with that moral worldview that would require somebody with a lot more knowledge of church history in other than a Mexican just us but it's at that's an important conversation
 it does but I guess what I'm saying is this Paradigm and we haven't really gotten to the Paradigm but if it's not a rule book and I can't read the rulebook then what we're saying is more giving an opportunity for people then to design new rules new rule books potentially and what I heard you saying was then the Bible doesn't give the guard rails for when you stepped out of line or not got it okay if that's what you heard me saying that that's not quite what I'm trying to say I think the Bible does provide a vision of yeah what is the good and the Beautiful but it provides it within a cultural framework of its author's name of the ancient Israelites and really Messianic Jews living in the first century so the question is how do we appropriate their framework and language in context they're totally different and totally different culture and time and place so it's not a free-for-all but it is how do we embody faithfulness to that mall
 call vision of the biblical story and historically it's just a fact the Christian communities who pledged their allegiance Jesus who believe the scriptures give us a word from God but they disagreed on certain aspects of how to embody that faithfulness in a different setting and that's just a fact of church history and so you have to say either something's broken with the Bible that it didn't provide us with that Clarity that's where a lot of people go has big tits the Bible where they say the Bible is providing a moral Vision but in a way that's different and has given birth to some different traditions and how how they go about the turning right from wrong well isn't there also the position you're just not taking the Bible literally enough some traditions have that view but it's my conviction that if you probe far enough every tradition has its own incoherencias and idiosyncrasies that will show that it is itself a tradition yeah we're getting into a controversial territory or I suppose and it just is what it
 but I think it's very it requires a lot of humility for leaders in different Church Traditions to be careful that we don't just assume that my traditions reading the Bible is its face value very clear meaning ultimately at bible project what we want to see is human flourishing for there to be Shalom and New Creation through the power of Jesus and being faithful images of God and images of loving God by loving others but I think the suspicion and worry is that if you're not going to smile as a rule book then we're going to start deciding what's good and bad on our own terms and it can just spiral out of control so fast you just watch it like as soon as you do that than this is going to happen and its pouch for a spell and now just we're living in debauchery and how you can flip it over and you can say
 also highlight how a certain tradition has developed a whole way making sense of a certain moral vision and then being very rigid about that and then without realizing it or maybe while realizing is doing all sorts of terrible harmful things to people and not even thinking about it cuz it doesn't fit was in there. I'm and so of course they can play on the world stage right now is Protestant Traditions you know the European American white dominant Protestant Traditions that elevated personal piety personal morality is a sexual Integrity all the while you know propping up with the Bible propping up cultural institutions that were killing and enslaving people and so is that kind of thing if we can see that now with some kind of clarity what are ways that my tradition is doing some other kind of analogous thing right now that's what I'm just saying we just needed for humility
 the humility to just say I can't just assume that my traditions reading of the Bible and specially if it is a moral handbook reading is has been dropped out of Heaven every tradition is going to introduce Distortion into the moral vision of the Bible and so we need to pay attention to church history of different Traditions people who different than me and trust in the spirit will guide got to be cuz history hasn't stopped and God still at work in the world guiding people in the new Uncharted Territory the question is what story is giving that guidance and that's where I'm at now this question that I'll be working on for the rest of my life but I think my definitions question God's people have to be working on for the rest of human history cuz that's what it means to be human right yes I do the land and Rule it as kings and queens and be stewards of Creations to go in the new Uncharted Territory
 I don't think it had so the last in third aspect of this reference book mentality we've called I think you probably came up with this raising but that the Bible is a devotional grab bag so the Assumption underneath is the Bible exist and I should write intuition the Bible exist to connect me not just to ancient people and what they were trying to say but to the presence of the Living God and of the spirit of God in the presence of Jesus put me in tune with that living one to help guide me in my life and community in the world to be joyful Discovery fun learning challenged epiphanies to overhaul your view of reality and connect you to the Living God in a personal way totally what is tonight to do the question is how does it how does it do it
 cuz I have a very personal and I've kind of back down on being so dramatic about how to talk about this cuz I have my own favorite parts of the Bible and there are times when I go and read those favorite part is they remind me of things that are true and real and I feel the warm fuzzies and so on but the trick is that becomes my main mode engage in the Bible I go read that paragraph or just that sentence or just that part of the page but I make sure not to read too far cuz like further in the paragraph is that one really crazy thing is I don't know I don't know what to make of that until I got with that but that's the devotional grab-bag intuition but poor execution because the execution becomes pick and choose and when you do that you lose the thrust of what the horse unified story was just trying to do or the whole paragraph or the whole story it was a whole letter poem right upper whatever it is and so all three of those The Logical dictionary moral handbook devotional
 I bagged the three different ways of tree in the Bible as a reference book ever heard you frame it that way which is really nice and that's what we're going to jump into the short handle uses unifieds to relieve Jesus but that Bagel a question was that mean and so will jump in to unpack that kind of book is the Bible we've developed seven not intentionally it just turned out to be seven aspects that are important to what we mean by the unified story at least Jesus so what's a turn into that thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're back continuing this discussion on Paradise if the primary way at work in the world through the spirit is through people then it makes all the sense in the world that God's word would be communicated through a human word and the human words are not incidental do they
 are the way the Divine word is is communicated it means I shouldn't go hunting for an explanation of the Bible's Origins that can't be traced to any human Agency for that can't be explained historically is the dead end the Bible doesn't need that kind of origin story to bolster its Divine Authority that's not how the Bible presented itself Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts Zac mckinlay is our editor Dan demel our senior editor and Lyndsay Ponder created the show notes we're taking questions for this Paradigm Series so if you want to ask us a question we'd love to respond to it email your questions to info actually the Bible project.com try to keep it to about 30 seconds or so and let us know your name and where you from the Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit in Portland Oregon on Mission our Paradigm as you will is to experience the Bible as unified story that leads to Jesus and we're able to do this and give it away for free
