we're tracing the theme of the anointed anointed as a practice of smearing oil on people and sometimes places it's a symbol marking a person or an area have a place where Heaven and Earth to be nice day we're talking about the anointing of Israel's first King Saul and then King David and here's with surprising King saw the first anointed king becomes the first Antichrist in the Bible the Greek word Christ is the Greek word for anointed one so the anti-christ in Santa I know it's fun and what's interesting is the first anointed king in Israel's history actually becomes the biggest obstacle to the anointed king that God wants to raise up but it's David his replacement so solid becomes the first and I invited so I was given an opportunity to lead as real as the anointed but he fails to trust in God's word so God picks David instead David is Anointed privately and he spent years
 Republican we think and this begins an important idea within the theme of the anointed for the anointed one must trust in God's word patiently even want to leave the suffering you have anointed one who's given everything they need to succeed but their moments that are going to need to trust and Trust God's wisdom and then solve case he doesn't first and then he stopped but I hear David and he not only succeeds where Adam and you failed consulted that too but now David is succeeding where saw failed test after test and that's all becomes the test and David refuses to exalt himself to the public place of God's anointed one and remember God's anointed one is supposed to crush this is snake so tall and become a snake should David kill him in other words what do you do with the snake if the snake is your brother portrait of the anointed one takes a
 big step forward in the story of David whatever it's going to look like to stomp on the snake sometimes it's as simple as to why you no kill the bad guy but what is the bad guy is the anointed one saw your brother what's an so the true victory of God's real anointed one is to sit patiently and wait through suffering even suffering that comes from your own brothers and allow God to elevate you to the place of rule and to trust that God will bring about the downfall of your persecutors today Tim Mackie and I explored the theme of the anointed in the story of Israel's first King Saul and David I'm John Collins you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 hey John hi hello hello and welcome to another conversation I get to have with you hundreds hundreds of hours and I've learned so much and probably should know ten times as much as I actually do with the amount of hours the number of pure minutes we have logged back and look at series we've done notes from previous podcast series and it's like wow it's so none of that's in my head right now I have to look at the notes and then it uploads. So it falls out your ears of the anointed anointed yes so this is been great we've been talking about that there's a ritual and which in the New Testament We Came Upon it where
 this early first century Christians for smearing oil on each other and each other like that's kind of weird praying for God's healing power Delta transform somebody and heal them and it's a beautiful thing but then the practice of loyal and someone where'd that come from to start racing that whole idea and it brought us back to in the Hebrew Bible the ritual of using oil but it was very specific not for just healing people are just kind of like having prayer sessions it was to select someone and anoint them meaning to commissioned them appoint them as a representative for everyone else you're marking them as like a Gateway Between Heaven and Earth a guy that mediator someone who whose feet are on the ground
 but who can stand like bring the Divine down to us and key for that was looking at not just the people who get oil poured on them in the Hebrew Bible but also the places anointed for smeared with oil and over to that we looked at cuz they are the two of which is the rock that Jacob pores oil on where he had a vision that heaven and Earth are connected in that spot and then the Tabernacle with the tent and everything in the tent around it. The super special oil smear dirt poured on it and it marked that as a heaven on Earth place the Garden of Eden
 spot workouts presents overlaps with us some more abstractly didn't even just a person it's just marking place there's a portal to heaven can be a walking talking bridge between Heaven and Earth in the form of a prophet or a priest or a king to the three people associated with anointing in the Hebrew Bible or it can be a place that's a place of Sacred Space and Jacobs case it's a place called The he name is Bethel House of God and calls at the Gate of Heaven but then the Tabernacles portable so you could take out anywhere and as long as you always glory is inhabiting it as a tour through the Wilderness any place can become a heaven on Earth portal based on where y'all at wants to set up camp yeah so you showed us how Moses gave very specific ingredients and recipe for some anointing oil
 who makes you wonder like how was their medication shaped in such that they were like you know what we need to use well yeah yeah yeah summer some oil and not just any oil oil oil with Cassie and fragrant Kane the logic of that she brought us back to Genesis 2 and we looked at the symbols and the meaning behind God taking land and watering it for me man forming the garden and so there's you know the Water of Life being instrumental for the creation of life but then there was one more ingredient for humans and that was God's breath breathing into the mud the clay and so we just talked about kind of beauty of this image of spirit combined with water
 great life Water of Life and spirit and what better object lesson I suppose what better item to represent that then oil because it's the life of a plant the water of a plant with all the life in it boil down into like maximized it as a way to think about what does it look like when a spirit and water comes together it's kind of cool image for that yeah that's right in other words in the Garden of Eden God provides the water from the ground that irrigates the dirt one so that the form of the human can be made out of the mud and then so that the plants can grow up
 so Water of Life is key for the growth of life but for human life you need more than just the Earthly Source the water watering the dirt you need a Heavenly source and Knots with the spirit or the breath is from God and so water giving life and the spirit bringing life to humans become joint images and that's foundational because that pairing for that analogy between water and breath spirit from God Is Fundamental to how the biblical poets in the song from the prophets and then just estimate all talk about the spirit as liquid liquid life which is actually kind of a weird way to think about the spirit because the spirit is breath or win right and so why would you start talking about when their breath with a metaphor of liquid liquid clearly not liquid it's like a fundamentally not liquid
 each other the effects of water are like and compared to the effects of the spirits in the Garden of Eden story so that connection in that story provides the foundation for why the spirit describes liquid threatened to my order on you you could be filled with the spirit these are liquid metaphors right so the association of water and spirit is like images and then what better liquid to symbolize that life giving energizing spirit that fills a place on Earth with the Heavenly presence of God what better liquid then Kool-Aid country Delight
so you got me two times I do remember country. I was like a lemonade would not want a spirit I like to water and sugar drinks from my childhood thank you for that that was impeccable timing sorry and vegetable oil I mean sort of olive oil which is the seed of the tree so the seed is the life out of you squeeze that life seed of the Olive Tree and out Comes This Dance liquid that has so many good things to olive oil becomes a liquid symbol of the Water of Life which in Genesis to set on an elegy to the life-giving heaven
 conveying spirit and what it's used in Hebrew Bible it's for people being set apart you got to like a lead in some way as an ambassador a what's it what's the word you want to use representative is there's one particular group of people within the storyline of Hebrew Bible think it's called the anointed ones and that are associated with the energizing power of the spirit and those are Kings of kings and then specifically the kings that are David and Solomon and then the Kings from the life David so we're going to focus on right now is actually the Rivalry between the first anointed king saw and they're going to see how he becomes the anti indicted the Antichrist
 Greek word Christ is the Greek word for anointed one so the anti-christ that one it was interesting is the first anointed king in Israel's history actually becomes the biggest obstacle to the anointed king that God wants to raise up that is David his replacement so solid becomes the first anti anointed and that's what we'll talk about right now Shelly Scott
so quick backstory from the Torah Moses anoints the Tabernacle in the high priest and the first person called the anointed one and Israel is actually the high priest of Israel Aaron's brother and so that's true throughout the tour Aaron is the anointed one he represents all the people forgot once Moses dies and Aaron dies Aaron son start becoming the high priest but the leadership of Israel moves on to the shoulders of a guy named Joshua and the Torah concludes in the last chapter Deuteronomy by telling us that the spirit God Spirit it was empowering Moses passed on and entered into Joshua this is Deuteronomy thirty-four
 so Joshua he's like the heaven on Earth person he's empowered by God's Heavenly spirits but you know there's no story about him being anointed he's not called the anointed one was just as far as you know the priest for the anointed ones but they're not ever called that in the Book of Joshua once you get into the Book of Judges after that Joshua dies and leader after L God raises up and what we're all told us that God's spirit will come upon and Empower these different leaders for a time. Like Gideon or Jeff Sampson these are the judges and so none of them are anointed none of them are called King but they are leaders that got them powers for a time and place or any filled with the spirit yeah that's what I'm saying the spirit the phrase has the spirit of God Came Upon Gideon right before he's about to go in the bathroom or something like that and then it'll Empower them but it's always temporary and for a. Of time so when you step in the book of Samuel the people do
 have a king but they want one and so they approach the judge the prophetic ruling leader of the tribes of the time and that's the guy named Samuel was more of a profit figure and that's a whole story we explored some of those Dynamics in her firstborn podcast series on the first so I want to talk about for this moment it's just to start our story right now with solve being anointed to become king the people ask for a king and God leaves this guy song from Tribe of Benjamin to meet Samuel and God says to Samuel he's the guy so in 1st Samuel chapter 9 verse 16 this is what God says to Samuel this time tomorrow I'm going to send you a man from the land of Benjamin you must anoint him
 as the leader Over My People Israel and then in 10:1 when they finally meet and they've had few conversations Samuel took a flask of oil and he poured it over his head kissing him saying has not Yahweh anointed you as leader over his inheritance so that's solved being anointed
 just later like a few sentences later what we're told is as Saul turn to leave Sammy out like he just got oil put it on his head may be amazed hair shiny any kind of like massage today in your filling in the gaps here give it to ya but give it some volume on here but then right really just meet you there so what we're told is he was walking away and he's on his way to a place named give you a which means I place and he meets this group of prophets and the spirit of God rest upon saw and he started prophesying along with this band of prophets you skip the 1st but that turned it over to the park on his heart God changed his heart yeah you skip that on purpose well it's cuz it's Rabbit Hole okay
 yeah that's why I skipped it but God turned his heart over yeah. I say interesting seeing the heart of Saw is a Fickle and it keeps flipping back and forth to his is salt a part of God's Own Heart God chainsaws heart something similar with Saul's heart that's an analogy with the heart of pharaoh in that case of scroll that's a whole thing install story but we don't have time to get into the point is that right after his anointing of the Heavenly power and presence of the spirit fills his mind and heart and body such that he actually begins hearing the words of God and speaking of Brothers, side with the procession of prophets how many prophets do you need to make a procession good question maybe just 34 bottle how many prophets were around like on a given day in a given place in Israel no information about these things
 cenotes anointing with oil is coordinated with the spirit the spirit of God coming upon him so just like in Genesis chapter 2 the water the liquid that God provides to saturate the ground to prepare it to become a vessel for the Heavenly Spirit to fill the ground and appoint the royal priesthood human who will be God's representative at all Genesis to all those images are being associated hear the liquid poured two appointments King and then the spirit coming to empower him to do so now saw it set up as a new I can do Adam I do human the next story this is so great man
 no there was a guy named snake first Samuel chapter 11 is what I'm reading here literally snake in the house the ammonite went up that's not like us where the sound like snake that snake a guy named snake translations don't translate his name where to find the name but it's the word snake exact words as in Genesis 3 so this guy named snake boots from the ammonites or her he came up and Camp against this town in Israel llaves give up this isn't a rival Nation do you have a Knights are the ammonites there you know distance siblings of the Israelites one of the sons of lot and his daughters from that night in the cave at the end of Genesis 19 on the m b, the moabites and Avenue B R O okay
 the ammonite so I'll be also in the Genesis 10 table of Nations know they come into existence after the song or story so far the Rival sibling tribes of Israel made war on this Israelite town and the people of lavash say to snake make a treaty with us and will serve you and Natasha the snake the ammonite said
 on this condition I will make a treaty with you all buy gouging out your right eyes so I will disgrace you within all of Israel from this is the surrender terms I'll let you surrender either I'm going to kill you but you got to make yourself Place rather so Josh the couch or the I recall that in the Genesis story blindness and site are key images associated with what the snake snakes roll your eyes will be open snake says no and the day you either that you won't die your eyes will be opened and you will become Elohim or become like a love him and today they eat of it their eyes are opened and what they see it is that they're naked
 so he's essentially saying that they are blind and that he has the key for the rise to be open now here's a guy named snake going to Blind their eyes soon as they're great examples these are all the leading very creative hyperlinks to the Eden story so it's all if I can do Adam Wright appointed through liquid and spirit and now there's a snake in the garden what are we going to do so just then solve 5 was coming in from the field behind the cattle and he said what why is everybody crying today what's the matter what's the matter with everybody that he didn't see the snake out they're camped up against the city so the people told him about all the words from the man of the last year from the city
 and the spirit of God rest upon saw when he heard these words and he became angry so you've got a guy named snake and he said I want to bring public shame on all of his real that's what he said about the eyes and when Saul hears these words of disgrace spoken over the people of God is real he hears it gets angry spirit of God comes upon him so he mustered all the people at basic the Israelites were 300,000 the men of Judah were 30,000 12:50 notice the repetition of the number 3 V 3 here and he said to The Messengers who would come this is what you should tell the men of the obvious Gilead tomorrow
 Deliverance will come for you when the Sun is hot so at the height of the day will be your rescue and so the messages when they told and the men of the obvious Rejoice so the men of y'all is turned and sent Messengers to snake and they say you know tomorrow can you wait till tomorrow because I think tomorrow
 Google can I see you tomorrow and you can do to us whatever is good in your eyes that's right from the Eden Eden story yeah good in your eyes so the next day solve put together all the soldiers in how many divisions 33 division this is part of how the motif of the test or the ordeal 3 symbolizes test often when you get into the ordeal I like that the ordeal in other words the belly of the whale Melody works so the later biblical narrative art design and in order awesome to be patterned after the order of the early chapters of Genesis and so you had a new Adam established in the garden snake appears and that snake the appearance of the snake creates a tester a choice for God's appointed one right in three represents the test and oftentimes sings the number three
 what patterns of 3/8 * 44 * 43 hundred thousand men and thirty thousand soldiers Judah placed in three divisions they went out and they struck down the ammonites that the heat of the day and it happened that the remainder were scattered so that not even two of the sneaky ammonites remain together so all the people came to go go and they made Saul King before the Lord and gilgal now offered sacrifices and everybody Rejoice this is a story that won him over in a way no other words saw has been privately anointed as king and Samuel put him before the people and the people say that they want him and then this battle happens so it's his victory over a guy named snake that qualifies him a
 size of the people to say yeah we want you we want to Skype you so this is the rise of Saul and it's just on the retelling that I just summarized you're like yeah I think we got good work with us he overcame literally overcame is a good hiring decision a snake so what happens from here installs story is the sequence from 1st Samuel chapters 12 through 15 and it's a series of failures of saw two major ones and you'll just have to trust me the language in all of these stories just goes right through the language of Genesis 1 through 11 again except when you comes to each of those two ordeals our tests again he failed both
 and so in 1st Samuel 15 when he fails both of those test this is what he told by Samuel the guy who anointed him for Samuel 15:26 Samuel said the saw you have rejected the word of Yahweh and so y'all has rejected you as being king among us around
 a Samuel turn to go saw sees the edge of his robe
 it's like Samuels leaving angry and saw grabs just the edge of the road and it tears off in his hand like tears off a piece of the robe the Vivid scene Samuel turns around and he looks at his torn robe and this is what he says Yahweh has torn the Kingdom of Israel from you today saw and he's going to give it to your neighbor one who is more Cove than you more good than yeah 3 cinematic seen it is I guess. Staring the Kingdom from you and cut your toe pants that ends with 1st Samuel 15 the next chapter is about begins The Descent of Saul and the rise of David so the anointed one has shipped
 now he is no longer God's favorite anointed one in God's eyes but nobody else knows that other than these two and God's going to raise up a new anointed one and as Saul is beginning his downfall David is beginning his rise and the rest of the first Samuel story is going to be about these parallel tracks of the truly anointed and then the anti indicted and just tracked the sequence of the story of David we're going to do just now like we're going to do and it's been designed to imitate the rise of saw David's rise is going to imitate Falls rise to power and in really creative and clever twice so moving on to David this is the neighbor who is my wife
 the chapter 16 begins and got tell Samuel I'm done with saw let's go to this guy's house in the town in Bethlehem the guy named Jesse it's got all the sons and we've also explore the story of the selection of David earlier this year and the firstborn podcast Series so I just want to go to the moment that when David walks into the room Samuel takes the Horn of oil and he anoints him in the midst of his brothers and the spirit of the Lord came powerfully on David from that day forward. That's what happened with all that exactly what happened with David in the exact same words remember except Samuel had a flask of oil
 I have started design Choice the next chapter is 1st Samuel 17 pretty famous story about David versus a guy named Goliath so the Philistines are fighting the Israelites and we're told that the Philistines are on one side of the valley Israelites on the other and then there's this battle line in between them and we were told was the everyday the biggest baddest Warrior of the Philistines he's called in Hebrew to the east by 9 I'm the man of the in-between it gets translated as Champion English translation but I don't know why the in-between yeah cuz he's walking in between the battle lines you just like strolled out there to the in between the battle lines so the demand of in between came out from the Army's is Philistines his name was goliat.
 his height with wealth depends on what ancient texts you reading this whole rabbit rabbit hole whether he was like 11 feet high or seven feet high is quite a difference it is quite a difference but we start focusing on the bronze helmet on his head and the scaly armor the way it's five thousand shekels the bronze is bronze greeves is bronze Javelin the word bronze is spelled with the letters of the word snake snake associate is bronze in the armor is scaly okay which is the same word used to describe animal-like reptile scales if he prefers he's being described as a big brown snake yeah it's weird play it's a clever words right the pay attention he would go out and Shout at the ranks
 Israel and say why did you guys even come out to drop in battle today am I not the Philistine and aren't you the Servants of saw two of them and let them come down to me if you can fight with me and kill me will become your slaves but if I Prevail against him and kill him you will become our slaves and again the Philistine said I publicly shame the ranks of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together a public shaming yeah he is bringing public shame trash talk some translations translate this I taunt the ranks of Israel some translations say I defy but if it's hot
 you're shaming someone basically you're just what bullies do you know it's like stand up for yourself you know so that's what he's doing he's disgracing them and that is that the same phrase used the same idea used by the different word from what is the am and I did the same idea if he wants to bring disgrace and whence all heard these words of the Philistine Christopher there there's a big brown snake you did of Israel's enemies bringing Public Disgrace on Israel how did Saul respond last time this happened yeah he just took care of him yeah he drove them out yet the spirit of God came on him and he drove him out this time when Saul and all this real heard these words of the Philistine they were made they were greatly afraid
 okay so the something straight sell his heart has changed but then in the next paragraph David appears on the scene his dad's like a good as your brothers on the Frontline bring him some you know cheese and oats and yummy things so David shows up with like all these goodies and we're told a 22 he ran to the battle line and he entered in order to greet his brothers and as he was saying hi to his brothers behold the East Bay and I am the man of the in-between the Philistine was coming up just that moment in the timing and he spoke the same words and David heard them and when all the men of Israel saw him they slept and they were greatly afraid but David
 he spoke to the guys standing around him and he said
 you know this the king said he's going to do anything for the man who will kill that Philistine and take away this reproach from Israel who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should bring public shame on the armies of the Living God you can see what's happening here I think you probably can't oh well I mean just a very literal level as he's he's asking is there a brownie and why is in the king what can you do about this when he heard the word is he's freaking out with his army and they are no one's going to go up to him is he up to anointed ones in the story you have saw has been anointed privately but just he just like you know nobody knows about except I feel so now you have two anointed ones
 and Saul is responding the opposite way he did last time he encountered a snake and now David is responding more likes all did back when stall encountered sneaky man the ammonite now David is like becoming a new saw or becoming what's all ought to have done or should have done so it's all hears about this young kid who's liked you no trash-talking this Philistine we bring them into his tent and he says listen this what sauces to David you are not able to go against this Philistine you're just a kid he's been a warrior to be skip the part where you take volunteered volunteered hears the rumors Start Spreading that there's this kid do saying that he would be willing to fight the Philistine for us all try to talk him out of it and David gets this great speech when he says listen I've been a Shepherd for
 a while and you know there have been times when a lion or a bear would come and take one of the lamps and you know what I just went after that thing and I attacked it and I rescued the lamb from its mouth and if a lion or the bear rose up against me I would seize it by its beard I guess the lines of main. Of a bear you know nothing me hair they can be kind of hurry hurry if they've been drooling or something and it's kind of like just that hair is hanging down so well for us to keep breeding season by his beard out to strike him and kill him that's lion or bear I mean your servant has killed both a lion and a bear and this Philistine it will be just like that because he has publicly shamed the armies of the Living God
 so David said the Lord who delivered me from the Paw of the lion from the Paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine snake snake is my Edition so he's comparing Goliath to this wild beard and glasses already been subtly compared to a beast of the field and say my snake so now David is being portrayed on analogy he's not David's now the new Adam in the story facing the snake in this ordeal just likes all did but now it's all is facing the snake and he's totally Fred and concealing notice just another creative this is right the way the narrative is being shaped to compare both of these characters back to Adam in the garden and then to contrast them with each other
 women Samuel story Yahoo point of the stuff out to you I mean this is not very good like clear on the surface like the I mean the snake I guess you're reading in Hebrew the bronze sounds like the word snake yeah so do things one this is over the last many years I have been going to every Jewish and Israeli Scholars work who's trying to understand the reading habits and skills of Jewish Bible nerds in the second temple.
 And when you learn how they read their Bible it becomes clear that they were reading it along the grain of its design so this is a lot of what we've been doing design patterns and hyperlinks in the melody so I did however
 find an author who suffer while I was just like I can see all this this and that makes a lot of sense and I've learned a lot also from a number of Scholars William cinnamon David Andrew Teeter Jake Stromberg these are Hebrew Bible scholars right now publishing and pursuing similar questions in Hebrew Bible but I found an author Brian Verrett who wrote the book recently called the serpent in Samuel A Messianic no teeth and when I read his book has like crazy so if this is a topic that interests you this is a whole book on Garden of Eden imagery specific to the snake in the story of Samuel so yes it is very creative very interesting and makes you want to stop the kind of think more about these ideas but it's incredibly easy to mess I mean
 yep showed us thank you we're almost we're getting there so the Philistine mocks David this is Amaya dog that you're coming to me with his wife so David goes out Alexis five smooth Stones right it's a sling all that effort that service and he goes out to face the giant snake and dog are coming at me with sticks and the reader is making no like you're like a bear or a lion do I connect to the Philistine cursed David by his I love him so in the name of dog on and then the name of but all I could see of Israelite
 and so David famously says to the giant snake you are coming at me with a sword and a spear and the javelin but I am coming to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts the god of Israel's battle lines whom you have publicly shamed theme of Shame is really key here they were naked and not ashamed and then a day they ate of the fruit of their eyes were opened and they saw that they were naked and then they hide their bodies from each other so this is also an echo of the eating material yeah that's worth thinking about a little bit more shame is the feeling of inferiority causes you to hide but it seems like all so this is an honor shame Society tonight and really it's like by being publicly
 disgraced, the worst thing that happened to you anyway yeah your identity is kind of bound up in your status in this case among the nation's ashamed to be shamed is to be treated as nothing as less than which is kind of like you know Jesus saying you can murder someone you could also just hate your brother yeah and it's like just as bad as murder it's like by making them publicly insulting them yeah yeah yeah the big deal of being the image of God and Adam and Eve feeling say no and shaming them but I'll send something happened where by taking the fruit wisdom on their own terms their eyes were open but then they recognized we suck
 I've made a terrible mistake yes that moment and moment of realization that's right it's someone you know forcing public shame on another that you know would resist it or but the Israelites you know their King is running away so in a way it's that's all fears and runs away from the giant snake it's a way of him saying my God is Not powerful enough to deliver us and we are not powerful enough of a Nation to defend ourselves there so their status among the Nations has lowered and for David he's like oh my God delivered me from a lion and bear used to live in God so he can take off the head of the snake and
 go to Tennessee with David does he you know famously slings glass with one stone sinks into his forehead and then there's the focus of the story where David runs up with no sword in his hand and then in verse 51 of 1st Samuel 17 David ran and stood over the Philistine took his sword drew it from its sheath killed him and cut off his head with it so he crossed his head and he has not struck by the snake in Genesis 32 State Crusher will also be struck compared
 well he's contrasted with Adam and he's in the vet he successfully dries out the snake crushes the snake's head so by the time you get to the end of 1st Samuel 17 you are feeling great about this kid you like he has radical faith and trust in your way and he is secretly Israel's King but Israel does not recognize the feeling great about that but then we feel great about that one saw some tests to come and lo and behold when do the test begin chapter 18 song becomes jealous about how God is elevating David and people are singing songs about David things you know Saul killed his thousand Philistines but David has killed tens of thousands since this is what it says the young women sing in the town under your skin
 if it does so in these chapters I'm all leading up the first a 24hr quiller but for the next five chapters for Samuel 1823 it's all stories about Saul trying to kill David so this is a Cain and Abel kind of thing so David is like an atom or like an able you know who is favored in God's eyes and the chosen one and saw takes on the role of like a cane anti the anointed one but they're both and that's what makes it yeah and how you don't worry it's the anointed one turn into the anti-noise vikane figure ya ya Christ and the Antichrist interesting so in other words they're almost like reverse mirrors of each other cuz they're both Israelite Kings
 but one has been anointed secretly privately has been anointed publicly and it's about the Rivalry between the two so notice all of these themes the anointed one but the firstborn write the Rivalry between these two Kinsmen Kings with so many themes overlapping right here
so this all built up to for Samuel 24 where David fleas he just have to run for his life Into the Wilderness but he's got a crew Affleck face full of Band of Brothers around him and so interest and 124 David flees to a cave and caves you know from The Book of Genesis our little refuges that are like Eden Eden refuges we do you know this and then more specifically in 1st Samuel 20:41 we're told that David is dwelling in the wilderness of engedi which is an actual place it is also the words of the phrase Garden of Eden with just the letter swapped around the phrase Garden of Eden is gunaydin and Getty citizen same letters do up just reversed so he's in his own little Eden but it's in the world
 so Celtic 3000toys men seek David in front of us want to talk to David so there's this cave and saw looked into the cave and he went in he was like guys I really got to go to the bathroom and were told that you went in to relieve himself and Hebrew that is level Hebrew lesson here in Hebrew means to cover over the feet really it means you take down your robe that's how you discovering your feet and you're squatting and you're taking a dump this is a number two to cover of your feet on the sheets
 yeah I mean you get the idea you have if you have a road that is basically two things you can do I would be more inclined to hike it up and just hold it under my shoulders it's awkward when squatting down and then here so instead you kind of take it down and you kind of like blast it out and then you it's over your feet yeah at least that's the phrase It's not a common phrase It's only Trivium yes he's also in the story of that really overweight King in Judges chapter 3 ft of the squatting and that's well that's about a hood stabbed him in the stomach anyway that's all I was saying he went into the cave let us a cat classic is to cover the feet
 and then here's the narrator says that David and his men have been sitting in that very cave in the back like they were hiding in the case so it's all there like to ring around the Wilderness looking for David they went ahead in this cage. Just imagine this be great so I'm saying and you're looking out and you just see King Saul coming in but then he goes halfway and then it turns around and you're like always town has the bathroom he's covering his feet
 okay start classic man in other words he's naked the men of David said that this is the day which you always said to you I'm going to give your enemy into your hand so David you should do to him what is good in your eyes is what they say that's a phrase from the Garden of Eden this is also the phrase used from the story of with no costi ammonite yeah they told the ammonites do it sooner but to be clear in the Garden of Eden Story how is the phrase used the woman saw it was good in her eyes she saw that the tree was good for seeing a good to look at okay yeah and then she took from the fruit and she ate and then later that act is called God describes what Adam and Eve did as stretching out their hand and taking from the from the tree
 so David's friends are saying David do what's good in your eyes like the sky is trying to kill you yeah
 today we got up and he cut off the edge of Saul's rub so how he pulled this off I mean Ninja wasn't it quiet in there like being loud about a business see it already anyway he's a lot to the imagination so it came about afterwards that David's it says his heart struck him
 because he had cut off the edge of sauce rub and we felt bad about it go bad
so David said to his men may the Lord forbid that I ever do such a thing to my master who is yahweh's Anointed one interesting because David knows he is also the United one also but like he's glued in the he is the true and he is willing to honor even though that God's anointed one has become the anti anointed one David says far be it from me to do that or to stretch out my hand against him which is the phrase to describe what Adam did stretch out their hands to take take him out and kill him. It doesn't do that he just took his hand and you take a bit of his robe and even that it was like I've gone too far and you guys know I'm not going to do what
 in my eyes and I'm not going to stretch out my hand against him so in this scene saw going to the bathroom becomes the tree of knowing good and bad but striking him down I was taking the fruit exactly right and he won't do it and with these words or seven David sharply rebuked his men and he didn't allow them to strike either so I left the cave and went his way so David passes his test so if the rat is one stall gets down the hill David Runs Out to the mouth of the cave and he says look it's all its million sols like what David what Andy says look I've got your road right here I'm not trying to kill you you left something then yeah I told ya so as soon as David finish saying these words are 16 saal said is that your voice David my son and he started crying and he said
 you are more righteous than I am you have done Tove to me you did Toph you did good and I have been doing raw I been doing bad words this the tree of knowing good and bad just as you told me about the good that you did to me how you always delivered me into your hands but you didn't tell me you don't know the guy finds his enemy does he let him get away may always reward you for the good that you have done to me today I know that you will be king and the Kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands so I think with this is just great story tell you know the ropes and they're both compared to atom if that's all Fails Like Adam and Eve the David 60 years Rodney fell in the stall you know Hall of Mirrors of all the stories reflect sure which other but we're meditating on is what
 what does it look like when God's Heavenly presence manifest itself in an Earthly human ruler and Saul and David offer these contrast portrait well in both of them they are anointed they both have a confrontation with the snake usually the story goes in the Bible the snake deceives you yeah you take and then you failed the test the both of them actually succeed there free either first test yet but then comes more tests and Walsall
 failed his subsequent past when we get here is David after defeating his snake Goliath now having this other victory over yeah well solved now the snake here yeah exactly or he's the tree and but he's also that the enemy yeah and he's the past and David succeeds doesn't take what he could have taken and saw Cassie like whoa that was the right move that was good to being anointed one means you're going to have tests and you required to pass the test and you can fail the test and you can lose your status as the anointed one I mean that's crazy yeah exactly the anointed one can through their choices become the anti anointed one and I don't like that the anointed one
 I can't rub you wrong a little bit the God would be like you're the one like you start Monday and then I was like I made a mistake well I don't know how is that different than the story of humanity in that's true
 okay yeah you're right that's a good point to storage mad at that is the story of humanity that's that's why all these stories are being hyper link to LG to Adam and Eve so I'm just annoyed by being human look at the meta teams here you have an anointed one who's given everything they need to succeed but their moments that are going to need to trust
 and Trust God's wisdom and installs Casey doesn't first and then he stops and we didn't look at those stories in detail sauce failure stories but they're all about him not listening to the word of the Lord and doing God's command just like we got cyst out of me but I who is David and he not only succeeds where Adam and you failed The Salted that too but now David is succeeding where Saul failed test after test in fact Saul becomes the test and David refuses to exalt himself to the public place of God's anointed 10 best whiskey he's eating patients and he's kind of like has his radical trust in like if God wants me to be the anointed one like I'll wait for God's timing yes that's right and I won't take in
 my own initiative and that's what the next two chapters we don't have time to look at them for Samuel 25 and 26 till two more stories making a total of 3 right here that David's kind of ultimate test and three times he refrains from using the sword to make himself King and one in the middle time it's not even his own decision fully he's persuaded by a wise woman named my father is the Redeemer Abigail and she convinced David not to use the sword to try and assert his authority as king and he listens to her he does the will of God by listening to the woman when he faces his test so I guess the whole thing is the
 portrait of the anointed one takes a big step forward in the story of David in that whatever it's going to look like to stomp on the snake yes there is a sometimes it's as simple as go by Common Trope is a good that is the bad guy Kill the Bad Guy by simple you mean it's plain that plane the bad guy he described like a snake you talk like to take the bad guy out take a nap but what if the bad guy is the anointed one friend a fellow brother who still King yeah what what then what the how do you fight the snake when snake is your brother
 yeah and this case he doesn't crush his head he allows the snake to bring about his own ruin and he waits for God to elevate him about their relationship as a Cain and Abel kind of story it's time to rethink of the story of Cain and Abel has like Cain tries to kill Abel isn't able to I didn't mean to say that to me what the word planable can you try to kill Abel doesn't he doesn't have the ability to be able to go back and take out cane yeah that's right and then decides not to the story about to go to store yeah that's right so the true victory of God's real anointed one is to sit patiently and wait through suffering even suffering that comes from your own brothers and allow God to elevate
 you to the place of rule and trust that God will bring about the downfall of your persecutors who claimed to be the anointed ones and I'm at when I first started to see these teams at work it was so hard for me not to start thinking about how the gospel authors have shaped the story of Jesus and I was thinking about that like how much was Jesus thinking about David when he would talk about the ethic of the Kingdom to yeah you know like you don't how do you treat your enemy David killed plenty of enemies at least in this story but for this story clearly the author wants to see this as pests of David's base it seems he doesn't take Vengeance into his own hands is really powerful David's pretty pretty bad out of hell yeah I'll kill Lions send me after
 what is the school for the anointed conversation is the reason why most people think of a king from the line of David when they hear the word Messiah is because the David story is the fullest narrative portrait of the anointed one in the Bible I mean Aaron appears in the Torah need important but he doesn't get nearly as much air time. It was one character who is an anointed one who gets a lot of Paige time David but also got her explicitly says there's going to be a king in the line of David who is going to infact this perfect place to land the plane at the very end of David's life he sings to ponds that we call second Samuel chapter 23 + 22
 Samuel 22 hits also identical to Psalm 18 in the Book of Psalms true it's a song of David that he sang when the Lord rescued him from the hand of Saul and the end of all his enemies have opened and retell the story and poetic imagery of how God's rescued him throughout his life and the last line last lines of the poem or is it this he says Yahweh is a live how blessed is my rock may God the rock of my rescue be exalted
 God accomplished Vengeance on my behalf he brought people's under me he brings me out for my enemies from those who rise up against me you lift me up from Violent Men you rescued me so I will praise you Yahweh I'm on the nation's I'll sing praises to your name yeah you're the last one he makes great Deliverance for his King he shows loyal love to his anointed one to David and to de-seed forever so what are you saying here is that the rescue is it God performed for me based on the promises he's made to me he will continue to do that for my seed on into the future so I think the contribution that the story of David makes in the Hebrew Bible is to portray him in the story of his rise and he blows it eventually but the portray him in his rise as being the portrait that's kind of like Moses in the Torah
 the kind of human we need who will be victorious over the snake will need to be like David was on his best day and David trust that God will do for that descendant of mine the anointed descend into mine
 what God did for me he will do for my descendants as well it's the one that sends the Samuel scroll is pointing forward it submits a Messianic story it's a story about the Messiah about a future anointed one who will be like the past anointed one of David
 so what's the story of David the portrait of the anointed one that the Hebrew Bible points to think of a mosaic made up of lots of little tiles the David tiles there's like a lot of David time and that's what we've been exploring in the conversation and so next next what I want to look at is how this portrait of the anointed one in David story is picked up and developed in the scroll of Isaiah and then in the Psalms and then we'll turn to see how the story of Jesus in the gospels is modeled and hyperlinked to Isaiah the songs and the story of David and the story of Adam and Eve after that makes for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're talking about David again the new David promised and looked for in the scroll of Isaiah he won't
 look like a royal glorious are from the line of David ruling in Jerusalem is not going to be like that that rule is going to look like somebody who is rejected isn't Honorable in the eyes of important people and he identifies with people in their suffering and grief today's episode was brought to you by our podcast team do circuit helps associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor Dan gumel and editor is Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey also missed this episode and Hannah will be provided the annotations for NPR podcast on a rap battle project described by the nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as one unified story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make it's free because of the generous support a thousand people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us and I'm from Puerto Rico
