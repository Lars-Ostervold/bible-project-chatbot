hey this is John at bible project and before we start today's episode I want to give a quick content warning today's episode is a question response episode in the second question deals with a graphic story about a levite concubine and judges 19 if you prefer to skip I'd recommend starting around the 23 minute Mark okay that's it on with the show
 it's a page on high high we get to answer when we get to respond to questions and the city City theme been gushing it was a long Series so we decided to do to keep our episodes because there were just so many great questions coming in to this is round 2 of Cuban are we got a lot of questions and we can't get into all of them and I feel bad about that in some sense but in another sense if sightings occurred during and some people are thinking through this stuff and it's also I think good questions are powerful and suggest succinctly holding your question down skid and making clear in your own mind what is my question that in and of itself is a really important thing to do it is yes asking the right questions is
 how to keep part of the learning process and the first two questions we can play together one after another because both of them revolve around a key biblical story that's kind of like the foundation of our whole conversation series which is about the building of the first city by Kane in Genesis chapter 4 and then those pivotal and so we built the video on our conversations on certain type of Kane city name of the vet it's a negative or a sad kind of tragic consequence of Kane's fear and murder of his brother however the biblical narrator doesn't ever come out and say and this was bad in the eyes of the Lord and so my number many many of you ask great questions of how do we know that can city is negative are there different ways to view it and so are we have two questions 1 from Mike in the UK
 and then another from princy in France and you are wondering about two different takes on Kansas City and I thought it was cool to hear these together and then I thought it might make for a good conversation between you and this is Mike from Hainan island in the UK have my question is could cane since he asked to be seen in a positive light I could it be the Fulfillment of woke up 1224 dhamaka protection on K like it was actually the first City of Refuge I said you were a manager is could run for justice and maybe only in the subsequent Generations the good intends to tote it into something ugly and what you meant on my name is princi and I'm from friends and there's a link between God's protection of her cane and visit is a refuge numbers for 25 cents of God's redeeming with City from being bad. Really serve its initial purpose thank you
 do we need a refresher on Cities of Refuge has his brother God exiled him from Eden to the East and says the neighbor he says he sets a mark for Kane it could be on him but it doesn't technically say that in Hebrew with a preposition could mean for him protection the gut says all Avenged anyone emergency as he freaks out the one who finds me will murder me the Berber rug which is what he did to his brother robbed and murdered him and then goes Kinkos Mary the wife has a son build a city named it after his son tell you why I remember you thinking this is bad or the boat yes please I think there was two main things one is that blocks maybe three but one was that
 city is a dwelling with walls and so we have to remember that it wasn't he just went to kind of build a new community or to build a house or shelter he built was scalp the point it's walled enclosure and we know he's trying to protect themself secondly he's going away from Eden and the logic of the biblical narrative that the wrong direction wrong direction yeah I'll do it then mainly the argument was around this word for putting a sign on them was a tote boat and the kind of weird play with the previous story in Genesis 3 and to where God provides and Eights
 Allied more appropriately and as its theme of when we need something when there's something missing that we need to be saved from God will provide it and Friday with a Taser Taser what is K need can use protection build an Acer for the lone human and then when the human is naked and ashamed and covered with leaves after they eat from the fruit God provides and or skin for them and the word days are in the word or look identical there's just a little as Jesus would say tiny jot and Tittle make the words look different to two times God has provided for humans with graphically almost identical looking words to provide what humans can provide for themselves when Caine goes to build the city the phrase used when he builds an ear it's exactly that you're weird City looks exactly the same as the word for a surgeon
 and the word or so he's the first character portrayed as providing for himself by his own wisdom and power what God have been providing earlier run the other words it's the hyperlink word play that sets up the analogy in this case a contrast between what God did to hear what kind does from self so that's that was my first clue that it's a subtle narrative hint of that will Cain does is negative there's also the fact that the next city to be built Babylon is also set on an allergy to Cain City so that Nimrod the Builder Babylon is that on an LG to Kane how is that Nimrod builds the next to me in the phrase building the city is identical to what kingdom does Mike's maybe push back is
 perhaps yes Kayne building the wall to create the city actually was the way to cooperate with God to protect himself as of yet and so it wasn't bad it was actually part of working with God it became bad in later generations exactly yeah like seven generations later with limit yeah so know where is that would be caned us something the God is like down with to preserve his life and that its limit to ruins it turns out that there is enough ambiguity there you could press on that point and make that point totally the question is does the city go from good or neutral too bad or does it go from bad to worse how do you know that's why I thought this was a great conversation because princey what you're asking is or is it example that city starts bad gets worse and then what God does is take the
 sad reality that humans have made for themselves and ridhima to repurpose it so to speak in the laws and culture of Israel to nothing Numbers chapter 35 which is there is to be half a dozen cities three on each side of the Jordan in the arrangement of the tribal boundaries that called the Cities of Refuge and it's all the language of the cane store are the one who her exam murders his brother but only if you didn't intentionally do it instantly do was accidental and so it's different from cane that came came came in today and he made his own City of Refuge so. He's okay for me the letters that I have in terms of the technical details is that analogy set up by the word play between what Kane does
 and then what God does for Adam and Eve close them with or skin and then what God does to build a nether so Cain is portrayed as doing for himself what in the previous two links in the chain God provided doing for himself despite God's promise or doing for himself in cooperation with God's for how is it possible that the building is a city is the sign that's what God wanted him to do and you could I guess you could make that argument and there is wonderful this is a great example this biblical interpretation there like we don't know so well we have to do is build our interpretive tool set off of how does biblical authors give us clues for how to evaluate a characters actions when they don't explicitly tell us this
 out of this was good and the fact that the next city is Nimrod City Babylon you're saying is a big clue to say as the Bible introduced the city's it's bad news it's right that even closer that canes descendant Lemak takes that promise the sign of protection and turns it into license for further violence is a direct connection to Canes violence and Lennox Island the Distortion of what is goodbye came to the store should have said goodbye last night so you are right Mike in making clear that the move that we're making interpreting Kansas City as bad or tragic in a necessity in cans mind is an interpretive mood for making it's not explicit but I do think there are enough text will close in terms of hyperlinks word-plays the story of Lemak being an intensification of Kane and then of nimrod being in even
 worsening of cancel all of those things point to me in a negative direction that made me delete persuaded me that this is not a story of a good City turning bad but that the city is his self a sad necessity from the beginning and my city we mean Walden close wild included I still like to imagine that life in Eaton you're going to have to build something that's moderns might call but the biblical authors wouldn't because there wouldn't have won't have a lot of gas so that's totally right yeah and I guess maybe another clue to be more context really distant is that when you get to Isaiah's vision of the New Jerusalem it's emphatically a city that has walls but that has Gates that are always open to other useless lot and then of course gets picked up in the Revelation so there's something about those walls getting erected that is a bummer and the
 cuz I'm getting decommissioned is somehow an ideal and that also feels like a reversal of Kansas City so I'm persuaded that the city goes from a bad to redeemed that's kind of the story are considered starch bad gets worse. It's important to note that the way you know that we're getting there is through some interpretive steps and that's what your highlighting but your question Mike and so it's it's always helpful like to retrace your steps go through them again and re-examine them and because there's been many times where I've got back to me like I don't think that anymore I think something different now cuz I've learned a couple other things and I guess that's the process of holding one's interpretations with an open hand as you read meditate on the Bible more so so we're going to move from Kan city or the fast forward to the city of Sodom and Gomorrah
 questions about Sodom and Gomorrah actually about other parts of the Bible that reflect back on the side of the more stories so this is a question from Alexa in Washington is Alexa moormeier I'm from Seattle and I'm a senior at Biola University when you were talking about Sodom and Gomorrah a similar those two stories when I looked at it so much language is exactly the same so my question mainly is what's the significance of their similarities but also their differences mainly what does it say that the woman is pushed out of the house and judges to be sexually assaulted and killed but the city is destroyed in Genesis are the biblical author's argument Israel's worse than Sodom and if so why doesn't it want the same level of immediate destruction thank you so good just doing some hyperlink way to go so
 first response is absolutely the last letter a unit and judges goes from from judges 17 to 21 and has two stories there's that next to each other that are themselves a hyperlink together and they're both horror thick disturbing and tragic but it's this last one in 1921 that's true the stomach turning we didn't even trying to pick that in our video on touches ever draw September 3rd censored because it's true it's stomach-turning and the most stomach-turning part you're right Alexa is the story in chapter 19 where it is one of the most obviously hyperlink stories to an earlier story in the Hebrew Bible so it starts with the levite who has more than one wife because it's one of his like concubine which is essentially a wife that you take just to have sex with and have a larger family
 play my permanently live with them and you're not affectionate we attached to them definitely not that you deny deal like that itself is screwed up from the beginning but that wife of the Levi has an affair and then leaves the levite and goes back to her dad's house so it's all the whole stories like a fractured relationship from the beginning a distortion of eating idea so the Levi's goes and looks for her and he finds her and she's persuaded to come back and live with him again and so they're traveling back to his home and they are going by Canaanite city the city of UFOs
 and the narrator says that is Jerusalem is it will later. Rousan yeah and one of his servants says hey let's go spend the night there tonight and he's like now that's a night City you know the Canaanites you're terrible. Let's go to the Israelites to do you like give you which means high place and then it's a replay of Sodom and Gomorrah he's going to stay in the city square but a man of give you a cam system come to my house be in my house I'll feed your animals that's exactly what lot says to the two angels and then while they're staying in the house the men of the city, and knock on the door and they say where's the man who came bring us out that we may know him to Beckley with the men of Sodom say and right at the point where a lot comes out and he says don't do this to these men here you know second assault my daughter's is the point we're here the guy brings out that wife and he
 shove her out the door and the men Levi's Levi's the Levi to see the Levites the equivalent of like a pastor in their culture he sends out his wife you know who had an affair and the men sexually assault her and kill her that night and then it gets even worse remember what happens in the thought of him our story is that Natalie what does dogs fleas from the city city gets torched and then they go up into the case and have drunk sex with their dad. Doctors do to produce. So just this yeah really distorted thing that happens there where has hear what this guy does is he takes the corpse of his former wife and cut it up and then sends the body parts out all the tribal leaders
 to say like something horrible just happened and you need to respond and so then a civil war starts the tribal leaders respond and they all descend on the city and its Israel turning in on itself and destroying itself and there's a Civil War and at least two more sexual violence it's horrible
 so your question Alexa is the language is exactly the same yes so when the biblical authors are doing this the question always is what the narrative pattern that's right they clearly want us to evaluate and meditate on the similarities and differences between the story but give you and then the story about Sodom and Gomorrah so what you're noticing Alexa and it is obvious when you compare them is the Israelites they hate even more atrocious away then the men of Sodom and Gomorrah
 and remember how lot was questionable cuz he was going to surrender his daughters even though he doesn't in the end but then the levite actually does it by bringing out his wife do it every turn the good guys and the bad guys are worse than their correspondents in the Sodom and Gomorrah store so it's a way of indicting is real through narrative intensification by inverting all the characters and making them even worse in the judges story which released this question another difference in the story is the sound of the Moor is immediately he created when it rains fire so it's a flat of fire why does not happen here and if you follow and I need to know do more work here but I've done some initial sound thinks they let me in this direction I think that the Civil War that happens between the tribes and I've noticed I just looked at my notes quickly when I was kind of prepping for this that the story of the sea
 is filled with vocabulary that comes from the flood story and Samba Sodom Gomorrah destruction story it's a type of flow yes the Civil War is an example of God ending people over to the self-destruction of their own choices so in a way I think this is right could be wrong but I think I need to do more work than Civil War that almost destroyed the whole tribe and tons of people died is depicted as the sad self D creation of Israel that they bring upon themselves through this tragic series of events so that's 11 sockets to study that Civil War story after in chapter 19 and then to compare and contrast the vocabulary with the flight of fire in the flood of Civil War that's my hunch at least
 but then even after a civil war eventually King David unites all of his real that's right and no even despite this atrocity farewell this city that emerges that is the saint of God it is important to say that before David the next story after the story about give you a at the end of Judges is about the story of the rise of Saul and the failure to Samuels sons and where does salt come from what tribe from The Tribe of Benjamin the bad guys at the end of Judges saw comes from that town of gibeah is in ya from The Tribe of Benjamin and in fact there's a whole bunch of stories of Saul in the vicinity coming from the very region of where the story took place so saw himself arises Israel's first king arises out of the location of the
 events at the end of judges and of course all is it himself a tragic figure and then he begins Israel on a course to a having a monarchy that the monarchy is in the narrative point of view from judges all the way through the end of Kings the monarchy is one of the worst things that could have happened because it led Israel end of the ultimate decreation which is EXO OK and destruction by a Syrian Babylon Lenawee Assyrian Babylon are the ultimate consequence for the types of things that happened didn't like that story in judges 19 but you're right Alexa it's not in the immediate consequence it's a slow tragic self ruin that flows out of these events in the story of Judge just happened over the course of many generations switch
 I guess I'm not sure which is worse consequences like a slow-motion train wreck or an immediate Trainwreck you know but both are trainwrecks they're just happened at different time scale I was just want to pull the Band-Aid off and real fast totally appreciate that you asked the question Alexa because it's a good example of when you're comparing and contrasting stories that are matched in terms of narrative patterns sometimes there are differences that really you have to sit and Ponder them like why is what happened in the city of Israel I said he was worse why wasn't the timing of God's justice immediate like Sodom and Gomorrah that would feel more satisfying instead of plays out in slow motion
 which ends up being worse and killing more people but it doesn't happen quickly no crap
 sobering human existence is covering all right let's go to a new question from Alex and Marilyn hi John and Tim my name is Alex and I'm from Baltimore Maryland you've pointed out that the concept of the city is generally negative throughout the biblical narrative buttons on a positive note I've also noticed that Ezekiel speaks of Sodom being restored and Jonah speaks of God's design statement about with redemption or Mercy in order for cities as a concept and for two of the worst cities specifically that consistently negative portrayal of Babylon from start time 6 out reminds me of Abraham cutting short negotiations with God over Sodom what's going on here
 thanks that's a great question is not a great question yeah thanks Alex so of all the cities in the Bible is Sodom and Gomorrah and then Babylon probably rank in most people's imaginations as like all those are definitely like the worst the worst of the worst in the biblical story so there is a passage in Ezekiel that is intentionally like the zequiel clearly intends it to be shocking he's talking about how bad is real has become in his generation that he thought the whole story of Ezekiel 16 he compares the history of Israel to that of a
 a young wife who betrays her husband and start sleeping around lots and lots of other men but that the husband is going to come and persuade his wife to restore the marriage and that it's going to happen it's going to happen whether Israel that is the wife likes it or not it's going to happen and then starting at the end of Ezekiel 16 he Compares Israel to being worse than saw them like it if man Sodom and Gomorrah could see you now like even they would be ashamed of how is your behaving is real but then he says but listen you know I'm going to restore Sodom and her daughters which is using the image of the city as a woman the metaphor estudias woman until the daughters being like the surrounding towns so you you know that right and you know that Samaria
 the capital city of the northern kingdom up to the north you know I'm going to restore them to in the end so here's the thing they're so ashamed of your behavior when they look at Jerusalem to the behavior that even when I restore all three of you Sodom and Gomorrah and Samara and you they're still going to feel like ashamed and embarrassed about what you did was this rhetorical play to say even the worst of the worst things that you're the worst and even once I restore you all which course you know I'm going to do then even as soon as I can and when you guys are doing that thing all the idols and keep bringing up the past
 yes that's it it's fascinating it's a fascinating and so the Shocker for sure is 4 is equal to say you're worse than Sodom and Gomorrah which is what the end of Judges was saying to do even more of the Shocker is that God promises to restore Jerusalem and Judah was worth in Sodom and Gomorrah and then you just because you don't like what like where's that coming from you I never saw that coming how is it possible like what does that even mean cuz those cities and region is now still the region around the text if they're there. It's like they're gone it's the most desolate desolate so is he cute got this radical
 wide vision of God's restoration for even the worst of the worst that it's really remarkable as remarkable as the portrait of the repentance of Nineveh in the story of Jonah right who is the Imperial bad guys of the time of the Jonas one of the day if that's okay so then the question is why isn't then maybe you take us his logical conclusion the story the Bible that would end with Babylon being retained you would think you would have destroyed by what ends with Babylon being from living from Genesis to the revelation
 it's set for Destruction it's the Death Star bad from the beginning and it's the yeah and so a part of me wonders this because in the Revelation and all throughout the New Testament we did this necessity that Babylon becomes more an icon or an archetype it feels like it is moved Beyond being an Empire and turns into an idea yes for sure that's why Babylon can be brought up as a symbol like another letter 1st Peter where guess we didn't talk about this we have talked about it before oh yeah I think it was an exile Sierra's mom to go to the last words of the letter of Peter where Peter says hey you know I'm she that is I'm pretty sure it's a church community that is in Babylon chosen together with you since greetings and so does Mark my son say hi greet one another with get some love Babylon hasn't existed for centuries
 an icon to hear that idea comes out in the New Testament letter it's the same idea it's a Nikon representing the dark powers that the city can have that an Empire can have a organization of humans that operate according to what we ended up calling the logic cane City that the only way to secure peace at the expense of human life and peace and stability is a zero-sum game actually in the video stop using with logic yeah in mindset of the mindset is logic makes you think that it's a reasonable reasonable has pointed that out to us I think I felt very reasonable and that's exactly the point where was Babylon represents a system that is internally coherent you know what is it you want to make an omelet you got to break some eggs
 whatever that idea and sell that system of human organization of community got to go to the Smoking Pit Bike that can operate through even the worst cities in the Bible can be redeemed but that might set my logic it's right with that way of being a city that can't be right because it is fundamentally at odds with the night deal which is the incident abundance of God's outpouring love and life means that there is always enough and anyone who Hoards and then thinks that that preservation of Life must happen at the expense of another if need be like that is fundamentally incompatible with the ethic of the eating ideal I think that's what's going on accents so Babylon comes to stand for that why well my hunch is that
 Revival comes to us has lots of material from all periods of Israelite history but it was put together shaped in a really important Way by jerusalemite who were destroyed by Babylon and carried in the Exile and still has some of the worst suffering the biblical authors ever went through with at the hands of Babylon in my hunch is that historical experience
 left a scar in that memory resulted in Babylon becoming an icon to something it transcends the historical Babylon so the question now it's a great question the certainly more reflecting I know I need to do on there but that's that's at least my first. OK Google and I'm from Indonesia Tim of Tabernacle at the pizza and it's disconnected to have set the sand and pretend to call upon the name of Yahweh goodness mean the depiction of the ideal city is worship at scale instead of violence at scale and when I was 14 they just want to be like other Nation power and security on their own term it filled it got returned in the city and incorporated into in the ideal image RI
 in the story thank you John and Tim really invite both insightful question it's good frame and I love the frame that you're out on that battle your observation is that Jerusalem the moment that it becomes a center of worship the center of Heaven and Earth got the presents a family present meeting Earth and then this big story about everybody dancing and see if you read the version of the bringing of the Tabernacle to Jerusalem in Chronicles the author has even Incorporated sections of Psalms from the song scroll to like imagine what types of songs they were singing as big as this huge warships fast the first worship best really enjoyed the after the rescue with the Sea of reeds and so
 if you know the lineage of Cain led to the city of violence and now the lineage of Seth connect to David leads to the city of worship are these kind of meant to be to like poles at the end of the spectrum like the city of man results and violence against redeem Citi scales up I love that worship at a scale where's the B scale versus violence it's Gail yeah because I think the way we framed it was violence that scale or generosity of scale and so that puts an emphasis then on our relationship to each other but then this Frame puts the emphasis on a relationship to God I guess there's violence at scale so that's not against God but in a way violence against humans. That's right but then what's the opposite of that
 worship at scales and now it's really focused on our connection to God what's worship except naming and celebrating the one who is the author in provider of all good things and then sharing those good things which is what David does he still has that huge feast and it names the name of that long list of all the foods the David chairs including fig fig cakes which one of the Trees of Eden yeah so it's it's kind of this Triad of the worship of God disposes us to view our neighbor in the new frame because I'm celebrating the Abundant sharing generous God and when you're in the the city of man essentially the god that you're worshiping is
 the god who protects me in mind even if it's at the expense of you and yours these two framing's it's kind of like what's the greatest command yes love God and love your neighbor so love your neighbor its generosity of scale and loving God you can think of that in terms of this worship but for Jesus those were one thing right yeah that's right the way you love God is how you relate to your neighbor how you relate to your neighbor is how you relate to God interesting than to think about you know I Think Jesus is ideal vision for his disciple communities were
 I guess like what you talked about earlier the Eden Without Walls if it's a celebration of God's abundant provision
 but the relationships are organized such that you're trying to prevent and build into the Water System supposed to be this deep view of solidarity and relational connection with others so that the idea of trying to conserve or gain power over them or that group it's just not something that when enter the mind
 ideally I'm just saying it's not ideal like here we're at The Sermon on the Mount but of course that's an ideal Vision that requires a lot of effort to live out personal and corporate Lane but I think that's what the garden represents and what she is his kingdom Vision represents we haven't done much work on the biblical idea of worship Indonesia versus more insights in could you can just kind of focus on doing right by your neighbor and living generously and make it a very horizontal kind of thing at what point do you need to stop and just sing a song or you know like play music and focus your attention on the Divine and let your imagination and heart be reshaped so that you can then, yeah I mean I think your neighbor that's right actually yeah in the Jewish
 in story
 the way human imaginations liberated to truly love your neighbor is by focusing on the Transcendent Giver of all life and provision the kind of frees you from the scarcity mindset when you are only thinking about your neighbor and you know what I mean like you need to lift your vision to a larger Horizon to remind you of Ultimate Reality cuz if I'm only ever stare at my neighbor I'm going to eventually started start getting a little concerned on My Worship be cool thanks bro so great great question the good inside we've got a wonderful observation and question from a famous in Australia on my name is Hamish and I'm reaching out from the beautiful face and a peninsula in Tasmania Australia is Pentecost Sunday right now as I ask this and I'm pondering over the
 name of the city in light of Luke's account of the events at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 I've read a lot of countries that describe looks account here as the reversal of the events at the Tower of Babel in Genesis chapter 11 and I find that to be a compelling way of understanding looks letter intent how should we understand the role of the church which was berthed at Pentecost as the New Testaments response to all of the ideas Rise by the Biblical name of the city thanks for bringing me along on the Journey of meeting Jesus Through scripture that's been sorry if one of them cool static yes that's cool to hear that you found commentary resources that are highlighting that cuz that's definitely part of what Lucas doing what's interesting was UniFirst made this observation that was at least meaningful to me was that all of the people there in Jerusalem at Pentecost are Israelites from all different from the D Aspera from all
 Nations so they represent languages and cultures but their Israelites okay and then it's from that Multicultural Israelite renewal then that the Jesus move really explodes into a multicultural, form that leads to
 problems and opportunities like the story of the feeding of the widows and Dax Khan highlights so I guess more Hamish I just I think the way you asked that question is exactly what Luca setting us up for is I think he wants us to see those early chapters of Acts of the Jesus followers as kind of this alternate anti Babylon type of community ethic so you are the city yeah you are absolutely so it's kind of Lukes Way of carrying forward the theme of the alternate City where is in Matthew Matthews included that material in The Sermon on the Mount that you are the salt and the light in the city but Luke's doing it in a different way to show it as the like the inverse of the opposite of Babylon so let's see so it must be relevant that Luke goes on to highlight in those early chapters of Acts the economic, embodiment
 of the ethic of Jesus followers specifically that none of them held their own property they were selling things donating them to a common cause to look really wants to highlight but this created a new Social and economic theories of relationships that included for widows make sure that they get fed and when they were culture clashes you know that story he shows how the apostles tackled that and I am that out so yeah it's really Luke is trying to create through the narrative a vision of the opposite of Babylon I suppose in one great place by the first person scholar that I read that really like blew my mind inspire me with this was in the New Testament scholar Richard Hayes
 he has allowed it's amazing work call the moral vision of the New Testament is from the early 2000s may be in late 90s but he has a whole section in there on the ethical vision of Luke acts the ethical vision of Jesus developed through the narrative argument of Luke acts and it's a powerful treatment and he was the first one that pointed this out to me and that it's Liz if you see The Sermon on the Mount lived out but instead of someone teaching about it he uses the narrative about true slim Community best kind of the narrative embodiment that how does that strike you John how should we understand the role of the church as a response to the vision of Babylon
 my question to respond this question is how much is the church meant to be thought of as an institution of the city city becomes what maybe you would call an institution that it very much though it works corporately there's power dynamics that are kind of firmed up there's ways that it operates through like a mental institution and it develops its institutions Town Hall in the problem with any institution is that then those in power who can we use power correctly
 yeah so when you think about giving up everything you own and caring for the poor this is beautiful idea of light wow what we always did that we could just like solve all the world's problems
 but then immediately start thinking about I start thinking about a charismatic leader convincing a bunch of people to do that and then using that for self-gain which is happened a timer to stop at a time with you or 400 hundred four thousand times so when I think of this idea when I think of Jesus saying you are the city
 and when he's singing to build my church and these kind of things this is a rabbit hole before over the years the social environment of the earliest Generations ride of Jesus followers they gave us the New Testament the apostles you know they all lived as a already as Messianic Jews as a religious culture minority in a more dominant culture of the Roman Empire and so communities of Jesus occupied the same kind of social space that did like I think they're called like the Guild's the Guilds of the blacksmith's Guild are the there different professional guilds and they gathered in homes that limited the amount of people that could be a part of one little mini institution that was a house Church you know so that reality limited what institutions could even Be Imagined in the generation
 the apostles and that's why it's a fascinating it takes a couple hundred years before you get later
 leaders of the church and here this isn't a post New Testament era having to tackle these problems of institutional structure with the rise of Bishops over many regions that are made up of many communities of house churches and how you how you organize all that and the apostles just didn't ever have to speak to that and neither did Jesus cuz it just wasn't their social reality so it's a question most Christians now for most of church history have had to wrestle with but did the apostles didn't deal with but what they give us is the escalation of Jesus developed out for smaller House Church communities so we got in and testament letters
 and then we kind of have to extrapolate from there you know Appalachian something to Hamish you know is cooling a sin on here in about Acts chapter 2 being this kind of opposite mirror image of Babel where everyone could speak the same language but they were building something that was trying to pay power on their own terms. Scatters uniformity yeah uniformity the vision of Babble Babble on and so at Pentecost all of these languages now suddenly being able to understand each other they have kind of it a new form of not uniformity but like Unity Unity Unity uniformity yeah that's right it was cool is that they celebrate the saving acts of God the right this wonderful acts of God which is means retelling the story of Jesus
 is one story but each of them is hearing it in their own language such a rat image sort of like the way that the unity of the body of the Messiah is created is by having one core story but that gets in body and in all of these different chores to be informed that I think it's to next inside for me is part of the reason why God scattered Babylon in The Narrative of the biblical story is that God wanted Humanity to subdue the Earth be fruitful and multiply still don't feel the land and there's something about going out and feeling the land it's this decentralisation that's right and it's going to create diversity and that's actually what God wanted and what happens after x 2 and 1/2 goes back out and there isn't this moment of volcanoes build the make an institution we go out and we build
 decentralized House Church movement and the rise of the Jerusalem Church but then way Norris up in Syria the rise of Antioch and then after that the rise of Ephesus and then after that the rise of the church in Rome and yeah in the New Testament era was a collaborative Network diverse networks ostriches yep that was how it worked decentralized it was and then how they all maintain Unity well that's been the Journey of discerning that's what the word orthodox classically refers to its end the church Discerning turning to the writings of the Apostles and the whole collection of scripture in the story of Jesus to discern who goes where the centralizing things the the apostles in the scriptures for a unifying ethic and
 vision of reality and there are lots of differences many differences the apostles didn't always agree no not even in the book of Acts and so that the unity not uniformity Discerning what is the kind of unifying thread the drawers that died first Jesus movement together and people have disagreed vigorously about what that unifying thread is the most Traditions now can still appeal to the New Testament and then to the first kind of formulations of the face that came out of those early Post New Testament century is called the Creed's up through the Apostles Creed
 and then the Nicene Creed and then it kind of fragments and that's just in terms of Doctrine or theology but there you go but I think it's important to say just because the issues about institutional realities aren't addressed in the New Testament doesn't mean it's not important or that if you try and build an organization to accomplish a goal because of your passion for Jesus. That's bad it's not that but it can be done badly or it can be done good late or likely it'll be a mix between the two but I don't think it means that we shouldn't try and build organizations to do good in the world and yeah if you put an organization on par with a city in some ways then the question becomes how do you build an organization without walls with an abundance mindset about it's mine so yeah it shares responsibility and influence as much as is feasible
 or maybe it's not feasible that is a bit Reckless but all indications are that Jesus was viewed as a great question Haven thank you as always we just what we hit we got to we got half a dozen questions and done right there I feel satisfied time we don't even make it that far yeah there was many more wonderful questions thank you for sending them in and we'll do this again with a new series but that's it we're wrapping up to see those are great conversations great observations and questions they are sent and we're glad it was stimulating
