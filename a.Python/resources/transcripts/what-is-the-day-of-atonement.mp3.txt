we are at the center of Leviticus if you've been following the long you've been reading the Torah with us from Genesis to numbers the first five books of the Bible and today we happen to be at the center of second movement of America switch is at the center of Leviticus which is the center of the Torah this chapter is in the section that the center of the center of the center of the Torah we know we're close to the heartbeat of the message of the Torah when we enter into the tent on the day of atonement this chapter is not in the middle by Chance the day of atonement is something to pay attention to it is the solution to a problem that we have encountered many times that God wants to work with humans to bless and rule the world but we're not up to the task and this section God has chosen priests set them apart to act on behalf of Israel who he sets a part to act on behalf of all humanity and what are these priests do they bring
 right into the center of the Tabernacle When Death has been introduced into the very heart of the 10th which is the source of all life we need to deal with the problem they're not just out there in the camp we need to deal with pollution has taken place in the tent and that's what the day of atonement is all about the day of atonement or Yom Kippur happens one time a year that the high priest first makes a sacrifice for his own suits and then cast blocks for the fate of Two Goats in Goat Sim balikli receives of the sin of Israel and then sent away Into the Wilderness the second goats is sacrifice in the Tabernacle and if blood is life it's blameless life is brought into the holy of holies and it sprinkled on the cover of the Ark of the Covenant the Throne of God himself in the cover of the Ark is called the atonement lid and so the moral failings are compensated for can the effects of our moral failings are reversed by the blood of substitute put on
 atonement lip is if this leads the place where God's presence of touches down his place word God have provided the substitute of atonement happens every year year after year it was never thought of as a permanent blasting atonement but it was designed to stir in Israel the expectation of something even greater when an author of Hebrews says it's impossible for the blood of animals to take away sins he's not saying something new what he saying is what is already the message of the Hebrew Bible because the Hebrew Bible is telling you that the animal sacrifices are just a symbolic gift of Yahweh of a down payment of something bigger than needs to happen which is of a blameless human who would come and stand in the Holy place and offer their life I'm John Collins this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I meditate on the hearts of the Torah the yearly ritual called the day of atonement
 extending us here we go
 hey John here we are in the scroll of Leviticus it is a bit intimidating book yeah it's the book of the Bible in which many people trying to read through the Bible just give up just go enough is enough and it's understandable one example of that is what we talked about last week which was chapters five chapters of ancient Purity law code about things you can touch it not touch that makes you pure n pure bodily fluids skin diseases it's all very strange. Who cares this is weird I thought this book was supposed to help me understand what it means to be a good person and like go to heaven one day and here I am reading ancient Purity laws the reason we were reading age of Purity laws is because right in the center of the Book of Leviticus we just came off of a story where
 and where do you start a mega mega star world
 install humans Partners in ruling the world through Folly and ignorance they forfeit that opportunity introducing death into the world yeah let's spread so intensely that God has to set in motion a plan to both purify his world from all the death and violence and bloodshed humans spread on it and put then also to carry for the plan to partner with humans so he keeps choosing smaller and smaller groups of humans to be as partners and at this point in the biblical story he's chosen one family the people of Israel and then within that family one family of Priestly representatives to be these representative humans a new Adam and Eve so speak on behalf of everybody else and the space that they are to do that in is a lot like the Garden of Eden in fact it just described and looks very similar to the Garden of Eden from the beginning of the story that's how Leviticus fit
 you're referring to the Tabernacle I'm referring to the sacred tent that is the Tabernacle that's right and all the rituals around the Tabernacle or what the Book of Leviticus are about and what way do you interact with this space that set apart to allow you to be close to God and in partnership with God or the word we would use the Bible uses is to be wholly to be a holy God has staked an outpost of Eden in God's presence and Holiness in the middle of the desert among the people of Israel and now that this people is hosting. Devine didn't presents and this one group within Israel is the Stewart's at the boundary between that space and the rest of Israel how are they to live and behave so one thing God gives them as the gift of being able to come right up to his presents to approach god with sacrifices and offerings which are called the coming near things that's what Leviticus 1 through 7
 and then would God give Israel the gift of a priesthood Representatives who will live and work in that place there's a seven-day ordination ritual and these Israelites are recreated to be priests will serve in the space and on the 8th day that is their first day on the job the two sons of Aaron decide to try and usurp their dads Authority and rewrite the Liturgy by doing what's good in their own eyes very play the fall not obeying God's commands taking the knowledge of good and bad on their own terms we've seen it now unfold and the biblical narrative over and over it just leads to violence and shame and the two sons were rebellious Leary riding the Liturgy inside the tent and so because of their severe not just negligence but willful Rebellion God deals with them so
 and takes our lives and that results in dead bodies inside the tent so God tells their dad Aaron hey Aaron here's why this happened and Aaron silent casinos that goes right or the city believes that God is right and then God tells Aaron okay no more drinking on the job so that you can have a sober mind to discern between what is Holy and what is common between was pure in a story ended with a crisis in the temp and so Israel and the priests are to be a people who live in every aspect of their being out the story that even in their own bodies retells the biblical story that we are outside eating that we're dying we're in a state of impurity we come into contact with we have brushes with death and substances and he would get into the section of the book which outlines all of these ways
 Israelites could become rich William pure that was the last conversation so this is chapters 11 through 15 and these are the main ways that Israelites can become rich William pure so just to summarize it's not bad to be ritually a there was no moral failure you didn't break the command it's temporary there's a way to move out of the state of ritual and Purity but the thing that is precarious about being in a state of ritual and Purity is the you are not allowed to walk into the presence of the source of all life in the 10th or the courtyard of the test you have to stay away so you become virtually and fewer by touching dead bodies by touching certain Animals by having a skin disease or touching mold or fungus or coming into contact with bodily reproductive fluids and if you want to hear more about that that's what those were taboo substances that in there
 troll imagination where identified with death and to be in contact with death puts you in a state of temporary impurity because you could pollute or bring death into the presence of God if you were to come into the temple and that doesn't put God danger what it does is pollute or vandalize the holy space with the scent of death like bringing in the scent of death so to speak and we're being told all this as Torah as instruction wisdom instruction for later generations of Israel who are reading the whole collection of the Hebrew Bible correct so it teaches us that God wants to and has staked an outpost of Pure Life and goodness here in the middle of our world outside eating with prepare what is precarious for us so learning how to honor the Holiness and Purity and goodness of the author of all life means recognizing when I've been in contact with death
 and living in a state of temporary distance from God's holy space not because I'm did something wrong but as Torah as instruction it begins to shape me into somebody who comes to love the life getting presents of Yahweh and wanting every part of my life and my diet to just be in the presence of the author of my life and it's taking me opportunity is the normal situations are going to be in when you have the birth of a child or when you have to bury a loved one or when you come in contact with disease Mark those moments as these sacred saying this is a big deal this is signifying the Frailty of my condition it's not good correct and so that's why I'm being ritually and pure and coming into contact with death or the signs of death is not in self morally wrong but it is a reminder
 and I'm outside of evening is wrong something is wrong in the world because we're all dying and why are we dying we're dying because none of us have yet been able to live up to our true potential as images of God and we live in a world that back in our family story this early stories of Genesis in our ancestors all the way back have forfeited the opportunity to take hold of life that is truly life that's given to us by God
 and so ritual impurity reminds me that I'm not in Kansas anymore we're not in Eden and so it is a knot way associated with sin and the failure to live by God's commands and wisdom this All Leads up to I need to resolve this crisis to crisis being interesting so this is how the center of Leviticus shaped you had that narrative about Aaron and his sons yeah I was chapters 8 through 10 then you get God saying hey Aaron don't drink on the job you censoring it out here. They're given to you the reader not for the fries before I mean the priests will you know the story about rebellion the introduces death in a the end of the 10th then you get this block of laws about ritual in Purity and the ways to resolve it and the ways to resolve it we didn't so much focus on this in the last conversation so it's right at now
 every one of them is resolved by a period of waiting usually buy a multiple of 7 then it's resolved by going through the waters washing and then by offering of a sacrifice which is the Hebrew word for purification offering it's usually translated sin offering in our modern translations and that is where an animal is offered as a blameless representative substitute before God and its blood which is its life as our conversation all the way back to here's another like ancient to upload the blood represents its life and its life gets sprinkled on the alto sometimes it gets sprinkled on me as a way of saying this animal's life is now covering me
 and it's life is Conquering the death of an impurity that I was in contact with and making me now pure to be able to go into the presence of God which is a meditation on I need something outside of myself to atone for me this is where the imagery being washed in the blood comes from like the hymns that are Christian worship songs and poetry what does estranged almost nonsensical when you first hear it cuz you're like getting rinsed with blood would make me dirty
 yeah what's the song There is power power wonder-working power in the blood the blood of the Leviticus chapter 13 to 14 people are cleansed by being sprinkled with blood of a blameless substitute so all of that begins to shape your life into a story of cycles and sorry I always go here but there's nothing like magical about to go blood wait on it cuz this is all lead up to the day of atonement which is what we're going to talk about for the rest of this conversation but all those cycles of touching the death waiting in a. Where I recognize my mortality then I'm washed then I'm covered cleansed by the blood of a blameless substitute so that I can really enter into God's presents these are all Cycles in The Book of Leviticus
 they're building up building up building up to a great Act of cleansing that needs to take place not just for individuals but for the whole tent and so here we come to Leviticus chapter 16 and just check out how the chapter begins celebrities 16 so we just finished the Purity laws and that's when you come to a close and what they taught me was God has provided a way to make the imperior person restored to a place of Purity so they can live in his presence through the sprinkling of the blood so that the life of a blameless substitute cover over and wash away the impurity so that's happened multiple times now in Leviticus 11 through 15 and then we start with Leviticus chapter 16 and says now he always spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Erin when they had approached the presence of Yahweh and died that's the introduction to Leviticus chapter 16
 the description of the day of atonement in other words we're still in the eights Bay this is still the same day in terms of the narrative you could have taken all those Purity laws and this would have been a seamless this would be the next thing so if you're thinking about it and literary terms the 7-Day inauguration of the priesthood in chapters eight and nine The Eighth Day the first day on the job that's Leviticus 9 the rebellion of Aaron's sons on the 8th day I was supposed to kiss 10 and then all the speeches about the Purity laws are happening on the 8th that the narrative hasn't shifted time or place then Leviticus 16 comes along and looks back and says yeah all that stuff about. A d and even what's about to be said right now is a response to that rebellion and what does happen on the 8th day oh yeah Rebellion the introduction of death in the hours living room
 so the day of atonement is revealed to Aaron and Moses on the day that death was introduced into the tent this is similar to how in the Garden of Eden even his act of severity of exiling them and telling them you're going to live outside and you're going to die now is laced with mercy and a promise of the snake crushing seated woman so hear his words to Moses and Aaron on the day of the rebellion of grandsons is laced with the promise you're talking about when Adam and Eve when he comes to tell him like death has the Genesis chapter 3 chapter 3 yeah you just offered your own deaths are now slaves to the Earth like this is bad yes right in there. Also promises that a seed of the woman meaning of future child will be someone who will crush the snake and the snake is the one that caused Adam and Eve yes
 to trapped and so God promises of solution and it's going to be a human was going to and walk crushing the snake being bit by the stadium bet ya the Victory and rescue will happen through one who also dies and that's a little riddle that begins to be unpacked and every cycle of the melody through as you go throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible and we're looking at another one right here is failure of the two sons of Aaron in the Eden tent introducing death into the 10 is now linked all these laws about the spreading of impurity through the camp but God wants to provide for it by washing purifying through the blood of a blameless substitute and that all leads up to
 Leviticus 16 which is now going to be not just about individual Israelites can be restored from impurity to a place of Purity and life but how the tent itself in the all of his When Death has been introduced into the very heart of the 10th which is the source of all life we need to deal with the problem they're not just like with your average is a ride out there in the camp we need to deal with the pollution is taking place in the tent and that's what the day of atonement is all about this chapter is in the section that the center of the center of the center of the Torah we know we're close to the heartbeat of the message of the Torah when we enter in to the tent on the table tournament this chapter is super super important so we're going to take the time to go thrift shopping
 we've already read the first sentence but I'll just read it again of Leviticus 16 know you always spoke to Moses after the deaths of the two sons of Erin when they approached the presence of the Lord and died so in other words within the narrative the guidelines about a day of atonement are being revealed to Moses on the 8th day of the inauguration of the 10th the day that everything went terribly wrong so the actual day of atonement will fit in to another slot in Israel's religious calendar but I guess the first one will be about six months from this day in terms of narrative time cuz it's an actual day of the year in the seventh month on the 10th day of the month Soca yeah we're at the right now we are on still in the earlier part of the year have some stuff at 5 or 6 minutes away anyway
 what's at the Moses speak to your brother Aaron so that he won't enter at any time into the holy place inside the veil before the atonement said which is on the ark or he will die most of the high priest might die by even going in and why would he died because I will appear in the cloud over the atonement lid and we talked about this atonement Lids thing yeah back in the Tabernacle Furniture conversation really talked about I think we talked about the table for the bread in the menorah.
 First to lead the Israelites out of Egypt in one the Wilderness it protected them at the passing of the Red Sea moved up over the mountain and then I move down over the tent where Moses couldn't go in then they got the guidelines about all the offerings then it appeared on the eighth day when they inaugurated the 10th which is this day this is that day and now what we hear is that dangerous good presence of Yahweh is going to be both a gift and a threat to Israel
 it specifically to their High priests in though they've always so that the most holy place I'll leave all these is not somewhere he can go except one day a year but the point here is you can't just go in anytime he wants it is this a new development like before you kind of assumed he could yeah it wasn't made clear like how often would somebody go in there we do know the only the high priest goes in the only the high priest goes in a window even for the high priest this is treacherous that's right so you can't just go in at any old time so the rest of the chapter is going to talk about the one time per year that he can go in the We Begin mentioning the death of Disguise two sons yeah because of how they went in and now here we are talking about their dad the high priest this is all being brought back into connection to that store
 this is how Aaron will enter the holy Place one with a ball for a purification offering
 second with a RAM for a Ascension we're going up offering and your translations playing 16 offering you called it a purification offering since we talked about that and offerings that's right sin offerings a translation of a word that doesn't mean sin right spelled with the same Hebrew letters has words in it when it's put into a certain verb form for Hebron Earth that's the pl the meaning of that were before him is to purify from stem of purification from sin offering and that's what you get for using the blood purify crack space that's right but you know already if you've been tracking with Leviticus so far so you expecting bring in an Ascension offering next he's going to put on a holy linen tunic he's going to take off a standard gear has a different gear he's just going to wear a very simple
 in white linen tunic and Sten light white men in underwear so none of that fancy stuff okay the crown so it goes off breastplate cousin this is where he goes in to the most holy place you are at your most interpreters through history see this as the one day that he does go directly before y'all way who goes in in a humble State the rest of time when he's out more visible people outside he would look like a God and image of God but when he goes in before y'all were who goes in a humble State interesting so before he goes in heat will go through the waters bathe his body and put on the clothes now here's the unique thing about this day after the water's he takes from all the Israelites to goats for a purification offering and another RAM for an Ascension offering and we've already done these two
 the first animals were for himself first ball and the Ram or just for himself in his household then these he gets from the Israelites and these are for the whole community so he's going to take the two goats and present them before y'all way at the tent of meeting and he's going to get out dice dice cast lots for the to go that's the ice agent ice yeah some sort of a little I mean they're not described in great detail but the girls are all the randomizer yeah. You should have called the casting lots but it's really nice and the guys will determine the fate of these goats one lot will assign the goat for Yahweh
 the other lot will assign the goat for Azazel who's this is as a wonderful question John so let me just show you a little kiss 68 sounds like a different God 16 verse 8
 Oliver English translations no not all wonderful and Ivy translate the word as as well as for the scapegoat one lot for Yahweh the other lot for the scapegoat but even that English raising is a little bit odd for the scapegoat yeah it said of as the scapegoat yeah makes you sound like this goat is being sent for somebody half of for some other thing and the Oddity is the problem at the heart of an obvious interpretation hear The New American Standard also translates as a scapegoat so does King James but the ESV translator it's the word as as hell with a capital A 1 lot for one lot for Azazel I got the name of something and the nrsv that's not as well why did they do that well so noticed a parallelism of verse 8
 power recline Aaron will cast lots for Two Goats one lot for Yahweh the other lot for us. Though so the sentence structure leads you to think that each lot will designate each goat for someone the first lot for someone and then the way that he Bruce praised or also sell puts it in a parallel sides if it's a name or type of some kind would keep reading then Aaron will offer the goat on which is the lot for Yahweh cell and make it appear vacation offering and the Goat on which the lock for Azazel tall she'll be presented alive before you are way to make atonement for it to send it to Azazel Into the Wilderness
 so it's two ways this has been translated throughout history to main ways there is ample evidence that the earliest interpreters of Leviticus understood this as the name of the spiritual being
 so I'm just looking here at the Hebrew Aramaic lexicon of the Old Testament by color and Baumgardner and their first kind of main entry here is a demon of the Wilderness lots of scholarly history to that the etymology like what's the Hebrew date for the name is they say uncertain however there has been an explanation offered by a smithwick's collar necklace Wyatt thinks it derives from two routes one is the word as as in Hebrew which means strong and the other one is Bell mean spiritually powerful spiritual who resides in the wilderness the scapegoat interpretation you really have to do some legwork here this is also an ancient reputation I actually gets really complicated and anti-semitic philosophy nerdy stuff but there are some people who think it's related to an Arabic cognate word
 what is all which means to remove and that it's a shorthand the goat for removal I'm compelled by the parallelism multiple times that these are both names or titles for the one to whom it is sent so here's the next thing that is interesting these two goats are unique this is like a unique ritual that only happens on this day so none of the other offerings involve anything like what's happening with these two goats the second thing is the two goats are presented together as a singular offering and there's no other offering that's quite like this so it makes clear what's true for all the others that they are symbolic rituals they tell a story so you have to ask yourself what story would be told by a singular offering made up of two animals one of whom gives us life as a blameless substitute and is killed
 and it's life is brought in before y'all way and we're familiar with that from the other offerings but then this other one doesn't die immediately at least it remains a lot you haven't told the story of what happens to these guys totally self let us let's do that so first the go that is for Yahweh he shall Slaughter the goat of the purification offering that's for the people and he will bring its blood inside the veil and cut the holy place yet always in this is it this is like the time that he goes in once a year he will do was it the blood as he did with the blood of a bowl he will sprinkle it right on the atonement lid on The Mercy Seat and he shall make a ton meant for the holy place because of the impurities of the sons of Israel and because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins so he will do this for the tent of meeting that dwells in the middle of
 in the middle of their in Puritas right here in verse 16 and this is kind of an easy way to remember it cuz of chapter 16 16 16 tells you the meaning we're going to link together the last many episodes of conversations here but this is a culminating Moment In the book so far got so tell me what you see here where I can play to a guy I thought all right well the catch up and got two goats yeah we're leaving aside this mystery of Oz as well but we'll come back to it to goats one is going to be an atonement purification for creation offering but yeah and we know from that purification offering the lifeblood sticking from the animal and the animal gave its life even though it didn't deserve it cuz I didn't have blemish the Society of something without the moral feelings that you had even though it's blemishes what about moral failings they were they were symbol of them
 dying on on your behalf the blood is drained out the life is in the blood that Pat has some sort of Life power still in that blood the priest sprinkles it on objects and on the space and and it's it's still hard for me to wrap my mind around but the idea of our corruption our moral feelings isn't just something that screws with me and my relationship with maybe God or with others it actually screws up with the whole environment there's this kind of vandalism vandalism is the metaphor you've been using now and that the lifeblood is this ritual kind of cleansing to kind of clear the air clean the Slate wash it clean happening here and
 but also because of the transgressions are guarded their sins okay so the sins creating the impurity that needs to be a tone for there's two reasons given here in Leviticus 16 16 making a tournament one because of the impurities of the sons of Israel so this is like this is the stuff that doesn't have to do with moral failings impurities this means like being in PR we just talked to me in which early and fewer and it's as if those ritual impurities of skin disease and of touching dead bodies and of leaking reproductive fluids and these are all symbols fluids and substances that are associated with death with a loss of life it's as if the tent in the middle of the camp is depicted as surrounded by a chaotic sea of encroaching death by dying people who live around the tent and those are constantly
 breaking at the shore as it were and spattering up little bits of impurity over the tent curtains and like slowly vandalizing that's one image so that needs to be dealt with and then the second reason given is because of their transgressions in regard to all their sins their moral impurities and that's also polluting is also political and so the singular Act of atonement it's dealing with both and this is we're back to our conversation many episodes of God the atonement is used in two ways and Hebrew Bible scholar here over the most Ram is Jay sklar his book in Purity and sin and atonement nature is real precise titled put a link in the show notes to this book is the atonement is used in two ways related to the two main meanings of its root word one is to provide a ransom was when you wrong someone you owe them
 and so it when you leave wrong each other we wrong God that score to this idea and so we owe God for wronging each other and so a blameless life being offered unfairly to give its life for my sins is a ransom but then also another metaphorical kind of scheme is that my sins and impurities pollute the divine presence like that encroaching waves of achiness and so that blood can overpower the forces of death by standing in my place as a blameless substitute for Life a blameless life can cover over death and send those stories are being told right here in Leviticus 16 16 and this coat which is only one half of the day of atonement offering the one that goes into the holy place by the priest does that the emphasis is on the pollution in the van
 yeah I have to separate them to make sense of them but the idea is are signs of mortality are in. He's which are not morally wrong but they are signs that your dying creatures and then also my moral failures and death and moral failures linked closely together in the biblical story cuz the only reason we're all outside of Eden is because of Humanity's moral failings and so the moral failings are compensated for and the effects of our moral failings are reversed by the blood of substitute put on the atonement is it this this lid which is the place where I got the presents touches down is to place word God has provided the substitute
I'm not saying any of this makes deep intuitive sense but I'm saying it's a symbolic ritual language that I had to work long time to learn what it's saying but I think once you sympathetically can enter into the symbols you can see at least the story is any of the moment that's happening is a Toma for the space it's not at home at for the person is not being sprinkled on the people write the blood is being sprinkled here because it's yahweh's dwelling place that has been polluted cuz that's another confusing thing is when I think of Tony I think of our Ransom on behalf of a person yeah but there's this biblical concept of a place needs to have a donut and there are offerings purification offerings the people make for individuals and their uncensored on for these are at elements for the corporate all of the people throughout the course of the Year all the unconfessed sin all the things that have never been.
 what is atoning the people in a way it is but what is providing atonement for is the effects of their sins by polluting the Sacred Space in their midst the other way this works is if this ritual is not upheld and is real thin Splash over the bounds of the tent and you know fill up the holy Place y'all we believe that's how the Babylonian exile is presented in the Book of Ezekiel as the idolatry and Injustice of Israel become so heinous so unaccounted for they always packs up and leaves which is deaf cuz once the source of Life least down Babylon is just for you to come plug Israel and Jerusalem for the taking but the classic sense of atonement which is
 I have a debt obligation that needs to be paid so that I can be right with God another's yeah that is different than the one we're talking about will the day of atonement is for all the people and it's about how the collective sins of all the individuals in Israel represent an offensive Act of pollution for the always living room and if we want y'all way to still be here we need to approach God through this ritual so it does compensate and atone for my sins but it does so by being taken into the holy space and dealing with the effects of mice in there cuz I thought in a previous conversation you made a point of saying the sins are actually put on the scapegoat got it so remember this a vacation offering singular
 is happening through two animals so we're getting one aspect of it right here though so this is summarizing both animals this is summarizing the one animal that was for Yahweh and that was slaughtered and brought into the didn't you say that the the scapegoat which is the one that was for autism causes that's the one that the priest puts and confess the sins of Israel that's what I'm trying to get at I see I see no no this one represents a blameless life who can Ascend the mountain of the Lord so I'm 15 only the blameless one who does what is right and just so this animal
 unfairly dies for the sins of the non blameless and Carries in its life to cover over the effects of Israel sins that polluted the most holy place that's the symbolism here so it would be a contradiction in terms for it to bring the sins of Israel into the most holy place what this this animals doing is the racing the effects of those ten seconds of life we also here is nobody else should be in the tent when he brings in that goat just one representative human and Yahweh It Down 2 verse 27 he comes out and when he finishes atoning for the holy place and for the tent of meeting and for the altar cuz he actually sprinkled blood on all those this is cool so where he goes as he takes the blood of that go and he goes into the most holy place which is going to the most Westward point the door is always facing East towards the sun rise
 you go in through the door of the brings you into Courtyard you can pass the alter ego in the East or the only place you go in the East door so you can see going west but what happens if he takes the blood in and then he starts a journey from the Western holy spot to go East to sprinkle the blood sprinkling at each key point on his Eastward Exile from the voice for sure is Adam and Eve or exiled at the East side of the Garden Kane is exiled East of Eden the Babylonians go east so it's as if the high priestess following the Eastward Exile of humanity from the early chapters of Genesis sprinkling blood at every Exile on the way and he comes to that go that's alive
 and he puts the two hands he presses him down on the head of that goes it's a lot and he confesses over at all the iniquities of the sons of Israel all their transgressions and all that stands in the three bad words we made a video series about each one of them there's a variety of ways of describing human failure then he will place them on the head of the goat another's good symbolic language for you put the sin on the goat somehow so how then what he does is send it into the wilderness
 by the hand of a man of my time a man of the time a man of appointing that's a horrible if we don't have time to go down there yet somewhat but someone will set him up and that goat will carry upon itself the iniquities of Israel to a land that is cut off and he will send the goat Into the Wilderness the sins are exiled of the holy of holies represents like the Eden Tree of Life Center and the one goat goes in there the blameless goat goes in there the living goes out into the Wilderness to a cut-off land the opposite end of the cosmos in the biblical imagination and what's interesting is as I was not brought up the nursing up here is just called the realm of being cut off in the wilderness just the opposite of God
 so Scholars call this the illumination ritual and I learned a lot about this from Reading lots of Scholars one particularly Illuminating account for this ritual was a scholar named Roy gained his book called and character to hold up about purification offerings at the event and the problem of evil and he Revival so I'm going to talk through this kind of extended quote but this is usually eliminating for me
 and he says no part of this goat a living goat is offered to Yahweh this is not a sacrifice it's in elimination ritual the biblical prescription does not call for the death of this goat is simply sent away as a ritual garbage truck carrying control toxic waste to Azazel precise nature is elusive the common understanding of us as well as a scapegoat referring to the goat itself is ruled out by the fact that the animal is sent to is also right you could even sniff that out and reading the NIV so obviously the goat could not be sent to the scapegoat the reason for the lot ritual before Yahweh is that he must decide the role of the goats through what appears to be a chance through the lot ceremonies the goats are designated as belonging to Yahweh and
 cell respectively each being a party capable of ownership a supernatural being could be taken to imply that is as L is the same but the animal is not an offering to us all rather the live goat transports Israelite failures to Azazel who ends up having to take this noxious load the ritual is an unfriendly gesture
 yeah, do you know that prank where you take poop and put it in a paper bag and then light it on fire and then leave on someone's doorstep and ring the doorbell so how never
 how to go see the movie or some kind of feels like that well let me finish it it kind of is like that but it's also a different container cuz this is great he said it's more like sending someone a load of chemical or nuclear waste because it's Yahweh who commands the priest to perform the ritual it appears that is his enemy is likely there for that is as well as some kind of spiritual being that his presence in the desert Region's is the extreme opposite of God's holy presence in the holy of holies however the nature of azazel's personalities not revealed in Leviticus likely to avoid the danger that some might be tempted to honor him so this is more like the snake the name for the snake if the Mosaic of the Messianic deliver in the Hebrew Bible is truly a mosaic there a second Adam
 they're like a king from The Lion of Judah they're like the high priest there like the prophet like Moses write in the Hebrew Bible gives you all these characters to create a mosaic in the same is true for the mysterious one Jesus called the evil one Lucifer that is one name in the Latin translation Latin tradition but the Biblical images are the slanderer the snake the Slanders where we get Satan right or is that the satin where the Satan is the one who is supposed to oppose the opponent yeah okay so which very possibly is a Hebrew compound word meaning powerful spiritual being good morning star yeah is it image from is a 14 so but here it's the idea of Azazel is an image of a spiritual being the non-existent one I mean the one who exists but in a state of chaos and darkness
 and so that evil one is the architect behind why we're all outside of Eden so once a year we send him a load of BS in a paper bag on fire and we send it out like send it back where it came from. It's the illumination ritual it's so Illuminating and both goats together remember are a singular purification how do you get that both goats are singularly said back when he said take two special go for a singular purification off-road and uniquely this ritual of purification happens through two goats selected by lot by Yahweh right a man make a slots but the decision comes from Yahweh the proverb chapter 10 the one is the blameless one who goes in and gives its life for sinful people and it's blameless life ransoms them from death and also
 purifies the pollution of their iniquities and then the other goat represents you always desire to do away with the effect of sin and evil once and for all by sending the load of waste back to the one who brought it into the world the first place of the day of atonement remarkable I mean think think of the scene yeah. Goats being let out everybody's watching yeah it's pretty profound moment to recreate that cinematically in a way that I could get viewers after the mood and pathetically into the scene yeah
 so
 Christian rock Jesus
 always I'm always down to talk about Jesus so Jesus is talked about in terms of being an atoning sacrifice he talked about his own coming death as an atoning sacrifice yes and when he does that he means in Pride both senses of purifying the land and also a ransom for our that applications yeah yeah what's interesting about Jesus is he is bringing together all of the Mosaic tiles of depicting God's victory over the evil one and his dealing with the consequences of human sin and he's merged them all together
 so important passages here for Jesus or like Mark 10:45 we're after two disciples come and say hey Jesus you know when you're in Throne does king of the universe had like we sit at your right and left hands and Jesus says you have no idea what you're asking for are you going to be able to be baptized go through the waters that I'm going to have to go through a suggestive of purification purification you know that the kings of our world he says love to become Lords over people they love to have authority but not here in this crew the one who is great becomes the servant
 whoever wants to be first must become a servant of all for even the son of Adam son of humanity didn't come to be served but to become a servant and to give his life as a Lutron Ransom atonement the ransoms someone from Death door to tell him it's not used no it's the word Redemption yeah it's a purchase someone from state of slavery leading on to death but the point is here he is activating I'm the son of Daniel 7 the son of man is activating the suffering servant of Isaiah with his language and he's activating The Exodus Narrative of redemption from death
 through the death of the Passover Lamb we are because there's that image to its Mark 10:45 other key passages I'll just go to any of the Last Supper narratives but Jesus chooses Passover Haggadah Luke 22 is a count of the last supper with Jesus chooses the weekend of Passover to time is Showdown with the powers & Roost and looks account he says I've desired to eat this Passover with you before I come when you take the bread he says this is my body different for you do this in remembrance of me the same way he took the cup and he said this cup which is poured out for y'all is the New Covenant in my blood poured out versus sprinkled that's interesting yeah cuz member with the blood would get taken from an animal purification offering it would get taken into the holy of holies sprinkled and sprinkled in the Holy place in the sprinkles
 alter and then they're what's left in the bowl gets poured out at the base of the altar yeah so hear Jesus is merging together imagery from the purification offerings happening in the Tabernacle on top of the new cabinet is the blood poured out and the purification offerings that happened throughout the year culminate in this one great purification that is the day but he's doing this on Passover over which is a different type of substitute a different narrative but both had to do with the sins of Israel and the sins of the empires of this world lead to slavery and evil and death and so you always going to bring the great flood of Justice over the land but for anyone who wants to be covered by God's mercy he provide the blameless substitute as the Passover Lamb but that's also essentially what the day of atonement is about and he's brought Israel out
 Into the Wilderness a land of danger and death and he's provided a way for them to be washed of their sins new purities the van if they don't deal with them they're going to salute you always present then he'll leave which will leave them to die in the wilderness and so the day of atonement goats become another way of looking into the mystery of what passed over this become another way of looking into the mystery of when Judah lays down his life for his brother Benjamin become another way of meditating on the substitute Ram that God puts in the place of Isaac on Mount Moriah that become a way of meditating on the snake crushing seed of the woman who both crushes the head of the snake but also was struck by the snake at the same time
 the Hebrew Bible is a huge Mosaic so all these narratives and hear ritual symbols to help us become wise about what's wrong with us and what's wrong with the world know what is God doing about it what has got done about it and Jesus just in a very few little words brings all of these narratives images together and it really brought in the Last Supper is important place for that Christians like to say is that the sacrifices were pointing to or trying to enact is what Jesus actually accomplished that he's actually doing something that all of the symbolism was connecting to kind of the hope and power of yeah so here an important distinction needs to be made between the actual historical activities happening in the round the tenth Tabernacle and the Hebrew Bible's representation
 all of that cuz the Hebrew Bible gives us a literary representation of the day of atonement and a Passover but included within a collection of Scrolls I have all of these other stories and one squirrel in the Hebrew Bible is Isaiah which tells you Israel and Humanity really needs is a person who will Ascend to the high place and offer their life as blameless sacrifice in other words Leviticus is alongside Isaiah is alongside Genesis so when the author of Hebrews says it's impossible for the blood of animals to take away sins he's not saying something new what he saying is what is already the message of the Hebrew Bible cuz the Hebrew Bible is telling you that the animal sacrifices are just a symbolic gift of Yahweh of a down payment of something bigger than needs to happen which is of a blameless human who would come
 and stand in the Holy place not for their life and that's what Moses's stories about doesn't make sense but you just saw himself as as the the blameless goat whose blood is purifying now there's a sense of The Goat Who Bears the sins and is cast out Jesus identify with that goat it seems like the gospel out there's want to associate Jesus with both goats won by being a blameless suffer but then there's the emphasis that Jesus death is happening outside the city near a burial plot grave area Outside The City Gate and so the one place in the New Testament this is really a boy that is in the letter to the Hebrews
 or he says therefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people through his own blood suffered outside the gate so let us go out to him outside the camp bearing his shame the purification offering animals their remains were taken outside the camp to a dumping site so it could be that he's referring to that you could also be referring to the goat that is the Exile outside of the camp as well if you could join him over because there's 1st Peter 2 Jesus himself bore our sins in his body that makes me think of like the ordination of the scapegoat taking the sense of bearing the sins saying yeah what verse is that 24 hours 24
 yeah he links Jesus to a sacrificial animal that carries our sins and there's only one animal that said to carry the sins of his route and that's the goal for us as hell yeah so that it's a good example of that little line comes from Leviticus 16 but he's refracted that language through the way that's all sunrise and Isaiah 53 which she's also quoting from right here and then in the next line where he says Oh by his wounds you've been healed by his wounds we been held so he's reading the day of atonement through the poem about the suffering servant that's what we're seeing Peters mind is so saturated and that he thinks about the day of atonement through the prism through the looking glass of Isaiah 53
 he sees them as deeply connected where did Isaiah get the idea that the suffering servant would be there since the day of atonement and from the narratives about Moses giving his life for the sins of the people and so on so yeah this is the chapter that resolve the crisis at the center of the center of the center of the of the Torah and the fact that it needs to happen every year also tells us that it's like a stopgap it's not new creation doesn't settle it we haven't restored Humanity Back to Eden we're still in acting something yeah that's right what God has given is a way for Torah instruction and them away for his people to understand who they are
 what they need what God wants to give them this is what the ritual instructions of Leviticus real about yeah I am shocked this is the first time I've heard of Oz of though yeah yeah I was bothered to when I learned about myself bothered but I feel kind of shocked yeah it's right there in the ESV and RSV yeah I don't read those well I don't really read this where did Jesus go to meet the evil one you went to the Wilderness and then he met the evil one who was trying to convince Jesus not to give up his wife but to take a shortcut to power
 it's as if the bible really is a unified collection telling a story that Jesus claims he was bringing to its fulfillment remarkable
 also the concluding know when we were talking about the offerings before you showed there was a sentence in this was in the first movement I think we're God says he's I have given them to you I'm giving them to you this isn't like an obligation we owe to God to try to appease him but was a gift that God was giving to us to know we can be in a right standing in food Embrace this right standing in the chapter right after the day of atonement it's in Leviticus 17 where God says the life of flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for yourselves
 it's God presented as the initiator and The Giver of the blameless life that will Ransom from death and purify from the effects of sin God is giving the life of the blood to us life of a blameless one of a blameless one yeah as a gift yep that is clearly how Jesus thought that's why he presented himself as the gift of God as God's gift to a failed Israel and it failed Humanity which is I think why you know the apostles in the Apostle John among them over pain the letters of John and whichever Apostle you think it is the one that abandoned him and get 70 or the one John the Elder who stuck around with Jesse's mom by the cross but either way
 John's take away from having seen Jesus died is the most simple profound statement in the New Testament God is love and he demonstrated his love for us in this while we were actually I'm reaching out with Robin spy is a revelation of the love of God for Jesus and for the apostles and I think it just takes a little more work for us to get there
 well so where do where do we go from here we go oh well we have one more movement of Leviticus to know yeah we do at the end of the second of Nevada guess he did with the priest being inaugurated yet and then failing and then all these Purity laws and then the day of atonement failure of priests on day one created defilement and death in the middle of the tent and when our deal with that ordeal with the central problem there was a long side about all the ways impurity can creep into the life of God's people and about how God wants to wash his real clean and provide the gift of atonement for the impurities leading up to the day of atonement when that space defiled by the rebellious priests itself gets purified along with all of the calf of Israel where we going to go next is how should a group of people who have received the gift of God's love through the sacrifices of atonement how should they live
 how should I respond to a people that has been not just delivered from slavery
 but then also delivered from the effects of their own failings how should they live what are the rhythms of life and standards of morality and ethics that God called him to and that's what this last section is about what we're going to focus on is the theme that may not at first blush seem relevant to that which is the theme of the seventh state rest in Leviticus 17227 divided is all connected okay God in the center of Leviticus thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're diving into the third and final movement of Leviticus where we'll be exploring the theme of Sabbath you can summarize it this way God has come to dwell among his people the tent has been purified by the day of atonement the reset and the sins that have polluted Israel included the 10th or exile
 in the form of a goat to send out of Camp all that accomplishes is that God can live among his people but what's the purpose of God living amongst people so that they can be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts edited by Dan Gumball and Tyler Bailey are show notes by Lyndsay Ponder Ashland high school and Mackenzie buxman have provided the invitations for our annotated podcast dinner app Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you to thank you for being a part of this with us hi this is Jerry and Malachi and we're from San Antonio Texas the first heard about the Bible project through friends or church and we use the Bible project for gain a deeper understanding of the scripture that we read everyday our favorite thing about the Bible project is approachable it is for people of all ages and walks of life we believe the Bible is a unified story
