we get to listen to some questions from people who've been following along in the Torah Movement by movement series we did not specifically around the Leviticus scroll yeah so let's just get right into it it up here what people were processing and I'd love to hear you respond so many great questions as always more than we can answer so we just try and pick out the most repeated ones they rise to the top and that's what we've done see what happens I'll Always Love interacting with people's questions you like people to listen to podcast or so smart it is a theme really perceptive questions though anyway let's dance. Let's start with a question from memory in Virginia
 hi Tim hi John my name is Marie and I am from beautiful Buckingham Virginia I've really enjoyed the series on Leviticus but my question is of a more practical nature how who or what was the tabernacle ever cleaned after all of that blood sacrifice as well as food sacrifice thanks for everything by
 is a very practical question so practical so practical as so many people ask the version of that question oh really yeah cuz it because it's going to get messy so messy and this is I think it came out on our conversations with a highlights this funny irony for us listening I don't have modern separated because the language of all of this in Leviticus is about purity yeah but the way you purify things is to smother them with ya wiping blood it was pouring blood and water purification rituals like a person writes you take a bath yeah before the altar the altar is just watching a lot of blood and for like the things in the 10U sprinkling blood on it I totally on the curtains on the nasty so it's a very practical question cuz for us it seems like you're making it dirty
 yeah even though symbolically it's being purified what would it what does happened is blood does it mold just leave blood-kin out yep yeah you know I think we've all had to cut well I mean else my scab and her little dry the bottles are these clean it off so you cut yourself and as you're walking to the bathroom to put on the Bandit it drips like my alarm clock there likes me but if it's a hard surface doesn't it just kind of dry and you could just lick it off
 I mean why are we hypothesizing when I'm sure the time YouTube video
 I'll be all my experiences like with my kids who cut themselves all the time on sticks and branches and stuff like that so that there's been blood around my house that will be unlike the corner of the bathroom and he'll try and be there for a week and then like I do that's right but I feel like it's just lights off
 I don't even know what the Google I put no man if you're pouring if your likes me really a big amount of blood on an object say there's a crime scene and I like a pool of blood on the ground no one ever cleans it up yeah it's not what happens yeah it's going to gross stuff going to grow stuff do you think yeah yes will blood and old that's interesting question it's different than Maurice question well I guess I'll just wondering because if it could just stay there then it just becomes like this is blood everywhere which is its own intense kind of way of experiencing something wholly but if it like needs to be disinfected then what happened so here's what's interesting the Torah never addresses this issue it just doesn't come up Solomon's Temple when it's described in 1st Kings chapter 6 through 8 there is a new edition
 an element in the courtyard that was not present in the wilderness Tabernacle and that they huge tub of water it's called the the sea the ocean
 and it has these pedestals do you know that are made of oxygen and it's all gold bronze and stuff like that but it never says what all that water is for it just says that it's there so that's a factor when you get into the second temple so this is the temple built after the return from Exile and then when Herod renovates the temp in for Century we call the first century BC we know from second temple literature the writings of Josephus also from archaeological finds that there were huge water cisterns created under the temple and conduit systems to pipe that water up on to the Temple Mount and Josephus describes that how they would wash so it's a process not described in the Torah
 but it's just I guess taken for assumption or taking us assumed that a lot of this Blood specially by the altar is going to need pretty significant amount of water washing it and so that those systems were at work in the second temple we know probably in the Solomon's Temple cuz of that huge tub of waters or something well at the Tabernacle was just on the ground exactly in the oven and then they would move at total the blood could just stay there and they would move it and you could wipe it off of the of the objects, certainly certainly they were cleaning off the Altar and whatever ditch your drains around the altar was never mentioned is things to get smeared with blood like curtain or the the different all the Ark of the Covenant in the top of the atonement lid
 it seems weird because the application of the blood is what purifies so it seems weird that you go in a week later and wipe it off and think they probably would just keep it even more fascinating is it's just that the detail never addressed which should tell us something that is a good example of we have questions that becomes a Bible with Biblical authors just don't answer and that's creating opportunity for us to say what kind of question I have but clearly the biblical authors are putting this information in front of me that introduces all kinds of questions do but what questions are they answering by how they tell it and what they focus on and that's where they want our attention which is clearly on the symbolism of purification not of the literal cleaning or dirtying up the surface that's almost incidental to them cuz they never addressed it then interesting yeah and it also helps to recognize what type of litter
 this is in that it's not this isn't it to help you know how to create your own Tabernacle system so because you left out you would know exactly how to build it you would know exactly how to run it and the same thing goes for the laws and we talked about this many times it's not a complete set of lock code that you could then now Run ya tribal system off of your going to left and a ton of questions yeah so whatever this literature is doing it's not to say cool now you go and and do this Leviticus and we jokingly call it like the Priestly tech manual in a sense that's exactly what it's not it doesn't act like a manual cuz it Doesn't address so many things you would need to address if it was like where does the blood go so clearly the main point is on the symbolism of purification through a representative blameless life
 that goes in goes before God on my path and that's the focus and therefore those of the details that are put forward in the narrative but inquiring minds want to know thanks Marie
 okay looks like we have a question from Elijah in West Virginia from Ranson West Virginia I'm a question on the meaning behind the laying of hands that's described in the viticus so on the day of atonement and with the blasphemer the laying of hands seems to indicate a transfer of sins and impurity but in the New Testament is typically an ax with Paul the laying of hands and sending out seems to accomplish different role considering Paul calls himself a blasphemer prior to his conversion is there supposed to be a connection between these two practices thanks for all you do guys you are the best
 FedEx Elijah no no no no you are the best and press the occipital a if I can remember correctly your hypothesis is in the end it's not clear explicitly not explicitly stated what this means that the laying of an on a hands is saying this thing that I am touching is now I'm associating myself with my representative in my place and appointing it as a representative of my place so an association of a representative on my behalf and so if that's the case then that's the corn meaning that score meeting then the logic works for what the priests to do to the goat as a representative and also what called us with
 who does he do with like about the laying on of hands with Timothy and then it happens when Paul and Barnabas are sent out from I forget what church is Antioch they lay their hands on even though the end result is very different right I got to go as a representative is going to go and like wander in the wilderness Ozark hold on but even with in Leviticus there's two different and ceremonies there's the single hand press what you do for a burn Ascension offering or for the purification offering or the guilt to reparation offering you put your hand on it one hand and you yeah it's just your hand upon it and that's part of the richest not explained what it meant do then you get the day of atonement and it's the double hand press in the pipe rescan
 what is the sins of Israel over at placing them upon it and that's the coat that goes into Exile then you get the guy in Leviticus 20 for the guy who pierces or curses God's name everybody who heard it puts their hands on him here and then he is taken out into Exile outside the camp and executed and then you get these laying on of hands in the New Testament question is does the laying on of hands inherently mean a transfer of sins well that only accounts for one maybe two of all of these right what would account for all of them is disappointing of a representative yes and what it means is that the placing of the sins on the goat is a little sub variation within the bigger meeting which I think makes sense of the day of atonement in the day of atonement it is the sins of Israel our sins are not represented by this go and instead of us going into exile
 the blasphemer story is fascinating but he is a type of scapegoat yes yeah it says if they have all been defiled by hearing him curse the name and so they take their corporate or the communal impurity and place it on him and he is exiled and dies on their behalf like the goat Rozelle it goes into interesting but scorn meaning in all of those regardless of placing sins are not is the appointing a representative Elijah was doing with well maybe do something with how I used to be a blasphemer is trying to figure out a way how does the laying on of hands transition transferring some sort of guilt but you don't have to figure that out if bling on the hand isn't strictly about transferring Gill it's about transferring a representative Authority
 he said if that representative is going to Bear your guilt or fear you're calling that's the difference with Paul and Barnabas with the church that sends them instead of the whole house Church going on the missionary Journeys they sent to representative and they represent you know that church on the road out there that's that's the idea about representation for coordinating the next we have a question from Sarah from Australia hi to enjoy and it's Sarah from Sunny Sydney in Australia thanks so much for the work that you do with Bible project it makes a huge difference in the lives of many people I have a question about David Hyman specifically the two guards and I'm wondering is there any connection with kind and I
 Kane who is sent off into the Wilderness and able whose blood is spilled on the ground thanks again
 oh that's really fascinating observations wonderful observation holy cow okay is there something there we are just in the middle real time also why were you recording this we're recording a series of conversations about a theme video on the first play the first time in Naples on the brain is already on her mind about that story more recently so Cain and Abel they give us access to God God chooses Abel sacrifice our favors at the detention on it first makes Cain jealous and Cain killed Abel in the blood of Abel has spilled on the ground and it calls out and there's this like this this idea of the blood crying out begins here it's a very Vivid image of the blood on the ground but then there's this Vivid image of Cain being sent into exile
 and what she's saying is look at the two goats there's the same two things happening one goat it's blood is spilled on the ground on behalf of the violence of humans and the other girl is sent into Exile now it's interesting though is Kane sent into Exile but he's protected this go to send Exile and you don't get a headache has any sort of protection I don't want other details when when God speaks to can and says your brother's blood cries out from the ground you are cursed from the ground this is Genesis 411 following when you work the ground it will no longer give it strength to you you'll be a migrant and a Wanderer in the land of Exile
 McCain said my phone is too great to bear
 we made a word study video about a phone and what's fascinating is one of those when I caught up with the bad words in Hebrew one of the three big words for evil is the word usually translated iniquity
 what's fascinating is Ivan can refer to both the wrong action and to the consequence for that action so what he says literally is my phone which can refer both to the thing I did to my brother
 and the punishment of getting here consequences being assigned to him so you could read it two ways he could say the wrong that I have done is too great to Bear meaning how can I bear my sin which is the end it's the verb to Bears this to carry NASA Hebrews NASA to lift up and it's the word used of animal sacrifice on behalf of they carry your scent or they carry your iPhone it's a standard phrase in Leviticus vehicle language to talk about himself as a carrying the consequences of his wrong for his brother so even his language is as if he's a talking goat in the moment saying I can't carry I can't carry the sins it's too much and that's when God has mercy and doesn't give him the death penalty but so you're right
 here is in the Cain and Abel narrative we're already it's a story being told with an eye towards the day of atonement in Leviticus butt off in the net as you read through the Torah it also works for word so that when you get to the day of atonement you're meditating on a theme you've already been invited to think about many times over throughout the Torah and that's of when humans do evil it defiles the land such the God must respond to it and you can't ignore and so the two goes act together as one symbol that's divided into two one go tinters in the dyes and therefore can enter into the presence of God with its blameless life and then the go bearing the consequences is that cuz I'll do but that's a pattern that's already been at work and how God in the outworking of God's response to human evil throughout the earlier stories that makes sense yeah so what
 are we supposed to reflect on with Kane & Abel that Cain is in some way like a sacrifice but he instead he and he is sent out into Exile but you get $0.02 with cents with the goats that the go being sent out to others L is going to die Edition with the ritual is filled out more with more detail cuz you need to if you're going to turn into going to do a sew in both the later Jewish collections the mishna and there's more specification of what to do with the goat and I know at least one tradition that I forget if it's in the mission Earth am both is that pushing off cliff Gary mission that shirt actually. Make sure it's because you don't want to wander so but Abel's the sacrifice to this is righteous blood
 so to speak is crying out crying out before God and God hears and feels to it so somebody wants us to see ology between those two moments in the Torah and to meditate on them is kind of what we're doing here
 okay so there's a lot that there's a cool moment to meditate on that I think we don't have time to really do that whole yeah thing proper but answer the question yes yes there is a deep connection and actually this connect to our next question which I just put the two together but I was amazed that is Cain and Abel thing came up and so many questions and so did this next question which I will let Abraham offer more again articulate my name is Abraham and I live in Klamath Falls or my question is about episode 6 about the day of atonement last spring my college group studied the life of Abraham in Genesis and when you guys talked about the two goats one sent into the Wilderness and one for the sin offering it made me think about how God ask Abraham to send one sign into the Wilderness as a sacrifice the other in Genesis 21 and 22
 is that significant if so does it change how we understand the narrative or the law thanks for all you do the last both of these questions this makes me so happy as wild okay yeah that's clear
 hello
 maybe elaborate on what he saying the way to go Abraham short answer is yes it's significant and yes I think it should inform how we understand both those stories and the laws and now they're connected had an eye towards Ishmael and him being sent out being like the like a goat or the Isaac being brought up into up the mountain to the holy place and being sacrificed on Parallel of the other guys and all of its various parts have been coordinated and coordinated so that you're really just cycling around a core set of ideas
 weather here in the narratives about the Cain and Abel or are they were ham or in the ritual symbol narratives of Leviticus we're really just cycling around the corner where the Bob Moses order of Aaron his son's it's just on replay Melody so here it's you have a key figure Abraham who God has elevated and chosen blast he and his wife and make a royal mess of things through all these rivalries producing two children out of their engine in rivalry and abused and so what God does is require the lives of both sons but also restoring miraculously the life of both of these yeah I thought almost at the Forum in rescuing from their parents then so 4 ish mail
 he and his mom are exiled to the east Into the Wilderness but then spares their lives at the last moment and so they map clearly on to Kane the the nachos and firstborn whereas the second-born is chosen but that's the one who is got also demands his life to be a sacrificial offering and then God for the Twist of Cain and Abel is God provides a substitute
 the dyes in the place of Isaac on the mount what's happening on the day of atonement is another iteration of exploring these themes of its yahweh's judgment and mercy
 and it's responding to human evil it's interesting when these stories are rift on it's always love variations has Kane and Abel Cain murders his brother makes his brother the sacrifice out of his evil in the Abraham story it's Abraham's evil that has God ask him as a test to sacrifice the evil character the younger brother Isaac and then we get to the goats now you're just like this theme is there and you're thinking about okay human evil sins being on these goats one being brought up into God's presence as a sacrifice one being sent out yeah yeah and
 yeah it is it the continual pattern is that human evil and humans failure is dealt with in these two ways of one through a righteous representative that's the one being brought in the goes before God to end and receive God's mercy paired with her matched with this need to banish and do away with evil once and for all by sending it into the Wilderness but what's interesting is with Kane God's comes to him with opportunity to confess just like you did to his parents you know what and where is your brother and when he sends them out he puts the sign on him to protect protect him and so is similarly was Ishmael the Exile of Ishmael Hagar is also the kind of Mercy because if they stick around there is just going to be a really abusive and means that right so it's this tragic necessity and what God says that I'm going to bless your smell
 any protect them in Exile and you provide some water in the world so are you don't get the sense of the go. This is Israel's going to get like yeah she might like some water in the wilderness under what does happened to that go because he has protected Ishmael was black the next one of the other sibling sets in Genesis that we didn't talk about but that's for sure connected in here is Jacob and Esau one of number when he saw comes out of the womb what what is Mom says about in is the year
 which means Harry it's the word goat what's the word for goat the word go. Yeah Harry you do hair do Terry and so the two goats on the day of atonement called Sayer which is what which is one of these thoughts names so when you read me the day of atonement your Busey Esau in the ghost that exiled to me just like you saw is so the David is bringing together all of these themes of these sibling rival stats and what you're all about this complex response to that's the bottom that's the bottom of it is it's the complexity of God's response of an fronting evil banishing evil standing up for their for justice for those who have experienced The Evil Within the same time forgiving and allowing people to
 beer established relationships God who have forfeited that through their evil in this tension and you can see it in the goats but now we're meditating on it in the way that happened with Cain and Abel yep and Isaac and Ishmael and then with interesting then is with the gospel narratives present this and other fascinating ways we've explored this with the to Jesus's
 the Cheese's is One Pilot if ever this Jesus bar Abbas and then Jesus Son of Joseph there's two alternate titles there's two figures name Jesus in the other person the other pilot says should I know it's my custom to release a prisoner every year at Passover do you want Jesus bar Abbas which is Arabic for Son of the father who's the guy who's the actual criminal and then Jesus of Nazareth who is innocent and what they all say is give us the guilty one give us Jesus bar Abbas
 is Winchester County you have this twin Duo thing almost like a sibling kind of thing one place of the other so you have the innocent who dies in the place of the guilty but then you have Jesus who you both. It's so he dies like the goat that is selected to be sacrificed and have his blood brought into the holy place but then he's also taken outside the city Jesus Jesus says he dies outside the city which you know whoever wrote Hebrews map that on to the exiled outside the city so he's both you both go both ghost that's an interesting Insight but then you're also saying the moment or Pilot says with Jesus do you want are also supposed to see kind of a to go thing going on the innocent the innocent and the guilty of because on the day of atonement one do is blameless that's the one that dies and then
 one girl has the sins placed upon it and that's the one that's exiled but it's yet another creative twist we're innocent jesus takes on both of those space while the guilty Jesus bar bus goes free super interesting so good job everyone right now it's makes me yeah I think once you start to read the scriptures with a certain mindset skill set and you're looking for unified language and ideas across all the different parts you really see it because it's really there yeah but if you're not you're not forcing it or look for that you won't and stuff for me it's just rewarding cuz it makes me feel like the speaker Community that's learning along with us as soon as we're done reading the Bible as ya meditation
 okay we got a question from Jessica in Wisconsin named is Jessica and I live in Appleton Wisconsin in Leviticus for the author mentions that if someone sends unintentionally they are to bring a center of purification offering to the Tabernacle I'm imagining that every person would be coming just about every day to make a sacrifice I am mostly just amazed through this example alone how much blood and how many dead animals are required to uphold the levitical law how is it even possible to even partially uphold the law thank you for all you do that they actually got to eat these animals to like not some of these offerings they couldn't like the burnt offering right that thing just gets fired Up and Smoke Rises and it's gone but some of them it's kind of like you're treating it like The Butcher Shop yes and you're like you get to partake in India animals for you just to
 yeah yeah what about what about the this one about the unintentional sins which which one is that oh well that's actually any of the three sacrifices that a ton ton provided tell my friends are for unintentional sins okay for intentional send does there's no
 it's just that's not covered. So once again it's a great example of how if you're going to fill out a comprehensive system you would need a lot more specification to cover all the varieties which is again what later Jewish tradition does in the mishnah in the talmud as they cover the section okay so here's the question did every Israelite bring an animal for every you know everyday unintentional infraction everyday I don't like keeping a towel at today I was three goats you know and and you just kind of doing that then I think you're right thing is we don't get that impression of how the system actually worked yeah yeah I'm in in practice in fact we don't actually have a narrative that talk in detail about how many people were coming or how often it was which is it
 Cadillac Maurice question earlier
 that the rituals are there to explore the ideas through the mail at cycling of the melody for meditation for the reader not to tell us how the system actually worked in practice we don't know was it possible that you just bring
 one goat every every new moon yeah we just don't have that information of how the system worked I haven't done and I'll probably at some point I bet there's more information in second temple literature about how people thought about the practice in the system in the second temple. Cuz they were doing and it was economically viable it wasn't bankrupting hello they end up sacrificing your whole flock so there's some way which the ritual was effective and meaningful
 but it seems like probably you weren't doing it everyday
 and there's just gaps in our knowledge because the tortoise the traffic that's one factor another factor is I know for and I don't know if this is just Protestants in my experience cuz it's mainly the Trish and I have personal experience in but there's often this moment when we come across all of these laws especially the ritual laws and we think like this is impossible how could anyone have done this and I want to make sure I'm not just importing my own kind of cultural Prejudice or not things about you just got things about myself like I have disowned in turkana are you talking about the the the thought of the reason why these laws are so intense has to show you how it's impossible to please God through your own
 efforts so every time I kind of kind of but I think that sense of impossibility all can also translate sometimes is too we read all the lies and we just think that's just too much too much for anybody to do right and it doesn't seem like that is ever an idea that entered the biblical authors buying or were even most juice whoever wrote Express when Jewish or Israeli authers talk about the laws of the Torah they celebrate and they love it there so thankful for the bank before it and they see it as a way to life and so I just want to make sure that when I look feel the strangeness and the overwhelming pressure to bring all the sacrifices that I'd it doesn't seem like that's ever have any Israelite experience really good cuz you could get this brooding sense of of like that the
 the Tabernacle system is just sucking the life out of community that give me all your good give me your goats and give me your and like and it's like always got to appease this thing versus the sense of a joy in being able to participate and being like I get to reconcile with a friend and then we get to bring I'm going to bring this this offering and then we're going to have a feast yeah like these kind of like moments worse like I get to be a part of this for example I was just as you talking it just brought the end of Psalm 118:2 my mind and it is actually in the section begins with what people say about Jesus when he rides into Jerusalem blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord
 blessed is the one blessed are you from the house of the Lord and in the poem here it's about the king coming to participate in a sacrificial liturgy walking up to the temple during the week of Passover that's what Jesus is Jesus the Lord is God he's given us light gives us light Genesis one so buying the festival sacrifice with chords to the horns of the altar you are my God I give thanks to you you're my God I praise you give thanks to the Lord like I stopped bringing the sacrifice because they do it that Yahweh has given this opportunity to them
 to make to be reconciled and to have peace with God and that's how they experience that's when Israelite authers talk about sacrifices that's what they feel they don't feel that but it definitely is not the thing that's crying like a weighty burden than other just like man I have to get this over with you so I want to get to the place where that's my default way of experiencing these these laws and I just I appreciate your honesty Jessica in naming the feline cuz I think it's something a lot of us feel too so let's look at a question from Rowena in New Zealand
 distance from New Zealand I was interested in what you were saying about the sacrifices and how the blood of the blameless animal represents its life and not it's Dee and I wondered how that changes how we see what Jesus is doing when he institutes communion and essentially says to his followers this is my blood for you to drink do you remember this point in our conversations with the symbolism of the blood and there's no weird
 that we talked about drinking the blood of Jesus ya stick of weird but you sit back and you just like that depends on the angle that you're coming from. From one angle that's our luck cultural education and upbringing it weird talk about drinking blood however in many cultures it's not so I just happened to be at some event and I was meeting somebody who's a really skilled and accomplish like bowhunter here in the state of Oregon like he actually has like some on some awards for bowhunting skill
 but somehow we got on to the topic of like you know when he's dressing or her and cutting apart you know an animal out in the wilderness than you know how for them away to honor the gift that God provided for him in the life this animal is 12 as it provides food for sampling for a long time but also that he feels obligated to use every part of the animal towards some productive and and not just leave stuff in the field that you doesn't leave anything out there and he takes a lot. He takes a lot more than you would imagine okay and but what he was talking about for example was the blood and he was talking about its nutritional value and then he starts talking about all these other cultures they start naming them that just yeah because it's such a such a precious resource so of course was prohibited
 because of the symbolic value attached to the blood but my I guess my life is an idea of drinking blood is abnormal heading down your social work I got it yeah I'm with you I have a revulsion to it as well but it is it is not weird and some other cultures send the logic of the Torah blood represents yes life and just to be clear we were talking about icky passage in the chapter next to the day of atonement chapter in Leviticus so David Thomas Leviticus 16 in the chapter afterwards Leviticus 17 is a series of laws for the Wilderness generation saying whenever you butcher any animal
 bring it to the tenth and dedicated life in this Blood Yahweh and then Leviticus 17:11 because the life of the flesh is in the blood
 I have given it to you on the Altar for making atonement for your yourself because it is the blood are English translations really struggle statement for the blood It Is by means of its life that it provides atonement Blood by the means of its life so the point is I think than our conversation and that's what your tracking on Rowena is the explicit symbolism attached to the blood is not death as the main point is that it is life and of course it's the life of a creature separated from its body separated from his body through death or just want to clarify I'm not saying that the blood has nothing to do with death breaks the primary emphasis is on the the blood is
 a representation of a blameless life but the way that that blood and that life gets brought into the holy of holies or to the holy place is through its death the death is not the foreground it's surrendering of the blame is the way the blood became detached from the body and the blood itself represents life correct that's right the life of the animal you would look in a bowl of blood and think that's alive or perhaps you would depending on your cultural position background but this is a deeply biblical idea which I can't even fully wrap my head around which is like there is the aliveness of it is this what they're saying
 for me to be a living being which is the Breath of God in Me That animates The Flash to animates my flash in the same way I could think of it that way when I have died there still a living element which is represented in the blood in some way my life the blood is life it's the stuff of things review and provide in a modern vehicle of the oxygen of the breath of the night they were honest and how it works but the blood the blood is the life so the blood assumes that the animal has gone through death and by surrendering its life is precisely through the act of surrender unto death that the life can now enter into and appeal to God with with his blamelessness not the
 the essence of the symbol so when Jesus is talking about my blood he is referring to his coming death but he's referring to the death as the vehicle the means by which the princes live life blameless life will cover for the sins of the many and so when he invites us to drink his blood he's inviting us to drink his wife which is why wake me up in Eastern Orthodox liturgy there's a close connection of drawn between taking the Eucharist bread in the cup and eating from the Tree of Life in both cases your ingesting life life Yogi the Adam and Eve it's it's Jesus becomes both the new humanity and the Tree of Life giving us his life to ingest for ourselves so that this is on life with a death assume that the
 and I think that's what that's what's going on there question clarify and meditate on the meaning of questions from Emily and Canada hi my name is Prince Albert Saskatchewan growing up I was taught that the best approach to Leviticus was studying at four types and Auntie types that point to Jesus
 well I've never been entirely compelled by the Supreme Court Judge especially as it doesn't account for what the average Israelite thought about Leviticus reading the spoke with hope the New Testament seems unwise how much should the New Testament influence how I read Leviticus I appreciate your response and I'm so grateful for all the work that you do
 quick question how would you restate your question my hunt Emily and maybe it's just personally I resonate with it from my own Journey with being followed Jesus reading the Old Testament is in the first classes I took about the Bible that the Christian College I attended I wasn't invited to understand Leviticus on its own terms within within its own narrative contact symbolic logic it was sort of like the book that you go to when is sensually you want to explain what happened to Jesus on the cross right and so you refer everything to that and you just you hopped in the little kiss and think about the symbols in that way so and I think that's the common approach in many Christian traditions and so I guess we're trying to model I guess it in two ways one we're trying to really get into what's that
 check context of these rituals and what do they can buy but also what we're doing with the melody is trying to track how Leviticus is actually working out to hyperlinks in there to patterning like the stuff with all the siblings of Genesis that in its narrative and literary context Leviticus is exploring the key themes that all of the Torah and the prophets are exploring and the New Testament authors are drawing and filling out and continuing on that the process so I think the way I would talk about my own Journey Emily is that my first acquaintance with Leviticus was very much like what you're describing which would be like okay so Jesus had to die as a sacrifice oh let's understand that because there was animal sacrifices the Old Testament where was that Leviticus okay let's
 find the verses that help us understand that Jesus was sacrificed reading it and thinking about it but probably not as a whole and we're not at trying to understand its literary design and message and what it's trying to communicate within the context of the Torah or I probably that's not good you're not going to be that interested in all the different types of sacrifices there were and how those all relate to all the themes in the Torah the Purity rituals are going to feel kind of bizarre yeah stuff like that and that's how they work to me for many years so one way that I've tried to imagine
 the project that my life turned into a witch is trying to recover the way that Simeon or Anna who are featured in the early chapters of the Gospel of Luke how would they have read and understood the scriptures are Leviticus in the old man righteous and devout devoted to the Los totora and he was it was revealed to him that the Messiah that his Bible pointed to would be revealed in this day or Anna the prophetess who hung out praying everyday in the temple how did they read it understands capture because they firmly believe that pointed to forward to their need for an anointed deliverer for Israel and Humanity they just didn't know what person that would be and that's what's reveal to them so I want to read Leviticus and see what they saw and understand it and those two
 and then what I think that does for me is it reverses the flow it's dead of reading the New Testament back into Leviticus it's the reverse is that so that I'm not reading the portraits of Jesus in the gospels and seeing how they draw upon the image in my imagery in language of Leviticus to portray Jesus and it's more of a relationship of continuity the gospels come down stream that supposed to know it's reading the Bible as a unified Story the lease in which case you're going to come out with many of the same observations that you did way back at the beginning yeah I think you'll just find them then if it or contacts or richer more more nuanced more Warner connected yeah okay so
 her question very explicitly was how much should the news has been influenced I read Leviticus well follow Jesus the only reason she also asked to read Leviticus without the New Testament mind and will you were just saying was like well I mean no like Simeon yeah that's how he read it yeah yeah it's almost like what a gift that Simeon was so saturated in the rituals and the literature of the Torah so that when Jesus came he was able to connect this. Let's write her to the Hebrew letter to the Hebrews very similar you could experience what he's doing there as he's just kind of picking out of context passages from Leviticus then saying Jesus did that but I don't we could sit down with that author whoever they were
 I think they would describe it as the opposite and stay everything that the Leviticus was pointing forward to along with all the tour and the prophets is what supplies the categories for that author to make sense of Jesus in the first place about is the Bible as Messianic talked about the Bible as meditation literature and his Messianic literature and this all gets back to what we're doing that this is Messianic Linda sure they're supposed to meditate on day and night and will give us wisdom and connect us to God that's right which isn't to say that every Israelite that participated in these rituals in the wilderness understood all of that what we're saying is the authors who have woven Leviticus shaped it
 to have the format does within the Torah that all of it is a part of a message that the Torah and Prophets are communicating and that's what it mean a Nana saw and when they read their scriptures what was on top of mind for them was who and when is it going to be yeah that's what they that's what they got from Reading their Bible where the stories where Jesus talks with the on the road to Emmaus is in or you just like let me tell you about how how I'm in in yeah all these stories yeah that's right when he went to his disciples and then he taught them how the whole Hebrew Bible was about him it was fascinating there at the other end of Luke's gospel beginning so they're very expectant and at the other end of the Gospel you have this man and woman couple two on the road to the Mass
 and they have no clue they were clueless cuz for them if Jesus dying to them was the failure of all their hopes not the right filmont of the scriptural hopes and we just had to show him how ya you if you can see it it's actually they're in their scriptures to write so the manner of Jesus fulfilling the scriptural hopes to his death and Resurrection was the twist in a surprise to many he saying it's right there in the Torah and Prophets and Psalms if you have eyes to see it you think Jesus would have looked at the day of atonement with them at this point it's like I can't go anywhere in the store in the profits and not find the same basic things like Cain and Abel. So the same ideas that's what's going on
 wonderful questions there's many we can get to you for sending them in imagining someone is may be sent in my five questions we've never gone to it I'm so sorry sorry many of you sending questions there's a lot to work through so when we do our best to highlight the repeated ones and anyway we just man and everybody thank you thank you both for participating in all so many of you send really encouraging like notes to us email or whatever and we're just we just celebrate how awesome Jesus is the scriptures are and that we get to be in the community it's learning how to read meditate on these texts elitist Jesus what a great what a great thing to be alive so thanks everybody all the best and we'll do another keep an eye or with the numbers scroll down the road
