hey John we're doing question response episode to finish off our conversation on the theme of the first yep yep also known as the last will be first the last will be first is were the first one that came out of these conversations was named the last will be first yeah so we got a ton of questions from the people listening along and you chose some of the ones that roast the top in terms of being asked the most and will just get into it let's let's rock it first you found there was a discussion group on Facebook talking about the podcast series which is totally cool with you and you found an interesting comment from someone who's Japanese grew up in Japan and so I think
 I want to open with this cuz it just itself will be a fascinating contribution to the conversation and we looked up the pronunciation and I forgot is it Rekha Baker so okay Pieology is not knowing how to pronounce your name all right so the comment is hello all I've been listening to the firstborn series and I cannot help but feel there's something missing from the discussion I live in Japan and culturally the concept of firstborn is alive and well and dependent and this is interesting because it's not in our culture less so what's up yeah it's not a big deal but Japan is Alive and Well we should say we live in the subculture with in America has many cultures I'm certain that we're at the big elk example Japanese-Americans shorter it's a totally big deal with the fur
 foreign idea in Japan has more to do with duties and responsibilities and with privilege
 it is the first one's duty to provide and protect the family it's their responsibility to represent the family and stand or fall for the family I see these duties all through scripture and since I'm in the middle of a sermon series of Passover are the duty of the firstborn is it to represent the family and Punishment and the need for Redemption and that's really strong and that story so Tim's work on this team seems to be all about privilege and Status will not following through on the expectations who gets the right of the firstborn in terms of Duty so how would you write about these two yeah thank you so much yeah yeah for was for that input and if it's mainly been focusing on for the kids but certainly just part of my own limitations of the human being cultural limitations but at the same time I know we have at least I tried to name as I think I did name
 responsibility is a really big part of this but maybe it's our own cultural location where my mind specific it goes to power and privilege which is it a thing in the biblical story like very much so especially when you have this is figures like a ham who are trying to get into the position of the firstborn the ham pattern that we called it in the series or like David Sons like in the beginning of 1st Kings are all jockeying for who gets to be in the position of King so you know they want the gold as they want to be responsible but it's for sure about power and being the first one so I think more it's probably just I am over empathizing the power and publish theme but you're absolutely right like the representation of the whole family having to duty and responsibility
 is for sure a core part of this team as well so kind of wraps wraps together all those things so I'm not sure anything needs to get reconciled I think more it's we could probably go through all the stories we went through and have paid more attention to the duty or responsibility see him and having someone from that culture represent that as you go through the hole, cuz I was just missing someone for not contacts like Riker would notice details in the texts that are invisible to me and I just a quick note that is part of the goal of scholarship is to read other people's Reflections throughout history and present on whatever the subject of business case the Bible that's why I try to do that as much as I can but there are only so many hours in a day and we're all indebted which is a great reminder of why it's so crucial to read the Bible and community
 yeah you know also I just a quick sign out one way that we are moving towards that here a Bible project in the last year is the development of a team of Scholars that I am a part of here and it's really exciting kind of for Francis y'all have heard if you follow the podcast for a while y'all know about Chrissa Gwen on our team but we are in the midst of a new phase of recruiting and building a larger and more diverse team of Scholars and I'm really excited about it okay so yes you'll be hearing more of that team that actually from people on that team you know in the future of the podcast but the gold is precisely that we can within our own team be able to represent multiple points of you like what bracket is bringing up here so thanks okay there were a lot like a lot of question sentence
 so as always we're probably only going to get through a few but there was a clear like winner terms of the question that Rose to the top that's what everybody's asking at least dozens of people and so we might spend the most time you and I are still talking about this Iowa with your I guess question is about Adam and Eve and in the Garden of Eden Story how dumb is Created from the dirt first in the narrative and then the woman is Created from the side of the atom second little later in the story and so there are lots of questions about what is the order of the firstborn is so crucial in the biblical story goes from here are we meant to meditate back on that relationship and see the role of women religious man and woman relationship
 so I just wanted to open with actually two questions asked by actually interesting Lee both people from northern Europe one from Laura from Ireland and then Ludy from the Netherlands and they both had ways of getting a question I thought were both helpful and then we'll just kind of session question for a little bit okay I I'm Rudy from the Netherlands for a while now I've been pondering what Paul means in 1st Timothy two forces 12 to 14 when he says that woman come teach or assert our authority over Men He links this to Adam being formed before Eve yet whenever God chooses someone to lead his people and have authority he doesn't seem at all concerned with who was born first so clearly I missing something here no I know there's a lot of debate about these versus but I haven't found much on this particular question so I'm curious to know what
 you're taking this thank you high Bible project team this is Laura I'm from the US but I'm currently living in Dublin Ireland my question goes back to Eden is the theme of the firstborn present in the relationship between Adam and Eve on page one of the Bible we see God commissioning both male and female image Bears to rule his creation then on page two that introduces and ordering of human Creation in that Adam was created first and God created Eve from part of atom which the Apostle Paul actually references this order in his first letter to Timothy so is it appropriate to consider Adam and Eve through the lens of the theme of the firstborn thanks so much
 okay is there a question and I think to summarize is both questions are saying hey when I read 1st Timothy 2 + 14 where Paul is talking about he refers to the narrative about the creation of Adam and Eve are the order of is he riffing on the firstborn steam because what he's talking about seemingly is power dynamics and that's the first one things about it he's also talking about who came first in the story so it seems like yeah seems like paws is referring on the firstborn thing yep potentially question question is how how is he mapping on to that because the patterns we saw was that often
 beginning with a cane and able or perhaps the star rulers in the land rulers when God Elevate someone to a place of responsibility Authority receiving the blessing the god often bestows that honor on the latecomer was the second born in a way that makes the first timer or the one who ought to receive that position you know yeah angry jealous you know what have you so that's the typical patterns the question is that happens with Cain and Abel all the way through out how am I supposed to understand that the story about the man in the woman in the garden then and
 what I would think is this the man or the woman sets the pattern the latecomer is the woman in the story it's so am I supposed to see her is elevated in a special way over and against the Mets what I would expect that's what you would that's what you might expect and the question is well is that the way anybody in the New Testament read the story while you're all commenting on that and he doesn't seem to highlight that and if anything some people take Paul to mean he highlights the opposite so that's the puzzle so these are really big topics complex text so we don't this would take many episodes sort out all the pieces but let's for the moment just observe in the in the Garden of Eden story and I'm taking back to we had long conversations about this in the family of God maybe I could try to summarize that what I remember is going on
 yeah because so God makes the a dom. Dom and forms out of mud you in the Garden of Eden Story begins and Adam is alone and he sees the animals all have the ability to like reproduce in pairs and Dom doesn't that puts me to sleep and splits a Dom the kicks inside takes one from his side's and then create woman and then and we showed me a number of times is What God Says is I want to give you an Acer yes and the Hebrew or either it often translated helper yeah radically
 inadequate English translation helper makes you think of like a helpmate I like an assistant yeah razor means like a savior a delivering Allied right now with Angela other this person that you cannot survive without the reason we know it means that is you simply have to search how that word gets used throughout the Hebrew Bible following Genesis and the most common person that refers to is God coming to rescue or save somebody who's in trouble or its use of humans coming to rescue and save another human who is in trouble and it was really clear here is a Adams in trouble to the degree that he can't multiply do the Earth without a partner with which to multiply and to do the Earth that's right and another's the commission given in Genesis one is for human who is one Humanity species that consists of male and female those
 two are the one Humanity only one of them cannot fully reflect the image of God Authority creativity the Abundant generating life of God of which both are an image together and that's what we learn from Genesis 12 right was it between 7 and 28 twenty-six to twenty-eight ski where God says he created Humanity in His image male and female betta gave them them male and female authority to let them rule this was for both apni s011 thought I have about the theme of the firstborn is that in the firstborn is typically about which sibling are we going to trace the line of the Messiah from got to choose one sibling to have the blessings and within the Savior could come that's around that line in other words that that differential between the
 to firstborn of the second-born is something you need outside of Eden house outside of Eden because it's the problem that generated through our mind being stuck outside of when were talking about the Christian man or woman in the evening narrative there's no problem yet the only problem is that it's not good for a human to be alone only problem is they're not generate New FBI exactly yes and the first one things always around siblings and Adam and Eve are framed as siblings this unique very unique relationship of A1 be coming to becoming one become one again which is not what siblings do ya siblings come from one they are to come from one but they don't become one again yeah we go and start their own thing that's right man will leave his father and mother and be joined to
 come on with your life so I think what is happening is that the first point theme is showing up but in a unique way that we didn't spend a lot of time talking about which is they both have the authority to rule God doesn't choose one of them over the other you need both the threat will God doesn't need both but humans need to consist of two in order to be fruitful and multiply and rule the land together yeah it's red so when there's a sequence of atom
 you know what comes first in the story and then a woman is Created from the side of a Dom or from half of a dime to to become to the order is there what is interesting is it's the second one made woman who becomes the delivering or rescuing agent for the first without whom the whole thing cannot work so not sense it is something of an elevated it was special place but it's not right already. There's also the detail and let's do this is place cappadox I know we can just talk forever about this where and I'll bring this up that the woman was the one deceived by the snake so talk about that really quick well in the Eden narrative and it is well past interested in in 1st Timothy Chapter 2 where God gives the command about not eating from the Tree of knowing good and bad before the man has been blind
 can a woman that's when the singular human received the command then you get to sleep in the division of the man and woman then when Genesis 3 begins the snake comes to the woman at the tree and when the next says you know did God really say you know you shouldn't eat from any tree of the garden what she says we can eat from all the trees of the garden there's just that one in the center that God said don't eat from it and you shall not touch it you like what is weird because she repeats God's command but in this kind of misshapen way in incorrect why so what that creates is an opportunity implicit in the story is to say well if he's knows about the Divine command it's only because her husband told her
 but it seems like you didn't tell her in a very good way cuz it's like a distorted version of a command at least you can put together that set of ideas from just a face value reading of the story and almost certainly that's the little set of details Paul is drawing attention to the 1st Timothy 2 yeah and so in other words the reason why Paul brings up the order of creation is more about how one learns the God's commands and wisdom and whether or not you should be teaching before you've been taught that supposed to dressing when he brings up the Adam and Eve story cuz that's what's going on in the churches in Ephesus that he's writing to Paul's words don't really reflect on or make a comment on the whole roll of responsibility Authority and firstborn and the first who's the first and who's the second
 taken to mean with that but it's not necessarily what he's drawing from the Eton is in there too if you wanted to trace chase that down more just kind of check yet where would you go look at what Paul might be too many important and controversial text in Paul's letters I have learned most and best from a couple scars what is the by Ben witherington his book that the commentary on 1st and 2nd Timothy and the letters of John called letters and homilies for hellenized Christians but he has excellent discussion of First Timothy and its historical and cultural context and in the literary context of the whole letter I've learned so much from his books he also has a number of books on women in ancient Judaism women in the time of Jesus and women in the New Testament letters odds he's off
 also lose the puppy yet the illusion is written on on these things and how to repair our project to teach a class on 1 Corinthians she's done a lot of work on the role of women in Tulsa letters than in the Corinthian letter specifically so in her book rediscovering scriptures Visions for women he has a really great discussion about both Genesis and about a 1st Timothy Chapter two places to go if you want to want to dive deeper all right so the next question comes from Craig in Australia by Tim and John this is Craig and I'm from Melbourne in Australia I'm hoping that you can unpack Genesis chapter 48 with Jacob while suppressing Joseph Children takes Manasseh and Ephraim has he's earned then crosses his arms and puts a free and a head of Manasseh what is the significance of this act
 what are the repercussions in the greatest story and how does it fit into The Narrative of the firstborn thank you again for everything that you do yeah great question excellent excellent yeah man that narrative in just 48 you just you should know the narrator is just winking at you the reader the whole time like in terms of narrative patterning and hyperlinks so in one sense remember who Jacob is Jacob is the second second born from birth was clawing at the position of the firstborn who famously grabbing at the heel of his brother from the beginning and then not just that but then he and his mom you know you're in cahoots trying to get him that position that's all the thing about tricking and deceiving Isaac with the food and all of that
 so in essence what you see Jacob doing here is
 replaying for the next-generation what he had been doing when he came out of the room which is usurping in reversing the order of the first as for the rest of it interesting it's like here we have Jacob as an old man repeating his grandson's what he did to his brother earlier on in the story that's one that's one piece another piece are these are just us two sons so these are half Israelite half the Egyptian was Joseph Married An Egyptian woman Asana
 and he's adopting these two sons as his own sense and this is why Manasseh and Ephraim are named among the sons of Jacob has he gone for the story from here what's interesting is that ephriham is the second born but he swapped his hands to make him the firstborn and it is has to be relevant the f g name comes from the Hebrew route to be fruitful and multiply. Fruit and his name is fruit devil fruit that's why I am so he's got the double fruit so he elevates the second-born whose name is devil fruit in the first one and then what's interesting is the word for when he crosses his hands the Hebrew words to calve
 but it's a word play a homonym for the same Hebrew root for what the woman sees the tree is good for gaining wisdom by a scale from a related route so what's happening in that moment is the woman is doing what's good in her own eyes and she sees the tree is good for a scale that she takes from the tree and so in a similar way here now here is Jacob repeating what was good in his eyes from an infant
 all the way up to him being an old man and it's like he's up to his old tricks again he's up to his old tricks but in so doing even his old tricks have some role to play in the providential plan of God not the got cost them but that
 the tribe of Ephraim is the tribe that's going to primarily represent Joseph is he gone through the story and so you're going to have all of the really really important people come from if Ryan is he come on through the store and you know people like Joshua and Samuel and so on so that's right there we didn't touch down on it but it's right in Jacob up to his old tricks. Good job Craig
 next week. Question from Daniel in Tennessee Joshua from the tribe of Joseph and Kaylin from the tribe of Judah and Esau or both singled out as The Descendants it seems that in the short-term Joshua was elevated at the favorite sibling and leader of Israel in the long-term Jesus come from The Lion Judah Daniel good observations nice work so Joshua yeah he is kind of the hero of the day he received the the Baton from Moses the next girls named afternoon but
 it's Caleb line where David come from a guy cuz we're also told that he comes from the lineage of Esau as well find this out in the number squirrel so he's actually half Israelite half Edomite so in a way he is Jacob and Esau together in one
 realest yeah he's so he's a descendant of Jacob that is through Judah and he's a descendant of a descendant of Esau
 we're not his backstory is not told like how did he come into the tribes and when did he join in sorry he saw Jacob Brothers the brothers that's right so how's your son of Jacob if he's a son of Esau through numbers 30 to 12 get Mary back in or something no it's about that his own lineage check out numbers 30 to 12
 we're told that Caleb was the son of Youth Luna the kenizzite and so yes you're right he's a kenizzite and Kenna's is one of the descendants of Esau but somehow he married into the tribe of Judah in such that he gets chosen to be the representative leader of Judah spot one spice to go to the land yeah he's an honest realizes married in May is realize because Jacob is the one who becomes the father of Israel correct Jacob brother Esau his lineage becomes another Nation the look up tennis tennis is the descendants of Esau Genesis 36 so what we don't know is it is Caleb a kenizzite fully and then he met
 I didn't remind you that or was maybe Caleb's mom was from the line of Judah and his dad was from like we don't know about the Manchester the point is is that has multiple things going on here what's interesting is Caleb and Joshua are not rivals in the story the partners together
 when you get into the Book of Joshua Caleb and Joshua do play important similar and contrasting roles they both get a special plot in the promised land for Caleb to Hebron and there's this whole really interesting story about Caleb that his daughter is Super Bowls and awesome and she comes in she asked off for like extra inheritance in the promised land and that's a whole story but both Caleb and Joshua are honored but Joshua was the one on the main stage where Caleb is just is awesome in the Book of Joshua he's just not figure whose
 on the main stage so I don't think the Rivalry Dimensions turned up between them but it is interesting that of the two sons that get elevated the most in Jacob's blessing for Joseph and Judah and then you get a whole book attached to Judah
 did you get a whole book attached to one of the sons of Joseph name the Joshua and how he rescues Israel from Giants
 and lead them into the promised land and then later in the profits you have a whole book dedicated to a seat of Judah who rescues Israel from Giants so Caleb Joshua Judah and Joseph and then you get Joshua and David these are all ways of highlighting these two brothers them both were used by God and blessed in important ways but the seed of the woman and even then can only come through one and so you come see Kaylee comes through Caleb and David so on but it doesn't never spill over in that conflict look up which is pretty cool so good observations Daniel
 okay Tara from Florida has questioned hi my name is Tara from Orlando Florida I was reading the story of korah's rebellion and number 16 and thought it fit into the theme of the firstborn is this accurate also how does the fact that several Psalms are annotated as being of the descendants of Korra fit into this theme it seems that even though God and I just his Justice on cora for the Rebellion that God still elevated him by mentioning him and his descendants with in the Psalms thank you for all your help I'm so grateful for everything that you do especially this podcast and the classroom Tara great question such as the school okay let's go to numbers when we were covered numbers in the year we did the journey through the Torah on the podcast
 I did try to highlight this but number 16 Begins by naming actually multiple sub-tribes of rebelling against Moses and Aaron in Numbers chapter 16 and so just real quick the first lines it says now Cora the son of its higher the son of cohas the son of Levi
 so this is one of the
 great grandson of Levi along with Dustin and Xavier on the sons of Ella off and also own son of Pella from the sons of Reuben they all rose up against Moses and are going to speak out against Moses and Aaron who were given three groups groups or three people three groups call Cora from the Sun to Levi he's the group oh well he's going to represent his whole family and then there's the song and Avi rum then their own hell yeah what time is he from you know what I put this up before
 and okay that's right so it doesn't say here there is an eliyahu's from the tribe of Zeppelin In the question is is it the size that the same Elliot does possible but it's not explicit what's interesting is that the first is from Levi Cora and then the last guy mentioned here on is from Ruben Ruben is actually the first Jacob's friend for him and was fascinating is this guy on from the tribe of rude and is only mentioned one time in the whole story and he's never brought up again and this is this is so it's as if these names and then you just disappears so just that fact alone that a guy from the firstborn tribe of Jacob is brought up among the rebels
 only in the introduction has to be a little hyperlink signaling that we're in the territory of firstborn rivalry here so yes Tara for sure this is being viewed as a rivalry of multiple tribes including the firstborn tribes from Jacob rising up against Moses and Aaron what's interesting is Cora is a Levites but Moses and Aaron are Levites to so this is an inner levite rivalry but then the mention of on the grandson of Ruben signals that we're at this is now a tribal rivalry of Sons of Jacob so that's that. So things don't go well for Cora know you could say that he and his family could be created I'm laughing cuz I'm uncomfortable but the you know the local Cosmos spot wherever they were in the wilderness is D created in a big way cuz the ground
 cracks open backs up in this light and swallow us up the rebels and then fire comes and consumes 250 other Rebels The Joint these guys so that's a sad end to the Rivalry so you can move on from the store gun like a man the sons of Korah if there's any left
 black timer for them this is now part of their ancestry so low and behold and you're right Tara there are multiple sub collections of Psalms in the Book of Psalms that are attributed to the descendants of Korra the sons of Korah and some of them are some of my favorite that we have turned too many times over the years so for example Psalm 46 just about how the river of God makes God City full of joy even if all the cosmos falls apart in the flood and Chaos that God City yes it's an amazing place and they had a front-row review of
 the world falling apart how the world that's right on 4748 so there's many more so yeah it's even just their mere presence in the storm scroll is tells you is that there is some kind of redemption story about the line of Korra that's pretty cool. It's a how this all these little hidden detailed gems in the Hebrew Bible In The Deep End right now but I keep thinking about just like the the real we're getting deep. Getting ready to get nerdy but that's the good life according to Garrett from Texas you had a cool observation that a good question hey Tim and John this is Garrett long from Denton Texas I had a question about 1st Samuel 20 verses 11 Jonathan
 the firstborn son of the king invites David to come out into the field with mirrors language from Cain and Abel but unlike Cain Jonathan makes a covenant with David and try to protect him from his father saw who is himself an iteration of Kane is Jonathan an anti Kane and an anti Saul thanks y'all cool design pattern there yeah way to go that's a double gold star if I was like your Elementary School teacher and you would ask that on the paper or something I don't you love the Goldstar Goldstar here's the thing you must have such a bad memory of childhood and getting a gold star at some point you didn't know I was a really poor student mostly like the CD student all the way through my brain turned on in college
 they were a handful of times that I got gold stars and I can close my eyes John and I can see it that's that's what it is I think because it was special yes to me cuz I really want to give that moment I so rarely got the clothes
 but now I'm very liberal with Gold stock and I want to everybody feel like I have a good stock yes yes and yes to have the first born son of the first king
 come to David who was the last born son bring about a field elevated over all of his brothers already so it's already like David is the latecomers eightborn who gets put in the position of the firstborn and now saw is being like Cain to David and you would think oh well if this is the first born of saw that it's going to be even worse and sister Samuel 20 is riddled with the language from the Cain and Abel story of the all to invert it and it's a super super cool and there's this cool thing where they work out a signal where David go hide behind that rock and if my dad says this is I don't have my assistant fire three arrows 3 call about test of Johnson's loyalty to David
 and then he goes out to The Rock and instead of murdering him in the field he actually says I know that you're going to become my King Sooper super clever in version of all of this so yes we do Garrett the principal there is it's your so many layers deep into the cycle of this seemed that the biblical authors can just pull select vocabulary from earlier cycles of the theme and the point like you're using this language if it's Jonathan anti can an ant I saw so biblical authors are constantly wanting to help you understand what's happening by inviting you to compare a character a moment to earlier characters are moments in this is what hyperlinks are so you're supposed to both contrast Jonathan and his dad fault and that's a whole set of wiper length comparison but then also both of them are set on analogy and contrast
 in important ways to end this we're getting even more someone out this house is qualify for this nerdy we getting nerdy still
 this feels like we got a little more shallow water over me I don't know why it feels like deep end of the pool yeah and we just swam into like the way you know I felt the deepest end of the pool was oh yeah yeah with the Levites Caleb and Joshua a little bit but this story is it feels like such a simple story
 Jonathan and David their relationship and the connection to the firstborn theme I don't know I just feels more approachable and we are one or two more okay let's rock a question from David from Massachusetts and Tim my name is David and I'm from Gloucester Massachusetts about the theme of the firstborn in John's prologue in its view of Genesis 1 John connects Jesus that identity to the word that was with God in the beginning and a light which came in the first day of creation I might John be seeing the theme of the firstborn at play in Genesis one with a human is the latecomer but the word in the light where the first manifestations of God's creation how might this related to the relationship between humans and wisdom in Proverbs 8th or the relationship humans are supposed to have in a body in the word of God as in Jeremiah 31
 thanks for all you and your team to a David well done with a gold star for you to know I have to get milk do you find more age-appropriate okay high-five diploma high five okay the great observations I love how you put this David so the word God's word and God's light are the first ways the god comes onto the scene Creation in Genesis 1
 and then humans are those the right the last thing to come onto the scene in Yosemite creation story and in John 1 Jesus is introduced as the word of God that is God and was with God and that is the light shining in the darkness and then the culmination of that opening part of John is and the word became flesh to con-con flash imitates the word and light first human last John one word in my first becomes human at the conclusion so that's a great observation so but what's interesting is in Genesis 1 the word in the light is
 is the God's God's word of God's light and then humans are an image of God so they're not Gods but they are an image of God and where is John trying to say both things at the same time in terms of staying the the God's word does with God but also distinct from God trying to create a distinction in our thinking that something can the father and the son can both be God even though they are distinct from one another as the lights
 God said let there be light but so is like light appears in some way but we've also reflected on that what is the light that appears the Sun not protons are photons and it must be the light of God himself so we just let there be light just stopped at Something's Happened. It's that God himself is just entering the darkness entering the darkness yet so and just real quick as you look back to hyperlinks that reference back to that moment all throughout the Hebrew Bible New Testament that's how they viewed that that it was God's Own
 glorious presence manifest and light it is lights we have life and so in the same thing with the word that's of God that's God's word and it's not something you know in a way it like it is coming out so it's it's it's happening but it's not something new it's a foreign God himself has threatened the word in the light are parallel with each other that collected on day one of creation and God said book word let there be light and both and you think both of those are parallel in that they have both of them have a source both light and words have a source in like the mind or in the source of a light source but they also radiate out a word goes out from the mouth of the speaker Radiance somehow even though I didn't know about photons
 and they didn't debate whether is a wave or particle that they knew that light radiated out from a source yeah and so they're parallel in that way that I do a first born and that's in the world of that theme it's always someone created first when we're talking about light and word I'm trying to understand only thinking of it as light and word being created
 it seems like there's a Nuance here with the light in the word are just being a bike now the light in the radiated are God's like yeah God's word so there is no first born the light in the word aren't the first born they're God Eternal yeah like the darkness but if you meditate on both of those images they do have some kind of Duality to them where there's the thing there's the source and then there is the thing that is sent out from the source yes and that's implicit in the images themselves and John is going to make those implicit ideas explicit when he's going to talk about the word God's word being both God and with God that is somehow distinct and the thing that goes out from God
 I'm in there when you means with God when he is going to map on God and the word to father and the son that the father's the one who sent out the Sun
 where do I not created but what they do bring about is the environment the cosmos in which humans can be recalled to be an image of God and John one hits replay on all of that
 but makes what was implicit in Genesis explicit the God and the word are two distinct persons within the one God and then he's going to wrap it up even and say and the word in that light the can't outrun God became human so now the human image of God is God and the one who was with Scott and yes 3131 is great because it's about how Israel for most of its history Jeremiah thinks hasn't been faithful to the word of God Express through the commands of the tour and so he anticipated a when God's word and command is written on the heart of God's covenant Partners so that no
 Israelite has to say to their neighbor hey you don't let me teach you how to know y'all cuz he says they will all know me and John in the Gospel of John when Jesus says in John 17 this is eternal life that they know you and me
 so it it really is the way that humans are brought in to that Eternal communion of love between Father and Son is by allowing God's love and wisdom to be written on our hearts to bring us into Union with Father through the sun is powered by the spirit that's really remarkable meditations on the nature of reality and human identity God I think I need to go take a long walk right now that's how I'm feeling
 all right last one is Lizzie from Texas from Temple Texas I noticed it in some ways John the Baptist has the role of first born this is perceived by others sometimes as a second born in comparison they both have miraculous purse that John comes first and Jesus also starts his ministry later I feel that Jon shows a good example of a first born giving up his authority like in the Gospel of John 3 vs 29 through 30 where John says Jesus must increase that message Kris do you think the gospel writers intend for us to see this connection between John and Jesus thank you so much for your wonderful administrating Lizzie what a great question I feel cold starkovich Lizzie I even just the way you set up the question I think you know you know you know how to grade your cell phone.
 pictures of gray and what did he go to Great powers of observation lisy at 6 actually right interesting the volumes really turned up on this and Luke because the stories of Zechariah John's dad Zechariah and Elizabeth and the story of Mary and the angel that sent to them what the Angels say how they respond to the angels the timing of the birth that's all set up really closely as a comparison
 which leaves the reader to wonder what the comparison would be between John and Jesus the gospel authors themselves really elaborate and build up on the comparison between the two so when you come across with John says John the Baptist says in the Gospel of John
 Saint John 1:15 it's John testifying about Jesus
 and he says this is the one of whom I said the one who comes after me
 he is before me because he was before me
 so this before and after language here so he's technically born after me but he is before me in status or rank because he was before me and the word play on the Divine name I am he was I am the Jesus will say later he'll Echo the Divine name with seven I am statements in John and what John is staying here is playing on that but putting in past tense to say he was before me even though he came after me feel like a little bit oh yeah you know what school is the audience picked up a couple of examples Jonathan and David and hear John the Baptist and Jesus for the firstborn theme is sorted in a way yes yeah that we didn't look at those yep that's totally wasn't time yet but I love that I mean because there's hope you know like
 I think John the Baptist it is easy I mean I think we should reflect on the fact that what human nature is is if you have some of power. The Baptist had a following yeah accrue he had it he had asked already and for him to just so quickly relinquish to identify like oh like I need to serve this other thing and to get it and two that have that humility is something to be celebrated as it's really hard and it's easy to just pass up because it's like a full of course because it's Jesus and you know but like that reverses the Rivalry yeah reverses the Rivalry yeah yeah precisely at the moment that like the ultimate firstborn arrives on the scene the true first born or thought that the firstborn over all creation the true first born gets a sibling of sort who older sibling does the right thing I mean
 but it's so yeah we're inverting the Kane the Kane & Abel pattern it is super cool it's helpful in terms of the character reversals but also it's helpful
 because we have so many listeners of the podcast who were going on and reading the Bible and they're like seeing how it works in your work is done now can just grow and become totally but I have a bunch of stuff I want to keep you figuring out too well then go do that I'll do as well we love hearing your questions and I suppose half of these were questions but that were mostly we're just really great observations yeah and let's actually let's really celebrate that because one of the things that we talked about internally is a is a desire a vision to see a multiplication of Bible nerdom of the meditation picture and seeing the design patterns and finding joy in the connections and then threw that gaining God's wisdom and learning how to flourish and follow Jesus and so it's really encouraging to see people doing
 and and enjoying it and so yeah thank you thank you everyone
