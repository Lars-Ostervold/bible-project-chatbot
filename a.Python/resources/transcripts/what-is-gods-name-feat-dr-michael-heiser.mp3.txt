is a Jonah Bible project if you've been following along in the podcast you'll know that we're in the middle of a series exploring the identity of God in the Bible how the ancient biblical Riders thought about what it's like to experience a Transcendent God you been listening long you'll recall that we did a question in response episode where Tim referred to dr. Michael Heiser we have the privilege of hanging out with my Kaiser here in Portland at our Studios last week to talk shop and get it outside voice in a script writing process while we're hanging out with Mike the topic of the name of God came up this something we talked about on the podcast before the name of God is an attribute that becomes more than an attribute and as soon as we start talking about it I realized that we need to record this conversation with some really good stuff here. What does it mean to take the lord's name in vain what it means just take the lord's name in any
 capacity and other related to taking the name of the beasts which is actually the phrase use the Revelation talk about all that and more a little bit more about Mike his Graduate Studies at the University of Pennsylvania in ancient history and then he did his doctoral studies at the University of Madison Wisconsin in Hebrew Bible and synthetic languages which is the exact program that Tim was apparently a scholar in Residence at La God's Bible software which is north of Seattle in our neck of the woods you got a lot of great books if you haven't read the Unseen around I'd recommend picking that up yes I had a brand new book out on Angels oh and gives it on podcast the naked Bible podcast where he a weekly against very nerdy about the Bible who was a lot of fun to have them in the office I hope you enjoy this conversation here we go
 okay we are going to talk about the name Hashem and heat them in Hebrew in Hebrew of the name as a theme throughout the Bible now in the god series that we've been working 30 we spent an hour talking about many attributes of God in the name was one of them but an opportunity to dig it deeper and partly because we have here in the studio with us the dr. Michael Heiser I might go later if you've been following the gods series conversations I've reference Mike's books and podcast multiple times so he's done a lot of those scholarly work and getting good scholarship on a popular level about Heavenly beings the spiritual realm in the Bible and then specifically about the the Hebrew Bible roots of the
 holiday the Divine plurality of God's being in the Old Testament that is the seedbed of what eventually they called the trinity in the New Testament and actually this topic is a key is the name the name of God in the Old Testament and then the way Jesus appropriate and takes the name in the New Testament yeah I found a lot of people don't realize that the Old Testament has a number of passages were for lack of a better way of putting it it's God as man or a man in the Old Testament and that provides a framework for what we see in the New Testament of the Incarnation the Trinity for sure in Carnation is often seen as a Christian Innovation some surprise that just blew everybody's categories cuz there were no categories for it and they're dead
 the opposite the category is where well primed for people who grew up on the Hebrew scripture is that the Incarnation was a comprehensible idea and it was even an anticipated idea where they would not have said what in the world are you talking about I mean we want to embrace that we think he Jesus of Nazareth this the one that that's right you see where the Trail Ends Here with the Incarnation so we are all good. That's the train depot where it ends in the storyline of the Bible yeah and then specifically let's really focus in on this idea of the name name and I just feel like there's a treasure Trove in there that I don't fully appreciate yet
 and I want to like it in your heads and figure that out so the name like I have a name you guys have names we named things it's just a common way to be able to refer to something so we all don't get confused so when you say the name of Yahweh and one since we're just talking about the way to refer to the Yahweh we talked about this too but in the series we've explored the fact that Elohim which is the common Hebrew word that gets translated as capital G God right and also Lord has the lowercase G gods or Spiritual Beings so tell him the category descriptor word are not a name not a name for a title that refers to a kind of being a being of the spirit realm and so there are many El Hitler many Spiritual Beings in the Bible and so the name of God becomes really important to identify the particular spiritual being whose story is told that the Creator and ruler
 one way this is what you said is a reference to his creator and King of the universe that's one kind of ground-level function that the Divine name play is the element Creator in case there's something operating in the Old Testament Scholars have called the name Theology and it is in part near touching on the Divine name brand of the four consonants but it's also to John's point it's also sort of a more comprehensive identifier the name Hashem in Hebrew is another way of referring to Yahweh himself not by name but sort of as a as an individual as a person. I don't know if you won't give any names for a professors at the UW but there is one is one in particular when it when I was going through that we all got the little lecture about what happens when we encounter the Divine name in Reading text and what to do and what not to do and
 so hit his instructions at the time were okay when we're reading texting class and you come to the Divine name I don't want to hear anyone try to pronounce it so you either have to have the choice of saying I don't know I reach means Lord which is the name I think he just wanted to instill in us a little bit of the the honorific sort of Aura of the Divine he didn't flip out on us if somebody forgot that he would sort of acting offended or something like that but just disorder reinforce that little point but it was my first introduction to the concept of him being away and not another way of referring to God to you know y'all way the god of Israel himself and the reason why there's a variance on how you say the name is because of the respect that people have.
 academic debate but there's also a sort of a religious phobia in if that's the right word in Judaism about pronouncing the name because of the ineffable Leti of it while we can't really pronounce it because we don't really know how it was vocalized and that's that's good because we're not supposed to pretend that we kind of have a chummy relationship with this Transcendent being their number factors that go into it but for me it was an introduction into something I encountered later in Deuteronomy there are there places in Deuteronomy that talk about you know God tells Moses now you're going to go into the wine you're going to do this and that and you're going to go to the place where I will put my name know that the place where the Lord God shall establish his name in the third person you are so where the place is in Deuteronomy 12 and I will make my name to 12 make my name I was in God's name is a entities that can live somewhere that the point is not
 we're going to get in the land and then God's going to show us a place to scroll four continents on the ground and say well that that's the place now that it has nothing to do with with spelling or vocabulary it it's it was a way that of expressing that the idea the only get in here God is going to choose to dwell Among Us in a particular location sort of foreshadowing the temple so the name again God talking about his name was a way of God talking about his own Essence his own presence being located somewhere yeah and I'm just done something I do I don't talk about my name that way we don't refer to it and I don't I'm not the mic you know it just is very far and you know way of yeah you wouldn't like to leave our Studios and say hey guys I'm heading back North but my name will be here right here which wall did you ride on
 what is there is a sense of saying I'll be with you in spirit we do have that like you know I know I'm going away but I see no the memory of me or something of me will remain here is it simply that's always talking about I would say it's it's a little bit more because when it comes to their passages that describe the name as though the name were a person you'll like what like the name gets angry the name has no lips of Fury and one place and Isaiah the name. That's important to read to have an effect on one is the beginning of Psalm 24:9
 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble may the name of the god of Jacob set you on High may he send you help from the temple and give you support from Zion to Clines it's more than memory there yeah so mail May the name of God set you up on high and then the next product line is may he referring back to you both and you could say God help you met his name help you but that's kind of an odd thing to say some trust in chariots and horses yes but we trust in the name of name of the Lord Our God. So it's more than what they said something like I would say like going into battle in the Name of the King we're doing this for the names and it's like for the reputation for the sake of the
 because of him we're doing this but it's different in that trusting isn't there yeah they're the name is something you represent I'm trusting in it here the noun Hashem the name is the subject of verbs doing things the name is protecting you while I'm out here hacking my enemy with the sword if it's more than I'm I'm remembering the king yeah it's believing that his presence is actually going to help you in some way he's going to be present with him in the way of talking about God's physical felt presence somewhere which is why did these Temple references are important Deuteronomy forgot the name takes up residence there and when I go meet a time what am I meeting at ICU the glory Cloud I See Fire maybe and I what am I in countering and then these texts the name text something is just
 it can be referred to one waiter for into this the name is this and I think I asked you this before Tim and I don't hear from my ears just unique in Hebrew thought this way of talking about someone's name I don't think it's I don't think we could say something like this is unique you do have the use of the name of a deity you know another place is sort of represent you have to take the place of the deities presents so it's it's not sort of a whole cloth invention is real part it would have been you know familiar to others who would have heard Israelite talking about this order talking this way they would have been caught the drift in our earlier conversation I had this quote from a German Old Testament scholar David it again in German
 geology but you have a whole section on the name Sivan whatever 70 years ago and he was clued in to the uniqueness of it he said the name Yahweh was committed in trust to Israel alone among the Nations is referring her to the tradition of the burning bush sure as the revelation of his personal name to the people he's going to liberate in the name alone lay the guarantee of yahweh's Nearness of his Readiness to help again the burning bush story I am with you. Says what's your name who are you I am with you to rescue a WeChat
 Vaughn Road goes on this name shared directly in yahweh's own Holiness for indeed it was so to speak a double of his being so it had to be treated as wholly in the very heart of Israel's worship to call on the name was equivalent to true worship of the one true God so he is there at least I'm talking to burning bush door is but that story is itself the uniqueness of the name it's I am we can a person is being referred to when we look at the command I'll show you know the English translations Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain it's actually not take but like I'm going to rip something from your hand you know it's never business on which means it's a bear or the carry Harry the name right so it's this idea of
 peripheral are the Ten Commandments have no other gods don't make any Idols don't hurry than the name in a worthless matter in a worse way it really does stand out like in a way that's kind of like it it just seems inconsequential compared to people and by the way don't I don't cuss no idolatry and keeping the house clean I mean to make it just as serious enough to Bear the name of God as an Israelite that there's there's an aspect of ownership there of belongingness that you you belong to me and therefore when people interact with you they need to come away with a high reputation of me and you're you're representing me
 like if I if I go out I say why you know I'm here in the name of you know faithlife okay my employer what that's an easy illustration for us to understand how a person in this case me represents the assembler in this case a corporate entity will it it's the same idea here you Israelites were representatives of the most high of Israel and I get there you go to the whole Imaging concept you guys have been brought up before just this sense of family belongingness you know you're a part of this group and it goes right back to this command so it was if it was a big deal yes so you're doing attention to make it crystal clear this is an important concept for me so the English translations take the name of the Lord is not the most helpful Hebrew verb NASA which is to carry for bear and so to carry someone's name means to function as their representative to carry the name of Yahweh in vain
 falsely is about misrepresenting a person a person we get the same idea in the Name of Christ depart from iniquity you're a bad representation of the one you claim to follow if you're living in sin or something like that you get the same representational idea because we're supposed to be conformed you know his disciples of Jesus to his life than in congruous you to be in soon since you name the name of Jesus you claim to be following him and being a you're the image of him
by the way we're using the name in this context is the standing for God and awaited the to refer to God and there's something else happening in the Hebrew scriptures where the name becomes more than that and you read a Psalm but it seems like you're in the Ten Commandments it's really just it's not named Theology and nearly it Dragon of reference to something it operates along side of what we would think of his name theology it does have a connection to name theology with a one-way thing about the name even calling Yahweh the name using the name instead of the actual personal man it's the way of doing that Transcendence Eminence thing that we've explored in the series here honoring the wholly other nests of the being I'm referring to but that being wants to be known and is numb and accessible to us so we used the name
 the name can live in the temple this was probably going to talk about a minute in the name lives in a being called the angel of the Lord but in this case it's that Yahweh even commits his name to a people to become physical human representatives of the name I'm going to do the name is going to dwell among you cuz when you go to the land the Lord is going to choose a place to set his name and he will be in your midst you and he will be your God and you will be his people and then the flip side of that is since that's true since you have this personal god with you then you need to be living in light of that reality and representing him carrying the name it could take you in a number of directions the whole your sort of Priestly role that Israel was supposed to play yeah it to other Representatives
 actually there's so much about the Moses Torres tied in here in the golden calf story win
 the people Worship the Great the First Command and then is this whole wrestling match where Moses intercede on behalf of the Gods and treat him he says listen I have known you by name you and I have this very special thing going I can just walk up into the living room on top of the mountain now therefore if I have favor in your eyes let me know your ways that I may find favor and remember this nation is your people you've chosen to represent you and bear your name the really terrible at it right now and then God said my my face my presence will go with you and I will give you Moses rest
 then Melissa said but if your presence doesn't go with us don't lead us up from here and then this is kylan how can it be known that I found favor in your sight and that we are your people isn't it by you yourself coming with us so that we may be distinguished from all the other people's so that you yourself you yourself the idea of you always personal presence represented by his name carrying the name is the thing that distinguishes God's covenant people give me the contacts within the context of their Journey to the land yes often times when I'm introducing this topic you know to a group or in a church or even in a conversation I'll I'll ask a question will who was it that took the Israelites out of Egypt and into the light and if you actually begin spend at the time maybe if you're having trouble sleeping you can do this evening if you actually take the time to to look at it will who's who is the Fig
 who does this in the Old Testament you actually get for options sometimes it's Elohim you know who does this sometimes it's the Divine name Yahweh who who does the other times it's the presents and other times it's the angel you actually get all four options and and that doesn't mean that the biblical writers are confused it means these are all different ways of referring to the same God who is in charge of getting them out of Egypt and taking them to the land and then we see it play out in the famous passage about the angel in Exodus 23 talk about that another key passage in this connection so we have the name living in Temple we've had the name as a way of talking about Yahoo M self you can do stuff to you and the name is something that Israelites are supposed to carry Faithfully as a way of representing God himself but then there's another being
 in whom the named Wells that's really important in this connection
 sir Mike what makes this passage in Exodus 23 23 guide uses this is right after they receive the law so they're they're about ready to get going here he says behold I'm going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared be on your guard before him and obey his voice do not be rebellious toward him for he will not pardon your transgression that's an interesting line and why won't he pardoned your transgressions why why why is he special to the end of the verse says well since my name or because my name is in him so God's telling Moses that essentially that I'm going to send this angel with you again along the way to me to be a help be a guardian again probably again a supervisor and in some way did the sort of a visible tangible
 means to remind them that I'm making the trip with you that would they be picturing for them angels are just people looking things that show up so they picturing like they're going to some guys going to come like who's that guy oh that's the angel he's the one that's going to lead us when he shows up in the Book of Joshua Joshua 5 because Joshua approaches the commander of the Lord's House is he's named in the international that's key he's called the ruler of the Lord's army are you on you know yeah and then they have this conversation in it and it's really fascinating because the the figure here
 actually says there's no you know I indeed and come now as captain of the host of the Lord and Joshua fell on his face to the earth a little freaked out and bowed down and said to him what is my Lord to say to his servant in the cap in the Lord's host said to Joshua remove your sandals from your feet for the place you are standing is Holy and Joshua obey. Where are we meeting this is one of the commander is described this is something I discuss a little bit and unseen realm he's standing opposite you know Joshua with his sword drawn in his hand
 and it's an unusual phrase in Hebrew and if you ask again if you're having trouble sleeping this is the kind of thing you do you look up the Hebrew phrase and it only occurs to other places and those two places are the incident with your Balaam and his donkey where the angel of the Lord has the sword drawn in his head and then the other place when the angel of the Lord is is judging no people in it when David takes the census end in both of those instances he is called explicitly the angel of God by the angel of the Lord in here he just gets a different title and we know that again because of the way that you had a man yuck it's called the captain the captain ruler of the Lord's host and and then is associated with the burning bush and by the way if you read Exodus 3 who's in the bush and Angel it's Garden the angel they're both there angel is and is distinct from you
 the Divine name Yahweh suspicion that the writer kind of knew what he was doing so the angel who named God put in him to lead them through the Wilderness stories in the wilderness stories and he shows up in that story about Balaam which is when they're in the wilderness for 40 years but know what it would appear what the people see is the fire stick fire in the cloud which is over the for Joshua and I hate you just to see a little bit at the end of the trail when they fail in the Book of Judges and judges to the angel shows up there basically says hey what's up you didn't do what I asked you to do yeah and so I'm out of here you're on your own now and that's why they all all the people weep and that's why the name of the place is called both team which means a weeping angel
 need a sword against the spanking at the end that's right take so long to adjust to an angel shows up and says I brought you out of each other and led you into the land what's the problem here and I said I won't ever break my Covenant with you I was his Angel is a joke we've already been introduced to this in so many store is that this Angel is and is distinct from and so all the way back to the angel at this place a visit and is distinct from and he's given the name Angels obviously show up in the Old Testament like Genesis 19 the whole Sodom and Gomorrah good moral story and they look like people in that particular episode their indistinguishable from men until they do something freaky like strike the city blind Lots like well I can't really do that so this there must be something different about these get you so you get these supernatural beings and human form
 this particular one is the only one is Tim just said is it's described in this way my name is in this one my name is in him and we also talked about how the name just sometimes looks like a person is their stories about that no that's the word that's the word word of the Lord okay in a day the name they were just a visibly is no stories like that well here is the name is in this figure out who a visibly right that's the connection that we're making their it's one of several ways were again God Appears in human form in the Old Testament you know you have the name you have the angel you have the word these aren't the only ones but they're probably the most your familiar and there's a reason why when you get into the New Testament the trappings of these descriptions are applied to Jesus Jesus is the word he is it in Jude he's actually the one who delivers the people from Egypt and need to take some to the promised land it's actually Jesus Juice
 yeah yeah do you want to go there yet or weed before we go in the New Testament as well as the name in him and he Bears the name and he manifested she did have seen the father has seen if he did has seen me has seen the Father the New Testament writers bring all of these copy each other again over and he's has a nest of the people wouldn't be hearing this and thinking while this is new crazy stuff like you know when what do I do with it then they'd know what is being communicated hear that now we have a man who was a born of a virgin of the we have the Incarnation idea we have somebody who lived among us into the word becoming Flash
 that is linked to all of these ways that God himself showed up and seen as a human being and so that the messaging can't really be any clearer this is where it all Led Led to this person being now incarnate new born of a woman but they have the category you know it into which this fits and so then they're forced to the decision do we accept the idea that Jesus of Nazareth who we know is actually the Incarnation of this being your God is mad and the Old Testament is this where the trail so to speak and with with him as Messiah and I was a big deal that they had to make a choice I had to make a decision but I think it's important to realize the Old Testament backdrop to this because the big stumbling block for a Jew when it came to deciding to embrace Jesus was if I worship Jesus if I embrace him and believe that he's God
 The Flash and he's the Messiah and he's the rightful King it because of what the Old Testament says in these passages and other passages they had to wonder am I violating the fundamental tenets of the Old Testament Faith which is the Lord our God is one I have an innate that was a thing that they had to realize that want to wait a minute I'm not really violating that because back in the Old Testament there was God as man visible but but that didn't mean that God wasn't in heaven you know you still have God transcend it but now you have God Eminence in in human form so there's this Tunis kind of thing going on and if that wasn't a violation of God's Own command then why would it be a violation now
yeah man just like four or five layers we could go after the last 3 minutes of what you just said. Wait a couple hours when we get to the New Testament with the Scandal that Jesus represented one layer was the claim you made about himself as being the god of Israel and bought it but it wasn't that category as such that was scandalous it was the particular Jesus of Nazareth making that claim about himself and his background and what happened to him that's represented the Scandal and the category was there the God can come Among Us in human fit retrospect but when he said before Abraham was I am yes they were like well there's a category for that but you're not him you're like no your dude your man know that but that's my point is what they're scandalized by isn't the claim that God could come Among Us in the form of a human it's that Jesus
 was making that claim about himself okay they have the category category exists it work like with unseen realm I spent a few chapters on this and I introduce people to a scholar who has now passed away but Alan Siegel was a Jew Professor Jewish studies specifically rabbinical material and he wrote a very famous book back in the 70s called the two powers in heaven and what he discusses in that book is hey you know our own tradition as Jews used to teach that there were two Yahweh figures there was again the invisible Transcendent one and then there was this second one who was the same in terms of being Yahweh but was also distinct in some ways
 and it was one of the ways that gets expresses the angel so you're single is tracking on this and what he what he wants to do in the book is that he has to really simple but profound question where did we lose this because this used to be our part of her in between the test before there before Jesus he never showed up as a man but they had this theology but it became offensive later you know especially after the crucifixion they're running around I say well this was the guy so this is why this example from the letter of Jude in the New Testament is great one cuz it's claimed to be written by Jesus brother in The Gospel of John who someone who is close to Jesus and that's what the writing a letter now and he calls himself a servant of Messiah Jesus means he's a full conversion of it
 I'm a pathetic my brother walked around saying he was caught incarnate I told him this is Creator and bodies is even in Jude verse for he just called Jesus the Lord and then in Jude verse 5 he says I desire to remind you all though you know all this that the Lord after saving a people out of Egypt brought judgment on those who didn't believe so he's putting Jesus said earlier that case closed in the angel Lord is Jesus
 well my playlist reincarnate Jesus the angel of the Lord in Hebrew Bible is Yahweh + my brother I believe was the human Incarnation. It's just before he was invited who delivered the people out of each other as this man is known as Jesus he actually travel through the birth canal and all that it so that's a little different than I was having a body towards resurrection and then and we can we then it's a bit of a tangent but then can we talk about what it meant for him to be with God in the beginning
 none of my pay grade. Now we're really speculation was Jesus conscious of his pre-incarnate I think we can answer that one not cuz I know because Jesus says things he does, don't know that takes us to the I think where we wanted to We can question because there is language look like when Jesus ascends to the right hand of God there are passages that suggests pretty strongly that that was a position formerly held that's right now he has a body right to be coming bodies and that's a whole other really episode of why the Incarnation was so important why you can't just skip that part but then he returns to a former status back to your conversation was
 the name rheology in The Gospel of John and then specifically in John chapter 17 where the whole thing comes together in a really amazing way go ahead if you're if you're there well there's two comments who was this Peter Ellis John 17 is this beautiful symmetry S7 S7 Parts seven movements to the prayer and the way each one of them really it's really amazing but the opening and closing movements movements 1 and 7 both have a statement of Jesus as awareness of Esprit Incarnation form and in the first movement he has this line where he says father glorify me with yourself with the glory I had with you before the world existed
 so he's remembering yeah a state of unity with the father glory in the last movement of the prayer actually the last line
 wrist 24 father I want those who believe in me whom you given me to be with me where I am so they may see my glory which you've given me because you loved me before the creation of the world so he remembers a state of Eternal Unity than glory and love and that's what we get paid for the birth canal is a unified community of eternal love that's the claim to be made here so remarkable Jesus reveals that and the way he reveals that in that I have manifested your name cuz I write the name if you can read if you if you had exposure to even a single book of your Hebrew Bible you know what God's name is meow
 3 burning bush story since you were a kid you know that God revealed his name you know how it's spelled you know you're not supposed to say it you know out loud so that isn't what she is talking about he's not saying hey I'm here and everybody gather around you know who shares with God's name is going on and I'm going to spell it correctly when he says I have manifested your name you don't have manifested your name to the man whom you gave me out of the world that's John 17-6 it's another way of saying something else John says in the same gospel that he that has seen me has seen the father you know what God is like you know who got it is especially you know just the other the whole lot of element you know what you need to know by God because you have seen me you've lived with me and I've lived with you
 and it's not just I did a good job you live in the way I shouldn't I do to make it back to her earlier he carried more than that but let's start there. The name Faithfully like Israel was called to do that failed to do to work over here in that in the Old Testament yeah I am the revealing of the name supposed to carry the name in the sense of being God's priests Angel was given the name the name was put in him which is another it's another phrase not caring the name is actually being put the name in him which is much more intimate
 you see that man out there that's me the way to say I am now you can tell I'm here because I'm appearing to to you in a day Jesus say he says What's the phrase he uses about the name father protect them by the power of your name the name you gave me a call your power is not a distinct from God of the name you gave me so the name was given I think for sure that's a reference back to Exodus 23 my name is in the angel Jesus says the name that he was given to me that's a similar language that they that that's going to be floating around in their frame of reference for rent and how is it how is this consistent with you know what God has revealed already always remember where he use that language before the main people can carry the name only one figure in the Hebrew Bible has the name in them such that it defines their identity that's the angel who is Yahweh
 take me out and hear Jesus is putting with this name language in John 17 puts himself my name is that name is the name that you've given to me
is another way to say this then to carry the name is to have God with you to have the name be given to you is to have God Be You
 is that only one person can say that it takes you into the ultimate end of sanctification where we first John three there's John again okay we hold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we you know because we are the children of God you know and of course John and he has and that's what we are that little parenthetical, and then he talks about being made like Jesus so there's this element of yeah we're going to be like him it's not like we become him and displace him or or like absorbed him or something like that we are perfectly and finally conformed to his image that the station so many different directions because you have the ID of Believers being transformed into the image of his son okay. Paul talks about you do have God dwelling inside Believers in the form of the spirit so it takes you off in that direction of the relationship of Jesus to the spirit
 why is it that Jesus says I have to a sentence of the spirit can come why does Jesus say behold I'm with you always even then after I'm going to go back to have I'm still with you for two or three are gathered in my name I'm in their midst and it's because of this again really fascinating relationship between Jesus and the spirit the spirit of Jesus Spirit of Christ spirit of God have interchangeable terms Paul says the Lord who is the spirit you know a couple times if it takes you in so many different directions and when the spirit when you realize that the spirit of God dwelling in Believers is the same deity that tabernacled in a with the Israelites in the desert are in in in Jerusalem and also that was in this Angel it links us with this hole in a set of set of ideas and it doesn't mean that God goes away or is displaced or is lesser needs that we are brought into the family where members of his body the body of Christ we are in Christ all these phrases are terms
 did the try to get at who we are now but who we will ultimately be in such clothes identification with Jesus do that he has to actually use this kind of terminology for still distinct so if people struggle with this idea of this visible Yahweh and he is Yahweh but he's distinct from Yahweh well in a Christian do you realize who you are because you're going to ultimately have to talk about yourself the same way we are so closely identified with Christ you know that we're like in him but we're not him. How do we even have that the prayer John 17 may they be an us the way that I am in you you're the best in me and you and them again try to to describe this close closest this is as close Affinity even ultimately when it comes to the same occasion and and glorification that we are made so much like him
 and we are in our modern Minds be like oh what percentage of we are you know the scripture never claimed it that we become, Jesus but it uses this language to so closely identify a time with him is to participate in the Divine do you raise itself is an introduction to all of these things build on your way we can spend a whole episode on one son of God language children of God language it's a lot of people I have found it it's sort of revelatory to them that wow the stuff that gets talked about in the New Testament like the vocabulary isn't like made up it's a drawers on something that went before it does if that's your intuition you're correct it's coming from somewhere
 another might be a way to land the plane or open another can of where is in the Book of Revelation there's actually there's two names you can carry there's two powers that you can carry the name of Yahweh by being in the watches all that another name for the Beast isn't that interesting language is used as the Ultimate Enemy you have this archetype of evil track it all down but there's even that anti Trinity in Revelation Adidas the father who's the who's the writer here but yeah so abused
 anyways in the American Christianity about taking the mark of raised we won't talk about that right now but one bomber is having the name of the Beast so you either bear the name of the Lord who is Father Son in spirit or you bear the name of the anime that you will want who is Dragon Beast it is the same price as it seems like I have them in the biblical mindset to have the name or the bear the name it is a sense of allegiant but it's way more so it's more than that in the Name of the King kind of language but then it's all so this weird mystical Union there's so many ways that the New Testament tries to express that
 in Christ with Christ dangerous to take the name of the Beast isn't just saying yeah I'm going to I want to dabble and doing some bad things it's like this Union with evil alignment and it can even be more Sinister than that you know it makes me think of some of the the enslavement language or the ownership language of Darkness over the over people that you get in the New Testament your people who are without Christ so that there's even a little bit more I think you're right now going on there Mike which of the seven letters at the beginning of the revelation end oh yeah here it is looking for Revelation to the Church of pergamum Jesus is speaking and the reward that he gives is this Stone that's a whole other thing but the stone has
 new name written on it and then you gives his people are invited into the reality of the name modern readers we kind of like a rock with the new what color is my invited into the the people of the name for the people of the name or lose it anyway I still feel a bit confused at how I'm supposed to think about the name feels like in your guys's mine is the name is a manifestation of God himself but in a world of many others of the word glory and so just kind of fits in this kind of the part of the matrix by D and major source of ideas which is typically operate
 this very clear like Wikipedia entry in my head where I like the name I get it but does this it doesn't do that it is this it isn't that but it seems much more interconnected with this whole just biblical Theology of god's complex identity of the other means of expressing the same idea also include embodiment you know cuz we have this name an angel thing going on with the word again in the Old Testament God is referred to as the word in several passages and he's described in terms of how do you get the word there you go I don't know if you guys have done the the whole son of man Cloud Rider thing but again it's is very answer from Africa language even the phrase son of man I want yeah you're over there it is your right so you get a number of ways of trying to express the same Tunis idea and yet these different aspects the angel of course there's a messaging
 son of man you get a rulership roll you get word again that's a revelatory roll I mean so you know God is doing all of these things in a way that interacts with people on a level that they can process I often say God has like two fundamental problems you know when he when he tries to relate to humans if God showed up just as the unfiltered Glory well you're probably going to die and this is a conversation kind of ends or process and the other thing is is you literally can't process like the unfiltered Glory like what is that and so it has some discernible processable form so smoke is good we can see that you know we know that is present unifier it but but it's often as a human being in the Old Testament so God has to sort of filter
 Excel 4, something familiar and also safe to have this relationship all right the name of God don't take it in vain don't carry in vain we have this line at the beginning of the Gods video released in our time yet maybe I will be when this episode released but there's so much here that were brought to the brink of the limitations of human understands how it always feels like however the point is I think many people reach that point too early there actually is a whole lot that we can earn touring you how the Bible's communicating to us the thing that we ultimately can't understand and so we're begin the video saying ultimately we can understand God's being but we can better understand what it is that we can't understand through all and what we're given disease images
 as Windows into the ultimate on them what's really tragic is why we don't teach people to read the Bible that way and some new Christian circles that are so devoted to know use the word literal ISM for she got to find what does that even mean but they're so devoted to this sort of surface one-to-one correspondence way of reading something that words like metaphor and symbolism Matrix of ideas that those are just like off the table the effect that it is it's really hard to read scripture that way and look at it as I'm supposed to piece things together it's a network of ideas into some sort of proof texting mentality that that's the only thing that they can really do because of the way they've been trained as readers and they're just cut off and so many other things yeah the way the Bible is actually communicating
 it's like that's my name
