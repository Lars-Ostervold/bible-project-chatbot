this is Bible project podcast and we're reading through The Sermon on the Mount we've been working through the nine surprise blessings at the very beginning of the sermon traditionally called the Beatitudes I'm John Collins with me is co-host Michelle Jones hi Michelle today we are in the last Triad it opens with Jesus calling us to be peacemakers great let's make some peace in the world that Jesus warns this isn't going to be easy get ready for conflict difficulty and pain if you are going to really become a part of these Kingdom communities in partnership with Jesus so peacemaking is seeking right relationships with our neighbors and our enemies what we're going to see here is that even with good motives peacemaking won't always be peaceful thanks for joining us here we go
the third Triad is going to essentially build on the first two I'll just read it and then we'll go for a The Good Life belongs to those who are peacemakers because they will be called the children of God the good life belongs to those who are being persecuted for the sake of doing what is right because theirs is the kingdom of the Skies the good life belongs to y'all when people insult you when people persecute you when people spread evil lies about you all on account of me y'all need to celebrate and Shout for Joy when that happens because your reward is great in the skies and because this is the way they persecuted the prophets who have all come before you what these have in common is building on the second Triad which is if you long to see the world made right and you actually take the ethic of Jesus of generous Mercy
 and go out there and do it from the right modus get ready to first of all get involved in arenas of conflict peacemakers he's summoning his followers to get out there and get in the Arenas of conflict where the generous mercy of Jesus ethic is going to do the most important work that's interesting that you would describe peacemaking as getting into where this conflict
 or just kind of probably cuz there's a part of me that reads like I'll be a peacemaker of just like you know like what is not you over there you can look too riled up the way you described it made it sound a little bit more like actually in a boy that's prime or I could do you like there is a lack of peace get in there and turn the chaos into something beautiful be present in the midst of Arenas a conflict so that you can introduce the ethic of Jesus as a resource that's available to help solve these conflicts does word in Greek is at any point us it's a compound is the Greek word for peace and payasas maker to make her two-piece doors so it's something that you actively have to create
 biblical peace is not the absence of conflict it's the presence of Harmony that's an order State Track Harmony of the work towards the peacemakers piece of something that has to be mad it doesn't happen in nature know the Things Fall Apart there is a very important boots-on-the-ground a reality for why Jesus would include us among the core traits of the good life of his kingdom communities Jesus lives in the occupied militarized Zone under that of all of the all the social contacts a person can go out down here there's a unique type of psychology and mindset that somebody would have if they grew up in a place that's their ancestral land but that's being occupied by
 a military an Empire from a land far away that you've never been to ruled by people that you'll never meet and they in the presence of their soldiers and their tax system determines everything in the life of you and your family and your friends
 that's super intense I mean it's it's difficult enough in our live reality yeah when a president you don't agree with isn't our cousin of conflict sure you know enough of like the people I don't agree with our aren't for me are now in power and there's all this frustration and conflict and lack of relax have peace yes and we're all we're all citizens of the same country in our lived experience of growing up in a modern Democratic Republic where we have these election Cycles right and so this is a cycle to our particular context and then it'll come and go and maybe it's your guy maybe it's not your guy or girl yeah but your point is is we no matter what context do you live in everybody knows the experience in some way of people in power and influence I've never
 in some way to determine my daily realities yeah and that is fraught with Teddy especially when you don't think they have your best interests in mind but you disagree with them so now you're trying to make an analogy that's hard enough as a fellow citizen who is a different political party correct now imagine a foreign country dictatorship a dictatorship yeah rules with violence and they're the ones now boots on the ground in charge within lived lived memory this is a hundred years ago they invaded our land was in my grandparents memory they invaded our land they re annexed and redesigned the map towards optimal tax structures to feed the resources of our ancestral lands into the tack tributaries of the Roman
 that's the context this social political context has existed for a century in Jesus day and already in Jesus time the Israelite Community has fractured along the lines of how to respond to this reality
so let's dive into the social dynamics of Jesus's day how did the Israelites back then respond to the political reality of first-century Roman occupiers to help us with this I have back in the studio Bible project scholar Dr been 13 hi Ben thanks for being here as you invite me I'm also wanted to bring my friend Rose in for Nara Animation Studio hi I'm Rose I'm your professional doodler I want to consider this crowd that Jesus is talking to and the people who would be and then when he is saying the good life belongs to the peacemakers there's different kinds of people here in that so I've got four prompts for you and going to drop four different kinds of people that could be men or women but they're going to basically represent for significant groups in the audience okay sort of picture of the four main
 score groups within Judaism it's important to say we're going to speak generally for conversation's sake there's there's no way to say of any one of these groups this is what everybody saw it or whatever but he did okay well let's just break it down for different groups Sadducees Pharisees the essence or sometimes become the qumran community and then zealots these guys are the Elite there they're the top dogs were thinking High priests like Aristocrats they own land their ultra-wealthy and then they're willing to collude with Rome in order to maintain their status of their cash their power they like where they're at and they want to stay there and I'm not saying that they are stoked that Rome is their oppressor they're not like eggs but they're like if this is our reality and those are the power guys we want to be together with them so we can
 maintain what we've got a few times in the New Testament especially in confrontation scenes with Jesus I suspect that they saw him especially as he gained Traction in the audience as perhaps a threat to their power and their status Matthew 37 great example because I'm a brood of vipers and I do think he was being descriptive more than down put into them Caiaphas that's kind of a familiar name in the and the crucifixion scene he's a sadducee so notice there in that scene with the the whole crucifixion scene they say Jesus is disrupting the peace so that gives you a clue of what they think peace and two way for them to make peace is to kill them so they might say in principle you making
 but it's not going to be peacemaking in the way of the Christ okay okay Pharisees like the Sadducees their stoked about Torah there are absolutely committed to helping people follow and live in the ways that God has directed but they have respect for all of the books of the Hebrew Bible not only the first five and they have respect for the oral tradition that's passed down and certainly are a part of continuing that oral tradition okay so they're very influential leaders but perhaps a good way to see him differently would be think local Pastor versus like highly powerful University expert scholar whose also politically powerful in ultra-wealthy with their boots on the ground in the neighborhood versus the guys who do the same thing but from an office
 suppose the Sadducees rejection of oral tradition and so there is conflict between the Pharisees and the Sadducees commonality same Heritage Same Book of the law but significant opposition the gospel accounts will show interactions and disputes with Jesus sometimes though he criticizes them for being hypocritical the Pharisees you know if they're teaching good things but they're not necessarily living according to it and it's really important to say not all of the Pharisees were against Jesus is Nicodemus he's he's one of those where he's a Pharisee right but he's not anti Jesus that's a great example
 okay that's her first two groups then there's this other group and think of them like separatists this the SM Community these folks were likely living in qumran down by the dead see if we had the major discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at qumran when you go visit it today it's it's the ancient ruins it was a large large community living in between the mountains and the Dead Sea and they were dedicated to a very rigorous we might use the word legalistic but La following way of life absolutely dedicated to sort of cleansing and purifying their Community but their way of dealing with what they saw as major problems within Jewish life and especially Temple practice was to get away from it and they're praying for God to come and restore and cleanse the
 so now you have their idea of what peacemaking looks like is but knowing how they were coping with the problems they saw rank gives you a little picture into I wonder how they heard Jesus when he said the good life is for the peacemakers because separating yourself from all society and holding up out in the desert and it's pretty peaceful out here yes but if we go back to the the the definition of Peacemaker witches bringing opposing sides into a harmonious relationship and then they're not like they're not a relationship I thought we had the good life and think of the essien community is like super dualistic there's their good guys and bad guys now just pause for a second
 imagine how if you approach life that way what challenges you'll face if you are to be a peacemaker and that kind of Segways I didn't actually intend this but it's nicely into the zealots okay so zealots are likely a radical we are not totally sure if this is like a fully known like organized political party or group at the time but certainly an ideal or idealistic way of life and ethic to the point even in the scriptures will see like Simon the Zealot so the group is there in some way within a hundred fifty two hundred years of this moment where Jesus is talking you've had the Maccabee and revolts this leader Antiochus epiphanes who like we said about the Sadducees wanted to join with Rome and so he is willing to sacrifice pigs on the on the altar in the temple
 he puts up like a golden eagle to Zeus and the exhaust pipes get super riled up and they they band together form a military and they went and they cleanse the temple that cleanse the society the restore proper worship to the temple this is what nevermind it's peacemaking yes and zealots are clashing with other Jewish group so there'd certainly oppose to the Roman occupation but they're opposed to the tax collectors who are working with the Romans and they're opposed to the Sadducees in the high priests who are in bed with the Romans and they're opposed to any Ferris see who's not teaching at the right to it so they had they had opposition let's say lack of harmonious relationships with lots of folks in and outside of their own Community should we can we come back to Rose here for a little bit yeah this is a whole thing you got going here Rose all right so he started with the Sadducees and they're on top of a tower made of Five Books there are five favorite book
 and they're out that got little scales were there weighing letters and they're like going to little monocle just examining that and that's all they're looking at and they're wearing like Roman robes and the entire world goes on around them without them looking at anything else above it all so let me have the Pharisees who have in one arm all of the books of the Bible and they got one hand reached out to the people with boots on the ground and they're clearly they're in the mess they're having a hard time but they're in there has got all these books of the Hebrew Bible other hand a human being it kind of like a local Pastor is working on the scene with people looked a little overwhelmed for dude to the scenes where I have them on a little their own little island and they've built
 barbed wire around it and they're just praying staying focused on their worship at with one guy like working as hard as you can to keep drawing the barbed wire around their little isolated communities that's good always reinforcing the Border your school we are not at no yeah that's great and then at the bottom of this whole mess we have a couple of zealots who popped out of manhole cover and they are there squirting like lighter fluid onto their pile of TNT in an effort I think 2 to blow the whole thing all of it all of it they got a problem with everybody everybody I love it that's okay that's what I do after the four prompts I was going to ask you no will your drudge Jesus here speaking to this crowd if you will
 he's got his arms around the entire image
 so that's the landscape is in that context saying things like the good life belongs to the people who don't withdraw up peacemakers can't make peace if you're withdrawing broker peace between parties in Conflict if you don't live among the people who are in conflict over earlier if you could end up going to see nonviolent resistance nonviolent non-cooperation with Rome is a very important statement of the ethic of Jesus in the sermon so the Freedom Fighters are not going to like how Jesus advocates for peace out but neither will the combined community and neither will the Sadducees cuz they're going to see Jesus saying but not observant and faithfulness to God's will in the Torah is super important and so the Sadducees won't like him but then the way that he's going to talk about fulfilling and being faithful to the Torah is going to take
 everyone has their own sense of what it means to be a peacemaker cuz she got the Freedom Fighters going we're going to make peace through War conflict the qumran community let's make peace with draw operation but full withdrawal because ultimately they do want peace right yeah but not peace to make some compromise their understanding their Jewish Heritage Inn in the meaning of wife and then there's the Sadducees were in power and they're like let's make peace through this brokering these power Dynamic political realism of Peace will come through our Fidelity to his Traditions traditions and laws of the Torah and to even wrap it up even more peace and was making peace correct as I can just imagine Jesus saying this and everyone
 altering that through their own minds and you're saying yes The Sermon on the Mount is the Manifesto It's the manifesto for how Jesus cars out of space what does it mean to make peace you'll tell you yeah just keep reading to keep her in or keep listening and you'll find out what that longing for to the world made right and actually beginning to do create that world too generous Mercy from the right motives which will involve getting into Arenas conflict and finding the way forward the stuff that's going to come in the following a good life is for the peacemakers for they will be called children of God these ones who make peace or the ones who show themselves to be members of God's family because they will be called children of God they reflect the character traits of the father
 ultimately Jesus created peace through generous self-sacrificial love will learn that this love isn't just for our friends it's even for anime when this is a high bar and you're going to be misunderstood how good is life for those who have been persecuted on account of righteousness because theirs is the kingdom of the Skies let's hear about how peacemaking is a hard road but it's the right path
 so if you're going to get involved in Conflict get ready to have people not like you the good life belongs to those who are persecuted because they're going to do what's right According To Jesus you would imagine people who are out there ordering Society in a way that creates peace broker in relationships in a way that brings more Harmony that they would be celebrated not persecuted you think think of this landscape the different options we've created it's the way of the pieces being achieved is by giving up something that one of these groups holds most dear then it will result in an anchor to the committee committee will be like of course those followers of Jesus up in Galilee mix with the people they include the poor there's some black bears among the people down at the persecution isn't coming from the people you're making p
 sweat is coming from the people who don't think you're doing peacemaking in the right way I've always read this being persecuted by the Roman soldiers that's going to happen is going to happen to literally it will happen to Jesus the sign of resistance against the the mission and goals of these kingdom of God communities resistance against them is not a sign of failure or a sign that God isn't with us in that work in the world right but this is the Theology of jobs friends ABS life is miserable all the terrible stuff happened to them there's no way God is with job and they somehow Joe got the agent in the world right thing you should sing Listen the way the world is right now when God's kingdom comes on Earth as it is in heaven it will result in you getting caught in the crossfire of a lot of angry
 people and you're going to get hurt and that doesn't mean that you're doing the wrong thing that you should expect it the good life belongs to those who are doing the Jesus thing doing the Jesus at doing what is right by God and others and expect that you're going to knock it like to buy some people and he's actually describing his own experience as the leader of this movement as soon as we leave this first block of Matthew which goes from chapters 5 through 9 as soon as you go to chapter 10 you start getting the narratives of people persecuting Jesus and his disciples
 the third statement in this Triad is the last beatitude of all nine Beatitudes and it's the longest how good is life for you when they insult you and persecute and speak any evil lies against you on account of me celebrate and Shout for Joy because your reward is great in the sky because this is how they persecuted the prophets before you
all one through eight have been about the good life belongs to those describing the group of people in third person here in the last one he shifts it to y'all and really he's building out the persecution what to expect your formal it take people making fun of you people are touring evil against you or misunderstood and you are reputation is in the dark yeah that's not the good life
 so you actually see how this could create a really counterproductive mentality people can dislike you for good reasons and actually the reason that someone should pay attention to what I'm really unkind and how I'm trying to give me a call and they'll interpret a negative reaction to what they're saying as this kind of righteous are being persecuted righteous proof yet I just with them you can see how people could take Jesus words in a way that's not quite what he means right you can be a bully or be mean-spirited and then when you experience pushback go I'm being persecuted it so now we're back to the generous mercy of the previous Triad and the pure in heart that's dealing with the motives in the manner with which I go out and engage in this doing of right in the world but don't expect by having your motives and doing the right thing that it would all be
 yep no matter how good ones intentions are and trying to be faithful to Jesus in the ethic of the Kingdom that doesn't mean you will be well received in fact expect people to misunderstand you to not care to understand you and your people to make fun of you or actually harm you so he uses to encouragemints to because of that the end because your ultimate reward the reason for what you do it may not be on the temporal Horizon of your your life before the kingdom come you're investing in the new creation when you live by the ethic of Jesus I didn't mean to attend that fun but investing in New Creation that's what he means here by your reward is great in the sky every Ward New Creation is God's Heavenly Transcendent life of pets coming to burst here on Earth since you don't start soon will come in the new creation or start building into that cuz I think I already made investing in New Creation ever said that way
 is a way of organizing human life within creation that's so beyond our imaginations right now but yeah we most religious and non-religious people we all have this desire to see things right and there's all these different ways we propose to do it yeah the Jewish Christian story says there will be a world set right called New Creation related to come will be a huge remaking of Creation in the Jewish and Christian hope of the new age that lived there ants in life trajectory now will bear some continuity similar to the Apostle Paul ends is great exposition of the Resurrection in 1st Corinthians 15 there for my beloved brothers and sisters because of the hope of the Resurrection be steadfast don't let anything move you
 always be over abundant as you work for the Lord knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord and the work of the Lord we praise in English conjures up like the most people vocational Ministry but he makes very clear throughout his letters that anybody doing any any kind of work can be done in the Lord for the Lord to talk about your day today work is the arena where you can begin to invest in the new creation and therefore your day's work is not in vain to fascinating thing to say the things that you're working on now can remain in this new reality but in order for that to be the case has to be something that is of the nature of this new reality of the nature it's not a spreadsheet
 that I treated people as we went about this work the kind of community that was generated by doing this work the way someone felt honored or Dishonored I how I relate to them in the course of my work now we're talking about the stuff of new creation and third chapter of I thought you were going towards which says each will be rewarded according to their own Labour your co-workers and got service you are God's field God's Building he should build with care if anyone build on the foundation using these like gold and silver things that remain hey what's up and if you don't it's it won't be an important part of the wisdom imagery in the sermon here so Jesus is interested in inviting his followers to the good life is to find Buy-Rite his teaching but that also he's trying to show the good life means there's a reward it's a life lived ultimate
 gives you the good reward your on the good life it's so hard to even live for a reward for tomorrow for American somebody has grown up in a western context especially in the last generation where will yeah cuz if your reward is in the skies that's this idea of the new Heavenly reality permeating Earth one day reward is that that's not right now it's not tomorrow but there is a sense to that it is now and this is the actual communities of Jesus are to become a little four tests of the kingdom of the Skies coming on Earth as it is in heaven that's what the Lord's Prayer is about that's at the very center of The Sermon on the Mount Your Kingdom Come
 will be done here on Earth as it is in heaven and where am I going to find that Jesus is starting the nucleus he leaves behind and all of these Galilean Village has a nucleus of what people could experience as a different version of reality is his followers to each other according to that pic of the Kingdom which is what he's inviting people to do with with the Beatitudes they're socially powerless and have no influence and you long to see the world made right here's what the god of Israel has always been up to and we can launch this heaven on Earth New Covenant people group right here right now let's do it expect to be misunderstood to be conflict and Arenas of tension that you're going to get involved to us and don't let the resistance make you think that you're barking up the wrong tree with the flow
 I hear it cuz you're with your what you're investing in isn't in the current system of organizing our society you're investing in a different way of thinking about human existence human communities hoping that that way permeates the system and changes that Salt and Light everywhere so do you celebrate when your persecuted insulted being I mean semen Chi Chi hair celebrate what is picking up on is an important Motif in the Hebrew Bible of here about celebrating as an Act of Faith and Hope in God's Redemptive power that you may not fully experience right now in the moment the first moments of celebration for example are wind is real standing on the other side of the sea after the waves crashed over pharaoh and they celebrating this thing the first price on in the Bible is a great time to celebrate
 it is a great time to celebrate but what's that their backs with the moment they turn around
 from the series salvation what they're looking at is to see and what they're looking as God just deliver them right but then they turn around and just like a desolate Wilderness with no water and no food and hundreds of miles that's true because they just had a taste of their ultimate Deliverance even though they have no idea how they're going to get out of this mess and that's biblical celebration in the midst of being persecuted celebrate their looking at the Salvation they just experienced and they're not thinking yet about all the trials ahead and they're just like celebrating we just got saved from an oppressive Nation
 miraculously in the scope of the Goths the whole of Matthew's gospel the death and resurrection of Jesus becomes The Exodus event The Exodus Deliverance that Jesus's disciples look back upon as the great Deliverance that gives me hope and cause for Joy even if I go out and see you in a second so I can try and lived after Jesus and get shut down hurting persecuted I think that's the best analogy I'm trying to make people do use of talking to on the hillside they have an experienced Resurrection yet of the Gospel we know where the store is going Jeff Mathews trying to instruct us to join those people on the hillside even though we live you know after the events of the gospels story but for the people on the hillside you're right it's almost it required an even greater Act of Faith on their part because they hadn't seen The Showdown
 Jesus in the powers one more thing so I think the way Matthew has designed these nine Beatitudes is he's introducing actually the job description that you're going to watch Jesus go and perform throughout the rest of the Gospel so we kind of covered this General Point already is that there are things introduced in the sermon that will get picked up and developed but the good life belongs to those who are impoverished of spirit those who grieve and mourn and those who are on the bottom and on the outside is this going to be a thing in Jesus's actual people you interact with me constantly and heels and and invites to parties skip that's right that's right is Jesus going to express a longing to see things that right is Jesus going to show mercy and talk about showing generous mercy and
 is Jesus going to demonstrate a purity of devotion a purity of heart is Jesus going to get involved with these are arenas a conflict and put himself right in the middle Jesus is also outlining his biography that's you're going to go read up on time with the exact vocabulary these are Jesus rules of Life yeah it's it's also an outline of the shape of a kingdom ethic is that Jesus is summarizing it here but then his own wife is going to embody and model every part of these these 99 traits and use the reader then you finished Matthew's account that you get to chapter 28 but we call chapter 28 and then the big question which in the last sentence of Matthew's gospel is and look I am with you
 if you go and try and model and imitate the things that I've invited you to do I'm with you first he says go and teach others this this way of going to teach them what I commanded you and here it is here this and then I'm with you I'm with you until the new creation till the kingdom comes on Earth as it is in heaven so these are attitudes are worth memorizing the worst turning over in your mind and heart for a lifetime
 I love that image of turning over these Beatitudes in our hearts of allowing these statements about what the good life actually is to embed themselves into our whole being
 so we've gone through all nine Beatitudes over the last three episodes let's go through them one more time and look at them as a whole
 some of them out has three main sections it begins with a surprise surprise identity of those who God is working with in the world and then I move to the main body
 which is all about the greater righteousness that Jesus is Calling his followers to
 Sermon on the Mount ends
 the choice in light of all these teachings which path will you take what kind of Life are you going to build okay so we're still here in the introduction
 and nine surprise blessings are the Beatitudes as they're called
 we've gone through all nine
 the first set of three how good is life for the powerless for those who grieve
 for The Afflicted The Good Life belongs to those who are unimportant to those around the outside of centers of power and influence because something is happening here in the rain of God of rides that is going to bring about the new creation which will be the ultimate land inheritance
 the second Triad how good is life for those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
 for those who show Mercy
 for the pure in Hearts it's important to recognize the biblical authors and God really thinks humans are capable of this they're capable through God's New Creation power and Presence Mercy in the power of God Spirit but it's where we are made for mermaids to be pure of heart
 in the third Triad how good is life for the peacemakers for those who have been persecuted
 how good is life for y'all is going to build on the first two and say get ready for conflict difficulty and pain if you are going to really become a part of these Kingdom communities in partnership with Jesus three sets of three blessings nine proclamations of who God is working within the world now let's look at the third blessing in the third Triad
 notice this is the third beatitude of the third Triad and it's blown up and expanded it has three parts
 how good is life for you all when they insult you in persecute you and speak evil lies against you on account of me
 celebrate and Shout for Joy because your reward is great in the sky
 for such as the way they persecuted the prophets before you
 tri-otic structuring of DSs speech is already you can just see it and how the Beatitudes are designed
 three's within three years within three we're going to continue to see this pattern as we progressed to The Sermon on the Mount for now we stay centered and surprise identity and next week we move to the next two identities you are the salt of the land and a city on a hill
 that's it for today's episode okay we made it through all nine surprise statements about the good life Jesus says his disciples you are the salt of the earth and you are a city on a hill of the world the city on the hill they're meant to illuminate each other so what is it mean to be light and so that's next week bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you for being a part of this with us hi this is Cooper here to read the credits Dan gumel is the creative producer for Today Show production of today's episode is by producer Lyndsay Ponder managing producer Cooper pelts producer Colin Wilson Stephanie Tam is our consultant and editor Tyler Bailey
