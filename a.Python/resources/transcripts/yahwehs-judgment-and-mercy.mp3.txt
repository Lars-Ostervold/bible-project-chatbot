if you were an ancient Israelites your whole life would revolve around the Covenant relationship you made with the Creator God you have your ancient lock code that you follow including a list of behaviors that keep yourself virtually fewer you're observing annual fee that remind you of who you are and right at the center of Camp is the sacred text the place where Heaven and Earth unites the place where God himself too well and you are invited to bring offerings that connect you with the life-giving presence of God 10th becomes a little symbolic micro version of the whole biblical story which is about Yahweh reopening the gateway to the Eden blessings so that humans can return back to Eden so Israel had his heart this little ritual drama played out where one represented at this realize it would enter into Eden I'm past the many the one representative Israelites are the priests the priests come from the tribe of Levi
 is the tribe in charge of the tent they maintain the tenant they packed it up and move it when Israel's on the move but only a select few Levites get to be priests and so today we're going to read a story about a rebellion of the Levi you see a few of them think the setup isn't fair maybe there's some self-dealing going on and they rally a group to voice their frustration that whole Chris assemble together against Moses and Aaron and said you've gone too far why do you guys exhaust yourselves above the Assembly of Yahweh know what happens next is well tragic the Earth opens up and swallows them whole hit these stories in the Bible that make you think I mean what gives why is God acting with so much and it is severe it's meant to induce grief decreation horrible the ending of Life So today we're going to sit with this tragic tale and examine why there's so much decreation in the Bible
 these D Creations are what humans are choosing and bringing on themselves and when y'all way brings about a new thing it's like he's accelerating it the creation process so that he can give birth to a New Creation story also has us examine the high level of accountability that God puts on those who represent him the angriest Jesus ever got in the gospels is at the teachers of the Torah they are supposed to be the ones out of among the many from among the many who guide is real to wisdom and life and he believes that are guiding them to death but the story doesn't end here with the ground opening up actually ends with the plague breaking out amongst Israel more decreation infecting everyone the high priest runs ahead of the wave of death and he stands there and where he stands in the way of stop with him he stands in between the dead and the living this narrative is a part of a huge Mosaic pointing to Israel's need and Humanities needed for the ultimate mediator
 to mediate Between Heaven and Earth
 thanks for joining us here we go
it's up there John we are in the scroll of numbers because we are waiting for the poor yes we are did you just get a fresh cup of coffee I did it's like the smell feeling around and go get ya thank you for that man does not live on bread alone but also with low caffeine and the word of the Lord and the word of the day we have all of it with fresh coffee smell filling the room we are turning our attention to the middle section of the fourth Scrolls the Torah there's three Scrolls in the middle the Torah that are kind of like the meat of the Torah has a bit of kissing members Exodus is traveling through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai where they hang out God commands you learn how to assemble as a nation learn the Tabernacle rituals the numbers is now then going out to the welders to the promised land from Sinai from side to the promised land
 running is it's all falling apart piece-by-piece that's exactly right and it's like we're driving the car and then the wheels come off I guess I'll be the last thing she said it's like a check engine light goes on and then the engine starts to like sputter and smoke smoke in the first movement of numbers Israel as organized as this mobile holy congregation moving through the Wilderness the outer ring of the camp is the 12 tribes of Israel the next inner ring is One Tribe selected to be extra clothes to the holy space to tribe of Levi among whom is a priest and then in the middle of the middle of the camp is the holy presence of God intended and there's three rebellions that match those three levels of organization exactly and so we just walked through in the last episode of outer layer and the rebellion of the 12
 spies who go into the land check it out they see that it says wonderful garden but inside are the Giants the people of Israel I liked that does not sound awesome yeah yeah we don't want to kill the yeah we're going back to Egypt we're going to kill motorists in the L word go back it's an intense or dying and then because of that God says this generation is going to die in the wilderness but I'm still going to uphold my promise and the next generation will come in the kids will go into the promised land and then it ends with those people going now we'll still go to the promised land. We're going to try to go in and they get beat by two groups called the Canaanites and the amalekites yeah and they are defeated in the wilderness so the story picks up from there after with numbers 15 which is super cool and we don't have time to get into it while we're going to pick up the store it is the next Rebellion story which happens among
 the group of Israelites who live in the next inner ring of the camp to the Levites The Witches yeah the Levites so the Levites Are One Tribe among the Twelve Tribes but they were selected from among the 12 especially be near God's holy space and to work facilities and maintenance and then one sub-clan among Levi is the family of Aaron Moses is brother and they are the group that selected to actually work in and around the tenth offer sacrifices burn the incense and go in and out of the tent self 21 Section 1 Section so this is going to be about it in our tribal rivalry of the Levites rebelling against the one sub Clan of the high priestess and that's what we call Numbers chapter 16 and 17 where this Rebellion stories found
 the first we just died in
 number 16 verse 1 now Cora the son of guitar the son of the son of Levi along with Xavier and Sons of Elias and also own son of pellet one of the sons of reuben reuben is the first of all the tribes and this is the only sentence in moment in the story where this guy on the tribe of Reuben the Pearce sisters great so you have the Levites rebelling and then you have one guy from the firstborn of the 12 tribes who also gets in on it because he's not mention again but what clued you in on is it reminds you of the Twelve Tribes that are around and so this is said to be a rebellion both of the leaders of the Levi Clan
 and then one guy from the firstborn of the 12 sons of Jacob so it actually becomes all of Israelites against their own high priest but all the Israelites outside Levi are summarized become symbolized in this one mention of this guy own son of Reuben at least I think that explains why he's this is Cain and Abel fixing the Rebellion store is the last rebellion that we just talked about in the last episode was about people failing to go in and subdue and enjoy the garden land data me feel you're out of any failure than this next Rebellion it's about a sibling rivalry of the firstborn Ruben and the other Levi's being scandalized by God exalting one sub-clan of the family to be there high Priestly representative
 rose up before Moses together with other sons of Israel 250 of the congregation chosen in the assembly men of the name this is so good this little phrase meaning of the name appears two times in the Torah and the last group of people that describe was the Nephilim Giants in Genesis chapter 60 cuz we have a great and we have wires and then of the name so we're riffing on both the sibling rivalry of Cain and Abel and also where that lead in Genesis chapter 4 through 6 in that sequence ended with the Genesis of the Nephilim the men of the name that whole crew assembled together against Moses and Aaron and said you've gone too far all of the congregation is Holy every one of them and y'all way is in the middle of them too so why do you guys exalt your
 selves above the Assembly of Yahweh why are you showing favoritism but notice they perceive that Moses and Aaron have exhausted themselves for self-dealing here and and your family have a special status I thought God said that we were all called to be a holy nation and the kingdom of priests right and they're not wrong this interesting claim on one level that's true but on another level Israel has shown that there as a whole are not very faithful Covenant Partners so God has elevated special mediators but the whole point is God shows Moses and God chose Aaron for these roles and these guys think that Moses and Aaron have exhausted themselves so when Moses heard this he fell on his face and he spoke to Cora this company saying all right tomorrow Yahweh is going to make everyone see who belongs to him
 who is Holy and who Yahweh will bring near to himself the one whom Yahweh will choose that's the one Yahweh will bring their coming near this in so many conversations ago that was the key phrase throughout Leviticus about who how and when did Israelites get to enter into the Eden hotspot in the 10 10th becomes a little symbolic micro version of the whole biblical story which is about Yahweh reopening the gateway to the Eden blessing so that humans can return back to Eaton so Israel had his heart this little ritual drama being played out where one representative Israelite would enter into Eden on path of the many and so these other Israelites or something like listen you always selected all of us out of the nation's we're all holy we should all get to do what you do
 did you choose this job for yourself anyway you know and Moses is like no Yahweh has chosen who he's going to bring near and tomorrow he's going to make it clear all of us who that is that's kind of a the set up here so we came to Mabel when God's choice of Abel the younger over Cain was made clear it was while they were offering sacrifices at the door of eating so it's very similar to the dynamic here cuz only the priests only Aaron and his sons are selected out of the Levites to offer sacrifices and go be near the door of the tent these leaders are like unto can who are rejecting God's choice the Moses is going to perform the like something to prove the test I was a test going to propose a test that will tell the truth about whom God has chosen so what he says is everybody Cora your whole crew take little incense burners because sensors
 that for yourselves and put fire in them lay incense on the fire and come here to 10 tomorrow and the one whom he always chooses is the one who is Holy for Yahweh and you think we've gone too far sons of Levi and you've gone too far to stress the back of my face so this is many conversations go remember the last time we had a story of some Levi's it's sir priest taking incense burners drawings of fire Yeah Yeah Yeahs on all the sons of Aaron who took it upon themselves to light the incense and take it into the tent drink a little too much Beano faculties cuz that job was given only to their dad to go in down to that rich and so the younger trying to usurp the position of the older than that
 if so now here Moses is telling the rest of these Levites to do and bring the incense which is the role of the high priest you all think you want to be the high priest and I'll tell you what do high Priestly sing prepare some incense to bring near the 10 do you like a I don't take a second to go well at all the last time those guys was struck down yeah I got arrested by fire Moses set them up it's really interesting then those head to Cora hear sons of Levi isn't it enough that the god of Israel set you apart from the rest of the Israelites to bring you all near so you could serve in the Tabernacle and stand before the congregation a minister and like of course you weren't selected to be the high Priestly group this is my prayer for eyes to go in and out of the tent but you're still sucked for us to get to work Irene and around the time you get to transport it you get to keep this place beautiful and guard it
 is that not enough for you that you are also seeking the priesthood so then you and your hole company have gathered together against Yahweh and as for Aaron what's what's my brother Aaron do you would crumble against him so then Moses sends a group to some of the others that rebelled and what they say is is it not enough that you brought us up out of the land of Egypt flowing with milk and honey to have us die here in the wilderness and do you think you're going to try and be a king over us most is so you can just see the volume getting turned up here on all the siblings matching that moment in the previous rebellion was kill Moses we don't need them we're going to go back and there they said it would have been better to die as slaves in Egypt now they're calling Egypt the land of milk and honey land flowing with abundance and I came and distorted memories here
 so this whole crew is they are angry at Moses cuz I think he's trying to be their King and he's not delivering Eden for them and then the Levites are angry Aaron cuz they think they should get to be high priest to this is more than just a smoking engine of the car that are rattling Somoza said everybody come tomorrow we're going to meet in front of the time and you always going to settle. Everybody bring your little incense burners so they do why would everyone have an incense burner with her house a good question I don't know so next day everybody gathers at the doorway of the 10th which is parallel to the door of Eden and then who should appear above the 10th of fire cloud of Yahweh appears over his tent and you always said to Moses and Aaron Moses separate yourselves from this whole congregation
 I'm going to consume all of them in a moment so this is now the third time that Yahweh has stated his intentions to destroy all of his Covenant people all of them are just the ones here about thank you yeah this congregation could refer to all of the people to do some in front of the door thank you I think actually in light of what's about to be set that makes my son so the whole thing is everybody's gathered and I'm going to consume all of them and then look at what Moses and Aaron do they do what Moses has done the two other times has happened at the golden calf and if the rebellion of the spies they intercede and they Moses there and say oh God God who gives Spirit to all Flat Rock ya sin Eden hyperlink right there were Gods breathed into the dirt the breath of life so listen you sustain the life of all
 creatures when one human sins will you be angry at the whole congregation it works referring to so among this whole crew of rebels what it says is Cora the sons of guitar the son of Levi along with the van and RV rhyme and then that guy on those four people and they rose up for Moses and then they get 215 or 250 more and then you got all this rides around them so what they say is will one person sin and you'll be angry at the whole congregation in this story it's like well you got for ring later this year so I think what's happening this is a meta moment the story we're reflecting here using the story to back up and reflect on all of the cycles of the melody up to this point in the Torah usually how that works as a whole generation
 Rebels are a group and God will select one out of the money so now it's like we're turning it on its head and what they're saying is but when you have just a few or one among the many who rebelled here Among Us real will you walk away from all of us just because of one is hurt your taking the righteous Remnant that God selects out and they'll allow their righteousness to cover for the money and now we're flipping it over and we're examining that feel logical puzzle from the underside God will let the righteousness of one rescue many and then he flips it and he says end well you let the sin of one destroy the many really that's how you operate and God doesn't answer he doesn't answer directly what he says this speak to the congregation and say get away from the dwellings of Korra that's on and off here I'm the one
 so that is the 103 Somoza Rosie went to the song and I'll be wrong and he said to the congregation everybody get away from the tents of these Russia in the bad ones touch nothing that belongs to them like that tree get away like there's something here that will lead to death people who have celery to find good and evil they believe that you always commands are actually what leads to death and they know the way the life so don't even touch it or you'll be swept away in their sin so they start to back off from the dwellings of the song and I'll be around and Cora and then the founding of Iran came and stood at the doorway of their tents with their clients their wives in the little buns and Moses said this
 this is how y'all will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these things this is not my doing like I didn't choose this job and what's about to happen is not me I think he's referring back to the fact that they accused him of trying to like make himself the king of this realm so we speak to the congregation he's pointing to Cora the van and I'll be around me says if these guys died just a normal death a normal human death right now if they suffer the fate of all humans then you'll know that I actually have made myself King he always has not chosen me and other words if they don't I hear they're going to die in a normal day in the normal way which is like surrounded by Family ripe old age and they're going to die in a way that is not normal and that will be a sign and there's 30 if the Lord creates a new creation
 or if he creates a creation so it's the word Bara create and then New American Standard get translated if the Lord brings about an entirely new thing or the ESV this is numbers 16 Verse 30 if the Lord create something new it's if the Lord create the creation
 this is going all the way back to Genesis 1 the word bra he's reserved for acts of God alone when God does something without precedent so creation itself is bra and then when God introduces bios on day five biological life EP baraz and then humans appear as though so even in the Justice one story when that word is you use the grill times something to introduce something new that's like new level of thing so here is instead of life being created in an unprecedented way here it's going to be an unprecedented kind of death the ground will open its mouth you like yeah Cain and Abel the ground opened its mouth to exactly the same phrase really swollen to swallow up the blood of Abel and God says the blood is crying out from the ground that opens its mouth to swallow the blood LOL now here
 it's the ground will open its mouth and swallow up these Rebels and everything that belongs to them they will descend a live into the grave and then y'all will know I'm not the rebel here these guys are the Rebels the heavy the decreation run this moment where the ground opening up is echoing both the innocent blood of Abel human Rebellion violence and rivalry leading to the death of being a scent but then also the ground split open is an image of what happened before the collapse of the cosmos in the flood so we're bringing together the D creation of the flood that started with the spilling of Abel's blood that led to the Cascade of violence that necessitated the flood and so both Cain and Abel story and the flood narrative is being recalled here with the opening up of the ground so that makes sense yeah I just want to stop and pay attention to that little narrative technique
 the wording of Moses of speech is echoing the beginning of human violence from Genesis 4 and then the ultimate consequence for human violence in Genesis see a flood of Justice with this language about the opening of the mouth of the ground swallowing up family the Levites so the people who are to stand in the gap on behalf of Israel and their stands that's the group of people that's rebelling against the priests so I know it's hard for us to think but this is like you know somebody is like a data entry person you know raises like a problem and is misbehaving at their job like that significant right leg needs to be dealt with but it's a CEO of a company starts a coup to get all the board of directors fired and like the stakes are higher the consequences will be higher and I think that's the logic of what's Happening Here is that if the people within the people within the people
 been selected to be the conduit of God's blessing for all of humanity if they think that God's word is leading them to death and they want to read the fine good about themselves and the consequences will match the level of accountability given their position I think that's the logic of why these three guys who have a management dispute with Moses that the ground is like a decreation install the allusions to the flood narrative and Ducane are trying to show the guy that this is actually a cosmic disruption and Rebellion within Israel so when we see death on a Nabi rhyme with their families at the door of their tents in the narrative goes on it just as they were all swallowed up by the office and so it is severe and it's meant to induce grief
 but I think this is easy to get distracted and think like what like what did those children do I thought didn't mostly just say will you punish the many for the sin of the few this has to do with the biblical author's view of corporate responsibility that when whole cultures have steep themselves in a value set and a narrative that leads to death to open up a path to a renewal of creation
 it's very uncomfortable for me I don't like these images at all but I think they're trying to communicate something that human corruption is never just an individual Affair yeah toast for the birth of a new creation you need a whole new community that's rescued and reconstituted and the passing of the old as I wear
 seems like there's also a theme in the Bible of when God chooses out of people to represent the people yes yes he does deal with them more severe more severity in terms of blessing and rescue but also more severely in terms of accountability and then consequences is this group yeah this one family so this earthquake and swallowing up is a creation decreation moment of the melody like the flat this is the local flood the intensity of this reminds me of the intensity Jesus has against false teachers or the leaders of Israel Israel super angry to the point where you're like what would you turn that up like a little too hot Jesus but there's a sense of severity into the ones who weren't selected chosen to be the ones who
 you are a blessing for them later example of this will be when Jesus has had continual conflicts and projections by the Pharisees priests and the leaders of Israel in his generation so in his famous prophetic apocalyptic speech yeah I wrote to you oh okay well there it's the 7 was he pronounces on the Pharisees in Matthew chapter 23 and then matching that in Matthew 24 is an auricle of Doom he announced is over Jerusalem he starts quoting from Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel talking about the downfall of Jerusalem but using the prophets language to describe the downfall of Babylon and he's showing a true slim has become a new Babylon and it's going to be D created and just pulls on all of the images of like earthquakes and wars and famine and storms and it's decreation imagery that's all going to be localized here on this today
 I thought of those just Jesus saying it'd be better for you to be like throwing into the ocean with a millstone around your neck yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry I went towards how Jesus picks up the decreation you're talking about this accountability accountability that the angriest Jesus ever got in the gospels is at the teachers of the Torah here this is about they are supposed to be the ones out of among the many from among the many who died as real to wisdom in life and he believes that are guiding them to death yeah so we laid into him this comes out in the letter of James in the New Testament where he says yeah most people shouldn't become teachers and leaders and the Jesus movement actually not very many people should this is because you will bring on yourself a more severe standard of divine Justice where the I think the classic line as you will bring on your self-esteem
 your judgment but what he means is this principle here the line is echoed in my ears from my first years of reading the Bible and cuz I think it's true there's the truth to it that's unavoidable and must be internalized by anybody who would claim to represent God yeah it's the tallest claim a human can make and we seen it over and over how horrible it is when leaders fail there's so many repercussions so many yep yeah yeah start gigantic and so the measures taken to deal with that level of human failure and Corruption are matched by the intensity of D creation of God and that's what the imagery of the story is intensifying it is the same imagery that the flood narrative is that going the passing of a whole creation
 you know that is just as intense as this image right here this is more of a localized expression of it but whenever we're at this point does the biblical story of God handing people over to the inevitable consequences of evil or of their choices towards the Rebellion or sin it is tragic and it's horrifying that's what Moses is horrified by so I can you have the decorations horrible the ending of life and I think was hard for us is within the biblical author's imagination these D Creations are what humans are choosing and bringing on themselves and when y'all way brings about a new thing it's like he is accelerating it the creation process so that he can give birth to a new new creation it's so boring and I don't want to avoid it though I want to be made uncomfortable cuz the store is clearly trying to raise our discomfort level yeah it has done that well it actually gets
 intense cuz a bunch of people flee from the sea and the earthquake happens and then those 250 that came with the incense That was supposed to be the high priest job they suffer the same fate as Aaron's two sons that got a little tipsy and in the tent and it's the same fire came out from your hallway and a top Aaron's two sons that symbol that is chapter 10 and now fire came out from you ain't ate up the two hundred and fifty roubles offering the incense and then you always spoke to Moses saying can't say to the priests go get those incense burners go recover the metal and melt it down and then hammer it out into sheets and plate the altar of sacrificial offerings that goes in front of the template it with the metal of those burned incense altars and it's a sign remember After the flood of D creation God put a sign in the clouds
 the bow in the cloud so that when you look at it you remember both you always Justice and mercy and so in the same way there's a sign put here on the Altar and it's a symbol of Israel's Rebellion supposed to be always judgment and his Mercy cuz the altar is also the place where you surrender before God and God forgives you so very creative reuse of that scene from the flood where this sign is both a sign of God's judgment and mercy that the place where he meets his people by the altar so the next day all the Israelites Grumble and grumbling is a cue for Rebellion what are the underlying story so what they say to Moses and Aaron is you all are the ones who have caused the death of all of these people who belong to Yahweh
 I was just kind of a classic actually I have these moments all the time when I walk in to a conversation that may be just as having with the boys and like I told they don't know the context right and I misunderstanding then let's try to insert myself into a clear that I don't understand what's happening but this is like that but also not cuz they just walked out and say so badly misunderstand so now it's all the people Moses and Aaron go back to the tent and the cloud is there and you always says I'm done with these people Moses and Aaron you get away from all of them and not go now this is bad I'm going to consume them in an instant so Moses that the Aaron Aaron you take your incense burner you're actually the one authorized to do you get fired from The Altar and go run out into the crowd to make atonement for them cuz he always anger has gone forth and a plague
 I've begun this is what the word for the strikes on Egypt so Aaron took it he ran out into the middle of the assembly and a plague is like a virus spreading and he put incense on the sensor and made atonement for the people and he took his stand between the dead and between the living and so the plague came to an end cut Salon the literal level this is all very strange and bizarre sure on the level of the narrative inventory you have a guy who is selected as the high priest stand in the Gap the people who rebelled against the creation has been unleashed the flood starting like a flood and it's the waves are and the high priest runs ahead of the wave of death and you gets this fire and he stands there and where he stands the way of stop with him and so this guy holding
 this guy holding this golden fire who's the high priest he stands in between the dead and the living like he becomes the place where the way they stops stop the flood of justice and makes a continent it is he covers for the evil of the people through fire really interesting this is not the normal way that sins are covered for its Through Blood it's through the surrender of a life and I guess here it's he's putting himself in the way of his death and he's surrendering his own life as it were and God grant him life and everybody on the other side of him yeah that's a powerful image this is Tora this instruction this is all meditation on the nature of the priesthood as an institution that points to Humanity's needs for a snake Crusher 2
 check the spread of death to open the way that the gap between the living and the dead yeah stop the stop the wave judgments yeah the narrative sympathy is with God God has chosen this people they keep time of time of time rejecting his will is purpose of offer of life it is the stories exploring the tension between God's desire to bless all of Creation with life in abundance Creations Rebellion against God that warrants Justice and those two are intention with each other within God's Own from our point of view their intention and so how is that tension of God's purpose and character going to be resolved and if you have one righteous one who will stand in the middle and surrender themselves on behalf of the many God will accept their intercession and give life and not death just trying to say
 this remarkable Stories the other very powerful images and it's easy to be scandalized by them when we're trying to understand like why would God acts you know and that fair is is this makes sense if you just take a step back from that it's a powerful reflection on this anticipation that we have four for someone to stand in the gap between the living and the dead mean the fact that Moses and Aaron in for chapters are themselves going to rebell and fail
 leaves this story sitting here in the Torah as Torah for future Generations saying man what we need is a greater than Moses and a greater than Aaron yeah will do what they did but like not Cosmic level themselves and do it on behalf of all creation this narrative is a part of a huge Mosaic pointing to Israel's need in Humanities needed for the ultimate mediator to mediate Between Heaven and Earth and you got in the prophets and they begin to speak of a future figure the sound a lot like Moses and Aaron but also like Adam and Eve and Noah and David and all the others and that's how the Hebrew Bible works so anyway this is also a meditation on God's Gift of life because of the righteous intercession of his mediator and that that's the role Jesus saw him self tapping into and taking to the cosmic level
 that's why I have to go and processing a story like this is that deleta point me to Jesus because I think what it means to read the Bible is Jesus gives me so much context for how to meditate on a story like this and let him speak to me
 yeah well I'm speaking of Moses and failing that's what we'll look at the middle way of a rebellion next story when the wheels truly come off till they get even more tragic but then also in the same set of store is flip over and become unbelievably beautiful and goodness to the worst news get combined with the bestest in the next section of numbers thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue with a third Rebellion story where two wheels really come off the clock this is Moses's test will you do what God says the way that God says it even if at this moment it seems rather counter-intuitive got system you didn't trust me and you didn't treat me as the Holy One in the eyes of the people today shows produced by Cooper Pelt edited by Dan gummo and Tyler Bailey and Lyndsay Ponder with
