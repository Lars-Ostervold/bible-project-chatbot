communication can be really hard I have my own invisible experiences and assumptions about how the world works and lives in my own psyche but when I'm talking to you I'd bring that with me to the table whether you realize it or not the Bible is the same the biblical authors have assumptions about the world and they're often very different than mine this episode is our next step in the Paradigm series what type of literature is the Bible today we continue our conversation on how the Bible is ancient literature last week we talked about how the Bible uses words differently than our words and today or to go deeper and look at how the words of the Bible or just at the surface of an often foreign way of viewing the world whole concept in the Bible or ideas that transcends words but the hole is going to be saturated with other cultural assumptions from the ancient biblical authors that are going to be really different than ours so when I think of
 Cosmos I think of the ever-increasing universe that I'm floating around in on spaceship earth when I think of civilization I think of democracy and freedom of biblical authors have a different way of thinking about the world the way the biblical authers talk about having an Earth where the way they talk about groups and individuals or honor or shame all these Concepts so these are bigger cultural Concepts that just the biblical others take for granted which means they don't ever talk about them they just think through them and it's important to realize that my cultural assumptions might be and often are completely different than the Bible's in the modern world we've inherited over the last few years the view of nature as this vast complex machine that material is all of it is and why we view the world as a material the biblical authors see the world and sacramental sacramental is a whale
 expressing with the biblical authors assume that the material is the way that what is spiritual or most realistic expressed to us I'm done calling this is Bible project podcast and today we look at the cultural assumptions underlying the Bible's ancient literature thanks for joining us.
we're working through a whole series of conversations trying to pin down and be really clear about what we mean when we say the Bible of the unified story that leads to Jesus another words what type of literature is this book or collection of Scrolls as it is when which way should we approach it and read it so in order to really unpack that we've been walking through a number of attributes different ways to talk about what type of literature Bible is everybody comes to everything with pre-loaded assumptions about what it is which will shape and influence what you do with it from a hammer to a table to a person to Sacred texts so what we're trying to do is be really explicit about the Paradigm within which we are engaging the scriptures we create all the content for the Bible project but we've also been want to be careful about not call
 our Paradigm it's a paradigm that we see models within scripture itself and then within kind of the historic to his Christian Traditions about how to talk about and treat yeah we don't want it to sound like our prayer times better than your Paradigm that we're asking the question what is the Bible's Paradigm of itself how does it ask us to engage yeah like I said that everything that we approach requires us to think of that thing in a certain way and I guess that makes a lot of sense when you think of something really simple like a table what's a table for and how do I use it and it could be all sorts of yeah I just say it's a simple point that is so simple often goes unsaid and so when we get into the environments where there are really unique things like a collection of ancient sacred
 communities of Faith often does explicitly talk about their substance about it they just operate and go and live in do on based on assumptions and there's what kind of literature it is an example earlier is it a cookbook you would approach that and one way is it a novel that you would approach another way and so we're trying to understand what the Bible is it is very unique literature and it requires us to really unpack what type of literature it is and how many levels in the first level which we talked about was that it's human all our literature is human but also Divine is the human Divine collaboration partnership so that's that's the first elements of the Paradigm which I guess any holy book would save itself potentially but mostly sure doesn't really say that so that the key
 and then we talked about that its unified literature it is a collection of Scrolls 51 different Scrolls by a certain counting written over thousands of years but I'm a different authors and different literary genres but it tells one unified story story and Scott's rescue of humanity to be his Partners in ruling the world and those things really overlap to me human and divine unified story about God is really beautiful and sophisticated and to me when I read this unified story and see the coherence that convinces me of not just the humanity of the text but there's this Spirit at work behind the text fine officers are so the way that that unified story about God and humans Finds Its Climax and resolution is in an anointed representative of the word Messianic mean
 anointed like like an anointed one like and anointed one and anointed meaning someone in ancient Israel who was singled out to be a representative figure on behalf of the whole this was Israel high priest was won the 91 and then this real King was another night that I love this how we're creating This Thread so the Bible is a human and divine partnership but tells a story of a human and divine partnership that God wants to rule the world through humans but we failed and so God anoints a leader to show us the way do it for us and the story of the Bible has this thread of choosing people in electing them and giving them this responsibility and that all leads us to Jesus and that's what I mean by Messianic and then in the unique sense of the Jesus style Messianic which is that the claim is that he is Israel's God become the human anointed one to do for the humans with
 I've been able to do for themselves and then that leads us to the next part of the Paradigm which is that it's wisdom literature how do you partner with God to rule the world you need wisdom in the Bible is presenting itself as as wisdom for us and wisdom that leads to Jesus who is God's wisdom incarnate but also wisdom within in the text itself that we can find to Despair and wisdom as we talked about is not just knowledge-based it's about a way of life it's about whole life embodiment of a set of values in the story these texts are not to stand to give us information that's actually shape us to become certain kinds of people Transformer character so that leads us to the one that we're in now which is this after beating the Paradigm that we're calling contextually rooted literature
 this one feels like at the center of everything to me but meditation literature is this ancient Jewish literature it's artistically designed and it can interpret itself through these patterns design patterns and it encourages us to reread and reflect over and over and over so it's not something we come to and get these propositional statements about how to lay over these principles it's a book that we reflect on or a collection of Scrolls reflect on forever and learn and grow as we do that yeah this one it to me is about the Bible's literary art is probably the easiest way for me to hang my hat on that idea and then the kind of artistic communication that it is requires a certain way of reading both reading and rereading and reading every part in light of every other part and in light of the whole which will take a lifetime when it when it's like a fifteen hundred page book yes all right
 that leads us to the part of the Paradigm where and I think it's at the six attribute and it's contextually rooted literature that the Bible was written in another time and culture we need to honor the historical context that came from understand it better so in last episode we talked a lot about words and how words are the way that we communicate and package ideas and transfer them to each other at every language has its own unique way of of doing that it was subtle differences and we are talking in English if you didn't know that and the Bible was written in an ancient Hebrew and in an ancient Greek that we translate into English to try to understand who just talked a lot about how to do with humility try to train ourselves to allow the Bible to use words the way that it did and its original context we might use them
 today in English and our contacts so just being aware of that and maybe going back and looking up some Hebrew or Greek meanings of words and tracing this to the story last episode but the word that has kind of shook me the most is nefesh soul that word translated into English has a lot of different connotations and Hebrew and we have a whole episode on that yes it's helpful we're going to take this part of the Paradigm into steps the last one of those about words and I have found it helpful to start there and when you're introducing your helping people really think about the contextually rooted nature of the Bible cuz it's is very self-evident went to reflect on it that words in another language and body another culture's way of seeing the world doesn't take that much to get there so the second step is also just to say so it's a single word to do that then of course whole books of the Bible whole Concepts in the Bible or ideas
 that transcend just words but the whole is going to be saturated with other cultural assumptions from the ancient biblical authors that are going to be really different than ours and last episode about the meaning of the word heart and the different conception of human anatomy is all so sad and so in a similar way the way the biblical authers talk about having a nurse the structure of the cosmos or how they talk about what is spiritual and what is material where the way they talk about groups and individuals or honor or shame all these kinds Concepts so these are bigger cultural Concepts that just the biblical others take for granted which means they don't ever talk about them they just think through them are seeing the world yes that's right so to the degree that we can see some of these core cultural differences between how the tablecloth reviewed all reality
 and ourselves then we were you know we're better prepared what do you call this bucket of things so we have words that's easy to understand these are cultural values or cultural assumptions cultural perspectives yeah I guess what cultural assumptions are you having an Earthen Hi-C the cosmos but that you have about reality in about what is the right through true thing
 so I just listed out one two three four just 5 not cuz these are the five best for the certainly they're not the five only different cultural assumptions could call his have I have found in my experience these are the ones that come up most common in other words when people have friction points with the Bible is there a part they don't understand or that they don't like it's very often that there is a difference of background assumptions that work so this list is a little bit subjective but at least I found it in years of teaching to be helpful these are some of the main different cultural assumptions I know how to see when they come up soften the window into deeper understanding to a particular part of the Bible the first one we actually don't need to talk about it because we did a podcast series on that's not very long ago and I just called the ancient cosmology it's a scary words
 Modern English it has been pretty specific term into work field of scientific studies about usually about the physical processes in Origins like study of the Stars okay so cosmology is study of our study of the origin and the process is the laws are processes that are fundamental to the origin and coherence of the universe it also has another way of meeting that's what we mean here which is stories or accounts that a culture gives about how the world is ordered and how that order began it's not different meaning of simpler way of saying the first meeting oh yes she is an account that's what the ology ology record log in under that log us all legit and then cosmas is about to order it's an account of how reality is ordered and how it came to be that way
 Stop This Modern cosmology easily unspoken and assumed we learned them from all kinds of sources growing up but they're really different from how ancient cultures cosmology and definitely from the book authors had a different type of cosmology than we do or where you see that that it's helpful to know that ancient authors had a different Paradigm this place to begin is the first sentence of the Bible with in the beginning God created the skies in the land so if you have a conception of the expanding universe and then a galaxies by the way I just this is a new Factor just uploaded 200 billion stars in our galaxy in the Milky Way and the Milky Way 200 billion remember we were just looking at the stars the other night and we were looking at the Milky Way the other night 200 billion
 and I see stars in our galaxy and I guess the estimate right now is somewhere between 1 and 2 trillion galaxies in the ever-expanding universe
 that's why I wanted to trillion little neighborhoods of 200 billion of my friends to small my whole life right now. Like consists of a set of rhythms that take up to square mile billions been in our vocabulary now you know we have only known this that buy a trillion is 1,000 billion + a billion is a thousand million okay I just looked up how long it would take to count to a billion just because I don't even I don't even have a concept of about thirty years to count to 1 billion if you just sit down and 1/2 that's how we think about the
 to the modern world that's what the floss for Charles Taylor cause the Deep abyss of time this awareness through Modern scientific cosmology that the amount of time and the depths of space within which we exist is abysmally more deep of than humans have ever come printed for that does something to your sense of your place within that universe is very different that shapes us to think in ways that are really different than how to put claw fish did you have written an account of the beginning of time and space I might have said in the beginning God created the ever-expanding universe and all of its galaxies my cosmology that's right so then Waters begin from an observational standpoint of a human standing on the ground so in the beginning God created what's up there the sky blue
 and what's down here the whole of the biblical Cosmos essentially takes up and it described with language of what a human sneeze when they're on the ground looking about and then they'll they'll make metaphysical though the Ponder the nature of God and then begin to describe what must be above and beyond the cosmic that can account for the snow globe in which we find ourselves the biblical language about the Earth assumes that we're on a flat disk the edges of the land before corners of the land the waters under the land the land is on pillars the Sky Dome above standing this while we read helps us to make sense of things like the windows of Heaven opened or phrases that might seem odd
 yes but actually make a lot of sense in that ancient perspective that's exactly right so when this is just about trying to understand there's another issue that comes along with how do I how do I go to terms with the fact that that isn't how he has ordered I mean that's true of all of these points that you have here this ancient lens what do we do with that do we impose that ancient lands on ourselves as the norm or do we just recognized that's the vehicle of communication this ancient Holter helpful and fun book to read by Hebrew Bible scholar Robin Perry called the biblical cosmesi pilgrims Guide to the weird and wonderful world Bible this is an extended quote so don't have to read longest and quotes but this is a good one cuz he's addressing that that very one I think helps us think it also helps us emerge this part of the Paradigm with wisdom motor part of the paradigm
 so he said Christians have a long tradition of adjusting and translating from Biblical cosmologies to contemporary cosmology often without even realizing it
 so we just merged the ancient cosmology and shift it to our own usually unconsciously in history of Christianity the ancient Israelite cosmology that's the three tiered Cosmos of the Skies the land in the Watersons the land that gave way to the ptolemaic cosmology that dominated Christian thought for centuries so that's the cosmology where the Earth is viewed as a globe it is a spear but it's at the center of a whole series of spheres the seven spheres going out above and that accounts for the movements of different layers of stars and Sun so it continues most Christians didn't even notice that a shift had taken place that shift from the difficult to the and wants copernican cosmology finally supplanted the told him so that's that we're on a sphere but we're not at the center we're going around the sun when that stymest
 did the ptolemaic Christians had little trouble adapting study do is take what he says remember in the biblical text the symbolic meaning of the image of Heaven above was always the most important thing about that language height or depth spoke of importance were ranked for the biblical authors the idea of Heaven being above meant that heaven was the most important dimension of all the creative world that's the high exalted place from which God rules over all things interpreting language of the high heaven non geographically deposit is taking it as a symbol that we would say they using the word Heaven as what's above to describe like a
 Transcendent Dimension that accounts for all things we would translate it into our cosmology which right now would be like another dimension or an ultimate the foundational Dimension that is only partially discernible to us forever but that we need that has to be present to explain everything else and quickly. So to finish the quote he says interpreting that language non geographically doesn't threaten the heart of devil cosmology at all the truth that scripture pointed to was always that heaven is invisible inaccessible to humans but it's at the heart of all creation because Divine Life and Rule all flow from it very helpful for me thank you Robin Perry yeah there is a sense of you think of I like to imagine an ancient thinker really believing
 that the the stars are creatures and there's a dome like they really I mean I think you saw them down they be like yeah that's how it is in God's Throne is up there and but then you get someone like Solomon who's talking about it and he's like yeah but even like the highest yes send it Heavens couldn't contain God she gets it like it's still at like it's just a way to think about and so I think the smartest ancients back then to also had this sense of like yeah we're just try to go to try to make sense of this that's right so this is been huge for me in the last couple years to just full-on Embrace ancient biblical cosmology and it's become so beautiful and profound to me it's because I've tried to do around Paris and cruising us to do which is to translate in my mind so instead of imposing my cosmology on the biblical authors about letting the
 letting the difference really stand out to me and then pondering to myself what does it mean what does it mean for David to say if I go to the skies you're there if I go into the abyss
 you're there you're inside me you're outside to me I can't go anywhere or are you not their poetry and do the profound claims about the nature of God's relationship creation but using ancient cosmology stuff like that so you try on the lens of the ancient authors if you know if you have an idea about what that is and then ask the question what message is being communicated through using this lens are the perspective what meaning is being put forth through it
at one part here is another deep cultural assumption that's very different from ours that follows from that I'm not quite sure what to call this so I'll just use words that I think are traditional within the Christian tradition this is a view of the sacramental in the spiritual so the modern world we've inherited over the last few years the view of nature as this vast complex machine or mechanism of parts that are all material nature the material and nature and all of it can be accounted for in Just Cause effect chains of molecules and things bumping into each other and combining all chemistry all the way down all the way down and so because of that focus on material it has resulted in a view of all reality that's very common called materialism
 that material is all of it is there is no other dimension or part of reality that we would call Rio that if it's not accounted for in that material and so this is lead to a big kind of division between ancient and modern cosmology is often the religious or face worldviews are pitted against modern or scientific world of the right yeah I remember my psychology teacher in 8th grade just basically saying you can't believe in ghosts angels' is kind of ridiculous he actually asked if I could read your hands clap if you believe in ghosts and like most of the class raised their hands and he is kind of ridiculous everyone that's ridiculous was the material world that's all there is and that's often and underline contriving assumption you resonate with our cultural background I do and another since I don't I grew up in a non-Christian home but my mom was really exploratory as far as the spiritual Realm
 we were always kids also exploring different spiritual Traditions so thinking about the spiritual realm a lot but I encountered that and another a to school sometimes it's hard to separate where we encounter what even thinking today I'm thinking man when I think about emotions or feelings I validate them the most when I can understand what's happening in my brain and I can explain it or I want to like understand the biology behind things or the chemistry of the brain functions so they're still maybe that inclination to do that to an interesting thing has happened though in modern Western forms of Christianity even in rejecting the idea that no there is a reality that is more than material or other than material it's also embraced this category that the material is what is fundamental or what is real and so whatever we're talking about in terms of
 some other dimension of spiritual Dimension or goddess Dimension is certainly not Material or there's no relationship to what we would call right like its distinct and it might break into the material world so whatever guy articles are a yes yeah I like God intervening entering into another thing emotion it's all material and of course he could come in and intervene and do something yeah but that's the exception and when that happens at Supernatural that I'm not rejecting of view that says only the material is what is real it still buys into a fundamental idea that the material is the opposite of whatever this Divine or schedule and so on and so the devil cloth has don't they don't think so sacramental means sacramental is a way of expressing with the biblical authors assume
 the material is the way that what is spiritual or most real is expressed to us in other words it's not about spiritual versus material it's that spiritual what is divine What flows from God is what is most real but the way that we encounter that isn't by non-material we're leaving the material world it's by experiencing the material world in an ultimate or spiritual state in the Bible spiritual doesn't always mean non-material it means ultimate at but the way I encounter that ultimately have been Divine Life in presence is through material things are guess I'm thinking immediately or just breathing Breath of Life God energy
 yeah be rats like is bringing Ox what would I would say is bringing oxygen it's my body it is a very material and from a material point of view it's just getting a chemical into my body so that everybody can survive but from a sacramental view that's actually participating with the Divine it's God's energizing Spirit I'll have the perfect language in Genesis 12 what is there that transforms the dark chaotic Waters into a garden in order invisible in one sense but the moment the spirit through God's word starts doing its thing everything that you see is spiritual Beast that is it's permeated created by and sustained by God to order
 spirit and purpose so the tree is the means by which I encounter the spirit and in through the existence of a tree I am through the of another person. This is and it's in Genesis to this is what underlies the animation of the human from the dust is human his spiritual that is infused by God's spirit and this accounts for everything the concept of Eden has a place where Heaven on Earth are the same place so if this is why the tops of mountains are often the sacred types of places Moses saw the pattern for the Tabernacle up on Mount Sinai the temple is up on Jerusalem Mount Zion the New Jerusalem in Revelation is depicted as on high coming down to merge with
 so it's why the biblical story doesn't end with a disembodied non-material world it's a material world but since it's been transformed by being totally merged with the spiritual
 and then you say the spiritual as opposed to material what do you mean if it's not something other than material so for the moment we're out we live under the sun and outside of Eden wear existing in a sub spiritual State its material and it's not unspiritual cuz the whole thing is to stay if I got Spirit but we're not at the hotspot sub spiritual we're not we're not in the center of a cosmology to be highest to be closest to the skies is to be closest to the Divine which means you're likely going to shine like a star that's vertical using vertical up and down you can also make a horizontal and think about Sacred Space in this is the Garden of Eden Paradigm where to be closest to the Divine is to be inside the tent to the in the middle
 if the garden in the city in the Temple City within the Refuge in the shadow of your wings and put it in the Psalms language so that's inside as well as most sacred and outside is what is common and so to be up or to be inside is where you meet that's where Exile is outside that's right that's why is outside the gate outside the gates that's right so this that movement from to the inside from the outside or to the highest from the lowest those are images of spiritual you more connected to the light more connected to God Ultimate Reality and life of the Divine and we say Ultimate Reality you mean why I'm at the material world matters or how the mature world is meant to be experienced it it's a way of saying the most perfect union between the material and spiritual when you say that you're you're automatically talking about them like they're two separate things
 yeah they are different dimensions some material can exist within the middle of the Garden in which case you eat from the tree of life and you are transformed you don't stop being material but it's a different kind of transmitted Ariel its ultimate material so there is a contrast but it's not between spiritual and material it's between
 explain your category and he uses the phrase trans physical to talk about the resurrected body of Jesus physical Insurance physical material and trans material be resurrected Jesus was filled by the spirit and spiritual but the resurrected Jesus is trans cynical or as Paul calls the resurrected Jesus the 1st Corinthians 14 a a life-giving spirit Spirit so it's more a difference between two loads of being material then between being material and both are connected to God Spirit like you said and Mabel's everything regardless of your inside the Garden or outside the Garden near the breath of life you have Cuts. But there is a sense of material that is like lagging
 it's it's still corrupted or I don't know how you corrupted or something gets the Bible's not asking us to put these two categories on it in the first place we're trying to describe the lens so it's natural to do that mortal and Immortal holy there's a common pure in a way that comes right from the first pages of the Bible, man and if you don't have that place you just won't see all kinds of things it's a cool invitation to like sometimes I think of the ancient Paradigm is being difficult or something to figure out or how do I how am I supposed to understand this but at the same time that it might be hard or difficult or different is also an invitation to see something in a different
 way that could be really fruitful not just for understanding the story but now for understanding my life around me and in a different way because my modern Paradigm is vino perfect are correct so try on something different is reality cuz we are blind to all of the ways where supernature what is Ultimate about reality is in front of her face all the time but we don't have the categories to see that it's their lives fascinates me because we've been two examples and they're completely different in one very specific way to cosmology we are very comfortable saying okay they got it wrong in a way but not wrong in the sense of the categories that were creating and the in the meaning behind it
 have to translate it to our cosmology so you know we talked about that but with this one I hear a saying you know they got right Anna Play-Doh came along and doesn't move that maybe is not has correct and then we adopted that we start translating the biblical authors into maybe a different Paradigm of the material world which we were comfortable with when it came to cosmology but now we're saying we should be suspicious of when it comes to Sacramento thinking in both cases were looking for the meaning and the message but at the same time this is other layer where were invited to try on a different lens than ours and we get to evaluate that even separately actually it is more similar I think then you're saying because we don't think within our cosmology up in the skies is the most intense space
 divine presence or the if I could just find somewhere on earth like if I come by and see if I go find the Garden of Eden then I could go go stand in the middle so they're ways of talking about all reality Within These spatial symbolic Frameworks in Translation we need to do so what are the ways in which the spiritual is being expressed to me through my physical environment but this is where are Catholic and Orthodox brothers and sisters have been saying to their Protestant sisters and brothers four centuries since some of the experiences I mean I'm getting from those Traditions that have identified a handful of physical experiences in life
 where you meet the Divine and they Stuart and care for those within the ministries of the church and so on
 do not just the Eucharist the bread and the cop but also marriage and another thing that only makes sense if you have a sacramental material plus spiritual infused new reality if you don't then sacramental thinking just won't make any sense
 we're not cruising to these as fast as I thought and that's fine collectivism vs. individualism the biblical a service Express some more collectivist view other terms have been used carpet thinking I like collectivist more but this is basic view about the human individual and their place within a larger group of modern Western readers have been shaped by our heritage that's just a few hundred years old that sings primarily in terms of individual liberty and the will and the autonomy of the individual even if it knows it's kind of a section cuz no one's Nyland you know but we treat the wheel of the individual as a very important center within our societies and that's very unique in human history of us and have us grow up isolated on island we won't even learn how to speak
 Angel nature would be a puddle collectivist lens can help us when we see stories that seem to be unfairly punishing the group for the one person's right or or the opposite of that and it even applies to things as simple as when we read the word in English you sing that as a singular versus a collective you y'all think how different the history of experiencing the New Testament letters would be if it was y'all and there are languages many languages translated that an individual's actions always implicate and affect the larger group or family or tribe to which they belong in the primary unit of responsibility is the group in the individual as an expression
 the group and so we live in a culture that exactly the opposite effect I was talking to a friend who's made some decisions recently that their parents really disagree with and what their parents are saying to them is your choices are going to affect Irma affect how people view our family and we are just processing that what do you do when you actually have a real moral or ethical value difference between generations and so you're you're operating by your conscience which is another deeply like it's also Christian principle to feel is right even if the men are going astray that's very difficult and so detention if written inside this context of collectivism so here were talking about biblical narratives or passages where a whole family is held accountable for something one person does
 group is held accountable for 10 famous ones like when David Countess number of soldiers until God sends a devastating plague on the people you know to our minds that is and it is actually I think the whole point of that narrative is it is unfair which is why David get the guts face about it but that's another thing with the relationship and about concepts of justice and how is God to deal with human failure and evil if it means you know holding the menu accountable so there's a passage in Paul's letters and 1st Corinthians 5 where is responding about that guy who sleeps with his mother-in-law and he lays into the whole community and start talking about 11 with in a lump of dough and that whole chapter 1st Corinthians 5 is an expression of this kind of thinking where he says what this one guy is doing is going to affect how the whole neighborhood thinks about you and the Jesus movement so you did
 the daily with that one person and it feels like wow that's really intense what he's thinking collectively now it's affecting its right to your next Point honor and shame years ago when I was working on the Book of Daniel and Daniel chapter 9 he's like one of the ultimate righteous Biblical characters Daniel there's no actual failure to know he passes all of his test with flying colors he does get sick and he claims to not have wisdom and understanding we need sees some of these bizarre dreams that he has but I'm in Daniel chapter 9 he does this review of the whole history of Israel's failure
 and you consistently uses the word we and implicates himself and then he even takes it upon himself to repent before God for the failure of his entire family throughout history you like that a different mentality and how about history and culture and where responsibility Lies We have a hard time taking responsibility for like our grandparents stuff and he's like thinking of like generation to generation so not only is it that he's not from those Generations but that in his actual personal life he was like a stand-up guy but yet he identified with it and takes responsibility for the sins of the damn that's really beautiful I think so something very profound there yeah that my culture is not telling me this
yes okay so you're right cuz of that collectivist versus individualist implicates and is connected with another one this is a big cultural difference that actually has a lot of facets but it has a handy little title called honor and shame every time we've talked about this I go okay I think I'm getting it and then every time it comes back up I might have no idea what this is so let's let Michael Gorman New Testament the opening words of this paragraph are simply defined honor and shame refer to the ongoing attribution or loss of esteem by one's peers family social class City and Salman Khan going at your beautician or lost or loss of self esteem planner way of saying that I steam
 stop esteem recognition on how do people look at me and think about me the house that respect is translated into your rank within Society okay that's how I think of respect reputation okay that's good word ranking social expression of that esteem in the public place you hold within Society it's really your status to a person's status which collectivist is holy implicated in your family are tribes status and that every person is every day going up or down the scale of Honor shame music going up or you going down it's never Static-X everyone around you and your group or status implicates the group that you're associated with
 so Gorman goes on in Roman society this respect was based primarily on things such as wealth and keishin rhetorical skill your ability to persuade others what is an influence something good what's good what's the book How to Win Friends and Influence People and political connections these are the cultures status indicators that is the case in the modern West it's his case in every culture has some form of some form of this but you're saying that the volume turned up to a certain level that we're just not used to that would appall yeah that would have all us depends on where you grow up in America how are your up if you're in a western country western is not negative or something to avoid but viewed as appropriate and welcome that to a lot of us feels really a paw
 yes exactly it is the finishing the quote pure pressure in this environment is not negative it's not something to avoid it's appropriate and welcome to someone with a higher rank comes to me and pressures me to do something it's like of course you're going to do it and this is your chance is my chance to get in their good graces chance to get the constant ladder climb and I think it was different about it is back to collectivism and individualistic with an individual has more individual in societies we tend to view important or honor or rank as subjective as an individual and so I've made this joke you do you for years now you do you every Disney movie made in the last two decades is an expression of an individualist honor framework self-esteem
 portents with your unique identity can only be discovered and determined by yourself don't let others tell you who you are and I'm not saying I'm just saying all cultures exist on a spectrum of the ways that they express the zahner on a shame has been bitter Roman society was very group and it was very explicit so someone who's been a slave even if you can gain freedom will never be able to get Beyond the Sea turn red certain ceiling just because of the rank of their status as a as a former slave slaves are very very influential that what we're not saying is that the Bible is saying this is good this is the cultural Assumption of this how our society has ordered us. Jesus will go to a dinner party where that's how people are acting you're not it next to each other next to the cool person trying to like you know move up the ranks and he
 tell them they're being dumb yeah yeah but what he doesn't say it is rank doesn't matter you know just be who you are or do you want to sit at the head of the table that what he says is no the poor are elevated to the highest place he inverted the scale to communicate and correct inverts the honor shame rank structure and again which I think is important we're back to a translation Coulter navigating cross-cultural okay because to embody what Jesus is saying and are setting we don't have to reinvent for Century culture in the local church to follow the teachings in a different cultural setting the being aware of it when we read just teaching there with your translate translate if you're not if you don't understand yeah we talked about the two before his this word
 honor in Greek or esteem it comes from the Greek verb duck to esteem someone and regard them as important and that verb. Comes from the same root as the Greek word doxa which is translated glory and I try to get in the mental have it when I see the word glory in my English translation to just always say honor cuz it's about someone status someone's ultimate status within the pain and shame ranking system would be a good example of a verse that says Glory that you should just think of her
 the great question John to swim idea will work study. Let's just do something random to English or Glory a 360 x in The New American Standard translation so I'm just going to go through all this and I'm just going to scroll and Isaiah 10:18 okay so this is about the Empire of Assyria Susan and one of the battery in the Kingdom. Of Isabella and King Hezekiah King in Jerusalem Assyrian Empire is on the rise it's the biggest Memphis the first Empire that the ancient world has ever known the largest organization of military strength into that point in human history and so they're coming and the king of Assyria besiege the city of Jerusalem and What God Says is
 God is going to destroy the glory of a serious forest and garden goes through their Glory of their forests and garden yet honor or their rank so there it just seems like it means like you know your garden is very beautiful and you're there and just has a sense of just on my typically think of you every time there's a couple things are going on one is a cultural background that's the king of Assyria I mean some of the most famous images that you can Google are of us are addends like cultivated Garden midlo Eaton's of his kingdom to depict himself as the bringer of order and Beauty but it was a it was all an embodiment of his status as the king of the world by status I can order creation and so from his high place on Eden the king of Assyria went for us and was annexing the whole world is to be you know the tax Regents they were going to fund his garden
 and is eating and God says no I'm going to destroy the glory Steve reward covered so and there it's the word heavy the Hebrew word covered means happy so in your steam it's about your reading the gravity new Gravity Glory has to do with embody the physical embodiment of your Social rank this interesting as tight as together we start talking about words and then we said well so where does the simple way to think about how different cultures few things in slightly different ways and there's bigger categories that one word may not capture in this cosmology cheese and there's Sacramento and spiritual how we just think about the material world but then when it comes back around the way for us to think about it it's still with words the words are often the vehicles of these larger cultural Concepts and one more word the land the plane I suppose in the
 play shame is the word Grace yes which is the word gift so we have two words one is what sounds like a religious word grace and then another words gift they're the science yeah they're the same wording in Greek chorus and the giving of gifts was one of the main ways that you attempt to move up the ladder is by giving gifts to people of lower rank to put them in your debt so that they're obligated then to be back be in connection with you or the giving of gifts to someone of higher rank in the hopes that they will return and reciprocate an elephant and then you receiving a gift from someone higher it's the way you get up the ladder and so gifts are always given with an expectation of response races are always given Grace's yeah that's right the grace can be freely given okay hear the the guru Master the Kung Fu Master of the gift and Grace language is the New Testament scholar John Barclay and a man so good
 yeah Grace in the New Testament is given without condition is given for free but it is given with expectation of return patterns Grace Saving Grace gets brought into the framework
 I just have one more we don't have time to talk about it I can just bring it up fully Holiness holy and profane sacred and secular it seems pretty connected to the security and pollution he's okay but it is connected up to the Sacramento Sacramento world to you and and us mology this is the idea that there's some things are associated with life and the divine presence is always associated with life and power and Purity and what is Mortal is associated with failure mortality death and impurity and so we are always in one State or the other usually moving from one many times in our lives with the the highest goal like I sending to the heavens were sending into the holy place is to move from a state of polluted impurity to sacredness in Holiness in.
 cleanliness is Next to Godliness and read through it you might notice and things differently yeah all the stuff about Holiness ritual Purity in the Old Testament kosher food laws but it's all activated in the stories about Jesus the people he heals we shouldn't be touching people who were ritually a which means they weren't allowed to go in the temple precincts and not state it wouldn't be allowed to go inside and you're not even likes the really be interacting with them or you would bill go outside you can contract impurity by touching love you and so unless the big inversion is in the stories about Jesus it's the Purity is what's contagious contagious Holiness that's what I love about the Holiness for you and made you one more that I'm thinking of that makes a really big difference when I read at least is that cultural assumptions
 F patriarchalism even being aware that this is a society where we're going to hear more about the fathers and the honor associated with the household of a father of a husband we're going to hear women's names mentioned less just because of the culture and so and they are mentioned that's a countercultural of a countercultural move for Beth Israel neurology practice kind of moves would be very very strange for us but for all the time and it can we're back to that has been a question throughout church history to what degree is the Bible just it was written in this context and so expresses that view whether or not the trajectory of the biblical story
 sing and all views of reality should be male-centered or picture I consent to it and that's been the big conversation throughout your history but it's important to notice it so that we don't just import whatever our views onto the Bible I think this is important to say that all of these assumptions except for the sacramental one feel like saying hey this is just where culture was and how it thought and it's a neutral place not a neutral place to stay away but think of it as just the waters they were swimming in I would still making sense of things that we can then translate out of where I think the sacramental 12 me feel different and maybe we don't solve this but that one feels a little bit more like don't leave those Waters like you can leave the Waters of an ancient cosmology translate out of it we're out of honor and shame culture
 can I have a patriarchal culture you can translate out of it but the sacramental wants me feels like don't is something we need to translate for sacramental in other words I won't go looking for God more at the basement of my house then I will outside the house but those are the biblical categories in inside or outside ear for talking about you have talking about Sacred Space encountered here in the material that's what I'm saying is you don't need to become a flat earther to understand the nature of God that's right however I think what the biblical story and a Sacramento will do use asking us to see is there are certain places people moments and experiences that are material that can become vehicles of God's presence in a very special unique way that unlike if I were to meet another one of those people places times you know
 the next day so the material can be a vehicle of the spiritual that is the fundamental thing here the dust translate but the idea that that's inside of Temple pricey but where that is where that is the language in categories for that was an immense a beautiful way to think about your biology totally right that's right which I think is about what makes something biblical we have a Biblical view of Acts exactly this is my point in this is the challenge is well okay what are we what the biblical authors just assumed about reality that the Earth is flat that's right yeah I mean we could go up this whole later on the phone with people with skin diseases shouldn't be able to access divine presence that only males should be in the leadership of in all areas of Faith vulture write these are some of your pressure is good that you had
 but we also need to attend is to the message of the biblical books that often yes developing adapting tweaking inverting inverting these assumptions in ways that we can only see if we noticed this in the first place. I think I can you bring up a track is a good example where they're some passage in the Bible that speak from a very patriarchal centered point of view there other parts of the Bible that are inverting and moving so they're both within the Bible so they have a Biblical view of X is usually a little more complicated than we often assume and I think that's the takeaway here is that we need to think more deeply about how we Engage The Bible and being taking a contextually rooted approach can often help us spot things that we might be blind or that culture is the vehicle that ancient cultures the vehicle and we're not meant to impose all of that on ourselves but we have to understand it to under
 and the author's message and at the same time it is a challenge to listen to another person in a different culture or another group of people and try on Allen's and evaluated as opposed to our own just like we're listening to anybody from a different culture so it is it the challenge it's also just the context so we're going to do one more episode on this Paradigm conversation and that's going to be that the Bible is a type of literature that's meant to be read in community communal literature it's not just read but also invited and express thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're tackling the final pillar of the Paradigm that the Bible is the communal literature
 so stop and think for fifteen hundred years most followers of Jesus heard the Bible read aloud in group settings what that means is that the moment somebody would hear something and be like why I don't get that you like turn to the other person and you like what does that mean and they would be like I don't know what that means let's go talk to the priest let's go talk to the pastor so in other words the puzzles in scripture and there are loaded onto every page we're always part of a communal invitation to go connect to other people in the community so that we can discuss it and debate about it and so on and that process has short-circuited it's the main way I can gauge the Bible is reading it alone by myself today show is produced by Cooper pelts Zach McKinley is our editor Dan gummo has our lead editor and Lyndsay Ponder has done the show goats special thanks to Frank Garza for helping us produce this series Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as unified story
