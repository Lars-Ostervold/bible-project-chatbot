welcome to the scroll of Deuteronomy this is a big day for us because we've been working our way through the tour up all year and today we get to open up final scroll is that it has so many ancient laws and so I guess it's best to inform you now that Deuteronomy the final scroll has a lot more lies in fact Deuteronomy is the Greek name for the book and it literally means s law but is he read many of the laws you're going to be like I think I heard that before and that's because you did dozens of the laws in Deuteronomy are nearly verbatim two laws that you came across in numbers Leviticus where in Exodus and so it's kind of question was that about a few are totally identical but often they're little adaptations for changes it's an explanation so this renewed giving of the Torah it is both recalling
 the wisdom of the earlier command but applying them in new ways for a new generation in a new situation that's the dynamic you see the laws so far have been given to the first generation of Israel left Egypt and is now wandering through the Wilderness Moses is realizing that those laws need to be looked at again affresh for a new generation to generation who's going to go into the promised land Who start the set up a pattern that like I bet every generation is going to start to need its own renewed explanation of the Torah for its own time and place every generation needs to look at the wisdom of the law with fresh eyes that includes every generation in the Bible that also includes Us by telling you the reader that you thought you were just reading a story about Israelites if you're a human and you're probably going to die you were the audience of the Torah
 you were the Wilderness generation Deuteronomy scroll and the First theme will explore are the repeated words listen and I'm not calling you listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hey Tim is John hello here we are here we are beginning a new stroll we are talking Torah as we have been for many hours mini mini episode in to the Torah but today is a significant turning point in our journey through the Torah why is that John because well we are beginning a new scroll scroll Deuteronomy and it's the last role in the Torah yes it is you know in Judaism you go in you you learn Torah or you do tour instruction right like that's kind of a part of the of the week in which case you are just reading these books right or does the word begin to me more it depends different Traditions do it differently but often at the youngest ages called day school Hebrew Day School where you're learning kind of the main stories of the Torah and then
 it's when you get into the middle school years they've you began to learn the bodies of reflection and commentary of later Jewish tradition back on the laws of the Torah which is called mishnah talmud and it's like progressively deeper sections of the pool you know it's what you start with when you're young so anyway that's true to me is very unique book in the Torah yes we've been reading a story from the beginning of the creation of the cosmos yeah but then you know that that goes pretty quickly until you get to this character Abraham and then the story slows down essentially to then focus on Abraham's family and then the story slows down even more when it gets Abraham's family in slavery in Egypt and
 The Scroll of Exodus to where we just ended in numbers really just takes place in the course of one 42 years that is about 40 years yeah so the tour begins and it spans like many many many generations thousands of years from Adam and Eve to many nations and then you get Genesis which is four generation and then you get Exodus two numbers which is kind of like two generations to Generations but spanning 40 years that's right next to the story and so I guess all the say Deuteronomy it all takes place in real time it's a speech it slows way down the story slowed way down so slow that many people don't even see it anymore I can't find the story there
 is a narrative skeleton to the book of Deuteronomy in other words moments where the narrator's voice comes and talks about Moses in the third person as if he's not the one talking and actually this is exactly where I was going to start our conversation it is a story but the narrator doesn't speak up except at the first paragraph very seldom throughout the body of the scroll and then the whole last chapter is the narrator so The Narrative of Deuteronomy is just a small Skeleton on which is hung long speeches that are all set in the framework of within the narrative a day it's really it's the polar opposite of Genesis which is 50 chapters no mountain Bible spins you know thousands of years many generations and on the opposite end of the Torah is doodle
 today cuz you know it's presented as one set of speeches and you can read the whole thing aloud and I think about 3 hours and maybe for bringing up the past. But it's like you can be a part of you know ya put Moses on 1.5 speed and you can get knocked out in two and a half and in other important ways Deuteronomy in Genesis connect to each other so in terms of time taste their the Polar Opposites whereas the central three Scrolls Exodus Leviticus Numbers are all a unified narrative from the journey from Egypt to Sinai in from cyanide to the border of the promised land in Spain 40 years but in other ways Genesis and Deuteronomy match each other as well and you talked a little bit about that over the course of these conversations so I imagine we'll see that I play a little bit it was the story from Adam to Abraham
 as far as the last eaten promise and blessing the story of Abraham of recapturing that and making the Eden blessing available to the nation's but through one family and then you get four generations of that family and it ends with the third generation Jacob overlooking the 4th generation his twelve sons and anticipating all that's going to happen in a poem and a blessing that he gets to his twelve signs and he says All My Sons gather to me and let me tell you what will happen at the end of days and then you get the Palm Genesis 49 minute forecast much of what's going to happen in the rest of the Torah and Prophets and so similarly here's Moses The Last of The Exodus generation except for two guys who are righteous Joshua and Caleb and he's been told is about to die and so he gives these long speeches but that culminates in the final section of Deuteronomy
 32 + 33 where he speaks not one poem like Jacob but two and he says gather around tribes and let me tell you what will happen at the end of days it's like exactly the same price and he speaks one a blessing over the Twelve Tribes just like Jacob did that's Deuteronomy 33 but in Deuteronomy 32 he forecasts the whole story you are about to read in Joshua Judges Samuel Kings and the future that is described in the profits that is Isaiah Jeremiah is Ezekiel in the 12 and Moses is portrayed as the archetypal Prophet warned Israel to be faithful to the covenant What would happen if they don't the Exile that will follow the atonement the God will provide to make a restoration and the new creation out the other side that's what Moses his final words are about to draw me 32 and so
 just like the Genesis ends with Jacob and the 12 sons outside the promised land waiting to go by speaking these long poems of blessing and future forecasting and so Deuteronomy ends the same way with a generation outside the land waiting to go in Moses speaking blessings but also for casting of what's to come to lose a really important, our door frames for the Torah and that's just the end like all those parallels with Jakob just happened in the last few chapters of Deuteronomy so we're going to do is go back to the beginning. Go through the whole book section by section of Genesis in Deuteronomy are very much designed as matching kind of powder frames of the door it's kind of like trying to think of a movie that begins and ends in I was very similar moments but because he's gone through the Journey of the movie or the story
 you don't experience it the same way even though it's very much the same that's pretty common in the hero's journey kind of motif the hero comes back to the dorm and re-enters at but changed going back to the Shire every scroll has been broken up into movements and we've been reading Scrolls in these movements these large sections of stories that work as a whole and is often three genesis at 4 but the rest of the Scrolls of had three and that design can help you know where you are also helps you and be able to compare stories so what we've been doing was we've been tracing one patterned through one movement is so walk me through briefly the movements in Deuteronomy and the patterns will chase Deuteronomy actually falls barely neatly into three big sections
 open up most commentaries the quibble about kind of minor or interior level boundaries but the book has three big parts and almost everybody can see them move to read a few times that begin with a series of speeches from Moses or Moses will recount the past of the story of Israel from The Exodus up to the present essentially is sermons the first block of Deuteronomy read like condensed sermons from Pastor the best of Moses and it's essentially Moses trying to say here's where we came from here is who he always has been to us we entered into a covenant with him at Mount Sinai be loyal to your way like don't worship other gods don't do what your ancestors kept doing be faithful and things will go great and that block of speeches makes up what we would call chapters 1 through 11 from the beginning 11 to the end of 11:00 so hear that
 after brakes actually coincide with the movement break so all of 11 is the last unit of the last bets a1311 their speeches from Moses and they read like straight up like sermons cool chapter 12 through halfway through chapter 26a pivots and it's still Moses's speaking voice but it started talking about the laws that Israel is to live by when they go into the land so when you cross this River here is how you were to live and organize yourself and we've already gotten laws about how to live in the land yes toy so the first paragraph of Deuteronomy is going to set up all of Deuteronomy as a commentary on the law on the walls that have to give in texts so we'll come back and read that first paragraph but it's essentially just from a observational standpoint chapter 12 through halfway through 26 is lots more lost
 couple hundred more to the lot and there's fascinating we'll talk about that when we talked about this but many of them are adaptations of earlier laws that you came across it earlier in the Torah but they've been adapted to describe not the law as you should follow it in the wilderness as a migrant camp but the law adapted for living settled life in the land really interesting so that's a Los Mancos 12th through the 26th and then halfway to 26 26 verse 16 on through the end of the school we go back into Moses and sermon mode and again he's calling his real warning them of the curses and the self-destruction the create if they aren't faithful to Yahweh he promises them of the blessings of Eden that will come if they do
 the other know where he's pretty skeptical and he says I know you're not going to do it and it's going to go terrible for you but y'all won't give up on you even if you're exiled far from the land and then he thinks those Palms at the end and then you get the little narrative at the end of the book where he dies so three movements the first movement is sermons that is supposed to say of Moses 2nd Movement is Moses giving commentary on all the laws that we've learned third movement is there more sermons by Moses that ends with some songs and then the narrative about his staff know this is always hard to do on the podcast is helpful if you have a charger a whiteboard but the first movement has three parts
 the last movement has three parts in the way each of those movements relate to each other is in a mirror symmetry or we could call it a chiasm so I want try and describe it but if you pay attention to patterns of unique repeated words the opening chapters movement 1 through 11 and the last movement 2634 have really unique hyperlinking matches were the opening in the closing movements are like mirrors exact measures of each other it's cool literary Artistry but it invites the reader to compare these different sections that are separated by a huge block of hundreds of Lost in the middle of the school at the beginning of the scroll in the ending of squirrel have been crafted really linked together and this is meditation literature once you see that then you're called to begin joining and comparing sections of the book that are far away from each other on the scroll
 but that have been designed with an eye towards each other and as you do so you get deeper insight into Moses's message on both sides of the scroll there's three big movements and those of you who are going through the reading journey in the app that will create more we focus on a theme of repeated key word or idea through a literary movement here at the seams so we're going to focus on Deuteronomy 4 chapters 1 through 11 we're going to be focusing on two key words that are linked together which are the words listen and the words love
 the Moses sermons in 1 through 11 are recalling how he always showed love to our ancestors and US throughout all of our history through bring us out of slavery in protecting us through the Wilderness oh and also how you always listen to our cry when we tried out to him in the Egyptian slavery so you always listening left and so Israel is to respond by listening to Abba and showing loyal love and return back to him so what school is of all the five Scrolls of the Torah the words listen and the words love repeat with the highest density in the section of Deuteronomy pretty cool
 and that's a pattern yeah it's a pattern in that it's a key repeated word that weaves this whole section of opening speeches together seems is one type of pattern which is just a key idea that's repeated the links a bunch of literal units together the middle of the book chapters 12 through part 26 is all the laws and so we're going to focus on the theme of the La Vela fairly intuitive and then the last section half of 26 on to 34 the word blessing and curse appears in these chapters with higher density the only other place that compares is back in the Genesis school so it's another way that Genesis and Deuteronomy or like bookends around the Torah the themes of blessing and curse or talked about the most in Genesis and then in the last movement of Deuteronomy
 so this amazing scroll I know the middle part is often hard to read for modern readers but if you really get with the first and third movements are in the scroll I think he can really provide a little more motivation and curiosity and excitement for waiting through the laws that are in the middle now the name Deuteronomy yeah that's a Greek name yes give it to us from the Septuagint probably yeah it's been a while since I look this up but that yeah the names that we have for the biblical Scrolls for many of them not all but many of them come from yeah the Greek translation tradition so Deuteronomy is a Greek compound word so as to Greek words much together due to Ross which is second and then, which is the word for law which is a Greek translation of the Hebrew word Torah is a Greek translation of Torah namas is the standard old Greek translation of Torah
 so the second Torah as Torah and that idea is taking its cue from the first paragraph of the book and thought nothing for it let's just dive in and read the first paragraph of the book and a whole bunch of cool things will unfold from the section
Deuteronomy 1 verse 1 z's are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness this first line these are the words are the source of the name of the school in Jewish tradition which is deveren which is the Hebrew word for word from the varine yeah so the singular of our word and then the portal is different me so these are the where it's now this is the narrator speaking so notice this book begins with a narrators painting a narrative context and Moses is a character within the narrative world and there's actually a little detail here I don't know if you'll notice it that tells you something about the time or at least the location of the narrator
 these are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness in and then you get a bunch of geographical markers of what Wilderness it was in the RV opposite soothe between piranha and purple and Lavon and cut zero-turn Diesel have you know I don't know either cities on on the east side of the Jordan yeah their names either near towns or four different regions but for over on the east side of the Jordan regions or landmarks yes I got notice this is all being spoken of by the narrator in past tense these are the words which Moses spoke and look up the first description is across the Jordan
 cross the Jordan so this is being compiled and this intros being written on the other side of the Jordan School ended it situated the story these are the Commandments that the lord gave to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan River and so the narrator locates everything from the perspective of being on the east side of the Jordan River yeah Deuteronomy opens with a voice of somebody living on the west side of the river yeah another words like numbers the cameras in the east side of the Jordan in the camp with his real ready to go but then we get to draw Timmy scroll suddenly the cameras now on the other side someone kind of saying hey I'm going to tell you a Moses said back then across the Jordan but he's sitting this scribe is sitting on the other side of
 Jordan totally compiling the camera in numbers ends looking at Moses in the people but with the west side of the river in the background right like the cameras pointed West that's the future Deuteronomy opens and all of a sudden it's the opposite where it's depicting Moses and the people but the cameras located on the west side of the river and it's sort of like you have to zoom in right cuz of the viewer in the speaker are living in the land so that's an important little details that pay dividends as we go on but the narrator is different than the voice of Moses keep it on the opening paragraph the narrator continues
 it is 11 days' Journey from Horeb by the way of Mount sit here to Cottage barnea that's a nerdy little detail the great Bible trivia in all those words feel like I kind of should know what where they are what they are like I was busy before or some variation of them so horrid their two names for Mount Sinai in the tour I one of them is by 9 and that word is a word play off of the name of the species of bush the Moses saw my need to send that but she hasn't that's burning brush and then Horeb is the Hebrew word for like dry and this hill really call him we're really small mountain is in the middle of the Wilderness where it's really dry and then mounts a ear is centrally the route that subscribe
 Israelites taken the book of numbers and then Cottage By Nia is the entry point into the land on the west side of the river from where the spies were sent out my Moses sent out that I was back in numbers 13 so it should have taken 11 days I was just where you get that okay chapter 1 the Biryani it's 11 days from Horeb by the way I'm outside here at the cages barnea 43 in the 40th year on the first day of the eleventh month Moses spoke to the children of Israel and all that the Lord commanded him to give them
 are you supposed to see that contrast there what should have been 11:40 40 years not days beers so just mentioning the place where the spies were sent from and then using the 40th year in the next sentence there's a whole story you know just said buried underneath that they're setting you got Moses is across Jordan from the speaker and they are sitting there in the 40th year should take a lot of days but four days a year and he's going to give them speeches now for us for this was after Moses had defeated second king of the amorites who lived in Ashburn and Org the king of Bashan who lived in the throat and a dry
 so these are two giants giant Kings Moses lead the Israelites to the east side of the Jordan these two kings didn't take kindly to that and they attacked Israelites and Moses led the campaign to defeat the king of the amorites who lived in such pain so it's Sehun is the consonants that make up the core consonants of the word snake backwards and bone is the word to conspire it's a scheme so weird for scheme to come up with a scheme so he defeated a guy whose name is snake spelled backwards is King over the land of treacherous scheming and org who's the king of Bashan which is the Hebrew spelling spelling and Hebrew letters of the Aramaic word for snake
 oh well there's love this stuff though often do hyperlinking to earlier biblical stories but through word place and time these are fine examples of that and they're Giants they were Giant Warrior King and where did we learn there were giants in the story and never second numbers and here in Deuteronomy so across the Jordan in the land of Moab Moses undertook to expound this Torah saying and then weekends so this is crucial he expounds Torah that's the new American Standard this is a good moment to compare translations Deuteronomy 1 verse 5
 nasb has to expound that would you were use that word expound know me neither
 yes he has to explain this Torah and King James has declare nrsv has expound and Ivy has expound interesting and that usually is as more normal English words but in this case it's that yes be explained it's the Hebrew word they add the fur Bay air which is essentially when you are picking up an idea or usually a written text something that already exists and you're not remaking it you are just well explain explain is a great there's another Hebrew word that can be defined as explained to like make someone understand understanding to bring understanding it seems like a similar idea here was just looking at the etymology of expound and it's yet to comment on or to explain something to reveal the meeting from within it so coming to
 some sort of text or story or something and then to say I'm going to help you understand what this means is very similar to the Hebrew word this word it actually very rare only a three times in the whole heap of my phone this is one of them another one is at the book end of Deuteronomy in Deuteronomy 27 verse 8 and Moses talks about how when the Israelites go into the land they are to pick some really big rocks and cover them with plaster and then to etch into the plaster of the stones all the words of this Torah and as they do so they are too bad to make them really clear so here it's not explaining something it's writing something and I really neat clear way you can see very clearly what it says that's interesting and then actually corresponds to the other place this word is used which is in
 little book of habakkuk when the 12 prophets where he's called to he's to write down something on tablets and he is to make it clear on the tablets so in these two other cases it's about really it's not having neat handwriting but here at the opening of Deuteronomy you get this other nuanced of the word which is not about him writing the rather it's about him picking up something that's already written and he is too bad that is make it clear yeah that's interesting so our word expound doesn't do that double duty when you can also mean just a really good handwriting when I get out I get out of that I'll kiss it is a word but they are and it's used as a way to make something kind of crystal clear maybe with a fuzzy idea these laws I'm going to like really bring into sharp Focus for you and it's the same word that can be used I'm just really legible handwriting I don't know why
 so long but I'm sitting here talking to somebody whose previous like career life before we did this project was making explainer videos in the Bible the next Sounder a beta error
 I am really fascinated with this word to make something clear clear handwriting or clear conceptual explanation of 3 * 3 * 2 * it actually refers to handwriting in context in this case it's not referring to something Moses is writing it something that's already been written it's almost like if this was the word legible but it was used as a way to make an idea legible which is more of a metaphor yes in a way that's kind of what's going on here ok Google meaning of a verb that also means to make something legible that's as good as it's going on here so this is actually really important Dynamic for what's happening in Deuteronomy
 to all the name an experience that many people have well first of all if anybody is reading through the Bible in makes it to Deuteronomy that itself is a accomplishment that's awesome and Ethan will probably happen to be around me but when you get to that middle block of laws and Deuteronomy 12 to 26 it's reading ancient near Eastern laws given to people assuming the life setting of tribal agricultural communities like farming communities and this have to do with my life but as you read many of the laws you're going to be like I think I heard that before and that's because you didn't dozens of the laws in Deuteronomy are nearly verbatim to laws you came across in numbers in Leviticus where in Exodus and so it's kind of begs a question like what's that about why are there laws being repeated but if you compare them sometimes they are like very new
 play identical stuff you are totally identical but often they're little adaptations for changes and this little narrative intro paragraph is giving you a rationale for why you're going to come across a second giving of the Torah which is why the name Deuteronomy it's kind of on point because that's what it is and so verse five year is giving you an explanation of why you're going to meet about the laws against some of them knew but some of them for the second time it's an explanation in what way is it an explanation if he's just saying the law again you're saying sometimes it's just verbatim Mike here's the login button sometimes just weeks and so how biblical literature works is when there's repetition you were meant to go back and look at or call up in your mind if you memorized it all I haven't but which I well anyway the original Bible nerds to God's spirit to frame
 you put all the stuff together definitely have it all memorized to call up in your mind the earlier passage being referred to and compare them and meditate on the similarities and the differences and what you'll find is often they meaningful Insight given to you by the differences so that's one element of what's Happening Here but then there's another one that is actually being alluded to this the story underneath why the 11 days became 40 years remember there's a little story underneath that that tells you why Moses would need to give a more clear explanation of the Torah in this moment in the story and so essentially the most simple way to say it is the audience of all of the previous hundreds of laws that you ran through in Exodus Leviticus the numbers all the people who heard those wise or debt and the people sitting in front of Moses
 like little kids were teenagers when all those laws were given and so this is for a new generation you get a renewed giving of the Torah let's see what's happening here now that may not sound very exciting to describe on the surface but it's a crucially important Dynamic that's happening here in Deuteronomy this is a new Torah for a new generation will start to set up a pattern that like I bet every generation is going to start to need its own renewed explanation of the Torah for its own time and place cuz that's certainly what's happening here so interesting tell me more about that was just here the generation that heard the laws of the Torah
 and then didn't live by them. In Exile outside of the land about the children of that generation have another chance they stand at the border of the land yet again and so the laws of the Torah are renewed for them sometimes verbatim but often with little clarification and framed here in Deuteronomy with a bunch of sermons and motivational speeches to kind of rev up the team before they you don't go out on the field so to speak in a way it's like the locker room speech before the game it's the Braveheart speech and even though like the team last year that had some of the same players but some different players like the coach gave you no similar speech a year ago
 but it's a different team sitting here with a new moment even though it's the same field in the same walk around that's kind of a dynamic is just like that okay yeah and we talked about years ago when we talked about the theme of the law you really made a point of showing that these ancient laws were given in a cultural moment where they're situated and the ones who were framing the Torah later the narrator here as you are describing him or describes we're putting the tour into its final shape they are not in that same quotes for a moment but they still care about what those specific laws that were given to Israel in some way they still are instruction for them but then you've been pointing out this pattern in the door itself where there's stories of
 updates now that we're like maybe there's a lack of completion there isn't a law for a specific thing that's happening when to celebrate Passover if your unclean or what happens to your land if you have no sons and so then Moses goes and ask God to get an update to the law so you've been chewing that pattern to hear you're showing something seems similar which is here's a new generation who is now stepping into a new moment and their place in time is different than those who first received the Covenant commands the ancient law code and so Moses renuzit for them by explaining the significance of the original and in the form of giving them a new version of it essentially and in the opening chapters which I will really kind of dive into in the next conversation chapters 1 through 11 he's
 retelling the story of how we came out of slavery how we are at Mount Sinai and God gave commands but your father's rebelled against the commands they all died off and here we are inheritors of those commands but what they mean for us now living in a situation were about to cross the river and experience the kind of life that your father's never experienced so this renewed giving of the Torah is both recalling the wisdom of the earlier commands but applying them in new ways for a new generation in a new situation that's the end it's just going to continue a pattern where Moses is going to be presented here as the archetypal Prophet especially cuz the prophet is the one who mediates the word of God the God's people yeah and so what Moses is doing here is going to set the pattern for all of the prophetic leaders you're going to keep meeting throughout the next section of the Tanakh which is the proper
 is the tour is going to come to a close here with Deuteronomy and then Joshua Judges Samuel Kings and then Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and the 12 they're all new prophets they're all called the prophets and what they'll be is they'll tell the story of how Israel did in the land from the perspective of the profits and then you got the 3 + 12 writing prophets look back on the history that was
okay couple questions the profits aren't doing what Moses did hear what you're saying hey guys were in a new setting we got a king now or anywhere in the new setting Babylon took over let me expound on the laws and give them to you a fresh are you saying they're doing something similar though they do something similar they are like Moses calling Israel to be faithful to the covenant made long ago and so this is what when The Profit start showing up this is what Joshua does is kind of a interesting kind of King in a prophet figure but then once you get into the judges Samuel and Kings you get this group of people are called the prophets and what they always talk about is how Israel is doing in terms of their loyalty to this Covenant agreement and then warning them of either Covenant curse or promising Covenant blessing if they respond positively or negatively and so they're like little Moses's yeah that's a hard word to say in plural and so the role of Moses and Deuteronomy
 come the template for the kind of figure that Israel is going to need in every generation to keep their face white hot of heat their devotion write like with renewed intensity in every generation you're going to need a calling back to the Covenant to the laws and you're going to need a Moses figure and that's the role that he's playing for this generation here which means A Renewed giving of the Torah the difference you're drawing attention to is you don't like in the book of Samuel 1 Samuel is coming up to King Saul to David he doesn't give a long new set of laws what he caused those guys to is faithfulness to the laws given through Moses right but he's the template the prophet par exsalonce but he also kind of you know that everybody else stands on his shoulders so just be more which is that the law needs to be
 tweets or got it well but what you going to watch happened in these laws is sometimes and this is where I get again I'm just previewing conversations we're going to have the we're going to watch laws that were given to the Wilderness generation get adapted an updated into the life in the land and that is a real Dynamic at work here within the Torah do the later prophets do that in any sense sometimes it's very interesting ways expounding were explaining the Torah every generation needs someone to come and say this is what God has handed us and hear how it's relevant for our moment that's the prophets the role of the prophets Moses sets the mold so what's really fascinating is Moses is going to begin his speech now
 we read the introduction using it again to speeches to go all the way through the end of chapter 11 and what he's constantly going to do is blur the lines of who he's talking to a fascinating so you could say it this way once you get into the speeches it's hard to tell if the people Moses is talking to is the dead people of The Exodus generation the second generation of the children right that it seems like that's who he is talking to on the narrative and then sometimes it feels like he's speaking to you the reader like sitting way in the future and its really intentional this is really intentional that Moses has re giving or his renewed giving of the Torah
 is setting a pattern that every generation going forward is going to have to pay attention to him so I'll just show you some examples so does Deuteronomy chapter 146 and so you're sick says the Lord Our God spoke to us at Mount Horeb I guess sort of the kids might have been there Linda kids some of them kids so I can kind of work you know what happened when is real got too big and Moses couldn't lead the People by himself and so you know they appointed judges and so on and then I'll go on verse 19 USA then we set out from Horeb through the Wilderness new like okay but then he'll say verse 22 then all of you approached me and said let's send out spies in the land
 do you like wait a minute that's like this is the generation after that exactly maybe it's some of the more kids but definitely wasn't any of these little kids coming up to Moses write like the people that Moses in into the land that spies and all that they're not alive anymore so in other words he talks to the second generation as if they are fully complicit and implicated in the choices of their ancestors that fascinating and he doesn't right through the Section he's going to go talk to all the Rebellion narratives that are in the numbers that were done by the people's parents and he's going to win every retells the story he's going to be speaking to the children and just say you did this and you did this you said that you did this right through so in these speeches he holds the present generation as participants in the actions of their ancestors
 just got to pause and think about that I think wow that's a different way of thinking about responsibilities different now I have been shaped to think about responsibility going up in 21st century America yeah we have a very clear delineation between like you and your decisions and me and my decisions like I am my own person and even if I came from your lineage like I got a clean slate like I'm my own person and this represents a view that says you are a new generation but who you are in the circumstances in which you live are not a blank slate they are very much shaped by the generation that came before you
 such that your own life decisions are going to either be just the total repetition or if you don't make some serious investments in your own character and life directions your life was more than likely going to just replay the life story of your ancestors and even when you think you're not you probably are so different offends all my like sensibilities growing up here on the West Coast you know it would write like write your own story exactly yep so that the dynamic happening here here's another way that this comes out in the Deuteronomy Scrolls and Deuteronomy chapter 5 Moses summoned all of Israel and said to them here oh Israel not their words, which is one of the key words will be tracing in the app reading experience here hear o Israel the statutes the ordinances I'm speaking to
 in your ears that you learn them and observe them
 Yahweh Our God made a covenant with us at Mount Horeb and again we're at that Dynamic of like oh well yeah you know I was a kid so I'm putting myself in the imagination of the people has the narrative audience sitting in front of Moses didn't make that Covenant with our fathers but with us who are all alive here today Yahweh spoke to you all face-to-face at the mountain is he could I get in a little dementia here
 you could kind of say like that could explain this is Red Red Keno going on though
 so the Covenant that Yahweh made with Israel
 like that wasn't just the thing for our ancestors that Covenant Is With Us Alive here today so just within the narrative world the thing that happened for the people in front of Moses for their parents Moses is saying that moment was actually with you yeah you were there and I think there's a dynamic here that's actually happening now for the reader cuz if you was a reader here that I do like we'll wait a minute I wasn't that Mount Sinai but here I am reading this ancient Israelite text and I think what he's saying is for me to
 I see like I wasn't there to Israelites many many generations removed from this reading this in a completely new era yeah if it should land in the same way of like oh yeah I wasn't at Mount Sinai
 but I guess I was because I was there in the form of my ancestors yeah yeah it has really fast this is the view of collective identity that's very foreign to me for a minute is it foreign I mean I got in the modern world we live the closest thing would be the kind of collective identity is that we think of in terms of national identity in American culture a person that is in the story of the country where you live retelling the foundation story of what a bunch of Founders did in the founding documents is usually brought up not just out of historical interest but is brought up because it's somehow I believe that implicates me as a carrier today of those values and so you could say you know the original audience of the American Constitution wasn't just our ancestors
 it's us like we are the inheritors of that to live out his vision today I think that's something similar to what's going on here so here is a towering figure in Hebrew Bible studies of Brevard child's of blessed memory he is Introduction Old Testament scripture named this Dynamic this way he says Deuteronomy serves as a commentary on how future Generations are to approach the law and how it functions as a guide in establishing its role in the Hebrew Canon by hearing means the collection of scripture the book of Deuteronomy instructs future Israel on the manner in which passed tradition is properly made a live in fresh commitment to the god of the Covenant Israel's Covenant with God is not tied the past history but it's still offered to all of the people in the act of commitment is real of every Age part a
 in the events of Mount Sinai and so also the promise of God to his people still lies in the future as well so I have a least I've come up with a little drawing that I like to make the Rana me which is a picture of scroll with me and then in the scroll you have like garlow picture in the skull on it as Moses standing there and he's addressing the second generation and what what do we know about the second generation well they're outside the land why are they outside the land because their parents reveled so they suffered 40 Years of the curse of wandering in Exile in the wilderness but they're just outside the land waiting to go in to the Eden land where if they obey the Torah God will give them the blessings of eating again it's all that is the narrative Within
 Deuteronomy but remember the book began with a little narrative intro and the voice of the narrator was somebody actually in the land and then on the other side of this the narrator has a long section of speaking in the last chapter of the book which is about Moses died and he didn't get to go into the land and nobody knows where Moses is buried even to this day that's what it says in the last chapter that's definitely not like Joshua writing that you know no Prophet like Moses has ever come again Moses who did The Exodus in the signs of Wonders has been many prophets at this point has been lots of opportunities phimosis grave yeah it is far in the future and we re calling that Moses had died outside the land that's right and so the person who's speaking to us at the begin
 and the end of Deuteronomy is not Moses it's the voice of the prophets that is the authors of the scriptural collection and the audience of the scroll of Deuteronomy is not the second generation on the east side of the Jordan waiting to go in the audience of the Deuteronomy scroll our future Generations your differentiating between the speeches which the audience was the second generation they're correct yeah but then the compilation of speeches by the later profits into a scroll the audience of that scroll is now completely different it's a new audience that new audience is invited to see themselves as replaying and experiencing Moses's speech as if it's them and so when Moses is talking about the ancestors at Sinai or you the second generation sitting here at Sinai saying listen
 everybody was at Mount Sinai we were all at Mount Sinai yeah even if you weren't you were and you today so this is a big theme in Deuteronomy Moses will be saying listen whatever happened in the past is not just in the past the past is today every day is today cuz today is the day you have to choose between good and evil between life and death between blessing and curse and so the audience of the Torah is a future generation that's still waiting for the Eden blessing to Blossom in the land they're waiting for New Creation they're waiting for the new Moses to come and so the book of Deuteronomy is designed so that the reader sees themselves as sitting on the other side of the Jordan
 as the audience of Moses's speech waiting to cross into the new Eden land and dividing them to be the Wilderness generation yet to see themselves as the generation in the wilderness here in Moses again today again for the first time. It's some just fun exercise but to internalize a reality which is they are a Wilderness generation and their own sets yes and remember this is the book end of a literary work that begin with the story of Ethan which says that all humanity is exiled from eating and we're awaiting someone who can open up the way back into eating so to be sitting here reading the Torah
 is addressed to people living outside of Eden waiting the time or way that Yahweh will send a new one like Moses who will confront the evil one who will provide atonement who will restore and open up the way back into the life and blessing of Eden and Deuteronomy is designed in a way that you are the reader no matter where you live or when if you're a part of this story in this Heritage and people you were the people being referred to in the book of Deuteronomy narrative about a group of people being addressed by a guy but the way of the book works is so that you the reader see yourself as the one sitting there being talked to by that guy it's like the movie the NeverEnding Story I remember the movie I do remember reading a book suddenly he's like the character in the
 I mean really becomes the character in the book in a real way with The Princess Bride The Princess Bride yeah I feel like it's a little different in that the book just comes to life as they're telling it like he doesn't enter the story right you're right in the NeverEnding Story that's right he's reading it and then buy when you get to the story happens to him yeah then that's right he gets sucked into the story becomes the end of the story well that's totally what it's like at the great Perla so the Torah Ends by telling you the reader that you thought you were just reading a story about Israelites if you're a human and you have a mortal body and you're probably going to die
 you were the audience of the Torah you are the Wilderness Center you were the Wilderness generation in the more you like read the stories and then come back take a breath and look around you the more your setting should transform so that you realize like oh yeah I am at Sinai I am at the Gate of Eden I am at this moment to choose between life and death at the tree yeah yeah I have moments of choice before the tree of knowing good and bad or before Mount Sinai where you always saying don't give your allegiance to things of your own creation or of your people's creation choose life choose wisdom follow my commands like every one of us is to see ourselves at that moment every day
 that the function of the book of Deuteronomy it's really profound if you'd be up under it so that's the frame for all of the laws in the servants to come and Deuteronomy and me that makes it both to give me a little more energy to come with these lost Village I want to learn wisdom here cuz I want to choose life and that's the adventure that this kind of opened beer on me. That before thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're taking a closer look at the theme that were tracking through this movement the theme of listening and loving so Israel's Covenant loyalty and love to Yahweh is also described with this word to describe the marriage Union of husband and wife in the Eden store I think with the analogy of saying essentially is that just as God provided a covenant partner for man and woman that needn't so that they can be fruitful and
 find have long life in the land and then together they are to become God's Partners here Israel is depicted as the Covenant partner of Yahweh and that is to love and cling to the stops with medicine name for Covenant loyalty in love with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Dan Gumball Tyler Bailey Frank Garza Mackenzie buxman provided the invitations for our annotated podcast in around Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything we make is free because it's already been paid for by thousands of people just like you and thank you so much for being a part of this with us this is Daniel hi my name is Jill Stuart and I from Calgary Alberta Canada I came across Bible projects YouTube channel last year and I've been using it ever since I first heard about the Bible
