the Sea Dragon is an ancient symbol representing chaos and disorder Sea Dragon is also a creature that appears in the Bible passage Genesis one God places that are mean that is the sea dragon in the chaotic Waters where he keeps them now and other ancient near Eastern versions of the Sea Dragon Story there's a storm. The battle of the Sea Dragon but Genesis one shows us that the sea dragons no true rival of God he's just another creature in God's world we're going to turn our attention to to Psalms 89 and 74 which actually depict God confronting the Sea Dragon like a cosmic battle one way to think about creation is to think about God confronting forces of disorder and nothing nothing chaos represented by the Raging Sea and its minions Creations being connected to the slaying of chaos Dragon these problems look back
 the cosmic battle at the beginning of creation but they also look forward to the day that Yahweh gives the dragon-slaying power to a human image of God he's going to be such a glorious image of God that he will bring God's rule or even over the waters as the immature strangely enough these poems don't end Victory we expect this anointed one that's coming ruler to crush the dragon but the poems end with the lament which seems like the dragon Wentz why doesn't you always stop the dragon from Rick and Chaos in our lives this poem is designed to give us language for when we're standing in the chaotic Rubble of our lives or our communities and we don't know when or why or how long the dragons going to be roaming around my life for my neighborhood God is the Dragon Slayer and he will supply it one day but sometimes you just need to sit with your grief
 call out to God today Tim Mackie and I talked about the dragon in the scroll of Psalms on John Collins you listen to the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
pick up hi John they were going to jump into the squirrel Psalms and talk about dragons the symbol of the Dragon throughout the storyline of the Bible and we stopped and done big summaries of where we Den where we going I'm not sure we need a phone right now it's up to say maybe I'll try one real quick the cultural setting of The Bible and of the biblical authors their world and imaginations were filled with stories about a storm God conquering and slaying a dragon in a battle over the ocean to bring order and divine Reign and Rule to the world the storm God sends high mountain Cosmic Mountain has Heaven on Earth on top builds a palace throws A Feast for everybody and amen happy day so but the biblical
 they want to express their unique convictions about God and reality but they will often use the symbolism of that Motif or storyline but always tweaking it so for example the biblical authors have the Deep conviction that the only Ultimate Reality is God's Own Self there is no rival to God but God doesn't want to create something other than God self with intelligent image bearing Partners in heaven and on earth right rulers Bob and he gives each of them a realm of responsibility and to the humans which of the main focus a call to partner with God and taking creation on a journey from the little seed of garden order to take all of creation on that Journey towards the garden ideal
 but the garden surrounded by Wilderness which is surrounded by an ocean and that's you know some stuff that needs to be subdued. They're on so if you want to talk about those anti creation forces of chaos and disorder the chaotic see and then the dragon in the sea is one of the main ways the biblical authors use the symbol of the Dragon not as a rival to God but as a rival to creation and the image bearing creatures that are called to bring God's order to Creation
 that arrival to God but arrival to the images of God that's right and so the dragon or the sea or the Wilderness and the creatures of the welder welder beasts become symbols for the opposite of creation and forces the needs to be subdued and have order imposed on them in order to spread God's Garden ideal to the land but when images of God Heavenly or Earthly choose to not do good and live by God's will to bring about the garden ideal but they undo good by doing evil they are actually playing the role of the Dragon yeah but it's a fiercer dragon at this point it's even more terrifying cuz it's not just a Mindless chaotic see it's actually mixing that chaotic impulse with an intelligence it's not merely a poisonous snake
 Wilderness now it's too shrewd snake The Crafty drafty a wise snake actually trick you trick you into undoing your own good and thinking that that's what's good Embrace death as if his wife and then humans can put on the dragon costume and become dragons to each other so that's the world in which biblical story takes place at our to Psalms Psalms 89 and 74 which pole on the dragon-slaying motif the tweak it in this way that we've been talking about significantly so important for both of these Psalms in the biblical story is All Humanity has forfeited and become seduced by the Heavenly Dragon
 the rebellious rulers the rebellious rulers above in the form of the snake and then humans from the cane story on word have actually become devouring dragons to each other building they're dragging my Kingdom's so God chooses one family out of the nation's family Abraham to be his Covenant Partners in King of a priest and images to all of the other nations and the nation itself proves pretty bad doing that so God selects one family out of that family and then one leader David and installed him as an image of God over the people but then David has it and so there's this promise that God will raise up from the lineage of David a future image of God partner to bring Cosmic order in the garden ideal everybody else
 that's all taken for granted when we start reading Psalm 89 when I started dating.
alright let's begin let's going to read it back and forth to make it more interesting so that you read verses 1 through 4 I will sing of the loyal love of Yahweh forever to all generations I will make known your faithfulness with my mouth for I have said loyal love will be built up forever and Heavens you will establish your faithfulness
 who am I here I'm singing I don't think well in verses 1 and 2 is the poet and the poet I was saying but verses 3 and 4 as if we can see our a quote from. Because yeah we're about to eat and then it continues I have made a covenant with My Chosen and I have sworn to David my servant I will establish your seed forever and build up your throne to all generations Sela Sela paragraph to the pond so these are words about the character of God taken from the golden calf story when God forgives this real for making the golden calf full of oil love and faithfulness yeah yeah yeah gracious and compassionate abounding and loyal love and faithfulness I will sing of your oil love all the generations I'll make your faithfulness known with my mouth in the first two verses the poet
 saying it's y'all always loyal love and faithfulness that keeps all of creation like knit together in the heavens your trustworthiness is established there's an order okay Cosmic order
 and that Cosmic order for all creation is mirrored by Covenant order that he has promised for one family on the land they blame the family this real notice the repetition of the words built up and establish this creation terminology the God building and establishing so this is going to be a poem about how some of the cosmic order it displays God's love and faithfulness and then the Covenant order of God's promise to David is also a reflection of his loyal love and faithfulness all red verses five through eight the heavens praise your wonders oh yeah and your faithfulness in the Assembly of the Holy ones who in the skies is comparable to Yahweh
 who among the sons of Elohim is like Yahweh he is no him greatly feared in the Council of the Holy one's awesome above all those who are around him oh yeah God of hosts who is like you mighty yeah your faithfulness surrounds you
 so we begin by talking about yahweh's elevation above all other Heavenly beings describe Euler's yes this is why none of the two or three times the idea of a Divine Council a Divine assembly of heavenly beings called The Holy ones and the sons of Elohim here is both with them but also like none of them are comparable and they're the ones in the heavens praising and they're called the hosts of the word stars is not used but it's the host of Heaven Heavenly beings the Divine Council the sons of Elohim there with God in the heavens but none of them can even be compared the deepest option cuz they're creatures and yahweh's Creator. So that's Yahweh is his power and status
 is being shown by how he compares to the Heavenly beings the rulers above verses 9 through 12 I'll let you read it you rule the swelling of the sea when it's waves rise you still then you yourself crushed Rahab like one who sang remind me his rehab again is a unique Hebrew Israelite title for the dragon it means the one who rages oh that's right this is the Raider you crushed rahav the rager so this is a dragon if you crashed real live like one who has slain it with your strong Army scattered your enemies okay yeah so is crushing the dragon is crushing enemies in the Babylonian version that we find in with the tech called in the a leash on GMA as a form of the sea and then with her is a huge Army
 dragons and scorpions and Beast and someone that's immature hook up this guy belongs to you also the land belongs to you the world and all it contains you were founded them the North and the South you created them tables or and Herman Shuffle Joy your name and those North and South paper and Herman yes yeah yeah the mount one of the north one of the one way in the north and one kind of in the south of her mom yep so now we are elevating the loyal love and faithfulness by talking about how Yahweh is the Dragon Slayer and of the Dragon armies with his arm with his arm and then that slaying of the chaos dragon is connected to the order of creation the sky and the land belong to you you separated them North and South the high play
 and the Low Places so got orders to see on the mountains so here creation is being connected to the slaying of the cast Dragon okay and this is the way you tell the story we're leaning here into the the way the story gets told in the cultures around Israel I see one way to think about creation is to think about God confronting
 the forces of disorder and nothingness in chaos represented by the Raging Sea and its minions but how he did that in Genesis one was he separated at yep no violent Conflict at all yeah he didn't slay it that's right so just this is another way to tell the same story but using a different set of images from The dragon-slaying Motif Genesis one here is being described as a battle a battle I know it's clearly not a battle that's right and I think that's important that that's the way that the whole biblical story open but if you want to reference back here's another way to think about creation if we want to work with in the dragon-slaying miss you can do it this way Genesis one is nodding to the dragon-slaying mess but also reworking at so heavily you don't even really recognize it anymore sure as a dragon saying this but the biblical authors could talk about creation both ways
 and then we end with verse 13 and 14 you have an armed with might your hand is strong your right hand is exalted righteousness and Justice are the foundation of your throne loyal Love and Truth go before you the exaltation of God's right hand this is all taken from the song that the Israelites thing after their delivered at the sea in Exodus 15 God strong right hand just real quick
 the Nexus 15 after God has praised for hurling pharaoh and his chariots into the water we read your right hand Yahweh is Majestic in power your right-hand shatters the enemy
 so with an outstretched arm and a mighty hand that's the phrase in Deuteronomy that refers to the defeat of pharoah at the sea so we have a description here of God's elevation above all other Heavenly rulers we have his power over the forces of chaos and then we have an illusion in here to his victory over human land rulers whatever the arms talk about it sits over you have a strong arm and hear up above the strong-arm right shattered rehabbing scattered his enemies you but then we hear we refer to God strong arm that is exalted and any other land dragons that want to appear Yahweh will smash them too so we have an allusion to the three Realms the sky
 the land and the Sea and he always is superior over all the unrivalled king of creation and bring her of order okay so one way to talk about the dragon is cactus water of creation and when we employ the dragon image we could do a Genesis one dead which is to say you know all I had to do was just with his word like separate out and create life there wasn't some epic battle and then he called the humans to the rule and subdue on his behalf and then there in lies the epic battle in a way that will have to go down but here in this song when he talks about
 that same idea of creating order in the sea it is described as crushing crossing the dragon the dragon the point is that got it has dominion over power over the terabyte yeah so it's tough cuz I literally just like will did God speak in the dragon is just a creature in the waters or did God destroy this crush a head and I think the biblical authors of a snake and those are two ways of thinking about the same reality and won the dragons dad and wanted to try. It's right at the point I get the point of the song is actually not to set out a comprehensive view of reality the point is to praise Yahweh and talk about how powerfully is in comparison to the Heavenly beings in comparison to chaos and in comparison to any land creatures that would want to challenge him soak the conclusion of his first part how blessed are the people who know the joyful sound oh yeah way in the light of you
 face they walk in your name they Rejoice by your righteousness their exalted for you or the beauty of their strength by your favor our horn is exalted our she belongs to Yahweh our King to the Holy One of Israel that powerful were to ever Ally with a people who could just like live in communion with that God and the King appointed by that guy that would be a sweet setup and that's the purpose of this song is this a God's creative powerful force over creation is he's doing that with a people with a covenant to David and man these people can walk in that lights that's a blessed people with a joyful sound and they are they're going to have power now this feels like it could be the end of the song
 this is only the first third okay one of the longest songs in the whole next part goes from versus 19237 long we don't have time to read that all this whole thing is a poetic meditation on God's promise to David that we read about in 2nd Samuel 7 you know how sometimes there's a narrative and then there's a poem right after the narrative this is that the middle of Psalm 89 could have is a reflection on 2nd Channel 767 could have been 2nd Samuel 8 what it goes on to tell us about God's promise he says that I'm just going to ask him here there's 20 speaking in God's voice I have found David my servant with my holy oil out of knowing that him
 with whom my hand will be steadfast my arm will strengthen them now David will be the agent of God's order bringing arm that defeated chaos and now David will be the agent of that first 24 my faithfulness and loyal of will be with him and in my name his horn will be exalted check this out I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the river without me it's this is he's going to be such a glorious image of God that he will bring God's rule even over the the waters to see amateur God rules over the waters now he's assaulted an image and that image will rule over the watch humans are like clearly land so yeah I'm pretty exhausted in Genesis one humans are called to rule the land creatures also the birds and also the fish in the sea
 but this whole thing comes with a condition for 29 I will establish David's seed forever and his throne like the days of the Skies well okay that's a big promise if there's a big yes
 but if his son's forsake my law and don't walk in my judgments if they violate my statutes and don't keep my Commandments then I'll punish their transgressions with the rod and their iniquities with blows but I won't break off my loyal love from him ordeal falsely in my faithfulness
 so each generation of David's mind will have a choice put in front of them about whether they will rule by the law judgment statutes and Commandments of God and if not then they're going to suffer the consequences but God won't break off his Perpetual loyal love it just means that generation will find itself outside the garden so it kind of sets up that okay so I guess you could find yourself outside of the cosmic Garden the God wants to create it just depends on how you can respond
hope this leads us to the last third of the poem and here I was kind of scam if that's okay
 but you this is now the poet speaking to God you have cast us off and rejected you've been angry with your anointed one you have spurned you have shown contempt for the Covenant of your servant you profaned his crown in the dust breaking down as walls bringing his strongholds to ruin anybody who passes by can plunder him he had become publicly shamed by his neighbors you have exhausted the right hand of his adversaries and it made all his enemies rejoice and this is Israel being conquered or this isn't it was just a king or like a crap King within Israel just making them suffer yeah I think we're going to see you this is a reflection of the downfall of the davidic Kingdom which happened at the hands of Babylon to and was threatened many times earlier by other kingdoms but Babylon was
 the one who brought him down to the dust there's a whole scene in Second Kings the focus is on the king from the line of David and said akaya who is hauled off in chains by Babylon and blinded his eyes are poked out and all of his sons have their throats slit in front of him I mean it's just like it's a gruesome scene that this is poetically
 so now this becomes a limit song how long will you hide how long will your hot anger burn like fire
 remember what my span of life is
 04 what level what vanity you have created all the sons of Adam what humans can live in Nazi death can he deliver his soul from the power of the grave sayla
 does it say why are we talking about this now I thought we were talking about like the downfall of the king now we're just talking about the plight of humanity in general the sons of Adam and how they are dying outside the garden but that's the language here yeah well because the davidic King was supposed to solve that text yes okay yeah the downfall is the davidic king is being set on an elegy to the death and mortality of humans outside the garden so there's 49 where are your former acts of loyalty is so different than how to write that you swore to David remember y'all way the public shame of your servants I have to bear it in my chest from all of the peoples
 your enemies have publicly shamed Yahweh they are publicly shaming the heels of your anointed one that's the ends of palm and then the editorial conclusion to book 3 of the Psalms and go away forever really out of sync with the poem the poem and not the last line it matches the conclusion of Psalms 40:1 72 this end the end of one of 60 and in all of them you could say maybe that's the last line of the poem itself over here really sticks out I see cuz the stands with the lament cry asking God why he's allowing something terrible and then it's like so this last year the poem is about how God has allowed his image of God did it came to have his crown be trampled on in the dust in the middle is about the mortality of the sons of Adam
 and then the last line of the poem is about how enemies are heaping public shame on the heels of God's anointed one is just all sounds like Genesis 3 you're saying that cuz you have highlighted here the dust and the heel yeah and that's applied to the store the snake snake eats the dust if snake bites the heel of the human of the one that will crush at 2 instead of emerging up out of the tests to rule the ruler has been released back to the dust and instead of putting his heel on the head of his enemies instead hear the enemies are publicly shaming the he'll hear the enemy isn't some snake the enemy is but remember all the way back the enemy's the first time enemies with used was when God scattered the enemies who are the minions of the raging one in the sea
 it's at that connection again humans Rebellion against order are in some way being mirrored by kind of a cosmic Rebellion God himself was Victorious over the dragon in the chaos Waters spoken and that Authority and power belongs to God Alone not any of their Heavenly being and not the strength of gods arm at the first of the Palm second part of the Palm is God's arm and chosen and empowered image of God from the line of David to do what God does and having his hand on the seat and over the rivers if he lives by God's law judgment that you come and then he will become perfect instrument of God's rule on the land but if he doesn't then there will be the consequences
 and then you don't move to any story of the stand of David's line or what they do is just all the sudden your they are like smashed in the dust dying like the sons of Adam with enemies on their heels so I think here it's now there are other land rulers
 who has taken the place of the Raging dragon or become an instrument of the Raging Dragon snapping at the heels of God's anointed one so there's a whole backstory underneath this year so what's interesting is the Heavenly rulers are mentioned but they aren't really like brought up again or what this is about human enemies taking the role of the Dragon
 now and they were powerless against God but does dragon human enemies are very powerful against God's image because they haven't lived by God's wisdom and sets the backstory here so the dragon doesn't appear in the last third but you just have enemies at the heels of that remind you of what God Said the snake would do which is strike the heel of God's anointed one in the first part of the poem on God strikes the dragon this is just ordering creation and now when there's the new set of enemies imagine are like human enemies Babylonian soldiers saying I'm supposed to connect these enemies to the enemies of of the Dragon the dragons enemies are the enemies of allied with the dragon the word enemies appears in
 first part of your last part in the first part their societal with the dragon the god conquered the enemy is disorder yeah that's right in the last part God has handed his anointed one and their descendants over to destruction because of their Disobedience that was what the middle part with the van but in this third part the enemies come back but in this time there is the king the anointed ones enemy's victory over the anointed one so if we used our we talked about this image of the Dragon has disorder and you can use the dragon as a costume when you are Rebellion against God applying that to this song You've Got God he is the one who can create order Cosmic order
 and so Cosmic disorder is the dragon in its enemies and God just like yeah I can slay that easy done that's when the enemy's First shows up in the first week at the last third of the poem the word anime shows up again this is humans who are bringing disorder to Creation the middle step is then God wants to share his power that they are ordering power ordering power over chaos to share it with a human representative with them and what is the story of humanity but here is the story of David and rescue Humanity to be a blessing for the nation today well I mean because then you get this little reprieve of like when David Falls it's like oh man humanities.
 exactly cuz that's David role is to be the new human the new Adam the new Adam yeah that's right so once God is installed and shared that ordering power with a human ruler now that human rulers enemies plays the same role as God's enemies in the dragon Yahweh face down the dragon without power you gave that power too human to face his Cosmic cast enemies I blew it and so now those chaos enemies have power over him and his heel so when were talking about the chaos enemies of the line of David were talking about which I got Babylon it Babylon is talked about in terms of being a dragon and Isaiah and so the dragon that got Slade was the dragon that represents the chaos and disorder of creation that God can order
 but then chaos that stands in opposition to the creation yeah that's right that needs to be ordered the Babylon becomes the dragon that represents humans in Rebellion against God wanting to bring creation back into more disorder instead of order and so the Sea Dragon isn't talked about again in the end of the phone but they are enemies the enemies and the only other time in this poem the word enemies is used is in relation to the Sea Dragon that's right and what drives the point forward is out of loyal love and faithfulness he crossed the Sea Dragon to bring about order and creation and then he shared that power with some human partners and promised that he would rule
 the world and bring that Cosmic order about through them he promised you promise promise promise
 not a promise had a condition for each generation but God said I'm never going to break off this promise there will be a future state
 and now the seed is defeated by enemies dying like the rest of the sons of Adam where are you guys at where's that promise right now what you going to do about it cuz all I see is your human images of God being shamed not really not telephone hands and perfect segue the song 74 fits in to the story line at work under Psalm Psalm 89 just from another angle so it's pause hold everything for some reason I and then let's dive into one more song
 this one's a lot shorter so we can read it all I'll let you start with first third versus 1 2 3
 oh God why have you rejected us perpetually why does your anger smoke against the Sheep of your pasture
 remember your congregation which you have purchased of old what are you do congregation purchasing you purchase buying off the slave market it's an image of redeem Redeemer of Israel congregation is the Sheep of your pasture that is Israel your congregation what you redeem From Slavery and then what you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance and this
 Mount Zion where you have to go out so these are the things that we're asking God to remember remember your congregation and remember this Mount Zion the place we're having a nurse is supposed to unite turn your footsteps toward the Perpetual ruins the enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary at 6 turn the middle of the pain your adversaries have roared in the midst of your meeting place normally people shouting praise but here it's like they're animals roaring they're in there within the meeting place of sanctuary this is the temple right yes invading armies in the temple that only happened one time
 I'm in Israel's history in ancient it's an ancient Babylonian are they set up their own standards for signs it seemed like one lifting up his axe in a forest of trees now all of its carved work they smash with hatchets and hammers they have with fire sent your Sanctuary to the ground they have defiled the dwelling place of your name they say in their heart let us completely subdue them they have burned all the meeting places of God in the land this is the destruction of the temple by Babylon I'll let you go for 9 to 11 or can we do not see our signs there is no longer any profit nor is there any Among Us who knows how long how long do God will the adversary revile
 what's that mean revile make fun of with contempt and shame so there's no signs like how long it's going to last this God just shut off all the communication channels how long are God will the adversary Revival in the enemy's spurn your name Forever by Goliath that's what glass then why do you withdraw your hand even your right hand from within your bosom destroy them
 looks like God's Mighty hand which is what he smashed Egypt and the dragon with you but just like he's keeping it tucked in his pockets okay from within your bosom yeah like bring your hand out why you haven't talked in your chest pocket it's kind of distinctive like old school military uniforms where the time thinking of more like Medieval Europe are like your city your temple destroyed how long what what are you doing where are you yep verses 12 to 17 years the middle of pump but God is my king from way long ago does Deeds of Deliverance in the midst of the land you're the one who divided the Sea by your strengths
 you broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters
 you crushed the heads of Leviathan you gave him as food for the creatures of the Wilderness you split open Springs and Torrence you dried up every flowing Rivers yours is the day yours also is the night you established the light in the sun you set up the boundaries of the land you formed summer and winter to work to The Ordering of creation all this is about ordering creation is so we're picking up the core plot line of the dragon-slaying mess so you're the king displayed by how you defeated the waters in the chaos monsters and then brought order to Creation
 The Creation years just like Psalm 89 being described as a victory over the chaos Dragon but the whole point is that but the dragons loose again another reason to go back and re-read the first part of the palm the reason why this poet is so distraught is because you're the God who defeated the chaos Dragon so why are you letting these enemies do this to us their unleashing the cast dragon on us so what's up like these you can see there's a contradiction in his thinking was interesting is that the last third of the pawn does not resolve the problem
 he just goes back to describing what the enemies are doing he goes on remember Lord how the enemy has shamed public knows how public shame part of this year a foolish people as shown contempt for your name don't hand the life of your little bird over to the chaos Manimal the Wilderness I don't forget the life of your afflicted ones remember the Covenant for Dark Places of the land are full of violence and don't let the oppressed be ashamed that they selected and needy Praise Your Name get up oh God plead your own cause remember the foolish man how he shames you all day long don't forget the voice of your adversaries the Uproar of those who rise against you is going up continually so in both of these Psalms the move seems to be one with the release of the chaos monster sea monster
 is saying God from here to sing for days of old from the beginning we know of God that can create order out of chaos for there to be anything at all means that you slay the dragon and here now we're experiencing the dragon in the form of a raging Army
 and so the Roaring Army yeah and in the poet's mind the Roaring Army is the Return of the Dragon that got its laid implicit in the poem to say hey what's up with all these armies I thought you were the Dragon Slayer and plus it in there is I thought you finished the dragon so it's implicit in the design of the pond and the way we kind of start talking about this in terms of talk about the dragon is God creating order and creation but he doesn't do away with this order he tells humans hate work with me as my image to continue to subdue the disorder
 and so go and put your hand on the sea anyway you know like yeah extend my rule over the animals and think the helpful frame that we start talking about was saying when a human and an image of God whether human or Sky ruler rebelled against that and instead of creating more order wants to create disorder by accomplishing its own vision of the good fight its own wisdom start son doing good yeah then what do we have but the dragon returned yeah in a way that's even more fearsome frightening and so the poets thinking you know how to deal with the dragon I know because creation itself existing means you know how to deal with dragons and this is just another manifestation of the dragon dragon so do it again do it again how long will we have to
 bring out your hand from your chest pocket smash that Dragon yeah this poem doesn't resolve doesn't point forward doesn't end with and I know that you'll slay the dragon in the end but it also doesn't end with and you rescued me for my enemy so just leave the lament by itself so this poem is designed to give us language for when we're standing in chaotic Rubble of our lives or our communities and we don't know when or why or how long the dragons going to be roaming around my life for my neighborhood and we call out forgot to do it again
 and yes you can think of it in a bigger frame in a bigger perspective but sometimes you just need to sit with your grief and call out to God and that's what this Tom guy says to do but it's important to remember that yes God is the Dragon Slayer and he will slay it one day but sometimes you just need to sit in this moment of pain and that needs to be one way that we respond to the chaos Dragon at work in our world it's not the only way but it's one important way thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast next week we're taking a closer look at another scenario where the Dragon theme for a while to have one we're looking at the story of joke what happens when the cast Dragon strikes our life preserve it takes the form of Bandits and Raiders who comes to steal and kill and destroy and then of a huge storm that knocked a house over that his kids are in and they'll die what's that about
