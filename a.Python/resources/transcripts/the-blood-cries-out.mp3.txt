welcome to this special midweek episode of The Bible project podcast there's a lot going on in the world and while the Bible project Mission isn't to speak into current events we found that where the fuel unique Place talking about apocalyptic literature literature that supposed to open their eyes to what's really going on behind the veil to see the world as God sees it and we began this series talking about the pandemic and how that was a type of Apocalypse that has opened her eyes to realities in the world we thought it would be a mess tonight end this series with another apocalypse that's happening right in front of us and we'll look through the Book of Revelation there's an important Motif happening with the Book of Revelation John's depiction of Babylon and the fate of slaves and the fate of innocent blood in the book that I
 what can I give us the respective on how to think about this with an apocalyptic set of lenses will look at the theme of bearing witness to Jesus and theme of bearing witness to the oppressed and the blood has been spilled I can go out there how God cares about that deeply how the Revelation is a tale two cities and its climactic way he makes Babylon the blood of persecuted followers of Jesus but the last line is and of all who have been murdered on the earth so you thinking all the way back to April when you see the blood of the innocent not just because they are followers of Jesus anybody any innocent blood that you see that's connected to these systems of Oppression and Injustice you're looking at that lot it's it's Babylon manifesting itself that's what he's saying right here you're doing this here we go
okay Tim John Collins so we can put it R series on how to read apocalyptic literature and it was really great we did a question response episode that just released on Monday and here we are now it's midweek and we wanted to extend the question response and do a little bit more talkin about apocalyptic literature because of the current national conversation happening we think that there's something really special happening and we think that the Revelation actually can give us eyes to see some things and you you approached me about this this morning and said it'd be cool to talk about Babylon a little bit and the Revelation and process what's going on with the protests with the with the murder of George Floyd and all the things happening again we've recorded the main conversations about how to read apocalyptic months many months ago when
 release them coincided with you know the the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic so we did a special kind of real-time episode to reflect on that the pandemic get off from perspective of the biblical story and then you know as we concluded the series that coincides with another set of current events that I think equally qualified as an another Apocalypse happening to our culture we recorded the last episode of those conversations the Cuban are episode of apocalyptic on Tuesday May 26th and George Floyd had been killed just 24 hours earlier I can remember reading about it in the news that morning when I was kind of beginning my work day and as you and I were recording the human arm episode 1st protests were just forming that afternoon in in Minneapolis and so we're sitting here now he was killed two weeks ago today
 and they are what are so hard to put into words what we're all experiencing everybody's experience so multi-layered you know so seems to me that there's a number another apocalypse taking place right as we're closing down or series on how to read apocalyptic and I just felt like we can't ignore another opportunity to reflect on how not just the murder of George Floyd but the right there's been this kind of recent Litany of black people killed in situations that are rooted in racial Injustice and it's some kind of Tipping Point and it's an important moment that we need to reflect on so that's the context of this is just a special extra episode in the apocalyptic series and as I've been thinking about the Book of Revelation there's an important Motif happening with the Book of Revelation John's depiction of Babylon and the fate of slaves in the face
 of innocent blood in the book that I thought would be going to give us a perspective on how to think about this was an apocalyptic set of lenses on your I've felt the last week I know I have privilege and I know I don't understand what it means to experience Injustice regularly the one that's so systemic and and I don't even know what that really means the stomach Injustice like I so the whole thing just makes me feel just stuck I feel like I'm repenting in like real time just like telling you I don't know how to respond in the right way and then I think you're not alone in that I think that's how a lot of people in America are feeling I've also felt the full range of emotions and neither you and I are given to a very wide range of emotions
 on an average day I think you're right there's something about the last ten weeks of the coronavirus situation whatever you call it pandemic crisis that has China removed a layer of I don't know of orderliness from our lives that I think makes a lot of people extra vulnerable to the intensity of these murders you know not to storage but Brianna Taylor and then Ahmad Arbury all of these they just kind of stacked together in a short amount of time and my parents were actually really invested back in the 90s especially when I was a teenager they intentionally wanted to understand more the experience of the black community here in Portland and so they just start going to look like an old traditional black church and this is when I told him I didn't want to go to church anymore and so they didn't they didn't make me but they did and I remember there's a whole season
 and my teen years where they just cultivated lots of friendships with people in the African-American community and they just wanted to know the story of Portland to the way that black people have experienced Portland and I remember really admiring my parents for that and I can see now you know since I've moved back to Portland after grad school and as an adult I've just been aware of that reality of Portland watching it change watching the urban core gentrify and watching how the African American neighborhoods traditionally when I was growing up have all been turned into Trader Joe's and you know the apartment buildings then all transformed and that's all just been happening and it's still active is examples of systemic thing that happens in the history of America
 and it's just from what I understand right one when I listen to my black brothers and sisters it's just one more iteration of the thing that's been happening for centuries that's their experience and so for this all to come to the surface in the last couple weeks I just have felt so sad despair despair anger in as much as I experience anchor consciously which is not
 doesn't look much on the outside least that's what my wife tells me when I'm angry and another part of it too is that I feel like you know I'm like a guy who is so who wants to listen to me talk about my Despair and sadness but who cares I actually I actually haven't had to live with the fear of policemen from my earliest memories is a boy the way I got my black friends to it was me about one important moment for me was when we started telling our boys for little boys telling the story of George Floyd and Brianna Taylor and my youngest son we're over the dinner table and my youngest son August he actually in the middle of the store he asked me to stop
 what he said was I know what you're going to say happens
 but he dies
 and he said it made him feel like it wasn't safe in the city anymore and let you know I was watching him process siden
 I thought of a good friend is African American and he was just sharing with me like last week what it's like to grow up with a fear of policemen from your earliest memories is it at the black little black boy in Portland and I was looking at my son whose white and just to see that fear in his eyes that like what the rest might be some police who aren't safe and I was just watching it was just a little bit of Innocents dripping from him you know so anyway the only thing I've known what to do with these emotions is I just started going to march in the nonviolent demonstrations in Portland and it's been really powerful and it felt so good so yeah and we're just saying we're say their names yeah. These people's names yeah it's been really amazing to feel like I don't have to sit alone
 fine and we can name it and yeah you know for those of you listening you know you have your own Journey with this but the apocalyptic is something being uncovered here for many people many layers of American culture specially in African-American Community there's nothing new here this is the same old thing in terms of the events that sparked this but in terms of the refusal to ignore it or be a difference that's being shaken in a new way that's really amazing to watch it happen in the apocalypse couple things that have helped me a time and try to turn in my eyes is I saw someone to share that one thing I was told us is don't try to get answers just listen to people who this is their life just like let's listen and like that's kind of been I feel like a common motifs I've been hearing so if you're getting involved because you want to liberate me I'm okay
 if you're riding say I'm okay but don't get involved because you want to liberate me get involved because your Liberation is intertwined with mine and I think that was the first time I kind of realize like I don't know to what degree I'm really enslaved and how much this is affecting me and other people because the impression I'm bringing through my ambivalence or through my lack of clarity of thought leading me to not take certain actions and I thought that was really stupid observation I really appreciated that that's a good segue I think into hell John's apocalypse The Book of Revelation I think can give us some language and imagery to think about it cuz it is I think you're right it's a form of slavery and one of John's core metaphors is that the Revelation is A Tale of Two Cities
 there's the city that is ruled on Mount Zion Heavenly Mount Zion by the slain lamb who liberates people to become a kingdom of priests and then there is the city of Babylon that enslaves people with its military and economy and the LOLs people into indifference and this is The Tale of Two Cities so I thought this week's I thought you kind of take it to her of this motif of the tale two cities through Babylon and then maybe come back to this whole complex eruption of racial Injustice in our culture and maybe look at it with new eyes
okay so maybe let's just kind of upload the last couple of conversations you and I had John about viewing the Revelation as a set of glasses lenses through which any audience any generation including the first reader's but now the 21st century readers living anywhere it's a set of glasses that you put on to try and understand and interpret your own landscape religious political landscape of Any Given Church community in the last couple episodes and how that differs from viewing the Revelation as a predictive code that is pointing to just one set of events in the past or the future that kind of thing so this is an exercise in viewing the Revelation has a set of lenses that we think about this motif of the of the two cities but I realize what I meant by it but
 the one where John is exiled were introduced to the Visionary of the book 1:9 John is right into the seven churches and he says I John your brother and fellow participant in the trials and the kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus I was on the island called pop most because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus so he doesn't actually say explicitly I'm in prison here or that I've been exiled here Jesse but that's how we got there so how'd you get that interpretation that he's there because of the word of God and testimony so this important he's introducing these words here when a follower of Jesus Bears witness to the word of God and the testimony this message by Cam Bearing witness to the story of Jesus he's the Risen King of the world that's becomes a key set of phrases that will be repeated over and over again throughout the book
 you have to wait for the book to develop what it means and then you come back and reread the book and you like I get it I get it so when people are announcing the word of God or sharing it or giving a testimony about Jesus what that means is they are resisting Babylon they are resisting the narratives that said that the kingdoms of this world actually run the show and that they have the final say in the really in charge said to give a testimony about Jesus is to resist the kingdoms of this world but telling the story of God's kingdom coming on Earth doesn't happen and usually results in followers of Jesus getting alienated isolated hurt or killed it's gnarly with this little phrase that uses the word of God and the testimony about Jesus is I mean we could even use the word like the scent like a form of political or social descent protest if you will
 first century context where Christianity was antithetical to the toddler and yes if you as a threat because of the clear distinction of you worship the Roman gods and you give your allegiance to Cesar or or you are now not actually supporting Rome and its leader it seems like Babylon is easy to tease out where you know fast forward to our modern context and and it seems like it's not as clean live in Babylon he never actually names the Empire that he's talking about you know it not once in the book all the uses is the names of different ancient biblical Empires from the Hebrew scriptures
 nothing to that either and he's in a new moment that the gods people haven't been in before in the first century but he finds it important to use these biblical icons of Babylon Egypt in Sodom cuz they helped give Clarity to the ambiguity so let's watch how he does it and I think it'll give us guidance for how to find some clarity to perhaps so what follows is that he sees the vision the cosmic apocalypse Reese's the exalted Heavenly throne room of God's kingdom and in chapters four and five uses of the slain lamb we got talked about this earlier conversations and Jesus who is the slain lamb crucified King he takes the scroll that represents God's purposes for history new start opening the scroll and the fifth break of the seals that he opens is in chapter 6 year where he opens the fifth seal and he sees up into the Heavenly throne room
 which is also a temple and he sees is his actual alter remember the Heavenly Temple is the reality to which the Earthly Tabernacle in the temple in Jerusalem where the symbolic pointers to so before you go up the steps or priests will go up the steps into the temple he would pass by the altar where all the animals have sacrificed so he's seeing into the Heavenly Temple and he sees in front of it the altar but what he sees around the altar is not the blood of animals he sees this is 6:9 I saw under the altar the souls it's the Greek word to cast The Living beings but it's the Greek word Suka Suka switch we get psyche and it's the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word which means a living beings living Essence so he sees dead people this is one of the very few where you have a disembodied
 a person who sees people but they're dead he sees them in God's Heavenly presence that's right or do you imagine them as disembodied here well I just saw it in a vision so I'm sure he's seeing human-like stick everything is being here with us but he calls them souls in this would be one of a very very small group of the examples that uses the word Soul the way we think of it in English as a disembodied human and really the scene that he wants to paint is that of an altar but instead of having dead animals on it or sacrificed its dead people and keep reading they had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony that they helped us the reason he's not on the island of Patmos the same reason why these followers of Jesus or debt markets people have been killed in the first Decades of the Jesus movement they're calling out saying how long Sovereign Lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and a v
 is our blood so we're back to Cain and Abel here but about the blood cries out so it's the scene of just like Abel's Blood Rose up to God and the judge of all the Earth can't and will not ignore the Bloodshed of the innocent as a quote from I think Psalm 69 the opening of an opening how long the Lord so this is a motif in the prophets in the Old Testament prophets and Psalms we trust the gods the judge of all the Earth still bring Justice visit Justice on the oppressors for the Bloodshed of Nana said but he takes a sweet time sometimes how long will it test ammonia or witness or word of God and you get all these scenes where people are announcing the testimony which means to say that Jesus is the Risen Lord of this world
 and that all Kings and kingdoms are ultimately answerable to him and when you say that message to L and powers that don't want to hear it you get you get the treatment for broken kneecaps you end up slaying on the altar so this happens in Revelation chapter 11 the two witnesses are testifying against the Beast and the Beast comes up and kills them in Revelation 12 remember we were this about the dragon in the woman sees other women their the dragon comes to wage war against the seed of the woman which is as interpreted by John as those who keep God's commands and hold fast to their testimony about Jesus so that's the drama the drama in the early parts of Revelation are you're going to Bear witness to Jesus you're likely going to get killed by the powers so that was reality in the first centuries of the Jesus movement and the book is exploring the whole drama so
 the plane land and the people associated with him John really wants to explore the other side of it of like will who's who's this Beast who or what is the beast in the city cuz the Beast is also a city at the same time so that we've got to the bad guys or Dragon who inspires some Beast to build a city and on top of the city Dragon rides this goddess woman named The Prostitute his whole car location of images are I haven't seen this one on a stained glass window I hope they nope neither of I neither by I'm guessing it's just a little too provocative if you're through the bad guy in Revelation the first real portrait you get is in chapter 11 and then it's this parabolic Edition John has about how these two prophetic Witnesses are going to rise up and testify there Witnesses
 depicted as a new Moses and a new Elijah they do Moses and Elijah stuff so they can shut up the Heavens so it won't rain they can turn the water in the blood and seven plagues Moses and Elijah but then the Beast is going to come up from the pit and attacked them and killed them and Revelation 11 verse 8 their bodies will lie out in the square of a great city which in NIV has which is figuratively called it's the word pneumatic it's a spiritual yes I'm here no matter what he says is this great city is spiritually called and then he named the city Sodom and Egypt and the place where their lord was crucified Jerusalem so whatever John means here he's thinking symbolically year of three actual cities in the biblical story that's why they use the word figuratively
 or spiritually what he means is apocalyptically when you put on your apocalyptic last year and you can see what the spirit of Jesus is inviting you to see because of an apocalypse what you'll see is in any city where the blood of the innocent is being said especially in this case because they testify to another King Jesus you're seeing the same dark Powers surface weather Sodom near the Dead Sea whether it's Egypt or whether is Jerusalem's it's the same city even though it's different cities is so important for seeing how the Revelation works as a set of lenses when you see this pattern of events you know that you're dealing with a Babylon type of moment here does that make sense that actually that one verse Revelation 4:11 the key to understanding how John thinks in terms of biblical design patterns and how he can describe Rome of his day with these ancient city symbol
 yeah they're laying in the Public Square of and he calls it the great City it says he doesn't want to he doesn't want to give him the Dignity of the human using the name and your bodies will lay the Public Square this great city which is New Mexico's called and then saw it on the song The More You gypped with Pharaoh's Egypt in the 10 plagues and then Jerusalem during the time of that guest many different iterations of Jerusalem but also in the flood member of the blood of Abel crying out from the ground that's Kane's murder and then change Seven Generations right after Adam through Cains line you get lemon juice for and he's even more murderous and he's a he's in Kansas City and the murder and the violence of Kansas City by Genesis 6 rise up to God and he brings the flood
 Jeff and then in Sodom the outcry of the of the oppressed against Autumn raises up to God he reigns fire the outcry of the Israelites slaves Rises up to God in Egypt he brings the 10 plagues to use all connecting all these so that's where the Lord was crucified I think he's reflecting on the persecution of Messianic Jewish followers of Jesus in Jerusalem that that we have described in the book of Acts they arrest and like the arrest of followers of Jesus Paul's persecution of the church Peter getting arrested Stephen getting executed that was the first outbreak of lethal violence against followers of Jesus in Jerusalem anywhere on Earth where the oppressed or calling out in the blood is calling out becomes a place which is spiritually summer in Egypt or Jerusalem
 this is about those who share the word of God and the testimony about Jesus say about being a witness to Jesus right now he's filling out this portraits he's trying to encourage the seven churches
hookup sites in chapters 1 through 11 when you get the chapters 12 and following which we explored a couple episodes ago it's seven signs he calls it a collection of seven signs that begins in chapter 12 and it begins with that Vision about the woman and the dragon the dragon is trying to eat the seed of the woman so what happens in Revelations 13 does that Dragon who's really ticked off if he wants to destroy the woman and her seed now she summons up out of the dark chaos Waters of Genesis 1 verse 2 he summons up a beast out of the sea and its powerful and it tramples people is like a military machine but then he summons up a beast out of the earth and this is this is all a parody on Genesis one where God summons he says let the Earth bring forth creatures and so this is the dragon bringing for us and tie creation creatures
 see you in the land and the Beast he brings up from the earth in Chapter 13 is the Beast that everybody has to worship and take them bark if they want to buy or sell sweet talk about that in the queue in our appisode this is people who participate profit from benefit from oppressive military economic structures that Prosper on the on the backs of the oppressed this called a beastly Kingdom in Revelation 13 and the city so that you get this city the beastly Dragon City then Revelation 14 and 15 you get this counter City we're back to the Royal Throne Room except this time it's not God's temple in heaven it's called Mount Zion high up and exhausted and so cool in these chapters there's a big choir up there and they're singing the song of Moses it says and the song they saying is all it's from the song of the sea Exodus 15 but combined with all of
 about how God's going to bring the plagues and finish off Egypt and bring about the ultimate Exodus and so on so cool and all culminates in Revelation 17 and 18 was the fall of this great City that finally is named Babylon
 finally is named Babylon and so the introduction of Babylon it's in Revelation 17 you read it because it's stained glass window be carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sitting on a Scarlet Beast full of Blasphemous names having seven heads and ten horns the woman was clothed in purple and Scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and Pearls having in her hand at Gold Cup full of Abominations what's that's not a normal English word standard Old Testament shorthand for I idle idle shrines a gold cup full of Abominations hand of unclean things of her in Morality at because what you do the locals this temple on Friday nights and somebody invites you pay like I had a good crop this fall I'm going to sacrifice for a party at the store party are the temple prostitutes and it's
 good night for the for the men involved in this isn't a normal Friday night in any Roman city in the first century the name was written a mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and of the Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunk with blood of the Saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus when I saw her I wondered greatly this image of this woman is pretty intense yeah writing of a red Beast one of those beasts when those beastly kingdoms yeah yep most Revelation commentators that I've looked at or thinking he's merging all kinds of imagery some of its Hebrew Bible imagery and Isaiah 47 specifically Babylon of Isaiah stay is depicted as a queen that God is going to bring down and bring from her exalted thrown to the Dust
 but then also people are pretty convinced he's also creating a parody hear of the Goddess Roma which is the Empire of Rome personified as a female goddess and he's mixing all of that together into one potent set of images here so notice the blood of the witnesses comes back up here again remember they were the blood was crying out from the altar now she's drinking it so we're talking here about you know it's just it's classic images of followers of Jesus thrown to the lions in the Gladiator Arenas and executed and City squares and this kind of thing and her own this was a point of Pride to be able to display its domination of the Nations and people groups around to build roads to bring the Pax Romana that the peace peace peace but it was always a company it was a piece a cup of Stew domination crucifixion of thousands of people and
 John wants us to see like you know the center of Rome is not this glorious honor of a place it's a prostitute riding a beast and a dragon drunk with the blood of innocent people that's what he wants us to see spiritually again with those glasses on the apocalyptic glasses when you see this image there's no ambivalence it's just like oh that's evil you can't read the description and be like I don't know maybe she was good to some people reaction the threat of this woman who's drunk on the blood of the Saints so what follows is a whole lament of all the kings of the earth began to cry out and lament over the fall of Babylon and I'm just going to read it it's the longest list of economic trade goods of the Roman Empire anyway
 in ancient Greek or Roman literature it's a list of 30 types of trade engaged in so this is revelation 18 starting in Reverse 9 when the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning just like Abraham saw the smoke of Sodom rising up so now here's the new Sodom smoke of its destruction is rising but the kings of the Earth are crying their weeping and mourning terrified I would torment standing far-off crying do you grate City Mighty city of Babylon in 1 hour your doom is come in the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn because well no one buys their cargo any more Cargoes us and here it is gold silver precious stones pearls fine linen purple silk Scarlet cloth every sort of Citron wood articles made of Ivory Coast Leawood bronze iron marble Cargoes of Cinema
 spice of incense myrrh and frankincense wine and oil fine flour wheat cattle cheap horses carriages these last two words he's placed very strategically at the end 29th number item of the list is bodies and then he clarifies that is human lives so again this is Richard Balcom who's brought this to my attention in the important way he really wants to paint the portrait of the economic prosperity of the Roman world it was a time that brought huge economic abundance for some for supper and the fact that he saves for the last these two terms to refer to the slave trade is really significant so he uses this word bodies and then he clarifies that is human lives with the last item of cargo I'll just read this Richard Balcom
 he says John gives considerable emphasis to the reference to Slaves by placing them at the end of the list he gives both the common term for slaves in the slave markets that is bodies that's how they referred to sleep thing on this body's I'm going to go get two bodies at the market and then what he says he does his he uses the common pejorative term for slaves bodies and then he gives them the scriptural designation for humans from Genesis one that is human life or a living human I thought to such a good observation about them cuz he says he is pointing out that slaves are not animals to be bought and sold his property but are human beings in this in phatic position at the end of the list has more than just John's comment on the slave trade to comment on the whole list of cargo it's the
 just the inhuman brutality the contempt for human life on which the whole of Realms prosperity in and luxury rest. This is a pointed economic critique of a whole system we've grown up in a culture that says politics and religion in economics there like separate spheres you know if you can go study and major in separate religion and that's fine too like if you want to study and learn about these fields but it lulls us into thinking that these are actually like separate spheres of Our Lives you know what religion doesn't have to do with these other things and appoint like this in Revelation 18 I think just tells a lie on that one is exposing that I think it's part of the seedbed of the anti-slavery The Logical outcome of a Christian worldview and it took Christians centuries
 actually own that conclusion but in a text like this Revelation 18 you can see the roots of it right there can't you and slaves last in the list because it's like the it's the foundation of the whole thing the whole economy is built on dehumanizing people that bodies instead of human beings
 the last paragraph of Revelation 18 is really significant he sees his vision of this Angel who takes up a big Millstone and throws it into the sea remembers that saying of Jesus about the children know about as far as followers of these little ones little ones better if you wanted to see what the millstone around your neck pick up a millstone that's a huge piece of rock and throw it into the sea and he says that's what Babylon the great City will be like throwing down by violence no longer found the sound of harpists and musicians and players and trumpeters won't be heard no Craftsman no crafts will be found the sound of the mill will not be heard in you know light of the lamp-post shine the voice of the bridegroom and bride will no longer be heard your Merchants were great men of the earth and all nations were deceived by your sorcery and then this is the final line because in Babylon
 was found all the blood of the prophets and Saints and of all who have been murdered on the earth remember we were tracing the theme of when followers of Jesus bear witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus that was kind of the focus of the book right that's John's audience but then in this climactic way he makes Babylon responsible not just for the blood of persecuted followers of Jesus but the last line is and of all who have been murdered on the earth so you thinking all the way back to April when you see the blood of the innocent not just because they are followers of Jesus anybody any innocent blood that you see that's connected to these systems of Oppression and Injustice you're looking at Babylon it's it it's Babylon manifesting itself that's what he saying right here in the fact he stays this for the last line
 I so significant I think he's trying to teach us how to spot Babylon seems to me and when you put all this together in light of the design patterns and how he calls Babylon also sodomy jipped Jerusalem he's trying to teach us how to see spiritually in Babylon raises its head and the murder of the innocent is like key Criterion on his list where I'm stuck by is the kings of the earth who were in bed with Babylon they see the Babylons going down and sad because no other source of income they benefited economically from
 Babylon and its connecting the revelations A Tale of Two Cities so if you just keep reading when the description of the New Jerusalem comes on the scene many of these items are going to reappear the bronze the the gold the precious jewels and there's a bun dance in the New Jerusalem streets of gold yeah so it's not abundance as such its abundance by what means right I'm right that's a contrast he wants to paint here and so this is abundance is built on the foundation of bodies that is traded in slaves human beings I think that's the contrast abundance by what means and abundance for that's interesting is what was the Garden of Eden on like with the volume turned up to 11 so I'm just I'm not saying this
 I told you I'm just saying he's inviting us to reflect on the economic systems and in which we are indebted have a worldview and allegiances attached to them that are not always apparent this why you need the Revelation to uncover that for you we've had a whole conversation in the past about what does it look like to live in Babylon when your Legions isn't Babylon and I feel like that's where I would want to go next in this conversation of like I mean nothing that I touch is not tainted by total by Babylon and by participating in in all sorts of economy's a my perpetuating oppression and violence or what like what am I do yeah so we got them all that all over but that was a really cool conversation that we got to have about living his Exile in Babylon serve Babylon
 yeah how do you be a Daniel that both resist subversive loyalty are apocalyptic moment you know part of what especially in America what makes this Uprising against systems are social systems that perpetuate racial Injustice so I mean the the the momentum and The Leverage that these movements have is an idea that the realities of racial Injustice betray what the American flag is supposed to represent and the ideals that it's supposed to represent and so it it's being loyal to the dream but that America could represent that's the kind of loyalty there's something there of subversive loyalty where its loyalty to the best ideals of what my Society wants says it wants to pursue and how I
 might be loyal to those even though the loyalty to those ideals might often means the version of the current institutions or leadership structures in the form that they are right now and I think that I'm anyways that's a that's a good way to capture what's going on right now and so as a follower of Jesus At The Book of Revelation I think gives us and very powerful set of lenses to think about what that subversive loyalty looks like which means naming idolatry name in cultural values and systems that benefits them at the expense of others and naming that as idolatry you know so you're right or videos on exile and specially the way of the Exile fully, go hand-in-glove here with this conversation we're having right now
I'm not sure there's a good way to even draw all the threads of this conversation will close right now I will say that for me I think there's a moment right now for me to really listen and try to internalize and make meaningful what it means to have such a legacy of Oppression at your back yeah I you know I still have I don't have the right categories and I don't want to be complicit thank you for walking us through Revelation and that theme of of testifying for Jesus I mean one other thing I've heard a number of times people just saying like where is the white Evangelical voices right now and they're probably feeling similar sense of I don't want to say something until I've got it all figured out I'm having all these conflicting emotions and then just feeling stuck
 Revelation guide us is this line from chapter 7 which I think is so cool it's John's vision of he hears about a group of 144,000 which is the 12 tribes of Israel * 12 that's what he hears he hears the number of these people who are sealed with God's seal but then he looks and he tries to see this group what he sees is not 144000 what he sees is revelation 7 9 a great multitude which nobody could count people from every nation every tribe every people every language standing Before the Throne and before the lamb close in white robes
 with palm branches in their hands this is all about how Passover and also the Feast of Tabernacles got celebrated in Jerusalem with all these branches and the crying out with a loud voice saying rescue belongs to our god to the one sitting on the throne and to the lamb and then when John asks his will to a guy who these are he says these are the ones who have come out of the great test the great trial they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb and it's this image of when God's people are faithful when they find themselves in Babylon there will be tension it will create conflict and tension just like Jesus created conflict inside of everybody he was around and that's not a bad thing cuz it can be apocalyptic it can expose you know what know what needs to be exposed but we're invited this image of putting on the White Road
 washed in the blood of the Lamb such a great contradictory metaphor but it's what Jesus was Jerusalem of his day and you know Jerusalem and he told him what he thought you know and he got killed for it but that may or may not be required and it and you given context but bearing witness to the crucified Jesus as as the way to confront the idolatrous powers of our world this is like is the bread-and-butter the biblical story and I just want to make sure that my eyes aren't closed to the Apocalypse happening around me so one day at a time may God give us wisdom right to know what to do when we wake up tomorrow fix listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast is a special midweek episode related to create event the Bible project is a
