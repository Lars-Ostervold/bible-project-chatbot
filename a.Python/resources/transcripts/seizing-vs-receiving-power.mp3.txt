welcome to the second episode in a new theme study called the theme of the firstborn in the ancient world power was handed down to the first points. Didn't matter your credentials didn't matter character it's just were you born first but the god of the Bible has a habit of choosing the second form or the lake cover the least expected choosing that person to have power to rule these are lights that do the thing that God did they separate dates one night he is the ruler but now there's the many rulers were given responsibility for the thing that God did and they are called symbols symbol is something that stands to represent something greater than himself this theme shows up first in the Bible and a surprising place in Genesis 14 God creates rulers of the sky and rulers of the land
 the rulers of the sky they come first and in Genesis one they're called lights the human rulers come last in the sequence of the six days they don't come first to come by even the animals there before then the last Comer is the one who is given the authority to rule over the land but it's an interesting as you read through the Hebrew Bible it's consistently the latecomer the god Elevate the places of rule and Authority these rulers represent God they are the hosts of heaven when we would cost Spiritual Beings are angels the powerful their magnificent and glorious and their first but then on day 6 God creates a new creature a creature of the land a creature of the dirt man and woman together are his image to rule over the Earth these readers of the Garden of Eden narrative in the second temple
 new the Hebrew Bible's Way better than most any of us to do and they saw within the Eden story God elevating the latecomer as boring as it were over the firstborn of the 7-Day Christian narrative this Authority given to humans to rule the Earth is an elevated position and it's a when you get to the story of this mysterious creature in the garden a devious snake whose goal is to keep Adam and Eve from embracing their identity to rule on his behalf you're meant to wonder who is this snake why is it trying to screw things up and as we read this story of the Fall In the Garden of Eden alongside other stories in the Hebrew Bible and some commentary from other second temple texts we're going to see The Sibling Rivalry here in the creation accounts under on Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us
 okay
 so we're continuing this conversation in a new theme called the first born son the theme of the firstborn of you looking at the whole story The Bible and how this theme shows up how basically there's a cultural assumption that and a family person born first then you said son for the first gets a special rates double portion of inheritance more Authority there the new patriarch so this cultural practice that because they were the first fruit of the womb the first one in line like they get this position of power this is a cultural assumption that's in the background of the whole biblical story meaning it was a assumed practiced in ancient Israel and all of its ancient neighbors but then you showed us how throughout the entire biblical
 will we get our story after Story Of God subverting yeah this cultural norm that's right that's right and giving the favor or the blessing the responsibility over future inheritance or authority. God consistently in my consistently in the first goal of the Hebrew Bible in Genesis every generation it's and it's one of the main prominent themes of many generations is this inversion of the right of the firstborn and this road because of poignant moment when we get to David being appointed as the next king of Israel and that there's a moment where God says look
 you're looking at the outward appearance and you're looking at who's first what I care about is what's in the heart and I'm choosing David who's the last he's the runt because of what's it a heart so there's two the same kind of comes to a head and this idea of I'm going to give Authority and power as someone who can actually handle it or not but that he doesn't it I mean David can't handle it and neither did most of the people that he invites the firstborn practice and gives it to some younger sibling but they consistently do you know about 2 but you're right in that the portrait for Why God is doing this in opposing this institution is that it's some opposition to humans
 are constantly valuing prioritizing things that are based on shallow external like factors and they are constantly after power and things as if I'm not one of the Human family is constantly after power privilege Prestige and will do whatever it takes to get ourselves or you know our children and cause chaos and it Causes Chaos and immense pain and ruin in the human story and spoke when God opposes this it's a naughty matized in Proverbs like God's opposed to the proud that he gives favor to the humble or in Hannah's poem that she sings the beginning of 1st Samuel the god brings down rulers from their Thrones and the elevates those who sit in the dust sit on the throne of Princess if God loves to overturn abusive human Power Systems
 it is Providence and the steam of the inversion of the firstborn is what this is about it comes to its Climax and Jesus who is portrayed as you know an outsider from porcelain goddess and who then threw his obedience death and Resurrection all the sudden you realize there's something incredible about this man you know I guess if we didn't highlight this in the last conversation but not only is Jesus's own Origins are shown to be from poor humble circumstances but then also the people who he prioritizes in announcing their arrival of God's kingdom are the same types of people the sick the poor The Outsider and he says they are the ones who are God's Royal Emissary is being invited to join the Royal party first and that's his crew
 God upside down kingdom the kingdom of God as a kingdom of the low status status and then he epitomizes that as the king of the new royal family by going to Jerusalem on a packed holiday weekend and poking the bear on purpose in order to provoke a conflict with the leaders the religious and political leaders of Jerusalem that ends up getting him killed which seems like it's what he plans on having happened and in being crucified as a criminal and trusting which is the lowest see what low Statin the lowest the lowest of the low yeah he trusted that his father would vindicate and exalt him beaten beyond the grave is because he believed in a status that he had that was much bigger that preceded his birth
 all the Apostle Paul will respond in the status of being the first the first the firstborn over all creation or in the Revelation Jesus says he is the firstborn from among the dead he is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he transcends our categories of first and last he just is he is the one who is so this this intuition I suppose that we have is humans that there's something special about being the firstborn is not completely wrong and rotten that there is a firstborn over all creation some being someone with actual Authority and power and Rule because of being the first to put it to say first is already to fit it into the concept of time sequence in the claim the classic you know claim about the identity and nature of God in Jewish
 tradition is the God isn't just first in time because then time would be first the one in whom all existence and reality is sore. Has to be first to be God is to be the one who is it's the one from the burning bush the one I'm glad I am that I am the being whose existence depends on nothing else they are reality in reality is encompassed within that one and so that's what I mean to say I'm the alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end of this when Jesus is called the firstborn it's using a metaphor of a Human Institution to describe the status Eternal status as we'll talk about this more when we get in later episodes to focus on the New Testament passages more but where does right now in the house the Steamworks
 biblical story there's this surprise you thought Jesus was the late born of little social rank but in reality he is the one who is the first and the last beginning and then he's the one who is starting a new type of family we are called to be part of that family and so he's the first born amongst many brothers Paul calls Jesus is the firstborn among many siblings siblings that we are being made into his image and so this idea of wanting to be the image of God to have God's authority to rule and a way to be important too powerful. It's the right call it yeah it is in fact the identity of the Human family on page 1 of Genesis of the problem is how we going to go and get that that's right and then the scheming of who's going to be first and how am I going to get
 first born that's going to be for my family and I hope then that just caused all the problems neck the right answer then you have Jesus who is the first born in this Meadow Way then saying now become like me which means to be first you actually need to become a need to become and this is again anticipating you know our final conversation this is for Paul and slit his letter to flip the ends in the poem in Chapter 2 that's how it begins he was in his very nature God but he didn't treat his equality with God as something to be grabbed his own self Advantage rather he emptied himself of that power and privilege to give up his life and so you win by losing anything by losing four of us so that's the medicine that's another thing and then you left us on a cliffhanger and you said you know you would think this thing begins with Kay nanay
 how did the first two brothers came to the older tables the younger God favors able and so the sibling rivalry happens in the theme firstborn kicks off and you said it starts earlier yeah I think the idea starts earlier yes that's right so we're going to do is focus on the role of humans in relationship to the rest of creation as it's portrayed in the first two narratives of Genesis the 7-Day creation narrative and the Garden of Eden narrative and if you pay close attention to the litter a design of the stories that invite you to focus your meditation on certain relationships in the story some really fascinating things unfold and I've mentioned this over the years in the podcast but I'm convinced this is a part of the meaning of the story and I learned I wasn't crazy as I found lots of other second temple Jewish literature
 the show that people were tracking with these ideas before Cain and Abel all that say let us turn our attention to the relationship of the sky rulers in the land rulers in Genesis
 so we probably more than any other part of the Bible have focused our attention on the early stages of Genesis so I will do my best to but some people are going to be listening to have no idea that's right so I'll try and do a summary but we do have a video on the 7-Day Christian narrative but does a better job than I could right now but explaining the design and message of Genesis a visual commentary Genesis creation narrative begins and ends with a prologue an epilogue and in the middle of those are the six days of God working so it begins with the land it begins in the summary statement in the beginning God created and how did that happen what it did involve narrative proper begins with the statement talking about the pre-creation state which is described in two ways
 two words tofu 50 ho
 is usually translated for must avoid the main in Korean translation translation tradition what it means is unordered and uninhabited tohu unordered or Fox and his a Jewish scholar produced a translation of the Torah I love you translate that wild and waste uses the W alliteration to capture the the rhyme of the Hebrew words
 so what God does his address those two states states as it were in order so days one through three are all about bringing order to the wild unordered bring order to the other order to bring honor to the underwear two days four five and six are about filling the uninhabitable Wasteland with inhabitants of the separation of three separations on first 3 days light and dark ordering flight from dark by ring light from dark day two is about separation of the waters below from the water the bus I got the chaos Waters got separates them and now you've got ocean and sky and then day 3 the dry land is separated from water tonight at 11 o clock
 you got the age of cosmology which is the snow globe so the source of the light on day one is you know it classic kind of puzzle in the story The let there be light light and it's a question of where did that light come from as you read on through the rest of the Hebrew Bible the primary way the presence of God within creation is described is as fire or source of Bright Light which makes you go back to day one and see if the God is confronting the darkness with his own with us on presents Enlighten however on day 4 we return to the topic of light and dark and what God does is a point lights or lamps the Hebrew word my order and he Adella means Lampard and those are to do
 is there now delegated to do the thing that God did on day one so God's lights that showed up to order the void now God is delegating that power to the lights to the lights a thread so on day 4 Genesis chapter 1 verse 14 God said let there be lights
 in the dome Skies which relation is that to you well I'm already translated my translation translation. I just wondering if it is that split let there be lights in the expanse of the Skies I'm curious what it was yeah I got a 114 wealth depends on what date of the NIV you're reading before show the most up-to-date one as a 2022 reads let there be lights in the Vault of the sky but it is light so it would be like if there be lights. Go to in order to separate the day from the night
 and let them be already separated God. Did it personally separated from light that's right so now they're separated again in this anyway the thing that God has already established is now being dedicated so that they will know how bad are they in power that happened at Sand Lake now here's some lights that are going to do the same thing they will do it and this is part of the biblical imagination for what are the stars so they're going to be called at the end of this chapter is the host of Heaven which is the same name given to the Luminous Angelic beings if that is a big imagined as creatures to do God's will they dance their dance or bring the show God's order they show and they display the order of time through
 there is a movement through their movement which is regular it's ordered it's the structure of time but there's a few that don't quite March to the same order a Nordic star and they are called Upon A Taste the Wonder is the Greek word means to wander and so the plan a test is the wandering one where we get a red planet because there's a handful of lights that look like they're not and coordination two great lights the big light to rule the reason royal king language to Rule the Day and the small light to rule the night the Moon the Moon and also and also this. Place them in the Dome of the Skies to give light on the land and to rule
 the day and the night and two separate the night from The Darkness got salad is good now to designate day for night that makes sense but to rule yeah that's like what I was asked how is this yeah they have a realm of responsibility which is to order time got hands over Taiwan detailing brush 14 that we left out is they are two separate the skies and let them be as signs to Mark the sacred festivals and also the days and years so you know when to have Paso pass over us I would you know you look up where the sergeant and older versions of the NIV and many other English translations that says let them be a sign for the seasons making you think of like the Four Seasons and that's not what this word means refers to the sacred festivals that you're going
 read about into Scrolls correspond with are you no sense of students that's right but he's referring to the seven festivals you lie about numbers and so another key has these lights are called signs which is the Hebrew word out which is simple so they symbolize something they stand in the place of something greater that's what I find us the thing they stay in a place that is why is it at least that to your you have to meditate on that what can you do for me so these are lights that do the thing that God did
 yeah yeah they separate day from night so God was the ruler of day and night implied he is a true but now there's these many rulers were given responsibility for the thing that God did and they are called symbols symbol is something that stands to represent something greater than itself now we're going to come back to this idea with a new word which is image correct yeah is that a synonym or is it so different ideas a different word is a related word know if it's so close to say a synonym of but it's definitely related word one thing that stands as a symbol or representing another thing and that's what image does but yeah very images of God's light there little lights little lights and so the question is where did they get their light from by what power are these little liar what Authority do they get to have authority that's right and here is
 it's important to see day for as a parallel in relationship to day one so they are symbols of God's light They Are Spiritual Beings
 who's in some aspects of their nature and being point to the greatest spiritual being of all small light when you filled the big light so that's the lights and what significant is the called rulers the called symbols and they are due in the skies what God was doing in the structure literate design of Genesis the 7-Day creation narrative Phase 1 2 and 3 have an important relationship just under themselves it's a little Triad and they won matches day three and some really important ways just in the repetition of keywords the easiest one is that on day one we got orders time I saw it it was the two separates Waters from the waters there's no pronouncement that it's good day 3. Separates the waters from the land God saw that it was good so
 is all these repeated words and phrases in day one and three that mark them as the beginning and the conclusion of a little try-out unit they don't want to three similarly 5 and 6 have the same design where day for has all of this language that's uniquely echoed not a day 5 but in De 6/4 we just went through a four-day five is where the. Just filled inhabitants of the sky so the day one ordering of day and night is not filled with inhabitants they 1 questions a day for ya in the way yep it's a lot of course but it's a lot of course there are six go back and their their own little sandwich that map on two days want you to but they also match in a row yeah today's lunch for 3 today one light and dark
 for the inhabitants of the sky are now the rulers of light and dark day five matches day to Sunday to got separated Waters from above from the waters below is a 5.2 points inhabitants for the for the both of those Waters so the birds in the air fly against the face of the waters above and the fish in the sea swim in the waters below the face of the waters above is that I mean water comes from the sky where does that water come from yeah and so in addition there is water slide water up there tonight that comes down like a whole like ocean of the Heavenly ocean that is drawn upon for do and rain and then the clouds media that down onto the land yep that's in the biblical imagination and so
 God now puts inhabitants in those two rounds of the waters so that way it's a five-match day to when you get today 6 what's interesting is our attention turns back to the land which was exactly the focus of day 3 day 3 got separates the land from the water so that's right and so they 3 is now match by day6 Wisconsin dating to Triad has 14 days to and five Waters above as below days 3 & 6 for folks on the land but then when you're if you're just staring in on day 4 through 6 as a little side of hand with you what you'll notice is the topic of rulers and representatives comes back up again yeah so now you were meditating on the relationship of the sky rulers
 just how they relate are similar different from the land ruler SpaceX so the first thing we're told on day 6 is Elohim forgot said let the land bring out living creatures according to their kind cattle creepers and beasts of the land
 so Amber told God made the beasts of the land cattle in the creepers so the land produces animals that low to the ground bugs snakes marmots weasels bunnies funny hello I'm grounded yeah that's right so Beasts of the land are non-domesticated kind of wild and quadrupeds you know Lions Bears Panthers cattle referring to the animals and then creepers do you know my lineage all the animals Yeah Yeah Yeahs this is all about the kosher food laws things are being categorized with an eye towards the Israel okay Kosher foods
 they are assholes other at all. So you got the animals they come first they come first the living creatures living creatures then verse 26 then I will let us make human in our image according to our likeness and let them rule over
 the fish of the sea the birds of the sky the cattle over all the land and over every creeper that creeps on the land so all the pictures but they can't afford them of the land water and the sky creatures the birds will typically think of how do not rule out thing however there was and still is an awareness that we are more powerful and check them in a positive or negative way and it that's certainly true in the ocean like telling the sturgeon what to do until we capture them and so what's interesting here is the relationship of humans to fish and land creatures feels pretty intuitive
 but to the sky sky creature that's interesting. I think that's also known as brain to call when do I rule the whale Oregon newspaper there was a couple kayaking this didn't happen this summer but I think previous summer but it became a viral video I don't know how I didn't see it when it happened a few years ago they're kayakers around these big humpback whales feeding off the Oregon coast and a couple straight-up get swallowed though yes like a big humpback mouth open wide thumbs up some video and yes closes his mouth about a spit them out it's B them out a little bit later like I told Jonah but they survived but they spent I don't remember how long
 food around inside the mouth of a humpback whale before is it spit them out can you imagine can you imagine
 astounding it's astounding is a terrifying thing to watch and I love kayaking I got love but anyway so yeah definitely not really over that so that's what's interesting about this portrait of the human images is that you think it's just the land and the Beast that we can like domesticate but the everything else is like you know don't mess with the bear don't mess with and then of course not the birds like they're on their own yeah level like they can cruise up in the space that you have no access to it sink in the ancient context rights of 2,500 years ago three thousand years ago when this was written at that point in human history agriculture obviously has really developed if animal cultivation memories of injury and you know I thought there were homing pigeons maybe you know people that train from Hawks
 I like anything but lie and obviously fishing with Hawks and Eagles maybe it's that kind of thing that's imagined by that humans have this capability to use their minds to bring a level of order and rule over any creature that it made you even the most wild ones but not unpack way out there in Wales portrait is an exalted portrait of human responsibility certainly exalted over most normal totally over my experience yeah like it's realistic but also it's fairly exhausted to most people experience like I don't do pick myself as a ruler of the sky and the creatures in it I just don't think of myself that way
 but that's the portrait here and such a being that has such an exalted place is said to be an image of God so the same idea of God created these symbols Sky rulers to represent him in the way that he hath had authority over time and day and night and ordering the cosmos and that way your the humans and the land being given authority to rule over the creatures a creature of the land of the Triad and the repetition of image and symbol and ruler makes the rulers of the sky and the rulers of the land kind of match each other as the outer parts of a little sandwich that is days for 36 right and that's interesting cuz it's comparing that God has delegated the rule above and the rule below
 how to share power and responsibility and that's the fundamental portrait of this being called Elohim is this a being who sustains order and then within that order wants to share power and privilege and responsibility that that we share that in common with Angelic beings correct yeah that's right yeah and distinct Realms of their Realm
 you know they govern time and the structure of time in the order which is viewed as like foundational to The Weave of creation and then the humans have their responsibilities the terrestrial just the landlord and the blessing of reproduction right be fruitful and multiply still the land rule over it I found man whatever Beautiful Mind is in the heart of the universe is a being there wants to share existence and responsibilities with created
 so that's the portrait here so it's notice that there's a relationship between the sky rulers in the land rulers it's the land rulers who are given I think the depends on your apology but they're given a big realm to rule so that's interesting comparison or contrast between them Sky rulers and then also let's just noticed that the human rulers come last in the sequence of the six days they don't come first to come last and even the animals are before them which is true in this narrative it's also true in the narrative example of the fossil record but that's not what this is concerned with as I meditate on it so
 the last Comer is the one who is given the authority to rule over the land late Comer if so you could just do nothing with that observation but it's an interesting as you read through the Hebrew Bible it's consistently the latecomer they got elevators to places of rule and authority and makes you go back to Genesis one bit that's interesting cuz most intuitively God would have given the rule of the land also to the Angels or the host of Heaven now there up there they oversee it all yeah yeah in a way like in Greek mythology that's yes yes they're the ones that their ruling yeah absolutely end in ation Israel context Babylon Egypt Assyria Canaan
 it's the forces of nature but definitely the lights in the sky are viewed as old Indy gypped at the Sun Ray or I mean this with the ultimate among the pantheon of deity is It's usually the sky gods that are like at the time if it anyway maybe some of the humans represent them yes that's right complement the Incarnation of one of the sky ruler correct but here it's reversed The Travelers have power and Dominion but it's separated from them that the minion that the humans are given its Rider both called him for one called a note that right there called an image and sell them particularly refers to a carved statue the word for statue
 statue that represents whereas the word sign or symbol can refer to lots of things I guess my point there was the angels are more powerful and they're more exalted exalted and they came first and they rule the sky why not also them be the ones who rule the Earth and here's the latecomers who are also like just these dark creatures yeah yeah who then God says actually you're going to rule that's right lol and yeah this is a uniquely elevated depiction of human identity and human dignity of the ancient world yet this is a very elevated view that stands in contrast to how other cultures imagine the heavens and the Earth
 so that's itself is worth observing just there you go now it's pass on that let's turn our attention to the next narrative which is the Garden of Eden story which depicts creation from another angle and with a different set of images that have their own connection ancient culture and we've done our conversations what I want to focus on is a couple things first of all that's the story of garnet need but you also have an alternate story about the creation of order and abundance on the lands that is told not in the sequence of seven days but in the sequence of just one long day And So It Begins and Genesis 2 verse for this is the first account of the birth story of the sky
 in the land when they were created first of focuses on a Wilderness and empty Wilderness but God provides the stream Will Spring the water pops up and begins to hydrate the land and plants grow up happens when water soil is watered here on planet Earth
 and what also got does with some of that mud at hydrated Optima the ground is he forms a dumb human from that ground and then breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man even becomes a living being now. Also the garden in the east in Eden and their God placed the human that he had formed so you get this portrait here where the humans are put there
 in this Lush garden plans that God has provided through no effort or just God loves to take dirt creatures and Elevate them to the Thrones of princess and give them chances to care and have responsibility oh God commissions the human to work and take care of this Garden so yours got delegating again you work and take care of it it was the parallel image to ruling in Genesis 1 you put these two narratives now God has formed a dirt creature given that dirt creature Divine breath to animate them as a gift and now it gives them
 a Divine task which is to Steward the ground similar to idea of humans representing God God is the one who provided the garden but now humans are being given the responsibility to care for an overseas Garden the same idea just one just different language and imagery so the human can't do this job alone
 and so what God does is lead the human on a educational journey of discerning what is the best type of partner and 1st at the negative lesson God puts the human in a situation where is to beat all the animals to me all the animals and what the human comes to realize that these animals are cool as them but there's no corresponding Ally or partner among them with him he can rule creation and so all conversations we ever see the Adam and dog do I know what I don't know what you're talkin about the movies that show because it's short animated film about Adam meeting Eve but his physical pain is this dog it's a story about Adam and this is dog
 and then like exploring and me and the animals and then leave okay really cool I can't wait to see you for an Oscar dog 2011 short film made by Mickey Gilley
 yeah it was nominated for best animated short didn't didn't win but it did win best animated short at the 39th Annie Awards
 I'd really curious what you think of it actually it's been awhile since I've seen it 16 minutes thank you dog and the dog okay okay notice here that the order of humans and animals is reverse from what it is in the 7-Day story that interesting yeah God creates the animals second in the story alone humans first then animals then got splits the human into male and female so it's similar ideas Genesis one but the chronological sequence is different and those are all puzzles that we totally beside but what's interesting is once you get the human a male and female in the garden with their vocation to work in the care once you reach that end of Genesis to your life you have reached now the same point as you were at the end of the seven days
 Alexis weight alright we reach the same point through to narrative images and you read them a lot of each other and you like this tear is a king and queen they're destined to rule this great so what is interesting is the next story features an opponent and antagonist whose identity is way understated whose motives are unstated but a being a new kind of exists in the biblical World in a way that no other creature seems like it's a creature that's the snake the snake is conscious animal and we think that ancient people thought animals talked you know it was no more common in the ancient world and it was in the modern world and was right that they don't speak human language
 something the Nerdist way of flagging and it's not 90-something business as usual and what we're told is that the serpent was tricky knew how to take advantage of the opportunity circumstances so there's an assumed backstory and you got to read on to the Hebrew Bible just classic meditation letter style which means that he Revival will build puzzles and ambiguities into earlier stories that will only be clarified as you read on later into the collection forcing you to re-read it day and night your whole life and so what this snake first does is question God's generosity and then what the snake says and trustworthiness yeah then attacks his trustworthiness know you won't die if you eat from that tree that God said will kill you if you eat from it for God knows the wind
 it from it your eyes will be open and you will be like hello him who know good and evil so snake know something about the LA me something about Spiritual Beings which is interesting so isn't it interesting that the two creatures that come before the humans in the 7-Day narrative are the guy rulers and the creatures the animals has four through six and that is precisely the form of this creature here a land creature who we have hunches and that seems to know about the goings-on of the sky rulers to see what I'm getting at here is something that words that little insight that we thought maybe was interesting in Genesis one that the humans are last in comparison to the land creatures of day6
 and then there's that in some kind of contrast relationship or similarity to the sky release and then here's a snake who seems to know the business with Sky rulers and is in the form of a land creature and his like temptation is to say don't you want to be like the sky rulers yeah don't you want to be like okay so this is an ambiguity cuz what the snake says you will be like Elohim which is a noun plural Spiritual Beings or it is also the noun that stands for the singular spiritual being the do the Creator which will be like y'all got the ultimate ruler the one who which state should want to be like they are like the one
 being plural it's the sad irony of like but you've already been given a whole realm to rule why do you want what hasn't been important to you which is to Rule the Sky as well
 so fascinating Outlaw loaded in here so obviously there's some motive here to get the humans dethroned or to get them get them to eat a little to get them to do what I got to do but the motives remain unstated for this creature but the deception Works obviously and they end up doing what God said not to do and so they bring on themselves and Exile out of Eden the leads on to their death and then the snake itself gets cursed and signed a position of low status in the dirt to crawl on your belly and eat dust and if the Future 2 seat from a seed of the woman that will be hostility between the snake and Humanity until the snake is crushed by Future see the woman so here's was super interesting is that this parallelism this identity of the snake and what I'm just drawing attention to these little.
 tales of the design lead you to think that this land creature somehow connected to the sky rulers this is the main interpretation of the snake in all of the earliest Jewish literature that we know of identifies the snake as a sky ruler in Disguise as a land creature and I think people who choose who meditated on the Hebrew Bible and saw all these connections begin to form portrait of this being and its motives and this gets explored later in the Hebrew Bible in the prophets and there's poems that depict land rulers
 as if they are thinking of themselves as Sky rulers so the king of Babylon in Isaiah chapter 40 and Isaiah makes fun of the king of Babylon whose kingdom is collapsing and he's going to die soon and you makes fun of them and creates this little poem where he imagines the king of Babylon thinking that he's a God good morning star and then Ezekiel makes fun of the king of Tyre and Chris's little parody where the King of Thai or imagines himself to be a cherub in the Garden of Eden to rebelled and was expelled down to the land really fascinating so those represent later biblical authors who are tying in stuff about the sky rulers in the land rulers that's within the Hebrew Bible itself but then second temple lecture I've got a handy-dandy resource
 easy way for anybody to get into a resource where you can see how the Hebrew Bible was being read and interpreted in the centuries before Jesus and then the centuries you know after Jesus is the scholar named James kugel the big reference book called traditions of the Bible a guide to the Bible as it was at the start of the Common Era what do you work through the Hebrew Bible and sequins and he's just collected from second temple literature so later toasty Revival literature ways that all the stories were interpreted by later to his readers so what is interesting was he's collected a whole bunch of interpretations of the snake and its motives so there is a second temple Jewish tax called the wisdom of Solomon that's Super Rad and it's actually included in some Christian Bibles
 and it has a little line that says God created us but his Humanity for immortality in corruption and made humans in the image of his own eternity but through the devil's Envy death entered the world and those who belong to his company experienced it is in a poem that's all about how God has chosen and exhausted that special servant who is that servant trust and does God's will expressed in the laws of the Torah they will live forever and you can experience life beyond death because that one is recapturing the original eternal life and made available to Adam and Eve the tree that was forfeited because they gave in to the devils and Z you see that little interpretations
 exactly this represents the mind of somebody who has fought through and meditated on these first stories of the Bible and come to the conclusion and motive of the snake back to maybe what we were saying which was why didn't God appoint the sky rulers also rule the land like they could have done the job I bet they're qualified and then most of Israel's neighbors that is their role as their role why should these lowly creatures get that responsibility and so this is all about theme of the firstborn. Exactly yes and one of the things that drives a lot of the problems with the firstborn can able the first one that we're going to come to backdate Envy yeah he's angry how does an implicit envy that his brother has been exhausted over him and it's not fair it's not fair that's exactly
 but my hunch is that the author of this text the wisdom of Solomon actually saw a parallel between the sky rulers in the land rulers and also a parallel between sneaking out of Inez and between Cain and Abel has meditated on all of it together and read the Envy of can back into the Envy of the snake that is as a disguise Sky ruler
 who thinks that the latecomer shouldn't be exalted over me yeah so the power dynamics have begun another knock with sex comes from round pretty sure the first-century 880 and some of the first Enoch from around the third Century BC and it is in 1/4 of Doc's the easy optic Orthodox Church in there it is in there but the second you knock is a statement that says that one from the order of the archangels
 deviated together with a division under his authority he thought up the impossible idea that he could place his throne higher than the clouds above and above the Earth that he would become equal to God's power this is kind of what I was taught us or destroy ya in another second temple Jewish text called third Baruch it's the devil is envious and tricks that humans but the contents of the Envy isn't made clear so here's the Whopper okay so this is a second temple Jewish texts who's time and origin is really debated called the life of Adam and Eve and it's an imaginative retelling of the Garden of Eden story about from some ultimate ultimate Hebrew Bible in there who is reading all the themes and patterns of the later he Revival
 into the garden so fascinating so basically it imagine the conversation between Adam and the Snake once they're all like that I'll have to feed and Adam s the snake why did you do that great and it's this long speech which reads Omer Adam
 all my enmity and envy and sorrow concerned you
 since because of you I am expelled and deprived of my honor that I had in the skies in the midst of the Angels
 when you were created I was cast out from the presence of God and was sent out from fellowship with the angels when God blew into you the breath of life and your countenance and likeness were made in the image of God mihael Michael one of the sky rulers he brought you to us and bid us all to bow down and give allegiance to you in the presence of God
 and he called the Angels saying bow down to the image of the Lord God as the Lord has instructed saying oh yeah and I answered I do not have to warship Adam I will not worship someone inferior who came later than me I am before him in creation before he was made I was already made he ought to bow down to me so what you were taught in Sunday school is the result of a long tradition of meditation on reading the Eden story and why does how the themes develop in the rest of the Hebrew Bible
 so it's not I don't think it's wrong but it's all unstated in the Eden story that interesting story and it's pretty underdeveloped in the Hebrew Bible although when you get to Genesis 5 is it and there's the kind of that like the Elohim another little window into the Grandeur of like the relationship between humans and the Elohim and I do it yeah yeah this works of the firstborn and I saved that quote for the last it's because these readers of the Garden of Eden narrative in the second temple. Knew their Hebrew Bibles way better than most any of us do and they saw within the Eden story a god choosing the lowly goddamn elevating the latecomer
 the second born as it were over the firstborn of the 7-Day Christian narrative which is the gyro okay so this seems really may be crucial is that there's something inherent to the way God rules from the very beginning and which is elevating The Humble the lonely the lowliest elevating the dirt creature and there's something I guess it must be good everything has been doing is good good good it must be something good about this but then this becomes the basis of a conflict yes yeah which then creates everything bath right all of the strife and violence and enmity and everything is now coming from this from the Rivalry yeah that's resulted from God send to elevate the lowly
 fascinating that's a good observation yeah it says if what God God as the source of all who is all being in existence in God's Own Self and from the beginning wants to share power and authority but also from the beginning wants to Define true power and authority not as taking 41 to self what you think you deserve right but rather receiving power as a gift and God's way of I guess incarnating that lesson is from the very beginning and he does give it to the angels that's right now but then he gives it to these lowly creatures and so if you're not down with that that people that don't seem to deserve what I deserve are getting God's favor if you're not down with that yeah now begin.
 oh yeah you're going against the grain of creation Surat cuz like what else does where the end of summer real time there's a lot of time camping backpack and get in the middle of nowhere this summer and you look at nature and you're like the most powerful creature out here isn't the king you know oh my gosh so intense they're clearly like the alpha predator you know out in like you know in the Rockies and just to think in nature that seems natural to us the most powerful is the one that giant the one in charge and then here in this culture practice the firstborn is nothing there the most powerful and this is a depiction of the heart of the creator of the universe as actually saying no it's actually the weak ones
 they are also also also the ones that God wants to elevate to the highest Place alongside those who for what circumstance or whatever have also been given power and authority and not so counter to nature but yet in Genesis one it said to be woven into the fabric of nature itself right that's what is so fascinating thank you drawing attention to them that's good okay. We'll look at Cain Abel next the next table where the theme of sibling rivalry and firstborn really kicks off Ling's kicks off but the language and imagery and how it all goes from there is really built on this earlier set of ideas and words here and just noticed I have this set up in Genesis 12 and three sets you up we not only need a human land ruler
 we need someone who will take care of that this Rebel Sky ruler to you need a ruler of Heaven and Earth to bring order to what's gone wrong and creation Now and of course what Jesus claims for himself at the end of Matthew all authority in heaven and on Earth has been given to me son so next to Cain and Abel and onwards in there thank you for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we turn our attention to Genesis chapter 4 the story of Cain and Abel pain is the older brother and Abel the younger brother they both come and bring offerings and for some reason God shows favor to the younger brother Abel and this makes pain anger and so I think God's response to Cain is essentially you're assuming that there's no exaltation for you to just cuz I went to the lowest one first and so now you got a choice
 whether you will do good or not do good based on this moment and be careful cuz there's an animal at the door moral failure is like an animal but just like I call your parents to rule over the animals and they didn't they let an animal rule them you have chance to rule this inner animal and what you going to do by Cooper pelts with the associate producer Lindsey Potter edited by Dan Gumball Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza and a woo provided the annotations for annotated podcast in our app the Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make it's free because of the generous support of people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with hi this is Brett from Barcelona Spain and I'm from Colorado Springs Colorado I first heard about Bible project from an instructor in a biblical studies course I was
