we are just at the beginning of a year-long journey to The Sermon on the Mount The Sermon on the Mount in short just over a hundred verses yet it's the largest and most well-known collection of the teachings of Jesus and John Collins this is Bible project podcast with me his co-host Michelle Jones High Michelle while we modern people call this The Sermon on the Mount Jesus had his own way of introducing it hears Tim Mackie if you ever wanted to know what a summary of just as teaching it is in one second message is it to us 4:17 Jesus is enough thing turned around everybody the kingdom of this guy's a touchdown Jesus is really familiar with the Hebrew scriptures which we call the Old Testament and the Hebrew scriptures tell the story about God working with Israel the bring about his kingdom and today you and Tim are going to walk us through the three parts of the Hebrew Bible and how those three parts connect to what Jesus is teaching in The Sermon on the Mount exactly
 and while we do that you're going to take a field trip with Dan gummo the producer of this episode and one of the Bible project Scholars and Shaw and you're going to look at an old Torah scroll so while Tim and I look at how The Sermon on the Mount relate to the Hebrew Bible will hear from you about how the Hebrew Bible is designed the difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament the order actually help set expectations of what to anticipate so looking forward to this so how does every part of the Hebrew Bible connect to The Sermon on the Mount Tim Mackie and John Collins sit down and hash that out thanks for joining us here we go
 let's just go to the end of Matthew chapter 4 real quick I want to look at Matthews introduction to The Sermon on the Mount the last half of chapter for so chapped Jesus goes into the Wilderness for forty days cuz it's 12 Jesus hears John's put into prison Jesus goes up and starts to ring all the towns in the hills around the the lake of Galloway Galloway 4:17 from that time Jesus began to an ounce and if if you ever wanted to know what a summary of Jesus teaching is in one sentence magic is it to us Jesus is a note saying turn around everybody turn around turn around and Hebrew word shoes in Hebrew. Just turn around
 which means the transformation of your mindset change your mind change requires you to go a different direction the same direction is not going to go well for you you got to change because of this thing that's happening what is that thing the kingdom of the Skies has come near since you brought it up the ra pain situation
 we talked last episode about domesticating Jesus teaching domesticating this word repent has such a punch to it right interesting now it's also becomes associated with with like Street Preachers and stuff that is kind of gross but it feels like it's really Punchy we're just like this does the does the Hebrew or Greek have that same punch as it turned around change the way that you're thinking for me the word repent fits into that category of religious words that it's come to have a meaning that's doesn't actually communicate anything anymore some words good so loaded with baggage religious words you have to make a choice if your goal is communication communication
 I find there are some words you just need to find a new synonym for a new word for it and so and maybe it's just because I turned around turn around turn around or change if you ever decide that your kids are blown and you just got ya I got to be a great just barely around turn around turn around I can but I would say stop stop that's what I said. But when you calling somebody to shoot her met and it's not just stopped but I just think it's a different direction I need to go in a different direction so Jesus message is something is happening stop and turn on because because flip it over
 something is happening that requires this is the only reasonable response the kingdom of the Skies as touchdown right here right now you guys need to turn around potential Kingdom of Heaven so this is unique to Matthew has the phrase kingdom of God a few times excuse me Jesus in The Gospel of Matthew but if you compare those exact same sayings to the Mark or Luke what you'll find is uniquely and Matthew he's taking a saying with Jesus use sometimes kingdom of God sometimes Kingdom of the skies and Matthew has adapted you almost all of Jesus mention that the kingdom to be Kingdom in the skies Kingdom of Heaven and the shorthand is that Jesse's message about the Kingdom of Heaven here is clearly not but it's somewhere that you go it's the it's somewhere that has arrived here and it should
 you stop collaborate and listen and go a different direction this important for The Sermon on the Mount cuz like what is the what is the New Direction so the question is the moment Matthew tells you the first words of Jesus which is public message it raises the question what does it mean to turn around what is the response to Jesus's announcements supposed to look like and it's a paragraph of a way it's going to start in the paragraph is called The Sermon on the Mount by Jesus next goes along the sea begins each other some followers and then there's 23 the last paragraph of 4th Sermon on the Mount Jesus went through Galilee teaching in their synagogues announcing the good news of the Kingdom healing every disease and sickness among the people so people are bringing him sick of suffering pain people who are terrorized by spiritual forces of evil people having seizures paralyzed he's just listing all the people that Jesus is going to
 can heal right after The Sermon on the Mount in large crowds from the capitalist Jerusalem Galilee all came now in Jesus all these crowds 5:1 he went up on the Mountainside where he sat down this disciples came and began to teach and said and then you get The Sermon on the Mount if you want to know the substance of what it means to turn around and respond to the arrival of the kingdom of the Skies it's this The Sermon on the Mount so The Sermon on the Mount only makes sense that it does is it's unpacking of bigger program Jesus which is launching both and teaching but then with his actions and with his Declaration of power over evil and over sickness and death itself so that's one and then the second Matthew told us what Jesus is proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and then like two sentences later he opened his mouth and said
 blessed are those who are poor in spirit there is as the kingdom of the sky's so Matthews title for the Sermon on the Mount is the good news of the Kingdom he's telling you it's kind of like tell him what you're going to tell him tell him and so you know the good news of the kingdom is actually pretty rad title for a speech because the titles of things prepare you for what to expect out of something so sermons on somebody you actually hear one of my books I highly recommend it actually a short funny enjoyable exposition of The Sermon on the Mount by Jewish scholar amy-jill Levine called The Sermon on the Mount a beginner's guide to the kingdom of heaven and she
 grew up in a very traditional Jewish community and she remembers reading the gospels for the first time cuz it was when she was in her teens and University years and she was really intrigued by Jesus goes from her perspective you know she was intrigued but because she heard Matthew 527 refer to as The Sermon on the Mount she said she would skip it and I've heard sermons ever questions concerns and telling the story about how she skipped it for years so the young adult because she was like I don't want your sermons so the point is Sermon on the Mount already puts it into a category in your mind before you even think of it but what if the first time you heard that you heard it called the good news of the Kingdom the good news about the kingdom of God
 kingdom of God is a tough race yes because we don't at least in my part of the world I think those kingdoms around right Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Kingdom Jordanian Kingdom rescue has a few out there just not my world I do the kingdoms my Kingdom's and then the kingdom of God or Kingdom of Heaven it just in case it ends up feeling very vague sure that's right but it wouldn't it would not at all sound that way to force entry to a speaker in a living in a different political scenario but the idea of Israel of God as king of Israel having Kings of the Nations having Kings and then have God having a kingdom that he is bringing about a realizing here in our midst this is yep standard difficult. And so when I hear good news
 I think I now submit yeah I think something new surprising even good news is I can't wait until it's a patient and then good news about the reign of God rule of God God God rules the world and why is that good news I'm going to hear some surprising news that's happening right now connecting with that guy who has power over its thickness and done and he's announcing that something new is happening and up here there's three chapters that summarized what this guy has to say that's it. It's good surprising news about how the creator of the universe is exerting his rule over us correct Matthew clearly wants to situate what Jesus is saying in a bigger story line
 that he wants us to see Jesus as fulfilling
 so I must think about the sermon in relationship to the where that story is found which is in the Hebrew scriptures
alright let's dive into the Hebrew Bible but to do that we're going to take a field trip
 alright let's see what we got
 so we are standing right here on the western Seminary campus here in Portland Oregon the beautiful sunny day and I want to show you guys something we don't do
 cancel what one unique part about my upbringing actually connects to the Jewish Heritage and the celebration of holidays in my family actually learn how to pray in Hebrew before I learned how to pray so I started following Jesus 20 21 years old I have a Christian Bible and I have a conscience and realize that the the books actually we're in different orders and that there were some books that were in different Collections and so it just had me pause and just asked a question like what what do I do with this and so I want to show you an actual scroll and then compare the difference between the Hebrew Bible and the personal Testament
 this feels like a little baby phone booth but it's very sacred feeling this is Vitor room at Western seminaries Library we are standing in front of a Torah scroll that was composed sometime in the sixteenth century and what were you looking at right here we roll to scroll all the way back to Genesis chapter 1 so we're actually looking at the first chapter of the tour of the first book of the Bible looks like a bunch of stuff I can't read and it's it's in columns written on parchment that looks like it is hundreds of years old like I don't want to put my hands on it and at the same time I do a Rolling Stones I were talking like these these pens are like four feet long maybe three and a half feet long yeah longer than your arm it's sitting up on like a glass table at like a 45° angle so you can read it easily
 and I'm assuming the way you move the book through like the all of the paper is on the left side right now cuz you mentioned to me that the tours of red basically right to left was the opposite of the way English readers read and Aaron can you read this I can't ya hear let me have the odds are you holding right now yeah I'm holding a bow probably a footlong metal stick with little pointer finger at the end is called a yard and you use this stupid pointed the text so that you don't put your grubby fingers on it are Hands-On on the Torah scroll but we use a Yad Yad means hand in Hebrew and so this little pointer some hand that you pointed out that I'll actually be the guide that all use as as I read very interesting here is the way the tour starts this is Genesis one chapter 1:1
 vallecito gallucci Matt hashomayim Vitalis in addition to the right to left businesses already looks very different from the Bible that I would have read as a matter of fact I don't see numbers I don't not that I can read this but it doesn't look like it's sorted into verses and chapters and things the way my Bible is there is a difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament and actually Michelle if you would actually brought two different Bible's actually to show the highlights of the difference is here so let's open up to the table of contents there you go under the heading right here in the order that the with the Torah Scrolls and the entire schools of the tonight would have been written and so I was wondering if you wanted to go through and we'll just track each of the books and we'll see where they start to deviate as I can
 yeah so the Hebrew Bible is divided into three sections the Torah the prophets and the writings in the Christian Old Testament is divided into four sections it has the pentateuch history writings of the prophets so the first five books of the Bible in I have our Genesis perfect and Genesis Deuteronomy these first five books are called the Torah which means instruction in Hebrew your section has a heading above those what is that called pentateuch exactly a 55 is with five strolls R5 compositions really quick is my Genesis through Deuteronomy my pentateuch is it the same just content wise as your Torah exactly the same exactly the same exactly the same books so then we move to the next section and what heading do you have for the next book that comes after Deuteronomy this next section
 Fox yes so this is where things start to DPA between the personal Testament and the Hebrew Bible talk about how The Sermon on the Mount refers back to the Torah
so what Jesus is going to say in opening thesis actually he says that he hasn't come here to set aside the Torah and the prophets
 rather he's here to fulfill the Torah and the prophets the biggest organizational categories for the Hebrew Bible are the three divisions of the Hebrew Bible prophets and the writings for in Jewish tradition to not talk to her I never even got to be in which of the Hebrew words for all those might be a brand new idea yes that the the Hebrew Bible the Old Testament is three sections yes cuz it doesn't have three sections in the Protestant canon in the product organization organization of the Bucks in the Christian traditional organization I was familiar with Torah being the first five bucks yes call the pentateuch increase about what I would call it the Yeah Yeah Yeahs
 but I have never called it that and refer to it as that and then but I had no category for these two other ones prophets in the writings of T&K never aim Kettering theme to the Hebrew words for the first five books of the instruction the most the time when you see the law and the Old Testament know how I love your law in this song yes that's Torah the threat and when Jesus or the apostles talk about the law in the New Testament they mean the Torah Jesus says I came not to set the Torah and Prophets aside but to fulfill them is talking of your translation is a law and Prophets method law and the prophets but it's Torah and Prophets yep the Torah tells the foundation story of God's purpose is and why he's called the family of Abraham to
 be the vehicle of God's blessing and the conduit of his rescue fruit for Humanity and creation this family is at the center of that Cosmic drama God rescued that family he invited them to represent him to the world they from the very moment so that's Covenant ceremony that put him outside and I are failing violating the Covenant 613 commands later they're still violating it and the whole history of Israel is presented as an epic failure with some
 and full of bright redeemable moments along the way and so what Jesus comes along and presents himself as speaking with the authority of The God Who revealed himself on Mount Sinai will be a whole section of chapter 5 while he'll say you've heard that it was said and Who quote from the know not always a precise quotation sometimes he's quoting even also people's interpretations of the commands tutorial we'll talk about this when we get there but the point is he's saying you'd listen Torres has revealed will to Israel you heard that it was said that and then this response is and I say to you and then he gives his teaching so he's clearly setting his teaching alongside and the question is is it in contradiction to or intensifying or replace thing and we'll talk about that I'm an American will be American
 Patrick scoop like context vs thing called the Constitution is pretty important and it's this is as gutsy as saying the Constitution says and I now say to you it's a gutsy move really that's the shock value of what Jesus has going for and claiming here but isn't that also a normal Rabbi move to be like a like this is what the Torah says now I want to tell you my reply guest on it and actually Matthew registers how people perceive what Jesus was doing here in the conclusion to the sermon and Matthew 7 he says when Jesus finished all these words the crowds were amazed as teaching for he was teaching them as one having Authority not like they're normal teachers
 no, these are classic really Jewish texts they're all about toilet interpretation and they're debating how best to live by the will of cotton field in the door but normally what they say the quote command in the stable by Santos and its collections of debates in the names of this Rabbi in this Rabbi and Jesus just pretends like she's actually Samuel Levine's book is really helpful because she's trying to situate Jesus in those debates of the first-century and Jesus is speaking on in the live issues happening in his time but what's unique has t just says it on his own authority and he wasn't trained in Jerusalem isn't tired of the rabbi's guild is not a priest he's just a guy Cruiser on Galloway from Nazareth Nazareth putting his own interpretation of Torah alongside the words of God and on a mountain
 and he does It on the Mountain after we going to the Wilderness for forty in the sky so Jesus is summoning people to turn around this thing is happening Kingdom of the Skies is coming down and to respond to it is to follow my interpretation of what God's calling us to through the tour this is Jesus for the one aspect of Sermon on the Mount is that it's Jesus's Torah revelation of the will of God for the Covenant people of Israel
 so that's a helpful way to think about what Jesus is doing in the sermon it's a revelation of some kind of new layer or development with the story of the Torah
 yeah so what I'm doing right now is I'm rolling actually part of the tour here back cuz I want to show you and Michele will show you a seam between the different parchment pieces actually using right here so this is where one leaflet of the of the of the actual parchment itself is joined with another parchment it's actually join these two together to create as little separation between the two pieces of parchment possible often is continuing the same story that you're reading on one side as it moves to the other from right to left but other times they can actually join two different whole sections of the Bible to each other so in the Hebrew Bible there's actually there's these giant seems actually between the three parts of the Hebrew Bible the Torah the Navy game and a cat to fame but now with all that I'd love to do is show you the difference is actually between Hebrew Bible and
 Testament in the Bible that you have and show you how the Ducks actually are in different orders if you would let's let's go ahead and go down to each book just to pick out the first couple of differences between the Bible all right I've got Joshua Judges Ruth and my brother cuz in my Bible it goes Joshua Judges Samuel a different section but you have their two other books directed three other books in your section where the order is different what happens when after you go from 2nd Kings what's the next book in your order you have Isaiah wait a second there's a whole bunch of stuff that comes in between there that I don't have huh you goes to why is that the sequence of the books in the book of the prophets actually goes in order of the former prophets we should be Joshua through 2nd kings in the latter prophets Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and then actually all the Minor Prophets are considered to be one scroll called The Book of the
 oh wow
 Esther Andrews
 and Chronicles then get pushed over someplace else but my profits are after the historical books so what why why are your profits in what mine would be called historic yeah the order actually help set expectations of what to anticipate so the way that the Hebrew Bibles organized actually helps you understand so in The Sermon on the Mount having the prophets actually as the next section actually does matter
 the sermon isn't just oriented to the first five books that you read scriptures it's also the sermon is prophetic it's tapping into the storyline of Israel as a whole told through the prophets so the prophets refer to a section of narrative books in the Hebrew Bible Joshua Judges Samuel Kings yeah that's what that's a bit of a reframe reframe yeah yeah they consider prophetic books because in the Bible prophecy is offering a Divine point of view on something past present or future until it's a retelling of Israel's story in the land in Exile from the point of view of the prophets people go into the promised land epic fail
 that keeps raising up delivers who usually have a bright moment and then they fail or sometimes they just fell from the first moment if your Samsung or something like that and keeps driving this expectation of how is Israel ever going to live up to its calling be God's representative to the nation's second section of profits are what Christians call the prophet Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and the books of the prophets began to project their hope onto a future figure who will come from the future line of David Key part of the pathetic expectation isn't just about a messiah to lead the people to rescue them it's about the renewal of God's Own coven of people so they can finally
 represent him Faithfully so is Major theme undergirds The Sermon on the Mount that's especially in two passages in Jeremiah Ezekiel that are kind of refer to as like the New Covenant passages, have you read it from Jeremiah 31 starting at verse 31 days are coming to Claire's Yahweh when I will make a New Covenant with the people of Israel and with people Judah cuz it's like to cruise now right Israel and Judah by Jeremiah Davis have the Civil War and split into two kingdoms and it's right beside and the northern kingdom has already been taken out by us Syria will not be the coming and I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt
 Sinai Covenant because they broke my Covenant though I was a husband to them to Clara showing this is the Covenant I will make with people of Israel after that time Claire's Yahweh I will put my law until my Torah and their minds and I will write it on their hearts I will be their God and they will be my people no longer will they teach their neighbor or say to one another no Yahweh because they will know me from the least of them to the greatest declares Yahweh for I will forgive their wickedness and will remember your sins no more yeah hugely significant passage in the prophet so important that that entire thing you just read is reproduced in the letter to the Hebrews the longest block quote of the Old Testament found in the New Testament is this passage quoted in Hebrews Ezekiel has his kind of parallel anticipation of the Senate
 Ezekiel 36 the languages similar buffalo different God says Ezekiel 36 verse 26 I will give to y'all Israel a new heart and put a new roof new animating Life Energy / my presents inside of you I will remove from you Your Heart of Stone and give you a slushie heart heart of Flesh I will put my room off my personal an amazing life presents in you and move you to follow my decrees and to be careful to keep my loss the story of the Hebrew Bible is showing even when God redeems and brings all family people very close to the divine presence personally reveals the Divine will granted in an ancient near Eastern context for the laws of a surveillance on but even then when God does that these people replay
 play in the story of their own family the story about him and even all Humanity in the garden which is just the something with us where we continually failed to live up to even our own dust ideals much less God's ideal purpose for us and so when they think of a renewed people of God lead by Messianic leader in the new creation living under God's kingdom it will require this renewable and Recreation of the human heart by the power of God Spirit oh and it was interesting Jeremiah doesn't mention the spirit what he mentions is putting the Torah inside and writing the Torah on their hearts or a damaged
 by God's will becomes my will without even having to think about it that would be great it's kind of like having your left hand know what your right hand is doing and have the same Vibe the idea of something being so natural that you don't even have to think about it and in fact if you did reflect on it you know how you surprise yourself like oh yeah I was cuz I mean I was I was referring to The Sermon on the Mount Jesus says when you give don't like I said it's a funny thing is that possible but there's something about it would become so ingrained yeah sure how you're doing it on autopilot essentially when someone points out hey you were just being generous really I didn't even realize it you were following the Torah yeah like oh really oh yeah
 yeah that's right it is written on my heart to buy character formation this is what Jesus is after in the sermon it's not a code it's it's a charter for a new kind of human character he's playing out here then that's totally right so the sermon is also a press its prophetic Jesus sees himself as offering this Charter for what the spirit empowered new representatives of God are called to be in the live like what kind of music does somebody who has the Torah written on their heart list by what does it mean in practice to have the spirit of God moving you follow God's will revealed in the Torah that's what Jesus is claiming to unpack right here and you can see look loose of that in the sermon but also you have to look to the contacts that we just saw
 where Jesus says in Matthew wants to see that he's fulfilling the story of Israel and this is a part of the package is the spirit empowered re-creation of the heart of people
so I should expect to see a real emphasis on the heart and the renewal of the heart and character and integrity of Heart and Lung bald major major major Payne
 so we've already seen how the Sermon on the Mount calls back to the Torah and it also called back to the profits but it's got a lot of wisdom in it as well it's got lots of saying can call back to what we would call you know the Books of poetry in the writings and stuff yes exactly yet there's one more section in the Hebrew Bible that we have to talk about and that is the cat to be more the right things and it's kind of a junk drawer with a lot of different types of literature but one of the main sub collections in this in the cat even the writing's is wisdom Literature Like a junk drawer full of really good stuff though cuz I see the songs in my in my Bible it says there's Joe the Psalms Proverbs Ecclesiastes song of songs does that exactly yet all of those books are all in the cat to team in the writings here at the end and one of the main functions that are plays is actually being wisdom it is literature that leads one to
 system to reflection and meditation on the words that were written down which is why the whole book is called the right things you're supposed to reflect on it actually why Psalms in the very first chapter actually says that the one who meditates on this Torah on this construction will be like a tree planted by water
 free it seems like the writings of the wisdom literature is the most liked The Sermon on the Mount because The Sermon on the Mount are these quick amazing bits of wisdom that Jesus was absolutely reflecting on the wisdom literature and on these books and thinking about ways and giving it to the people who were at The Sermon on the Mount ways to think and imagine what it would be like to be a part of God's kingdom but the way that they got their required them to meditate and require them to think about the puzzles in The Riddles In The Parables that he was giving them
 what perspective is the sermon as wisdom literature Jesus often will state things in their most extreme form which is very common Proverbs just grabbed you grab your attention force you to think about it you know so if your right hand causes you to sin but yeah if your eye leads you to sexually objectified another another person gouge it out you know it's just really intense stuff so again we'll talk about this but this is love of hyperbole clever word pictures and comparisons this is these are the characteristics of wisdom especially in the world via Proverbs when you live by the fear of the Lord do wisdom you get the good life which doesn't always mean wealth and success of sometimes it might but you get the good life that lady with some says this more valuable than gold and silver
 Jesus offers three word pictures to talk about the decision that you now have to make once you've heard this good news about the kingdom what Jesus is doing is he's putting himself in the position of the father and of Lady wisdom from the opening chapters of the Book of Proverbs so so so when Jesus says in Matthew 7 there's a gate and Away in a path is narrow and at least the life and then there's this wide gate and path that leads to destruction these are the two pants when the life one to death this is one of the most foundational metaphors for receiving rejecting wisdom in the fear of the Lord in the Book of Proverbs 22 2 pads but the father will regular be like my son listen to my words live by the fear of the Lord takes the path of wisdom don't take the path of fools if he's instructing lady wisdom says it's a conclusion
 Her speech and Proverbs chapter 8 the one who finds me find life all those who hate me love death. Narrow gate that leads to life Proverbs 1 through 9 culminates depicting Folly and wisdom as two ladies lady folly or lady wisdom and the each one builds a house and then you can go up and enter that house but one we still life one leads to death and so Jesus ends with these two houses build your house on a rock and you'll outlive you build your house on the sand and you died so it says this Proverbs is sunk into Jesus OD play did he doesn't need to quote it's just woven into this language and imagery so Jesus is putting himself not only in the place of The Giver of the Torah and not only is saying the one who's going to recreate New Covenant Newhart people
 is also presents himself as the revealer of divine wisdom and to live by the fear of the Lord as you do in the Proverbs you want to know what that looks like now is The Sermon on the Mount
the last book of the ketuvim of the writing veggie ends with 2nd Chronicles you end the book of 2nd Chronicles it actually feel very last verse ends with an incomplete sentence in Hebrew it's the Edict of Cyrus midi deck he's just like and let him go up and that's just the end of the sentence go where I go out like what's what what comes after and that's that's the dramatic end to the Hebrew Bible so it is a story essentially in search of an end the Hebrew Bible's version of to be continued
 that's it for today's episode next week Tim is going to show us how The Sermon on the Mount fits into the whole narrative structure of the Gospel of Matthew so important thing on the mount is to recognize that it is the first of five big speeches in The Gospel according to Matthew the sermon isn't the only thing that Jesus teaches but it just the first big speech in Matthew and that's on purpose the Bible project is a non-profit we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to do that everything we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you thanks for being a part of this with us hi this is Cooper here to read the credits Dan Gumball is the creative producer for today's show production of today's episode is by producer Lyndsay Ponder managing producer Cooper pelts producer Colin Wilson Stephanie Pam is our consultant and editor Tyler Bailey is our engineering editor and he also provided the sound design
