is it John of the Bible project and this is the last episode of our discussion on how to read the parables in this conversation we're going to look at some strategies for taking the ancient Parables of Jesus and adapting them for modern life's it seems to me that we owe it to him to give as much attention to how we translate them into our own cultural context which means I think adaptation you can watch Jesus adapting parables in the gospels write a version of it and Matthew and a version of Luke will be able to get different and so if you get the main idea I think they ought to inspire new creative adaptations of the parables in our own settings we're also going to look at one of my favorite Parables the parable of the dishonest shrewd manager in this Parable a manager finds out that he's going to get fired by his master it so before he leaves comes up with the plan calls up all the people that
 who is master money and he cooks the books for their benefit and when the master finds out what this guy did the narrative says he was a dishonest manager this is perfectly clear but it's like a joke that has a Twist at the end instead of getting taken to court the manager says you're still fired but you're going to get ahead so I think it's because the master commends him at the end that's what leads us maybe to think all this is a parable of praising certain kinds of behavior namely dishonesty and if we can understand it how can we apply it wisdom thanks for joining us here we go
we are going to finish this conversation about how to read The Parables Parables of Jesus The Parables of Jesus specifically specifically in the Bible in fact we now started this conversation so many days, remember the word Parable did we talk about the word Parable how is it that I'm not bringing this up until the very last episode I'm sorry I be it's perfectly timed okay it's a compound Greek word Parable is from the Greek word Parable a what's it called when it's just you're saying the word o the Greek world it's a transliteration arable is a transliteration of Greek word for a ballet this compound para is the preposition next to and then Bala comes from a verb cast sometimes when you stepped to set on the long side to set alarm sides. So it's a little Parable in his own self
 figure of speech a parable refers to saying a teaching her story that sits alongside another reality it's actually the same concept of a metaphor which is also a compound Greek word but yeah long side so Jesus wants to talk about how his Israelite audience faces a decision about his offer of the kingdom of God to see if Jesus offering the kingdom of people who tells a story about a king giving resources to some managers are stewards so because the offer of the Kingdom stewards equal his listeners for Israel at that moment so the thing that's happening in Jesus life is something the reality reality yes and then the parable set next to the little parallel reality that he weaves that helps you gain new insight through the parallel stories in into the real thing it's set alongside several conversations about
 before from George laycoffs metaphors we live we have a Target that we want to describe or give new insight into and so we borrow from a source domain to describe a Target I want to talk about me every time so our experience of time which is very amorphous but then the moment you take from The Source domain of possessions you can begin to form metaphorical pictures alongside our reality of experience of time so time is something that we spend we lose that we save it when I get to possession you got going to understand it is our extended metaphors instead of a short phrase or one word or image the whole story of a parable becomes a large metaphor so I do anyway. However we did go out of the way to show
 do that if you tried to take every element of a parable and turn it into part of the metaphor yes and metaphoric scheme yeah that's right you could you could definitely go Way Beyond what Jesus was intending last conversation will talk about one of the most helpful kind of guidelines or controls on keeping our interpretations grounded we've already talked about a few first of all this is like going into recap mode first of all that The Parables were one of those common ways Jesus communicated not to talk about some other set of ideas of universal religious truths or moral ideals of The Parables were in the service of his larger project which was to announce inaugurate God's Reign and Rule here on Earth as it is in heaven through hip threw himself in the form of a group of people who were living under God's
 in this new and surprising way he was telling Parables to explain what he was up to the parables are a commentary on what Jesus is doing in the actual stories in which he's telling The Parables and then in the last episode we talked about the parable of the was called off sometimes that the talents or the the king and his servants it was so hard for me to unwind the way that I have read about horrible to then use that principle of what was Jesus doing in that moment that moment and why did he tell that Parable yeah those people to explain what he was up to that's right and that Luke actually gives you the massive hit like Jesus was doing this because he saw his disciples were misunderstanding what it meant for him to go become king that's right so then he tells that pair of balls and then we read that Parable I had that in my mind okay that's what his problem is. And I think I can't do it
 and still hard for me to let that shirt come the way I'm I'm understanding a pair of instincts are trained in the Christian tradition that the parables are about Jesus is talking about something else other than himself and that The Parables that my first set of questions that I should ask this is our expectation I think is that they're about me and God Jesus is telling a story about me and God cuz I'm one of his followers this is his teaching he teaches about how people relate to God right that's what moral religious teachers do yeah yeah so it's all in the context you know it's the one that's been sitting there for two thousand years just patiently waiting for us to pay attention to the actual context and I should say this isn't like a brand-new idea there many people throughout history who have been I think responsible with The Parables but
 then it's tended to be a minority this reading of what was that Parable where was that at chapter 19 19 now so one thing that they did to the parable which is interesting to me is it made it less mysterious or less like a riddle and made it an away well but because it's not about me it becomes less interesting about potentially me and I can put myself into that Parable now I just want to like sit in it and think about it but if we go okay so this was about the people around Jesus and these reactions to the king or all about the specific types of reactions that his followers and the people who are against him we're going to be doing in the next couple weeks yes and that this whole idea of more will begin
 then and being wise with what you already have was for the disciples to prepare them to go out and be commissioned by Jesus and that's helpful but it then and just kind of makes it okay yeah kind of noodles little bit for me so I hear that and I think that's cuz we haven't taken the last step yet which is to ask how do Jesus Parables about himself given to his contemporaries how does Jesus story and The Parables how do they speak to people who aren't sitting there in that moment and do that at all because Luke wrote it for someone who's not sitting there yes that's exactly the point obviously thinks all these Parables and Matthew and Mark have enduring value Beyond just the moment when Jesus spoke some to his contemporaries that's why they're in the gospels they're not just in there cuz they think now we can speak to us only them in there because when they give us a window into what Jesus was actually saying and claiming about
 how do we bridge that Gap in the very next step other we're going to talk about but the first and most important thing is that we understand what Jesus meant by this Parable in the moment when he speaks it in the narrative context that the gospels have provided and that should be our guide to its meaning which can then register the next step to say okay what is the significance of what Jesus was saying to them what is this significance to me
bright as we're making that transition I realized I think we've had this is what pretty meta conversation in biblical interpretation about the meaning of meaning where do you locate the meaning of a text like the gospels I'm going to make us not gets to see arrest history of literary interpretation and biblical interpretation in the mid-twentieth century to guy named Emmanuel Hirsch and he earned distinction has been very helpful to me the difference between meaning and significance meaning is what I intend you to understand from the words that I'm speaking so it's author or Communicator focused resource say let's make this very practical when you're listening to your wife Kristen talk in theory she has a meaning
 you were trying to communicate something to you and you will do well write to discern not what you think she meant cuz she might be saying something new you've never heard her say before so it's rides Communicator focused when you're looking at a literary text we don't have access to the person behind it anymore but we assume that the litter a text in bodies there the meeting they want to communicate and reader focused which is if you just got home from work and Tristan's communicating what she doesn't know yet is the kind of day you had and so she can't predict the significance that her meaning will have based on the day that you had so that I could be that you're just in such a great mood
 and whatever she tells you something and it just you light up in a way that she didn't anticipate just makes it so excited and that's cuz her meaning right which was something she would comprehend and try to get to you but she had no idea the significance of how that my land with you cuz I had to do with you and your experience that's the idea meaning of significance meeting is what I intend is the communicator significance is now that you understand my meaning what does that mean to you or what yeah we really intended what's this is what the significance of that because it's not like the person now means something different right it's know what the person meant that is what they meant here's what they meant and that's one thing I get to that honor that and now how does that affect you as a friend and in theory we should care about what people mean just because we care about other people
 what they mean to break the kind way to live in none of us listen without interests we typically start paying attention at the moment we think that something matters to me and the significant to me sadly all the time I am incapable of listening to two streams of communication at the same time oh yeah I don't think anyone can do you spell wife does it regularly you can listen to something what I am saying and what both sons are synced like at the same time and sorted and like sorted out what happens regularly wear like one of my sons is singing and the other son is listening to an audiobook and then Jessica's trying to communicate something to me happened yesterday or day before yesterday and fuses care of you know a minute into telling me something right probably important and I just have to choose at that point like okay I am I going to just go
 or do I just you know sweetie I'm sorry I didn't hear any talking for so long and I didn't hear any of that that's the last thing that I told your wife wants to know and it's usually when I start to clue in like what she's telling me I have to do something or respond I'm interested and I realize this has huge significance I'm so I'm so then I got to start listening I'm really bad at that I am constantly being distracted by things I would guess way more than the average person am I in a situation where someone's talking to me and I realized I've no idea what they're saying right now I was somewhere else and I have to make the decision yes do I stop them and make him start again or do I just try to pick it up I figure it out
 but I think people gets out like we are listening is more complicated than we do the whole communication Theory thing is is very complicated yeah yeah I can appreciate this distinction I have a meaning and when I communicate in the one that lands for you it has a meaning beyond my meeting correct and I just prefer I like how her she uses a different words cuz it makes the word meaning less confusing because all of a sudden I feel like for me it's helpful to end their you could footnote this with a very with a hope with many books about the problem of defining meaning and there are some problems in defining meaning only in terms of the speakers intention what are the purpose but I just want to set that aside so I think the Instinct that most Bible readers are trained
 to look for first is significant right and what we tend to do is Bypass or ignore meaning and just cut right to see what I mean and what's the significance of it for me yeah those are distinct but related realities and I want to make sure that the significance I'm drawing is really what Jesus has been tempted 45-second so how do we begin to draw significance that's connected to just me
so we know that there are two Extremes in the history of termination of The Parables we talked about this there's the allegorical you know field day where every single little detail is given the symbolic significance and the decoder ring is in the eye of the beholder so just be the Other Extreme Ways to say listen that's all just creative realism there's only one main point when they go away from any given Parable however when Jesus explains his own Parables what she does a few times it's clear that he does see different symbols that stand for dinner thanks to you both for soils so let's just take Jesus method is a guide what is Jesus done what he's done is identified the main characters in the story so you have a farmer sowing seed that's the word of the Kingdom in plaid he's the farmer so I can so I can God see it and then each soil is like a character and then there's a couch
 character for each character main character the soil and then you have the birds or the Thorns right where the rocks that kind of thing and so there may be other details in the poem give me in the parable but notice what Jesus he's just drawing attention to the key focal character points of the story that's how he got it so Craig blomberg in his very helpful book interpreting The Parables turns that into kind of like a rule of thumb but essentially the way we understand GSM meaning is to identify the main characters of the parable and note that each character is embodying some point some Epsom part of the message and Pete Advocates is that the surest most reliable guide that we don't go overboard okay so like cuz you could take any element of Jesus parable and say
 be this has some sort of hidden meaning that's right but then you can get out of control and have a field day so how do you know what parts of Jesus parable actually do have meetings are you supposed to clip into correct and what you're saying is one sure-fire solution is to focus on characters acts like a character it's embodying one of the key messages he message of the store so sometimes there's only one character you know a woman hides 11 however there's even there that there's two elements to that character there's what Jesus is actually comparing the kingdom of God to is the leaven has leaven a character that 11 becomes the character as an object that woman placing leaven in the Dove that's what the kingdom of God is like so they are the woman is God and the 11:00 is like a character
 she said that's like a simple 2 character terrible 11 is a character characters when it's crucial to the plot take that element out of the plot of the story falls apart now I feel like we're just right characters or objects to the plot objects crucial to the diagnostic mean something by the comparable to the element and apparently does Jesus mean something by this particular detail well if I took this detail out does it change shot it the nature of the story does it change the plotline does it if you take 11 out and they're sure if you take a character out it will unless the character was just correct some random flourish that's right but so in the Good Samaritan the Samaritan puts the injured
 turn on his donkey and buying his wounds with oil or Chi character is the donkey a key symbol what does a donkey symbolize what is the oil symbolize so that it's basic it's in that story there's a man who gets injured or so Levi has a priest and then there's a helper Samaritan and then the helper has all kinds of different little age instruments a donkey boil The Innkeeper and so on but all of those just serve as like one corporate character okay this is is the character or object or I suppose you could even now talk setting any of those elements crucial to the plot indispensable indispensable from to without that element that would be a different story all together and maybe the reason why you sled with characters is that generally speaking stuffing most often the characters in Spencerport
 in fact maybe we could even think of an example in a parable for character is dispensed in general characters are the conveyors of a narrative meaning examples of narratives even really good narratives we can take a character out in the plot snow work but you are in which case you would say they're minor characters yeah and then typically they are simply sub their little sub elements of a larger sometimes characters are composite so for example in the of the generous the guy who goes out and hires people all day long so he hires people have different hours ago but in the end it's the guys who came first who got hired first in the day they're the ones who speak up and they're angry at everybody who came after them then all of a sudden it's a three-character pair of all, it's the landowner the grumpy guys guys that work the longest and then everybody else who got hired later which is a composite
 character really 23 character Parable but character slots can sometimes be composite and have other indirect have a donkey have some oil have an Innkeeper but that kind of thing I loved about you search for clarity of problematize everything which is wonderful because you helping me clarify ya even even more so let's just look at some examples so let's just quick survey some 3 character Parables some of that already a huge number of Jesus Parables have an authority figure father King Master landowner and usually they embody or symbolize either himself or the god of Israel and of course that's on purpose. Those are both kind of blurred together not in the car. And then that usually there's two subordinate
 of some kind contrasted that's one positive one negative so a slave subject to sign the debtor a manager like so if you think through the each character in body is a main point a pretty it's pretty intuitive so take the prodigal son for example if you got two contrasting sounds character who gets the most airtime geospace so they embody a man principal the Jesus is trying to get across there are people who are foolish completely foolish don't deserve some generosity Mercy Grace forgiveness and sell focused and in a way that ruins relationships that's right yeah that's right yeah cut himself off from the family you've got a generous a surprisingly generous merciful father who wants to reintegrate his son back into the family
 then you have the older brother who's hold Grudge on each one of those communicate something blomberg sunrises that he says like the foolish prodigal son who returns and finds forgiveness even the most serious human failure doesn't close the door on God's mercy is a notice what he's done there in the contacts Jesus is talking about his reception of people that the Pharisees of put on the the outside of Israel Europe tax collector sex workers many of the poor and destitute so he's taken Jesus's Parable commentary on them and he's turning into a larger principal he's finding the significance I think so yes if I remember correctly this Parable is part of the lost three law 3 Los pericos correct a sheep plus a coin lost son these were all told
 in the context of was this it was a contacts yet religious leaders who I think the Jesus should be ashamed of himself was it when the woman comes to no no no no this is just how they see Jesus throw in Kingdom of God parties and they just coming for ya all these people who are changing their ways and following the way of Jesus Jesus Jesus has for this Parable is he wants them to understand that what he's doing is he's extending God's generous love and forgiveness of God and to those people does outcast in his immediate contacts the people who look like failed Israelites they are failures of keeping the car so much so how do you compare them to someone who squandered his inheritance in a foreign land and have nothing to show for it it's receiving defiled himself by like three little pigs
 everything in that character that's an ethos to the Jesus movement that continues right on through into the Jesus movement that the churches founded by the apostles and it should be a part of the ethos of Jesus movement there is nobody who's too far gone there's nobody who's to failed of a human but you just turned it into what's the significance for the Jesus turned into like a theological principal for the Jesus movement at large and but that surely would Jesus just trying to do with the story like the okay it's communicate a core ethic of the kingdom of God there's nobody who's to failed of a human being to receive God's mercy and finding a new start Jesus is through these characters explaining a core ethic of the kingdom of God it has a meaning for his context right then yes but then anyone who hears it even if they're in that context or Beyond can see that meaning
 MC the ongoing significance of it it's actually so intuitive that we forget that Jesus actually meant something by it in a historical context do we immediately go to the significance for me and all people of all time usually that's where we go first floor and in the prodigal son it's not that hard for the easiest ones to go to the same about the generous father yeah it's such a patent image of Jesus's description of the god of Israel generous indiscriminate an image of the the grumbling older brother who resents the set is actually such a universal image of having a sibling that you resent because your parents did something for such a universal
 I guess it depends on if you have a family and siblings but it's a pretty widespread phenomenon to have siblings and if they don't deserve the mercy or forgiveness that your parents give them two common human condition to think that other people don't deserve forgiveness more Universal Supply in siblings LOL I'm just saying that the actual narrative image of a sibling resenting their other sibling for something to parents do is pretty widespread experience and the way that van Berg says the older brother should not have begrudged his brothers restoration so those who claim association with God shouldn't Elevate themselves but those were supposedly and deserving of God's grace yeah that's exactly right The Prodigal Son there's a reason why it's one of the most famous parents so intuitive meaning
 message I notice what he's done his he's located each of the three characters so there are other things in the story and actually thinks that I think your significance a Jewish story teller, Jewish audience assumed a Jewish characters here he goes to out to the Gentiles he's at becomes a slave feeding pigs which is like the iconic animal that you should people do inviting line between kosher and non-kosher to announce you he returns home so I think there are echoes of the story of Israel here on the large-scale level. I wouldn't there for say the pigs symbolize the Gentile Nations right I think we're probably pressing it too far the pea pods or the carob pods or whatever that he longed to eat symbolize this or that or the ring with the father gives him yeah and blouses something specific yes so
 he said the Good Ship exegesis is flown by the seat of my pants and it took me so long to understand what I meant to say you're sailing a ship called Jesus is how you interpret which is a fancy word for interpretation it means to bring out how did you bring out meaning so the good ship exegesis is flown which is the sailing term look up for sailing to do now that we have plans yet you think it means flying cuz it's healing is always flying by the seat of our pants which I know he would smart and then we would like spend one hour parsing Oliver paragraph or something you know that which is not flying by the seat event has been very methodical yet is that there is a element of judgment call in all interpretation so what we're looking for is just using our best historically informed sensibilities and I think
 Bloomberg really helps us hear that landing on the main characters is a really reliable Guide to the main message that is meant by Jesus in the parable 3 character Pebbles yes there are three character Parables let's look at some two characters
often the two types of two character Parables for Jesus sometimes he'll contrast a good or positive character or object with the negative one so collector and a Pharisee go up to the temple to pray the tax collector says Lord have mercy I was always sound like a joke set up and she says oh God thank you that I'm not like that tax collector place just becomes really clear each of the characters in bodies a message or a character type that you do and don't want to be like for the contrasting ones you have a wise builder of the house on the rock foolish builder of the house on the sand house owner who locks up his house and if he knows there's a thief in the neighborhood he stays up and he's alert then you have the Steve who wants to break in and on the take from self I kind of thing but those are fairly intuitive the contrast is usually between people
 motives or behavior their values in the outcome so the difference between those type of 2 character Parables where you have to contrast and character is very similar to the three character Parables like a foolish son and then a big riding Sunday or you have a good service in the bad servant in the three character Parables you have an authority figure who evaluates you into character Parables The Listener is the evaluating you become the authority figure okay so it's like the balls in your court date which is wiser in this relates to another type of two character Parable which is often times there is an authority figure and a subordinate figure but often these are some of the most difficult Parables because once again you're trying to figure out and evaluate
 the authority figures that I owe you a session of the support that the one of The Parables you puzzle of over the most hits in its category does shrewd manager. Manager sure 3 character Parables yesterday figure someone under the authority of new people to people one that usually has good one that's bad that generally to character Parables there's two types of talking about one is there's no authority figure there's just two contrasting subordinates correct and then there's another type where there's actually an authority figure in just one subordinate so there's no support it to compare them to figure out and then see you're watching and you're paying attention to how the authority figure evaluates the subordinate and then you yourself are trying to evaluate the subordinate and there's an interesting interplay these are these are amazing Parables because it's the interplay authority figure in the parable and the the
 become different evaluators of the subordinate and sometimes it makes for fascinating terrible pain so Jesus said to his disciples there was a rich man who had a manager and charges were brought to him the manager that this man was wasting his possessions and he called him and said to him what is this that I hear about you turn in the account of your management for you can no longer be manager terminated the manager said to himself what am I going to do since my master is taking the management away from me I'm not strong enough to dig and I'm ashamed to beg I have decided what to do so that when I remove management people who receive me into the houses so he summoned his master's debtors one-by-one and he said to the first hey how much do you owe my master and the guy says 100 measures of oil and address as well
 take your bill sit down quickly right 50 and then he said to another how much do you owe that goes 100 measures of wheat he said to him take your Bill Wright 80 the master commended the dishonest manager for his shrewdness for the sons of this world are more shrewd and dealing with their own generation than the sons of Light and I tell you make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous well so that when it fails they may receive you into the Eternal dwellings quote one of his faithful and a very little is also faithful in much and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much if then you have not been faithful in the in the unrighteous Mammon
 who will entrust to you the true riches puzzle a great one immediately after the Lost coin the washi tape and The Prodigal Son the next sentence is and he also said to his disciples it's the next thing so if you're reading a Red Letter Bible the transition Luke 15 is almost all red letters and then you move right into the red letters of this teaching right here right after you finish reading Jesus has the famous line no servant can serve two masters evil either hate the one and love the other or be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon now the Pharisees loved money they were listening to Jesus talked about this and we're making fun of him stopping at him and so he said to them and then he goes on and they have another long day just another long song
 but said the point is is that this is a follow-up still addressing the Pharisees about the questionable company that he meets remember your 15 and then also the response to this is people thinking Jesus has a ridiculous view of money and unrealistic view of money they make fun of him so I just want to say that's the response to this Parable whatever Jesus is doing with this Parable we need to make sense of both the narrative contact right for adapter and what people take away from it which is to say this guy is crazy what a ridiculously of money this guy's has and his thing about two masters correct so we're doing on here just to honor the narrative context of apparel so whenever I come across a parable of Jesus and I scan up to see words with the last narrative moment and is that significant I scan down
 yeah is there a narrative after this that helps me understand and this case we get to get it on both right with sides and the one before is about we are talked about it the Pharisees Think Jesus is being too loose and has been generous to him and and offering God's forgiveness their way out there to outside and he tells the story of The Last Ship last coin in the parable of the lost son and then immediately he goes into this next Parable in which seems unrelated isn't related but he tells it to his disciples not to the Pharisees true however the Pharisees do over here they're listening then they respond it's like he tells me stories to the Pharisees or no back in chapter 15 the Pharisees were grumbling saying this man receives Sinners meets with them he told them this Parable or so he tells the three Parables to the Pharisees
 yeah and then he tells them a parable correct and this fourth Parable has two characters and authority figure the rich man and the subordinate the manager the rich man is firing the manager does the notice Jesus doesn't want us to think about the the reasons why Jesus is rushing everything to the moment of getting fired and the guys response the reason why was he was wasting his possessions wasting his possessions what why and how well we're not but it does set a contact for what he is also about to do wasting well yeah I mean I could mean so many things but Jesus doesn't Paralee doesn't want us to focus of your managing some as well then your expectation is your wealth will grow and if you asked like hey this manager I have less wealth that month and last month
 unless mother for ya something wrong as manager makes perfect sense he's not he's a good guy or bad guy this is a neutral character doing something sensible and we don't know if the manager is just like was being was doing it on purpose just had a bad run out of strength that's right of Market bats all that yeah those are the Jesus disciples we know a lot of them were made up of lower class so they would have a negative view of managers of people with a lot of wealth oh that's just the nature of the social situation rich landowners and managers are not popular to the majority of Craftsmen and day laborers in the for the Galilee in Jesus's time is the nature of an economic set up so the guy gets fired and then we get a window into
 is psyche psyche what am I going to do ya could polish up my resume so notice we're back to this team and authority figure Rings a moment of Reckoning that forces a crisis of decision on the character huge Motif in Jesus parables in that neighborhood crisis Parable parable about this guy had to make a decision I'm sometimes two or three categories again there was Parables about the nature of God's kingdom to surprising Rising nature of nature or arrival check of God's kingdom second is Parables about the value set upside down value system in Essex and the third is about a crisis that focus on the crisis of decision that God's kingdom forces on his real of his day and what you going to do about it and you think this is a third kind of, it's about a character whose authority figure forces him to make a decision because I've always read it in terms of Epic 1
 like so there's something about how I should behaving okay yeah I got it that's a great example of the assumption that we bring to hear the teachings are well either moral religious truths about God and me or their ethical truth about how I should live here oh so it's all confusing as a parable is your leg okay so this guy was dishonest and rewarded he was wasting okay so let's go on his master has these accounts and his last day on the job he just straight-up yeah he took the books he cooks the books and then three steps you owe less right how much do you owe a hundred you owe 80 now and when the master finds out what he's doing you would think the Masters going to get really angry I would expect the master to be last in the store yeah just like you Wicked yeah I can't believe it we're going to jail I'm suing you for all your worth your life is over
 so that's the twist in the story I mean the narrative says he was a dishonest manager what you just did was dishonest Jesus is perfectly clear but it's like a joke that has a Twist at the end but instead of getting taken to court the manager says I like how you're thinking here you're still fired
 but you're not here you're going to get ahead so I think it's because the master commends him at the end that's what leads us maybe to think all this is a parable praising certain kinds of behavior namely dishonesty of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of Light Jesus is using a very loaded apocalyptic symbolism pair of the the children of dark and the children of the light key in the people who are for the king of God of people are not people of the realm of chaos and death for people of the realm of Divine Light and New Creation notice at the end he says people have this of the darkness right people of this world are more shrewd and dealing with their own kind he's just telling you summarizing the story that you just told her the story is
 got someone who is is of the darkness being shrewd people who haven't been transformed by the kingdom of God behave but then he goes on to say you know there's something to be learned here this guy was forced with a moment of Reckoning and what did he do he valued relationships over money but his master's friends for yourself by means of unrighteous wealth so the Assumption here is that money is correct the god the word Mon Mon Mon Mon is it is a deity sorry I didn't look this up but I'm going to a second so Mama it comes from the root word in Hebrew or Aramaic the Semitic word I meant which means trustworthy trustworthy
 it becomes a word for money but that is what you put your trust The Trusted thing is what Mama on means and the workers and sayings of Jesus it's money personified as a spiritual power that stands in competition to God because it here at the Maman of unrighteousness that wealth Can a reading from the dictionary of demons and deities in the Bible by PW vanderhorst the uniquely Jewish term referring to wealth personified as a spiritual power of the principalities and powers and Paul Jesus views money as as superorganism yeah
okay I'm sorry I just want to register that point so in Gs is mine what's a voltimand value is people and relationships
 and money is an instrument in the service of a greater cause that's the basic point the manager was wise to realize that that he is in a position to manage this guy's money but only for like another moment in time yeah and so he realized what you really are the most valuable thing here is not the money it's the relationships and so and I only have one more day so am I going to do I'm going to focus on the relationships it's right in spite of the money correct. So in other words the character becomes for The Listener like a contrast character there's something praiseworthy about him and that's a little twist about the master at the end we praise him at the moment you expect him to take him to jail break that but the point isn't there for you go like cheat people out of money cheat some people out of money
 give it away and make good relationship you know Robin Hood steal from the Sheriff of Nottingham the sheriff he was stealing from but it needs a bad guy in no no no there was the King Louie I think was the main bad dude you're the lion in The Disney one Sheriff of Nottingham is the main antagonist in the lessons of Robin Hood Rich Tyrant the point isn't steal someone else's money so you can give it away the point simply is here is the character who didn't let money distract him from an even greater goal which is securing he has a crisis of decision so he secures his future by downgrading money to an instrument and then Jesus makes him into a contract character
 he says okay so that's what the people of this world the sons of this age since we give them to them but sometimes you don't allow money to distract you from what more altimate and so then I just kind of got all this money I think go there any is my power yeah that's what you don't realize actually true power comes to relationships right and it was a massive business Revelation to me all business was down a relationship that's the most important thing and you think you think that it's about your piano to like make money in the most important thing that you're still at the Effect 2 vocabulary
 trust and faith at the end so he says I tell you make friends of yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth does using the image of the parable money is an instrument and then it's clear Jesus actually doesn't have a very high view of the air with a lot of resources terrifying so that when it fails they may receive you into it internal dwellings phrase it slip that don't let money be something that keeps you from entering into the people of God's kingdom entering entering into the life and the people of God's kingdom worldly wealth to gain friends for yourself so when it's gone and it's Jesus view of wealth and Nuggets it's not I don't stick around and it will be fun but something more important that's being built yes yeah that's right and yes that thing is what you should use money for yes and that's and gaining friends
 connected to that thing yes okay so we think of Jesus as a teacher of just ethical Cruise in general this becomes Jesus about what to do or not to do with me if so stop by first principle this terrible fits into his larger proclamation of the arrival of God's kingdom that forces a crisis of decision upon you and what are you going to do what's the context Jesus is forming communities of new brothers and sisters of equals with him as there's a lot of them some of them are loaded like a women named and Luke chapter 8 financing the whole Galilee Mission the tax collectors and with the people they're coming around Jesus to live under God's Reign and Rule as Jesus defines it which is surprising and this Parable fits into that call
 so it is at the crisis Parable you are faced with a crisis when I'm faced with the invitation to the kingdom of God and this becomes this is a parable about how money gets downgraded and significance and importance and it should never dis it shouldn't prevent you from making God's Reign and rule the thing you really trust in and if anything you should view it as an instrument just like the sons of this world do the sons of this world know when to downgrade the importance of money when they get fired because when there's some greater value of yes at stake if they can figure it out and then Jesus says so you do the same thing because the greater thing of value of steak Yeah like it away Jesus is saying just like that shrewd manager just found out he lose his job I want you to feel like that you're about to lose all your money it's all going to be gone it's all gone yeah it's not going to be here in the long run you're finding out
 but you're getting fired from the job he thought you had which was protecting your wealth yeah that's right yeah that's exactly right. That's over now that you know that's over and what you going to do and even the boiler in Jesus specific context he's telling Israel his disciples and his disciples Israel everything we see around us to Temple down in Jerusalem these tax-collecting really nice synagogues that people might give to because they've profited off of you know all of this debt slavery going on here all going down that's his announcement that God's going to allow them to destroy this place yeah if Israel doesn't accept my offer of the Kingdom That's The Crisis crisis does Parables about that crisis don't let money prevent you from accepting the kingdom of God
 what is the term Eternal dwellings what's the significance of the Eternal Tabernacle New Jerusalem have never quite focused on that before in that way but it's the same thing with like in The Sermon on the Mount the city on the hill is the Isaiah to image the light in the city on he'll hear it's the Eternal Tabernacle arriving here on Earth for him to say you're going to be welcomed into this Kingdom by the friend you were generous to that's not how salvation Works my mind I hear that you're welcomed in because of the way you dealt with your friends and how you use your well yeah but again in the context of what he's doing he's a traveling band with these little
 king of Asgard parties in every town so how are you going to respond to my offer to the kingdom in this ragtag group that's forming around man that I leave behind and every town if you can look at it and your normal through your normal Greco-Roman lens of honor and shame and status and power and be like these losers listen I'm building well I'm building I have true power I'm trying to get up the pyramid in my culture and there's no way I'm going to give up everything that I've built in that is trustworthy to go follow Jesus and do that so it's attacking wealth as one of the many things that keeps people from accepting the upside down
 surprising offer of the kingdom and it is about trust this was noted by Kenneth Bailey great set of studies on The Parables and Loop in a book called The Poet and the peasant but you notice if you were to Retro translate this Parable from Greek which it's in back into Aramaic with Scholars do this all of these word place on the word amend trustor trustworthiness in this so one who is faithful so one who is our men in very little is also I'm in in much one who is not faithful not trustworthy is also not trustworthy if you haven't been our men with unrighteous mom mon who will trust you you're yummy and Ken the true mbuna riches like every line in this is lit up with work
 trust me so this is about a crisis of decision the kingdom of God forces upon you a crisis of deciding what you're going to trust in for your destiny in Jesus wise because of the sipos and he says you guys are like that manager in that what you thought you were protecting and managing is going away and you're being called to something new he has his crisis moment of your Allegiance changing the manager was fired you are but you're being called to something great yeah that's right and so now what do you do with the wealth that you have access to it needs to serve a greater purpose as we go and proclaim the kingdom of God and travel around in two cities
 and the Pharisees who are listening over here this and they're just kind of like that's that's a dumb like he has doesn't understand money I don't understand how the world works yeah and I kind of cute and nice yeah that's right that's the point isn't to commend the dishonesty of the manager at such an illustration the point is that he's making a value decision based on a, a moment of crisis has forced on him he's going to lose everything
tell us about significance what's the significance for you yeah okay well one is this in terms of the master or the rich man character the authority figure is bringing a moment of Reckoning this Motif and all and many of Jesus Parables so that fits into the larger pattern the kingdom of God forces a moment of ultimate decision in the present leading up to the ultimate decision and Reckoning at the culmination of History whenever that's going to be but that combination history has lots of Forte's like what he was offering to Jerusalem in that moment in the leaders of Israel so I think we can pretty easily extrapolate that out as the good news about King Jesus travels around the world and whether or not people are going to live this part of his kingdom it forces a crisis of decision what am I going to do in this moment about Jesus I think that's essentially what that
 firing you a moment in the parable that's a significance that it takes forces me with a decision what am I going to do
 yeah it's not it's funny it's like do you realize you've been fired and my money's worthless no money you don't understand like we've got a whole got a whole thing going on here and you or you're just traveling around just homeless guy hanging out with with poor poor people and hanging out with a questionable questionable people and you think you understand how money works and how it works you don't realize you saying you don't have to realize you you've been fired and the shrewd manager would take this moment of Crisis to get a house in one that's right cuz the parable gives you like he finds out he's going to be fired and then he has a window everyone this is the window of response so they have the equivalent is that
 am I going to trust think of all the time and weird place and I going to trust that Jesus is more right than all of the economic political social structures around me and that all of this is transient and is headed for some moment of Reckoning even if it's not within my lifetime it's a matter of trust that God will hold all of it accountable and I need to make a decision in this window of time that I have about what I'm going to do so then the question is what are you going to do then that's where the character of the steward comes into play so I think the the significance their manager the manager yep with a steward the other manager if I'm going to prepare for that moment of Reckoning I should be extremely wise and even shrewd with how he's money how I use the things that I trust him which is usually use a fidget running
 you can trust us that's rice and security of All Sorts so go be dishonest with money that's not the point though be shrewd the point is yeah he becomes like a negative image and inverse image go be screwed if you flip the image and this is what I've done before tell me if it's going to far you flip the image and now it's not a rich man in a manager it's King Jesus and a disciple and King Jesus isn't firing at siple he's basically like promoting him yeah just saying like you you're you got a new job and your job is to take my wealth and just be generous with it it's right for your own personal trust rights it sang this isn't mine your goal is I don't have your chords to give it away and make friends with my wife yeah that's kind of similar to there's another pair of a cup
 chapters later and it says Jesus was you no telling his disciples how they should pray and then he says there was this unjust judge just the bad guy but this woman keeps coming to him over and over saying give me Justice give me my Vindication and he wouldn't listen and she comes back again the next day he wouldn't listen she comes back again the next day and finally he brings her stuff yeah that's the parable about how they should pray the point isn't oh God is like an unjust judge and I have to bother him it's using negative characters to make up a how much more example of how much more so is that it's an unjust judge will respond to constant bleeding that much more how much more will the generous father who is Joss Castle is very similar is the sons of this age cheat each other but they still understand that money is an instrument not a God how much more should the sons of Light understand that
 he is an instrument and not treated as it got us the logic of it here in which case you're a little alternate parable of Jesus parable is I think this is totally right because of how much more yes okay so God isn't he's not liking in God to a rich man and his disciples to people who cheat just got fired people and yeah it's a how much more how much more than we have five God whose issue a notice on all of the things that we trust in what's the saying of Jesus is it a parable where he literally says how much more of a field in this way how much more does he care for you
okay let's summarize where we are at the guideposts first pay attention to the narrative context given by the gospel authors and we talked about that last at which is the context of Jesus now passing the kingdom to Israel in the first century this is the meaning of the parable next step is I want to understand the significance of the parable beyond that original context how it speaks to audiences and readers of the gospel and that I think a very helpful guide is kind of condensed into the principal given by Craig blomberg folks on the characters on the main characters each main character in bodies bendable main point of principle of The Parables and there's the illustration of Jesus and just some teacher talk about abstract ideas into put the abstract ideas like in the cloud above him yeah and the parables are helping you understand those ideas actually his parables are explaining what he's up to and then that whole thing becomes down that surrounds him the meaning
 him telling a parable that's given commentary think if you have a hole in their to seeing you and then the parables in the world and what's happening on the ground on the ground in the Racine I look at the main characters of the parable how they connect to the characters in the actual narratively just tells it and that whole package then becomes a guide for how its significant to me and then his principles that you can then each means of the parable and his principles can be a party which is this is Jess basic Bible study method As You observe interpret the meaning and then you can then apply it to yourself in the value of this principle of each main character in bodies of principle or message is really to help us from getting distracted from other to 10 Bible Code allegory where it's just kind of
 however you did say that you use for the character object which would mean now it's like it that's a slippery slope so really I feel like I'm sorry I'm parsing indispensable objects yeah the principal isn't just about characters it's is this element of the story indispensable indispensable that's right about how he's focusing on characters because it seems like that is where the juice is totally that's right but then I guess the question becomes one doesn't object become a character Julie obviously human and I think it's indispensable to the plot to take the leaven out of the parabola you just have a woman and bred right you don't have the parable anymore if you take the donkey out of the parable of the Good Samaritan you don't skip a beat when is it if you can't take it out without the plot being changed does that mean it's a character or does that just mean it's indispensable
 an indispensable plot element but the plot elements or characters are the vehicles of the story principal and the principal that we need to focus on the characters or the principal more General its focus on indispensable elements of the story typically characters but yeah sometimes objects I'm changing my nuts right now and when an object becomes like a character and an object often becomes like a character especially when it's 11 Alex has a motive has a med and has a agency in action in the story infiltrate the doctor Wednesday yeah it just carries a guy but he could have been carried on a horse at 4 on the guys back yes it's right here does it have does it have a desire
 does it have a agency and so once you've made that step then are the last I'm on the way to the last page of the notes I think we owe it to Jesus to brainstorm sit down and once you got the basic plot Arc of the parable you see what he meant by it in the narrative context you could discern its significance, the basic messages are principles involved by the character is Jesus memory at some point this conversation you try to imagine Jesus going to sleep one night thinking of these things ain't nothing but again when your time out to character parallel circuit to propose I wonder if Jesus had that kind of nomenclatures like we'll have a good news 3 character Parable I'm working on it and he's so he went to bed some nights thinking of like I'm going into bethsaida tomorrow there's two life synagogue leaders and hate me
 Scholars really thinks I'm a heretic and he's thinking right but then there's that blind man and I'm just I'm going to pray that God's kingdom will heal him tomorrow and Jesus had thought you went to bed thinking about his mission what he was doing and what he would do tomorrow and yes so he paid attention to his context and he adapted his stories
 and The Parables to you know give these subversive cryptic Kingdom riddles it seems to me that we owe it to him to give us much attention to how we translate them into our on cultural context which means I think adaptation you can watch Jesus adapting parables in the gospel for write a version of it and Matthew in a version of Luke will be a little bit little bit different and so if you get the main idea I think it should not Inspire new creative adaptations of The Parables and around and around settings hero because if your pastor. Pastor your leader of the small group whatever you know you have your own context and the people that are unique from what Jesus faced in becida but those basic ideas could be remade into a new modern day
 Pastor for many years so I lived in the world of sermon illustrations text I would be like here's the main ideas that work I would boil it down into a principal for him and I'd force myself to write out each point in the main sentence and then I would just Ponder those main principles and look and recall life experiences the fit that profile and then that's how it came up with sermon illustrations and it seems to me that something about Jesus came up with there's a scholar Tom Right Auntie right is actually really well known for building in Parables and do his academic writing which is what makes it so fun to read cuz most Scholars don't write like that it is that's right he had a parable about a donor a wealthy donor to a like a local University who gave a big piece of art like a huge statue
 and you know there's some gifts that you could give to University and they would hang it on the wall of an existing building but that there are some things given by a donor that is so big it's its own thing and so they have to go like some land for it but I have to get some land for it and like maybe in the scent at the little park theater driversity they have to like you know if the ribs or something new and put it on a pedestal and it was a little parable about how Jesus is message was given to Israel of his day but it didn't leave Israel as it existed and forced it to accommodate this new thing that couldn't be accommodated into their existing system for giving someone a puppy
 congratulations your life has changed so but then I was four years later I can remember these little parable of the NT Wright cups into the different academic books and that's the power is still telling them two thousand years later and so I think the last step of truly getting the significance of The Parables is adapting them into new Parables for our own day and you think of good examples I feel like they're you've told me about when you were in your twenties and kind of building out your Christian worldview there were a couple like teachers that you really admired terrible there was this yeah there's this guy Peter Hyatt who I think he's still teaches I was Presbyterian preacher and he I was turned on to him by a professor of mine, cuz we were going through
 a class on educational theory and developmental educational theory and how how do you communicate truth to someone away that she changes them and how that's really hard to do while you're preaching to let you know any good pictures to do that well and he said yes Guy Peter his sermons turn into these like masterful like extended almost Parables and sometimes I listen to one and I'm just like that was confusing I don't think I get it and other times you listening I'm confusing fused in the drops in your eyes I see what he's doing here I guess he's also really good for me to get taken care of Pop Culture stuff or like 90 pop culture of his culture and showing the connections I bet that's what it was like to hear Jesus but sometimes I get it and when I do get it it lands heavy yeah and then packing in little Clues and connections to help me understand the moment that I'm in
 but what it was like totally to listen to what is fun like I you know I grew up in church and a very prostitute tradition where someone gets up and teaches our 45 minutes and offloads a bunch of information to you and you're supposed to upload it and and I don't know how many hours of sermons I've heard in my life I bet I could probably figure it out what I'm in the amount I remember so small so small and I think that I would rather have half the time you just be confused and the other half the time she really impacted then all the time being like 5 following but then it just goes away that's funny my first Mentor I had teaching me how to reach the kind of Chris Dawson is the pastor in Madison Wisconsin use a really amazing communicator and something he drilled into me in the years when
 the mentoring me was people are going to forget almost everything you said you would just constantly remind me you have to build your sermon in the light of the fact that people will forget almost everything you say and so it is mine sermons are really just try and communicate one idea if you have three ideas break it into the 31 idea and just work it work it with the story we're good with image we're gets with a mixture of grounded in the biblical texts many things you can circle around that one thing and I'm really grateful for that cuz I think that's true for how you do that really actually in a more Publix bad of an idea talk to one main idea and it doesn't have to be more than 10 or 20 minutes which you know you got to feel some time and it's your service so maybe
 PV pets, but man that's the hardest thing is keeping it short it's right and take about the parables are so short but I'm in 30 seconds and you imagine you go to church you're all like you got all dressed up you're singing this song the preacher gets up and he just 45 seconds tell the story and then he's back down then right you're taking communion yeah yeah thank you for listening to this episode of Power project podcast that's it for a conversation on how to read The Parables and if you're new to the show and you want to look back at our back catalogue couple things I'd recommend we have a episode on the word soul in the Bible the series on the Holy Spirit
