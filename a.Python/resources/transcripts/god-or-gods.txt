[Start of transcription 00:00:00]
Tim: Most people when they hear the word God, don't think of the storyline
of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Jon: Hey, this is Jon at The Bible project, and today on the podcast, we're
beginning a conversation about God. Who is the God of the Bible?
That's what we're going to talk about for the next season on this
podcast. And it's going to be an incredible journey. But before we get
too deep into the story of the Bible, and what it means to experience
the God of the Bible, we need to stop and come to grips with the fact
that—
Tim: The word 'God' in English is a terribly confusing, unclear word. 
Jon: The word 'God' is a confusing word because God is not a name. 'God'
is a title. It's a generic way to talk about any spiritual being. 
Tim: So the problem is that when we use the capital word letter G, we're
using a title to refer to a specific deity or spirit being that has a specific
story and attributes, namely the Jewish and Christian God.
Jon: But Judeo Christian belief is that there's only one true Creator, God of
the universe. 
Tim: There  is  one  chief  Supreme  God,  the  God  of  Israel  revealed  to
Abraham, Christians believe revealed in Jesus who has no rivals, but He
is the King of kings and Lord of lords, and God of gods.
Jon: God of gods. That makes it sound like the Bible talks about there being
more than one God. But that can't be true, right? There's only one God.
That's what Christians believe. That's what monotheism means. 
Tim: I'm  so  fascinated  with…how  did  this  happen?  How  did  a  modern
definition of monotheism come to be what Christians believe when it's
not, in fact, at all how the Bible talks about the identity of God? 
Jon: Yeah. If you're like me, this just made you really uncomfortable. But
hold on there, we're going to talk it through, and what we'll find is that
all the confusion has to do with what we mean when we use the word
God. Thanks for joining us. Here we go.
Tim: You know, I have all this stuff in my head right now. God or gods?
Jon: You've been working on this for the last five weeks, four weeks?
Tim: Yeah. I'm just thinking this is like classic moment where I have all this
stuff I want you to own. My goal is to get you to own all of this. 
Jon: I love that goal. We need some telepathy cord.
Tim: I know!
Jon: Some brain direct link. 
Tim: But instead, I have to articulate...
Jon: You have to put it into language.
Tim: ...every one of these ideas. 
Jon: And then I've got to listen to those words and unpack them in my own
psyche. 
Tim: So that what's inside of my head can be inside of yours. And that's
crazy. 
Jon: Yeah, language. Information theory is interesting that our brains aren't
computers in the sense that they're very different than how computers
work, but our brains process information. The theory of information
processing is the same. And so like when information is in the form of,
let's  say,  sound  waves  coming  out  of  our  mouth  versus  digital
information going through a cord, versus maybe analog information
on a tape, versus neurons fighting in your brain, it's all the same thing,
just in different formats.
Tim: Different modes.
Jon: Different mediums. 
Tim: Wow.
Jon: It's crazy.
Tim: It is.
Jon: We're going to talk about God. God or gods?
Tim: We're setting up a conversation to begin the process for a theme video
for The Bible Project that we're going to call "God." 
Jon: Yeah,  the  theme  of  God,  which  it's  not  really  a  theme.  God  as  a
character. And we don't have any other theme videos on characters. 
Tim: No, we don't. No. But the way we're going to be talking about the
unfolding of God's identity, it fits the category of theme, in terms of it's
a set of words, and vocabulary, and ideas that are introduced on page
one, they undergo development throughout the narrative ark of the
Bible. The story of Jesus is a climactic new unfolding...
Jon: Who God is. 
Tim: ...identity of God that's in continuity with what came before, but also
takes some significant leaps forward. And then, it all comes to closure
on the last page. So it's true, it qualifies as a biblical theme. 
Jon: It comes to closer.
Tim: Yes, yeah, in as much as you can never bring history to a closure. But
this is an important topic. We could call this video "The Trinity."
Jon: Which a lot of people want us to do videos on the Trinity.  
Tim: Which a lot of people want. And it's about that, but how we're going
end up with the Trinity isn't going to be by starting with it. 
[00:05:04] 
Tim: Like all our theme videos, the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus.
And so the identity of God, God's nature, and identity, undergoes a
narrative development through the sequence of the storyline. And I
think  there's  real  value  in  pausing  to  let  the  story  unfold  God's
character in its own way, in its own order. Yeah, there you go. 
So it's actually going to conclude with the Three in One God: The
Father, Son, and Spirit, but I think starting there won't help people
grasp the significance of the Trinity. 
Jon: Okay. So we're not going to assume the Trinity when we start?
Tim: We're just going to let the story tell itself. God or gods?
Jon: Okay. 
Tim: Yeah, so we'll talk about that more as we go on. But that's the video,
"God." And I thought about calling it "God's Identity," and then Jon
talked me down off that one. 
Jon: Me?
Tim: Yeah. “The Identity of God” or “God's Identity.”
Jon: I don't remember. 
Tim: Well, I just think we go for more basic vocabulary. 
Jon: Oh, yeah. Just God. This video is about God. 
Tim:  Yeah, just God. It's what it's about, it's about God. It's about a whole
bunch of really specific things about God, but it's about God. So let's
just call it that. 
Jon: I think that's great because it's a word we use all the time that we take
much of it for granted. And from the little hints I've been getting from
you is that it's a lot more interesting, and it will be a lot of unexpected
things as we peel back this onion layers. 
Tim: Yeah. This whole topic of God's Identity of the one God, the one true
God of Israel, this concept of monotheism, the existence of other gods,
how those relate to the one God, and then...Yeah. So the rabbit hole
goes quite deep. 
And I've been interested in it for a long time. Actually, it was through
my years in local church ministry that I've kind of the conviction that
this is a really important topic for followers of Jesus to process through
so we can speak intelligently to our culture about this. So that's actually
where I think it'll be most useful for you and I to begin talking, which is
I call them "Three Problems with God Talk in the Modern West."
Jon: Okay.
Tim: So this isn't about the video as such, but for me, I wanted to ask myself,
like, "What am I hoping this video accomplishes or what's the problem
that I think this video could help?" So three problems when the word
God comes up in the English language, at least. God or gods?
And I know we have supporters all around the world, many of whom
don't speak English as a first language, so forgive us that we're going
to talk about the English language and the problems with the English
word God. But that's our context. And so that's where we live.
Jon: I got to imagine it's pretty similar in most cultures.
Tim: I don't know. I mean, these words in different languages of deity come
from really different origins, especially if it's different hemisphere or the
east to the west. 
Let's start with the first problem. The word "God" in English is terribly
confusing unclear word in modern English.
Jon: Really? It's clear. God. Short and sweet. Dude in the sky. 
Tim: Okay, all right. 
Jon: What's  confusing  about  that?  I  mean,  my  six-year-old  gets  it.  No,
seriously. He's like...
Tim: What does it mean for Paxton? 
Jon: I haven't purposefully sat him down and tried to explain God to him,
but through church, just other conversations, whatever, he just gets it.
He's like, "God created things." It was funny, the other day, he pointed
to a fork and he said, "What is that made out of?" And I said, "Well, it's
made out of metal." He didn't know what a metal was and he was
confused. He goes, "No, no, like, what's it made out of?" And I said,
"Metal." He goes, "No, no, no. What did God make that we turned it
into that fork?"
[00:10:00]
Tim: Oh.
Jon: Yeah. He wanted like the base material. 
Tim: He's thinking of like—
Jon: And so I did tell him metal it's a kind of rock, I think, I don't know, and
that's what God made. Actually, a sun made it...
Tim: Yeah, that's right.God or gods?
Jon: ...but God made the sun.
Tim: It's like exploded star, then the dust. 
Jon: So I mean, he gets it. He gets that. I don't know exactly what's in his
head but it's not that confusing to him. 
Tim: That's a good example. So likely he has a personal being. You think a
personal  being  with  will  and intention  in his  imagination  when he
thinks of the word 'God'? A personal being? When he says, "What did
God make that we made it out of" what does that word refer to? 
Jon: I'm assuming he's thinking... 
Tim: A personal being.
Jon: ...of a personal thing. 
Tim: Who like has power to generate a universe where there's metal? 
Jon: Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't remember being six, but I guess you
just kind of have to look around and assume like, "Well, this house is
here because someone's made it."
Tim: That's right. Okay, yeah.
Jon: "I saw my dad make my bed and that's why that's here. So why is the
trees here? Someone must have made it." 
Tim: Yeah, that's right. But to then conclude a singular personal being is
therefore responsible of that. 
Jon: He got that from the culture that we're in. 
Tim: Exactly. Right. So you're socialized into that kind of idea. Because you
could  grow  up  in  a  different  culture  where  the  material  trees  are
themselves an aspect of the divine. Right? Or there are many gods, not
just one. There's all kinds of gods.
Jon: Or there's no God.
Tim: Or there's no God. So you could  use the word 'god'  or 'gods'  to
actually refer to a lot of really different kinds of beings. So the EnglishGod or gods?
word 'God' can describe many different kinds of deities that could
have, whatever, created to be responsible for the universe.
Jon: Right. 
Tim: So there's part of what do I mean when I say, "It's not a very helpful
word." 
Jon: Got it? 
Tim: Because it's ambiguous. And part of that is because the English word is
a title. It's not a name. 'God' isn't any beings name. It's a title for a kind
of being.
Jon: Right. Like angel or... 
Tim: Spirit, human.
Jon: Or human. 
Tim: It's a category. 
Jon: It's a category. 
Tim: In English 'God' is a category of being. But you're right, it does get
filled out with typical  content in the modern Western culture. You
named a couple at the beginning, like the something big guy. Some
big guy upstairs.  
Jon: Oh, yeah. 
Tim: Or what did you say?
Jon: I don't know. Dude in the sky. I don't know. 
Tim: The big guy upstairs, right?
Jon: Yeah, maybe. You just say the word 'God' in a room of 50 people, and
the same thing is not going to come into everyone's mind. 
Jon: 50 people on the same church, or 50 people scattered across the city. 
Tim: Yeah, you're on the bus... 
Jon: You're on a bus. God or gods?
Tim: ...and you say, "I believe in God." And you think you're being bold and
standing,  whatever,  trying  to  represent  your  faith.  But  what  that
overlooks is the word 'God' enters...the sound waves, enter 50 people's
ears on the bus...
Jon: And conjures up different categories. 
Tim: Very,  very  different  portraits  because  of  their  family  history,  their
religious or non-religious experience, right? So 'God' is a title that can
refer to many different kinds of beings. One thing they would have in
common is that they are likely all invisible and powerful. Probably more
powerful than human. 
Jon: Not the Greek gods. I mean they are more powerful, but they're not
invisible. 
Tim: Oh, that's true. That's true. Yeah, yeah. If you were in ancient Greece,
you might spot—
Jon: You might run into one.
Tim: Yeah, you might run into one. So that's the first problem about God
talk is that it's a title that can refer to many different kinds of beings
from many different religious traditions. It's the first thing.
The second thing is, if a singular All-powerful Creator, Ruler type of
being is what comes into somebody's mind, that's fascinating, because
certainly isn’t' where all humans have believed about deities or a deity
for all of history. That idea of a personal being, who's the Creator and
Ruler of everything has a history, intellectual history.
Jon: By the way, are you using deity and God interchangeably? 
Tim: Yes.
Jon: Okay. I just want to be clear.
Tim: I am, yeah. Because that itself it's a legacy that comes from the Jewish
monotheistic  tradition  that's  been  passed  on  to  the  modern  West
largely through its daughter, its religious daughter, Christianity. But
there's  actually  quite  a  lot  of  confusion  about  that.  So  that  word
‘monotheism’—God or gods?
[00:15:13]
Jon: There's confusion about what?
Tim: Okay.  There's  one  God.  Many  people  think  Jewish  people  believe
there's one God. What do Christians believe? There's one God. 
Jon: Right.
Tim: What's the title given to that, believe it's a monotheistic religion. The
confusion is that—
Jon: And during a time where there wasn't other monotheistic religions? 
Tim: Yeah, monotheism, like really passionate monotheism is the legacy of
the Jewish and Christian tradition in the history of [inaudible 00:15:43].
Jon: Everyone else is really fine and just assumes there's many gods.
Tim: Yeah. Most religions, for most of human history, have been in some
form of polytheism, many different gods, or pantheism.
Jon: Everything is God.
Tim: Everything is God or some version in between. There are actually a
handful  of  other  monotheistic  religions  that  have  popped  up
throughout history, but nothing like the Jewish Christian tradition. It's
unique. And the fact that a singular 'All-powerful, Creator, Ruler being'
is what probably comes in to most Westerners minds when they hear
the word God that shows you the influence of these particular religions
in  our  history.  Because  that's  not  what  most  humans  for  most  of
human history have believed. 
Here's what's fascinating. You can go look up at Dictionary.com, Oxford
English Dictionary, if you look up the term "monotheism" it gives you a
definition that doesn't actually correspond to what Jews and Christians
have believed about God for most of their history. So here's the English
– this is from Dictionary.com. So the English definition of monotheism:
“the belief that there is only one God,” that's the short definition. “The
belief that there is only one God.“ And that seems intuitive. "Mono..."
Jon: One. God or gods?
Tim: "Theism"... 
Jon: God.
Tim: One God. The implication being, therefore, there are no other beings
that  can  be  described  or  identified  by  the  noun  'God'  or  'gods'.
Monotheism: There is only one God, which means there are no other
gods. 
Jon: And you asked a bus full of Christians, they would say, "Yes, that's
true."
Tim: There is only one God.
Jon: Including me. This is what we learn. This is what we're taught. Right?
Tim: Yeah. 
Jon: Is that what you learned when you started following Jesus?
Tim: Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, there's only one God. 
Jon: There's only one God. 
Tim: I'm going to force you to do, if you really stop and think that through,
if you're a follower of Jesus, and you've read the Bible at any link, you
don't actually believe that...
Jon: All right. 
Tim: So anyway, we're going to talk about it. We're going to talk about it.
Jon: Okay.
Tim: So the modern English definition of "monotheism" that there is only
one being who can be described with the noun God. 
Jon: One deity.
Tim: Yeah. So there you go. I'll just give you the bottom line. If you look at
the belief about the God of the Bible that you could use to describe
monotheism, it would not fit that description. What it fits, if you just
read  both  Old  and  New  Testaments  is  that  it's  a  devotion  and
allegiance to the particular God who revealed himself to Abraham, andGod or gods?
Israel,  and  ultimately  in Jesus,  and  the  belief  that that God  is the
Supreme God, Creator and Ruler of all among all other gods who
might claim your allegiance.
Jon: That's not what the Bible says. What's interesting is, there are verses in
the Bible that make you go, "Wait, did they believe there was other
gods?" And then usually you go, "Well, no, it's just that's the culture."
So it's just kind of like...
Tim: Yeah. We'll talk about that. 
Jon: But for me, and I guarantee almost every Christian, Protestant, Catholic,
they would listen to you say that and go that is BS. Like there's not
many gods in which the God of the Bible is the Supreme God. That
sounds like a cult.
Tim: It sounds like the Bible. 
Jon: It sounds like the Bible?
Tim: It sounds like you've been reading your Bible, not even that closely.
Like just read it on its face value meaning and you walk away with
what,  you  know,  Bible  nerds  of  different  stripes  call  biblical
monotheism or ancient Jewish monotheism. Which had room for a
populated spiritual universe among which they believed there is one
chief Supreme God, the God of Israel revealed to Abraham, Christians
believe revealed in Jesus, who has no rivals. But He is the King of kings,
and Lord of lords, and God of gods.
[00:20:21]
Jon: God of gods?
Tim: Yeah. 
Jon: Is that in the Bible? 
Tim: It is. So there you go. That's confusing. You're making my point. 
Jon: I feel like you're teaching me a different religion. 
Tim: You're making my point for me that not only is the English word 'God'
unclear in English, the concept of monotheism, now I'm so fascinatedGod or gods?
with,  how  did  this  happen?  How  did  a  modern  definition  of
monotheism come to be what Christians believe when it's not, in fact,
at all how the Bible talks about identity of God?
Jon: Okay. 
Tim: So anyway, we'll talk about it.
Jon: Yeah, one step at a time.
Tim: One step at a time. That's the first two. Here's the third one. Then, once
you have those two confusions—
Jon: The first one being the God is not a name, it's a title and it can be
ambiguous what you're referring.
Tim: Yeah. You can refer to many different types of beings. 
Jon: And in human history, if you took a human out of any time in human
history, likely they thought of a very different than a monotheistic God.
And the second one being the way we think about monotheism is not
the way the Bible thinks about monotheism. 
Tim: Correct, yeah. So you combine those two, and then try and talk to
somebody in the modern West about how Jesus is God, and you have
a  situation  ripe  for  total  miscommunication.  Not  even  just
miscommunication. I think to say, "Jesus is God" with that kind of
confusion in the air is actually irresponsible. Because to say, "Jesus is
God" it means you're leading up to the other person's imagination
what that says about Jesus, right? 
If God is unclear, and can conjure up the big guy upstairs, who's going
to let you into the pearly gates if you've been naughty or nice or
something, that's what comes in many people's minds. Then to say,
"Jesus is God" is a total misrepresentation of Jesus. Because they're
equating Jesus with the big guy upstairs who's going to let you into the
pearly gates based on whether you've been naughty or nice. Are you
with  me?  I'm  just  saying,  as  an  act  of  communication,  you're  not
helping somebody at all. 
Jon: Does the Bible say Jesus is God? God or gods?
Tim: It does in very Jewish categories. But it doesn't do it in the way I just
did it. 
Jon: People are turning off the podcast and starting to listen to something
more Christian.
Tim: The Bible is making the claim that Jesus is the embodiment of the
particular God whose story is told in the Old and New Testaments. 
Jon: The embodiment.
Tim: The, the human incarnation - embodiment.
Jon: Why can't that be synonymous, saying, "Jesus is God and Jesus is the
embodiment of God."
Tim: Because most people when they hear the word 'God', don't think of the
storyline of the Hebrew Scriptures.
Jon: So if you're saying Jesus is this picture you have of a dude up in
heaven, then that's confusing people. But if you just say "Jesus is God,"
and someone doesn't have a formed view of what God is, then—
Tim: Then hopefully, the question is, "What God? Jesus is what God?"
Jon: Or what do you mean by “Jesus is God”?
Tim: Ah, yes. In that case, you've then deal. Then you can sit down have a
conversation. The point is, there's nobody comes with a clean blank
slate when they hear the word 'God'. We have a preloaded set of ideas
and stories about God. And then we take Jesus and fit those into that
container. 
What I'm saying is the way the biblical narrative works, it's precisely the
opposite. The whole story, three-quarters of the Bible is giving you a
very detailed portrait of the character, and nature, and purpose of the
God of Israel. And then the story of Jesus comes along and says, "Jesus
is the human incarnation of that particular God, the God of Israel." 
And that's very different because I can't assume that...Actually, I always
assume that no one has the story of the Old Testament in their heads.
It's a pretty safe assumption. God or gods?
[00:25:07] 
Jon: It's a long confusing story.
Tim: Totally. Which is why my notes are 32 pages long for this topic. Do you
see? That's the problem.
Jon: Totally. We like to just pass out New Testaments and just say, "Read
about Jesus." 
Tim: And I get that. I mean, Jesus is awesome. Personally, it was hearing
stories about Jesus all through my mid to late teens that began to
challenge my concept of God. I had a concept of God. 
Growing up in Portland you're in whatever late Western culture, and
then it was actually the stories about Jesus that begin to challenge my
definitions of God. And so the stories of Jesus began to remake what
that word referred to in my imagination. And then, once I started to
read the Bible, then it continued. 
So I want to start with the word 'God; in Hebrew, because first of all, it's
awesome. It works differently than our word 'God' doesn't English. 
Jon: Yeah, teach me that. 
Tim: So this is familiar. This is how we've done many of these theme videos.
We began with our English word about Spirit or whatever covenant or
holiness, and then we learn the biblical word, and then that invites us
into a whole different way of thinking about things. 
Jon: Okay.
Tim: So the English word 'God' we've already talked about it. Interesting. If
you spell 'God' with a capital G - this is Oxford English Dictionary - if
you spell 'God' with a capital G, you are referring to the God of the
monotheistic  religions,  who  is  a  singular  being  Creator  and  Ruler,
source of all moral authority, supreme.
However, if you spell 'God' with a lowercase g, you could be referring
to a god from any other religion in the history of human religions,
which is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a super human
being, or a spirit worshiped as having power over nature or human
fortunes - a deity.God or gods?
So the problem is that when we use the capital word letter G, we're
using a title to refer to a specific deity or spirit being that has a specific
story and attributes, namely the Jewish and Christian God. Are you with
me? When I spell 'God' with a capital G, the Oxford English Dictionary
says I'm referring to the Jewish Christian God.
I'm using the title. I'm using an ambiguous title but I gave it a capital G,
and now I'm referring to...
Jon: To the Jewish Christian.
Tim: ...to one particular God. 
Jon: Yeah, that's how we use the word.
Tim:  That's how we use the word ‘God’. That is not at all how the word God
works in Hebrew. This is the culprit of 75% the miscommunication
about the word 'God'. So you probably know the word 'God' although
you're looking down now, but you probably knew it beforehand.
Jon: Yeah, Elohim.
Tim: Elohim. So the first sentence of the Bible. "In the beginning, Elohim
created the sky and the land." So even right here in the first sense of
the Bible, in Hebrew, it's also a title and it means essentially what
lowercase g does. 
Jon: So it's like, “In the beginning, a god created the heavens and the
earth”?
Tim: That's the question. 
Jon: Because like if it's a title like human, it would be "In the beginning,
human created the heavens and the earth." 
Tim: Yeah. And these are both are translation debate because oftentimes
the biblical authors will put the word “the” in front of the word Elohim
to specify that we're talking about "the God of Israel."
Jon: Who will put the word "the"? 
Tim: Biblical authors. In other words, it's very common for biblical authors to
refer to God...God or gods?
Jon: Oh, put the Hebrew 'the'.
Tim: That put the Hebrew words 'the' so word 'ha'. So "Ha Elohim," "The
God."
Jon: So it'd be like, "The human." 
Tim: Yes, the human. "The human named Jon, walked into the room." 
Jon: But if you're telling a story about me, and you were telling it to a bunch
of ants about this guy, and you're telling these ants "The human, he's
coming to kill us all and destroy our anthill." And you're like. "What
human?" "The human." 
Tim: The human.  Yeah, yeah. So interestingly, that's not how Genesis 1
begins. Genesis 1 uses unspecific title to refer to the particular God
whose story is going to be told here. That's Genesis 1. In Genesis 2 you
get...
Jon: Wait. Genesis 1, it just says Elohim.
Tim: Just says "Elohim" all the way through. A deity. 
Jon: A deity.
[00:29:58] 
Tim: Then in Genesis 2, you get the phrase "Yahweh Elohim." Which tells
you, "Oh, yes the Elohim that did what He did in Chapter 1, that was
Yahweh Elohim. Stories are set next to each other so that you compare
the main actor in each of those stories. So but you do know that it's a
singular Elohim.  
Jon: From Genesis 1?
Tim: From Genesis 1. All the verbs are singular. Here's a little more about
this word because this is an interesting word in Hebrew, 'Elohim'. So it's
a long form of the word. There are many forms of this word that
appear in the Bible - The short form is the word "El." It's just the first
two letters - El - over 200 times in the Hebrew Bible phrase. So it's very
common. El. God or gods?
There's another singular form, Eloah. So instead of Elohim, Eloah. And
those are both singular. That occurs almost 60 times. And they all in
our English translations just get translated, "God".
Jon: Why are there a discrepancy between the ways that they're said?
Tim: Well, it's a fascinating history to this word. So El, is the short form,
Eloah...
Jon: 'El' makes sense because it's like you got human and you got man or
something.
Tim: Oh, yeah, okay.
Jon: Just shorten it.
Tim: Yeah, shorten it. Human, man. Take off the "hu." 
Jon: Take of the "hu" to make it shorter, it's easier to say. 
Tim: That's  right.  So  El,  Eloah...Actually  literally  probably  the  way  great-
grandpa Moses said it would be Eloah. El, Eloah, Elohim. It's three
forms. 
Jon: Just three forms. Probably just how people have gotten used to saying
it... 
Tim: How the word developed. What's interesting is that the...
Jon: Great- grandpa Moses. Is that what you just said?
Tim: Yeah.
Jon: I love it. 
Tim: It's like old English, how our great-grandparents spoke English. 
Jon: That picture that conjure when you say that. 
Tim: "Grandpa Moses spoke Hebrew," would be different than later forms
Hebrew. So you have El, Eloah, and then Elohim. And that third one,
Elohim, that "im" is significant because it's the plural noun ending. It's
like 's' in English. God or gods?
Jon: When you put an "im" behind a word, you're—
Tim: You're making a plural.
Jon: You're making a plural. 
Tim: Yeah. Unless you specify by other indicators and context that you're
using a plural noun to refer to a singular reality, which you can do in
Hebrew. 
Jon: We talked about that with “the skies.”
Tim: Skies? Yeah, it's a great example. That's right. 
Jon: Because that's a plural... 
Tim: Correct.
Jon: ...that means a singular large thing. 
Tim: Yeah. 
Jon: What's that called? 
Tim: Well, that was called...I forget. The plural of complexity or something
like that.  
Jon: Yeah, right. 
Tim: So  there's  something  similar  happening  here,  but  it  creates  an
ambiguity in Hebrew because the word 'Elohim' is technically plural.
You  can  be  reading  a  sentence  in  the  Bible,  like  in  the  first
commandment, "Have no other gods before me," and the word is,
Elohim. "Have no other Elohim before me." 
Jon: Which is the plural for God. 
Tim: gods, yeah. Who gets humiliated in the 10 plagues of Egypt, according
to Exodus Chapter 12. The Elohim of Egypt. The Gods of Egypt. So you
can use the common plural noun, but then when it's referring to the
God of Israel, the verbs, all the other words connected to Elohim are
always  in  the  singular.  So  the  first  sentence  of  the  Bible,  "Elohim
created." And created in Hebrews is marked as a singular.  God or gods?
Jon: Because the verbs have a—
Tim: That's right. Yeah. In English, most of our verbs are not marked as
whether it's one person doing it or many. 
Jon: So  what  does  that  mean  that  the  noun  is  plural  but  the  verb  is
singular?
Tim: What it means is, in this case, we're talking about one specific Elohim,
not many Elohim.  
Jon: Then why didn't they use the word El or Eloah?
Tim: Exactly. 
Jon: What do you mean exactly?
Tim: No, I'm  just saying that you put your thumb  on  the  ambiguity in
Hebrew.
Jon: Okay.
Tim: So we don't have this ambiguity in English, but it is there in Hebrew. It
creates fascinating challenges.
Jon: But we could duplicate the ambiguity. We could say, "In the beginning,
gods, a gods..." No, I guess we can't.
Tim: No, you can't do it. No, you can't do it because it's referring to one
specific Elohim. Because it's a singular verb. So an Elohim created. You
don't know which one though.
Jon: Yeah. That's interesting. 
Tim: You read page one and you're like, "Oh, which Elohim?"
Jon: Yeah. 
Tim: Now that wouldn't occur to a modern Westerner because God—
Jon: But that wouldn't occur to a Jewish reader of the Bible either because
they've read other portions of the Bible. 
[00:35:05] God or gods?
Tim: Yeah, that's right. But again, if we were trying to come to this with a
blank slate. So here's what you walk away from this basic point then.
The word Elohim doesn't refer to a specific God.
Jon: So if we just had Genesis 1, and that's all we had, then there would be a
big debate about which God do they think created heaven and earth. 
Tim: That's exactly right. In English we have this convention where if we put
a capital G it means the God of the Bible, and if it's lowercase g, any
other  god.  In  Hebrew,  there's  just  these  words,  El,  Eloah,  Elohim.
Specifically, Elohim is used within the Bible itself to refer to gods other
than—
Jon: Yeah, like the gods of Egypt.
Tim: Yes. The Elohim of Egypt. "Have no other Elohim before me," is the first
commandment. So it presumes there are other Elohim that you could
have before you.
Jon: Or that you could try to have imaginary Elohim.
Tim: But  whether  they're  real  or  not,  isn't  the  point.  The  point  is  the
Israelites sure thought they're real, and so therefore they wanted to
have... "Yeah, we want to worship Baal." 
Jon: Okay, they thought they were real. But I guess the question that then a
modern Christian would ask is, well, just because they thought they
were real doesn't mean they were real?
Tim: Correct. I mean, that's the question that you got to talk about, and I'm
going to force us not to talk about it for a while. But we're going to
eventually talk about that. 
Jon: Okay.
Tim: I'm just saying the word means deity. 
Jon: So right now, you're saying, it's totally cool to still just say there are no
other gods... 
Tim: No. I am saying-
Jon: ...at this stage in the conversation? God or gods?
Tim: At this stage in the conversation, I'd say, the basic meaning of the word
"Elohim", is either referring to the singular God of Israel or all the other
gods. 
Jon: Yeah. Well, because culture at large believes there are other gods. 
Tim: Yeah. Israel's Canaanite neighbors believe there are other gods. 
Jon: Canaanite neighbors. 
Tim: Yeah. And many Israelites were tempted to believe that those gods
were  more  powerful  than  the  God  of  Israel.  That's  the  first
commandment. 
Jon: But what we haven't established is whether or not there are actually
other gods or did they just think there were other guys? 
Tim: Okay, right. That is a question that is yet to be addressed. 
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: So here is one that'll throw you for a loop. Go down to this 1 Samuel
reference here. This is a strange story. This is a story about King Saul,
Israel's first  king. He  isn't hearing  from  Yahweh,  the  God  of  Israel
anymore. No guidance, no words of guidance or anything, and the
Philistines are breathing down his neck, big army coming  his way.
Samuel, who was an important prophet has died. 
And so he goes to this sorceress, who's a spirit medium, and she has
him conjure up the deceased Samuel, and she does it. And then in the
story here, it's "And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out and
said, 'I see an Elohim coming up out of the ground'." 
So whatever the Hebrew word Elohim means, it can refer to the One
God of Israel, it can refer to the gods worshiped by other nations, it can
refer to a deceased human.
Jon: That is somehow...
Tim: Conjured up by sorceress.
Jon: ...conjured up spiritually. 
Tim: Yes. God or gods?
Jon: So it's very loose word. 
Tim: So it's a word whose meaning is very different. 
Jon: It's range of meaning is broad. 
Tim: It's range of meaning is broader, and has a different set of nuances
than our English word 'God'. And then no English translation does this
passage get translated. I see gods coming up out of the ground or I
see a god.
Jon: Right. Because our word 'God' doesn't have same broad meaning.
Tim: Yeah. It doesn't ever refer to the disembodied spirit of a deceased
person. We have the word spirit to refer to that. 
Jon: Right. 
Tim: So that's actually our first clue as to the meaning of this word here of
Elohim. 
Jon: What's the clue? That's it's broad?
Tim: The  fact  that  Elohim  can  refer  to  the  disembodied  presence  of  a
deceased human means that Elohim has a certain range of meaning
and connections that's different than our English word 'God'. Just like
we did with spirit or holiness, you have to flush what categories we're
bringing from our English vocabulary through the Bible. 
[00:40:07] 
Jon: Try and understand the Hebrew category first and then figure out how
to translate in English.
Tim: That's right. When the Bible says, "God," what does that mean? So first
of all, here's one first implication. So Yahweh, the God of Israel is an
Elohim, but He's not apparently the only Elohim because there's the
Elohim of Egypt, there's other Elohim that should not be put before
Yahweh—
Jon: And they could all be fake. 
Tim: Yeah. Yeah, that's right, whether fake or real. But Samuel wasn't fake I
think. He encountered something very real. That in Hebrew could beGod or gods?
referred to as an Elohim. So here, I'll just let someone else do it. This is
from Hebrew Bible nerd named Michael Heiser, who actually has some
great books and a great podcast...
Jon: "The Naked Bible" podcasts and a great podcast. 
Tim: ...that's called The Naked Bible podcast. He has a book called "The
Unseen Realm" that's been one of the helpful resources that I've been
looking at as I put all this together. So here's how Heiser puts it. 
He says, "If we're trying to just understand how the Hebrew Bible uses
the word "God," Yahweh is an Elohim but no other Elohim is Yahweh."
"Elohim," Heiser concludes, "is a place of residence term. The word tells
you what the proper domain is for that being. By nature, the God of
Israel, the many Elohim of God's counsel, demons, angels, the departed
dead like Samuel, these can all be referred to with the word Elohim.
So  what  do  they  have  in  common?  They're  part  of  a  nonphysical
domain that’s related to, but also distinct from the physical embodied
domain. So an Elohim is by definition and by nature a disembodied
entity. So the word can refer to many different beings who inhabit that
realm." So that's his conclusion, and I think that's helpful to at least say
there's a common denominator between all these uses of Elohim but
it's different than an English word 'God'.
Jon: Okay. So it's a big bucket word to refer to any type of disembodied
being.
Tim: The Elohim of Egypt, the Elohim of...
Jon: Samuel. 
Tim: ...of Babylon, the Elohim that is Samuel coming up out of the ground is
disembodied, and the Elohim that his named Yahweh, the God of Israel.
Jon: So basically, the confusion we talked about at the beginning, all comes
down to this discrepancy where our word 'God' is specific to a type of
divine being.
Tim: Right. The all-powerful, Creator, Ruler. 
Jon: Right.God or gods?
Tim: Yeah.
Jon: And we understand and most Christians understand this idea of other
spiritual beings, angels, demons, but we wouldn't call those gods. But
in  Hebrew  there's  a  big  bucket  word  'Elohim'  and  it  can  refer  to
Yahweh, the Supreme God as a Bible presents Him, it can refer to the
gods of other cultures, it can refer to a spirit. Does it ever refer to
angels or demons as Elohim?
Tim: Yes, which begs the question of, if those can be called Elohim, then, is
angel and demon just another type of title for Elohim? 
Jon: Another type of title, or is it like a sub-type? 
Tim: A sub-type. Yeah, that's right. In essence, it just means spiritual being.
Jon: Elohim.
Tim: Elohim is a spiritual being. A nonphysical being.
Jon: Okay. So in the beginning, a spiritual being created the heavens in the
earth. 
Tim: Yeah. What spiritual being? 
Jon: And then in Genesis 2, "Yahweh the spiritual being, created." 
Tim: Yeah, which in English and Genesis 2, you turn Genesis 2 and it and it
says, "The Lord God, which means—
Jon: Because Lord being Yahweh and God being Elohim. 
Tim: God the Elohim. So it's a phrase. Yahweh Elohim. The Yahweh God.
Jon: So if you were to do a translation of Genesis 1, would it be "In the
beginning, a spiritual being created the land and the sea or the sky and
the land"?
Tim: Well, it's tricky because, for the biblical authors, they don't just think
any spiritual being. They're thinking of Yahweh. But the language that
they use—
Jon: So they would say, "The spiritual being"?God or gods?
Tim: Well, I think they would say, "God." 
Jon: Elohim?
Tim: It's tricky because in English... 
Jon: No, I'm asking not how Hebrew speaker. How would you try to say in
English the best way the speaker would be thinking? 
Tim: Oh, I understand.
Jon: You probably just would say, "God," because that's put—
[00:44:59] 
Tim: Yeah.  And  perhaps  using  the  lowercase  g.  In  English  to  try  and
communicate what's going on is lowercase g, god. Oh, which one? Oh,
keep reading. Well, and actually, there's only one Elohim, who has the
power  and  capabilities  of  generating  universe  like  ours  within  the
convictions for the biblical authors. But you don't get that Elohim's
name until page 2. 
Jon: Right.  So  if  you're  Jewish  person  who  grew  up  just  worshiping
Canaanite gods, then you knew nothing about Yahweh because it had
been forgotten?
Tim: That's right. 
Jon: You haven't been told.
Tim:  Yeah. You're an ancient Moabite reading Genesis 1.
Jon: Yeah. You get Genesis, someone's telling it to you, and they say, "In the
beginning, Elohim created," you would go, "Which Elohim?" 
Tim: Yeah. And then you'd get to page two and you'd be like, "Oh, the
Elohim."
Jon: So to create the same impact for an English reader, you would say, "In
the beginning, a spiritual being created the land and the sky."
Tim: Yeah, totally. Yeah. I've never actually thought to put it that way. God or gods?
Jon: And then you'd as English reader would be like, "Okay, what spiritual
being?"
Tim: Yeah. Well, you would walk away from the story going, "That's a very
powerful spiritual being." 
Jon: Sure, yeah. That's a pretty...yeah. With His words, created.
Tim: Yeah. I know my people, Moab they...because Baal is an Elohim, but I
don't know any stories of Baal doing what that Elohim just did on page
one of Genesis. So that's a very powerful Elohim. This is all sanctified
imagination. 
Jon: Sanctified?
Tim: Oh, it's like we're using our biblical...we're trying to biblically imagine
ourselves back into the ancient world. So it's probably all kinds of
things we're not thinking of.
Jon: Oh, I'm sure we're doing it absolutely correctly.
Tim: Yeah. So all of a sudden, phrases in the Bible begin to be able to make
sense.  Like  at  the  top  of  the  next  page  there,  a  phrase  like
Deuteronomy 10:17. "For Yahweh," this is Moses to Israel, "Yahweh is
your Elohim. He is the Elohim of Elohim, and the Lord of lords, the
great, the mighty, the awesome one."
Jon: How's that normally translated?
Tim: God of gods.
Jon: Is it?
Tim: Yeah. Deuteronomy 10:17. "Yahweh is your Elohim. He is the Elohim
among all the other Elohim." Do you see how? Even though it's the
same Hebrew word, in the first singular—
Jon: I like just rolling with the word spiritual being. That's helpful.
Tim: Yeah, good. 
Jon: Yahweh is your spiritual being. 
Tim: Yahweh is your spiritual being, which means all kinds of things.God or gods?
Jon: He is the spiritual being of spiritual beings.
Tim: Of all spiritual beings, yeah. 
Jon: Of all spiritual beings.
Tim: Yeah. This is that classic biblical phrase. It's a Hebrew turn of phrase.
You  put  two nouns next  to each other,  the  first  one singular,  the
second one plural. And what you mean, it's a way of saying this is the
ultimate of that thing.
Jon: Is that how this is? Those both are plural.
Tim: The Elohim of Elohim. Right. But the first one singular and meaning
because he's the Elohim of Elohim. 
Jon: Oh, okay. 
Tim: It's just like "the Holy of holies" or the Song of songs.
Jon: So the most spiritual of beings. 
Tim: Ultimate Elohim...
Jon: The ultimate spiritual being. 
Tim: ...among all Elohim. So notice here, it presumes like whether or not
they are real, and we'll talk about that, it presumes that people think
they have. People believe in other Elohim. Many Elohim are available to
give your allegiance to.
Jon: Well, and if we're just talking about Elohim in terms of spiritual beings,
then yeah, I'm not as worried.
Tim: See, isn't that interesting once you stop using the English word ‘God’? 
Jon: Yeah.
Tim: Yeah, there you go. I mean, it means deity.
Jon: Elohim mean deity?
Tim: I'm sorry. You're right. You're right because of Samuel. The Samuel, is
the Samuel instance...God or gods?
Jon: If by deity you just mean spiritual being?
Tim: The disembodied spiritual being. Usually quite powerful. All right. So
let's  look  at  another  example.  This  one's  from  the  Book  of
Deuteronomy and it's from a poem where Moses is anticipating the
idolatry of the Israelites when they go into the promised land. This
Deuteronomy 32 verse 17. He says that they're going to sacrifice to
demons - it's a Hebrew word for demons, Shedim. Demons. Which
means like malevolent  bad  spiritual beings -  demons  that  are  not
Eloah. Singular. 
[00:50:07] 
Tim: And then the parallel line is they're going to sacrifice to Elohim that
they had not previously known. So this is a poetic parallel line. The
Israelites they sacrifice to demons that are not Eloah, they are Elohim
that they had not previously known. This is another good example.
That sounds funky in English.
Jon: It is really confusing. 
Tim: But it makes perfect sense in Hebrew. 
Jon: They're not Eloah. So they're not spiritual beings? 
Tim: But remember Eloah is singular.
Jon: Oh, Eloah is singular. 
Tim: Eloah is singular. It just means God. 
Jon: Is El always singular?
Tim: El and Eloah are the singular form. 
Jon: Okay. So they're not the God?
Tim: They are not the God but they are Elohim. What are these other beings
called in this poetic line?
Jon: Yeah, the demons.
Tim: They're called demons in one line, which means spiritual beings that,
well,  worship  of  them  will  lead  to  destructive  human  behavior.God or gods?
Destruction. And then the next line they're called Elohim that your
ancestors didn't know, didn't worship. 
So once again, if you look in your English translations...Actually, I think
if I'm just going look it up, I'm pretty sure all our English translations in
that second line use the word gods in the plural. "They sacrificed to
demons that are not God, gods that they had not previously known."
Oh, that's interesting. That's the NIV. The ESV translates, "They sacrifice
deemed to demons that were no gods." 
Jon: That were no gods. 
Tim: So they take the singular Eloah and they make it a plural in English to
gods that were not known. That's interesting. I wonder why they made
that decision. Anyway. 
Jon: That's confusing. 
Tim: It is confusing. You can see why these words are confusing. To try and
bring these words across in English is actually difficult. 
Jon: Yeah.
Tim: Because of—
Jon: But as soon as you use the word 'spiritual beings', it's not difficult. 
Tim: Sure. Yeah, it eases the tension. Yeah, yeah. 
Jon: So why don't we just do that?
Tim: I have a friend who he's a pastor and he was trying to talk about this to
his church community. And so he was using the plural word 'gods' and
a whole bunch of people, their heresy alert went crazy. 
Jon: That's what I'm saying. 
Tim: Because he was talking about other gods.
Jon: That's why I kept—
Tim: And the whole point is that the word 'gods', this word in the Bible... 
Jon: Is the wrong English words.God or gods?
Tim: Is the wrong English word.
Jon: It's the wrong English word. 
Tim: 'God' is a confusing, unhelpful word in the English language. 
Jon: You know, you don't have to use it at all in the Bible then, right?
Because you've got spiritual being, you got Yahweh or the Lord, and
then you've got angels and demons. There's no reason to use the word
'God'. 
Tim: Yeah. And this is a debate the Bible Translators have. When you come
to a word that has meaning has developed so much that it's not a
useful word anymore. The challenge is, do you just use it anyway, and
try and redefine it in its biblical meaning, or do you just ditch it and
find a new word? And that's fascinating to think that the English word
God has actually become a hindrance to clear communication. 
Jon: Yeah. I don't think you could actually lose the word God because—
Tim: No, it's too much of a fixture. 
Jon: Do you believe in a spiritual being? Also, that's confusing.
Tim: Okay, here's the New Testament example that's interesting. In the New
Testament, especially for these Jewish authors, they grew up reading
the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures, so they're using Greek but they're
thinking often in Hebrew. Paul the Apostle is a good example. So the
Greek word, you know...You studied some Greek college. The Greek
word for God? 
Jon: Theos.
[00:54:50] 
Tim: Yeah, Theos. So in 1 Corinthians 8, you have new followers of Jesus
who used to go down to the corner temple to whatever, Apollo or Zeus
and eat meat from a sacrificial lamb offered to Zeus. And the question
was, "Hey, should we still do that anymore? Can we do that?" And he
says he thinks it's a bad idea to go there and eat it, but if you get that
meat and bring it into your home, he says it's no big deal unless there's
someone around that it's going to cause problems for you. God or gods?
So this is how he opens that paragraph in 1 Corinthians 8. He says,
"Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know
that there is no such thing as an idol in the world."
Jon: Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
Tim: "And that there is no God but one."
Jon: What does he mean there's no such thing as an idol in the world?
Tim: Yeah, he doesn't mean idols don't exist.
Jon: Obviously, there are idols. 
Tim: Yes, yeah. So that idols are idols. That idols are ‘no thing’ in the world. 
Jon: They are ‘no thing’ in the world? What does that mean?
Tim: So you live in a world where there are literally hundreds of idols on the
street, in the marketplaces, everywhere, in town hall, in people's homes.
People do all kinds of rituals to them, they fear them, they treat them
like  little  people,  they  kiss  them,  they  bow  to  them.  The  Jewish
Christian conviction is, those idols are no thing. 
Jon: They have no power? They don't represent anything?
Tim: They are wood and metal. 
Jon: Well, then that's a thing.
Tim: Yeah, totally. 
Jon: Well, it's  like  coming  to Portland and saying, "There  no [inaudible
00:56:44] here.
Tim: That's right. The parallel is there is no such thing as idol in the world
and there is no God but one. Those pieces of wood are not Elohim.
Plural, or singular. That idol is not a Theos. 
Jon: Got it. 
Tim: It's a piece of wood. And so he's just saying, "Listen, concerning food
sacrificed to idols, there's nothing spooky about that piece of woodGod or gods?
carved like Zeus down in the temple. And the fact that a piece of meat
was dedicated to it, whatever, it's a piece of wood." 
Jon: It's not an idol, it's a piece of wood. 
Tim: It's a piece of wood. It's not a god. It's not a spiritual being...
Jon: It doesn't represent—
Tim: ...it's a piece of wood. No, he doesn't say it doesn't represent because
look what he goes on to say. 
Jon: Okay. 
Tim: He says, "There's no such thing as idol in the world and there's no God,
but one. For even if there are so-called gods in heaven or on earth, and
indeed, there are many gods and many lords, yet for us, there is but
one God." And then he goes on to define what God is. "Our God the
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
Jon: He's sounding really schizophrenic  here.
Tim: Exactly. In English, it sounds like it doesn't make any sense. But again,
in biblical Elohim thought, this makes perfect sense. 
Jon: Yeah. 
Tim: So what he's saying is, "That piece of wood isn't a deity. It's a piece of
wood." 
Jon: It's not a spiritual being. 
Tim: Yes. Now, he says, and that's how people treated these pieces of wood
and metal. They treat them, they revere them, they kiss them, they
weep before them, they cry out to them, and it's a rock. It's a piece of
wood. 
But there are so-called gods and lords in the world. We do know that.
So in other words, he's acknowledging that even though people might
think that the wood or the rock is a god, he's saying, it's not...
Jon: But there are.God or gods?
Tim: ...people are connecting themselves to spiritual beings that are real.
And he calls them "so-called gods."
Jon: What's that in Greek? So-called?
Tim: Theos. This is a plural of Theos. 
Jon: Why do we put so-called in front? 
Tim: Oh, got it. Here. No, sorry. I'm certain that's his phrase, but I'm just
going  to  double  check  the so-called. There are  many  called  gods,
named gods.
Jon: In English when you say so-called—
Tim: Yeah, it's kind pejorative. It's kind of like, but we know that there is no.
Jon: Yeah. 
Tim: So it's the passive of the word speak. "There are many gods spoken of
in heaven on earth, and indeed," then he goes on to a firm, "There are
spiritual beings out there - many gods and many lords."
Jon: And lords, meaning?
Tim: Yeah, referring to spiritual beings.
Jon: Spiritual beings that have some sort of dominion?
Tim: Dominion, correct. And that's because he's Jewish and he knows that
there are real spiritual beings that have been given dominion by God,
we're not there yet, that they're under God's authority and that they're
real. There are Elohim out there that are real spiritual beings.
[01:00:03] 
Jon: So what he's saying is, that piece of wood that people are sacrificing
meat to, don't sweat it, it's just a piece of wood. It's not a spiritual
being. 
Tim: Yes. 
Jon: "So there's nothing weird with the meat. Don't worry about that."God or gods?
Tim: And for us, we know and give our allegiance to one God.
Jon: "So eat the meat." 
Tim: The point is there's nothing spooky magical about the meat. 
Jon: Because  that  wood  statue  can't  do  anything  to  the  meat  besides
maybe like give a nice smoky flavor to it, if you burned it underneath it.
Tim: Right. So that's the first point. 
Jon: That's the first point. And then he says—
Tim: But then he doesn't want to be misunderstood as saying, "No, I'm not
saying there's no other spiritual beings."
Jon: So he doesn't want you to go from there and go, "Oh, okay. There's no
other spiritual beings." 
Tim: Correct. 
Jon: He's saying, "No, there are spiritual beings and they have many names
and they have dominion over things and we need to watch out for
them."
Tim: Yes. "And yet for us, there is one God." So notice this claim. "There is
for us one God" answers two things. First of all, it's just a piece of
wood. There's no reality to it. It's just a piece of wood. It's not a god.
And for us, there's one God. so we know who the ultimate God is, that's
just a piece of wood, there's no problem here. But then, I don't want to
be misunderstood as saying...
Jon: When you say "There's one God"...
Tim: "There's no God but one." 
Jon: Yeah, right. What does that mean?
Tim: We'll talk about that. It's why I put this example last before the next.
The conversation about monotheism.
Jon: There's no God but one. 
Tim: So is he saying only one spiritual being exists? God or gods?
Jon: Well, no. 
Tim: No. Because  what's  the  next  thing he  says? "Now  there  are  many
named gods and lords but for us, remember there's only one God."
And then he goes on to name that one God as being the Father and
the Lord Jesus Christ. To which a pagan will be, "Oh, so you believe in
two gods." And then he would say, "No, no, just the one God of Israel
who his Father and Son and Spirit." 
Jon: Yeah. So you're going to explain what he means by "there is no God
but one"? 
Tim: Correct.
Jon: Okay. I want to know.
Tim: What he doesn't mean is there are no other Elohim, there's no other
Theos, there's no other spiritual beings. He doesn't mean that.
Jon: Right. 
Tim: Because in the next sentence, he says there are. 
Jon: Well, couldn't he be saying there are in theory?
Tim: Well, if he wants to say in theory, he would say that.
Jon: Or he says "So-called."
Tim: Yeah. But that's an English translation that is putting a pejorative spin
on it. There are many gods spoken of. And then in the next sentence,
"And indeed, there are many gods and many lords."
Jon: He's pretty expressive there. 
Tim: Yeah. So he says, "There's some that are just spoken of." So we don't
know they're real, maybe they're not real.
Jon: Right. 
Tim: But you've read your Hebrew Bible. 
Jon: There are.God or gods?
Tim: There are many gods and Lords, but for us, we give our allegiance to
the one God. 
Jon: So you're saying "For us, there's one God" it means, for us, there's
allegiance to one God.
Tim: Yes. For a Jewish person to say "there is no God but one" doesn't mean
that there are no other spiritual beings that could be called Theos or
Elohim. What it means is my allegiance alone is to the God that I
believe is the supreme Elohim over all the other Elohim. That's what
he's saying here. 
Jon: Does it mean more than just we have allegiance to just this one God?
Because it seems like when he says "there's no God but one" seems like
he's saying more like there's only really only one God that's important.
Tim: Yeah, I hear that. And here he's actually just borrowing a phrase from
Deuteronomy and Isaiah that we'll look out a little bit later. It's often
misunderstood to mean to be a claim that there are no other spiritual
beings. But he goes on to say in the next sentence that there are. Are
you with me?
Jon: I'm with you. 
Tim: Just like to say he has a coherent brain. 
Jon: I'm with you.
Tim: He can't say, "There's no other spiritual being," and then in the next
sentence say, "Now, we know there's many other spiritual beings." It
doesn't make any sense.
Jon: First it sounds really schizophrenic. 
Tim: Exactly. That's right. Yeah. And that's the English problem. 
Jon: Yeah. 
Tim: There we go. Are you with me? Elohim, there's one refers to spiritual
beings. The biblical faith is oriented towards one particular Elohim and
the claim is that Elohim is the most powerful: the Creator, Ruler of all,
and  that  Elohim  personal  name  is  revealed  as  Yahweh  -  God  of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, all that.God or gods?
[01:05:16] 
Jon: Okay.
Tim: So in light of all that, what then does it mean to say there is one like
the Shema? "Hear, O Israel, Yahweh is our Elohim. Yahweh is one or
Yahweh alone." Or what does it mean for a Jewish monotheist in Paul's
day to say, "Now we know there is no God but one"? So what did they
mean when they use this one?
Jon: Thanks for listening to this episode of The Bible Project podcast. Next
week, we're going to pick right back up and continue to talk about the
identity of God in the Bible. Specifically, we're going to look at the
Shema, the famous Jewish prayer found in Deuteronomy.
Tim: And the famous line in the Shema, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD is our
God, Yahweh is our Elohim. Yahweh is one." So does that one mean
that there is only one Elohim, one God? Well, that's the question. 
Jon: Next week we'll explore that question. In the meantime, check us out at

Nancy: Hi. This is Nancy. I'm from Wenzhou China. [foreign language
01:06:41]. What I like best about The Bible project is that it provides a
framework  for  me  to  understand  what  each  book  of  the  Bible  is
because for a lot of the Bible books, one of the first times I read it
could be very overwhelming especially for books like Leviticus and
those things. And so watching the Bible project really helps me to
understand the theme of that book and helps me to remember.
We believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus. We're are a
crowdfunded project by people like me. Find free videos, study notes,
