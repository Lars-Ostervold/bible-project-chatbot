last week we began reading the scroll of numbers it's the fourth scroll in the Torah Torah means teaching often translated lock and it's easy to think of the Torah as a big list of laws because it has many of Israel's ancient law code in it but the Torah is predominantly a story with lock code sprinkled in between their deaths it's important to remember that the laws that we have here are not a complete lock code but a highly curated sample of laws and this is essential to keep in mind as we get to these four laws in the book of numbers that will look at today please for laws each of them were probably actual rituals and lost in the life of a but the author of the tour I have selected out and arranged them in a sequence to communicate a literary message through the cycling of themes this whole section is a riddle so we're going to read
 poor laws about ritual impurity disputes Between Brothers adultery and a custom known as The nazirite Vow why are these here why are these in the order that they're in this is so strange just get ready these are for a really odd stories we're going to take these odd stories and read them through the lens of what we've been calling the melody a narrative pattern that's been building from the very first stories in Genesis God creates order out of chaos he appoint someone specific to rule on his behalf God gives the human access to his own life but the human fails to take it and now finds himself in a new disordered reality so this laws here to activate the next step of the Genesis story line about sibling rivalry and brothers Ronnie each other results in Vineland it's about how you make yourself right with God and right with two brothers who are trying to undo
 the failures of Adam and Eve and now I'm do the failure sibling rivalry of John Collins this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I read for using little ancient laws least four laws it's a meditation on what it means for all Israel to become the kingdom of priests playing the host to the author of all life and goodness and Beauty thanks for joining us here we go
 oh Tim, John hi hi yes we are in the wilderness is where we are yeah yeah and Hebrew the book of numbers is called Bob midbar Ahmed bar yes in the wilderness in the wilderness this is the fourth scroll in the tour collection we've been going through the whole Torah and we won't do a big job review here but this is the story of God working with the people of known as Israel Abraham's family who is now in the wilderness and the Middle East Northern Sinai Peninsula Northern Sinai Peninsula is left Egypt and they've done through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai they've made this Covenant agreement with
 God to represent him and to be a holy people yeah meaning set apart to live in proximity and his service to God to then bless the whole world that brings us to the whole overall tour the Bible but here we are in the Tabernacle and what we just looked at in the beginning of the scroll numbers is that is a headcount done and then they're organized around the Tabernacle and this design that brings to mind this how the Garden of Eden is organized to very sometimes overt and other times subtle that goes and hyperlinks in use of the vocabulary from the early chapters of Genesis the author paints Israel camped out at the foot of the mountain with the garden tent in the middle of their Camp painted as a Garden of Eden picture with Israel appointed all together
 has God's kingdom of priests and then within that Kingdom of priests there is a specially selected tribe of the Levites and then among that tribe especially selected family Aaron and his sons as the high priest who actually go in and out of the tent at the center of all of them and then the Levites are around them and what the author also assumes that we recall is that living in proximity to the nuclear reactor of Holiness as it were the fusion Center source of all life is the source and sustainer of all life in order living in the middle of your camp that is both a good thing cuz you can get extra bundle an extra blessing man you can get water from a rock you can get Sky bread you know falling down everyday to feed you and
 you can be blessed but also it puts you in proximity to something that is at the same time dangerous and whether Israel will will adapt itself to the place of Holiness and moral integrity and ritual Purity that is the responsibility they now bear and it's what they said yes to when God said I want to come move into your camp and so is that drama in the crisis created by that possibility for danger that is connected to the stories we're going to be in looking at today actually they're not stories at all the most ancient near Eastern laws are so okay so where the first movement of numbers and focusing on the theme of the temple where they got the presents in the middle of people which is the main focus of these are the chapters do we just left where what you just described which is God selects the Levites and makes them
 the first born well the people are numbered and the 12 tribes are numbered it's become clear that they have been fruitful and multiplying a lots of lots of them hundreds of thousands and then there are arranged in a nice series of concentric circles with the tent at the center and then the Levites who's one of the tribes is us like that okay so let's jump in ya and last episode we covered numbers one through four and as you've been trained to read through the Hebrew Bible when you hear Garden of Eden music and the selection of a special chosen one to live and work in the garden you're trained to think her and locked out watch out cuz something's going to go wrong so here's what's fascinating is that what's going to go wrong in terms of somebody failing to trust God or doing what's good in their own eyes that's actually all going to happen when they leave Mount Sinai have to check
 10, but because the biblical authors want to keep the music of the melody going they're going to construct this opening section of numbers by still going through the sequence of seems that something will go wrong but the something that's going to go wrong you just have to see how this works okay so we're going to session for a little bit here it is essentially what we call numbers chapters 5 and 6 and the sections such a great example it's a straight-up riddle it's for random will paragraphs that each one by its own you like okay I get it but you like why are these here why are these in the order that they are in why is it so strange and the sense that it does make is if you know how to hear the music in the vocabulary from Genesis 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and it's exactly like what happens here in sequence while 30k
 I've never heard sermon on a 454 really bad stories
so numbers 5:1 spoke to Moses command the sons of Israel that they send a way out of the camp every person with a skin disease everyone who's had some kind of reproductive fluid leak out of their body and everyone who has become impure because they've touched a dead body so this is harkening back to take a stroll right in the center of the scroll Purity laws what makes you pure and impure ritual and so there's a whole rabbit hole but skin disease model be discharged of reproductive fluids and touching dead people were three of like the five things correct a try this is a cultural taboo system where was in ancient Israel you become ritually in pure when you come into contact with something associated with death or dying
 and it's not morally wrong to be ritually in pure but but don't go to the tavern yeah if you contracted ritual impurity by touching something that's after dying is dangerous and violates God's holiness is to waltz into the courtyard of the tent when you're in a state so ritual a states are temporary you waited. A 7 Days sometimes 14 you wash your body offer a sacrifice of purification you're good to go
 so I don't have to go outside the camp you just got to wash here is something new happening Next Level and actually so here's something new now that we have fully dialed in the camp has a little model of Eden then anyone who has who is Bratayley a virtually a state has to go live outside the camp
 so the three of you shall stand outside anybody male or female send them outside the camp so that they don't pollute the camp make a make it in pure the camp where I live in the middle cuz actually like you just being there well not it's not only are you richly and fewer now you're actually going to fix space that you're in is going to become virtually a yeah the member of this is from our last conversation numbers one through four painted a picture of outside of the Wilderness yeah but Gods created a little Oasis and so the fruitful and multiplying tribes that are arranged in a big circle or like the fruitful land of Eden and then at the inner circle from that is the Levites in the priests who are like in the garden and then at the center of the time is the Tabernacle in the 10th which is like the tree of life in the middle very specific detail in the Eden story and so if on an LG to that the whole Camp is
 then to honor the sacred dedicated to life status of the whole Camp means the people who are in a ritual a state that is the contracted death a state where like the reality of death is just obvious and clear and it's not wrong but it's just a realization of like it's a realization that things aren't right yet but being in the state isn't wrong but if you're going to visualize a state that is right then that needs to be moved out that's right yeah skin disease leaking bodily fluids having touch a dead body those are all realities that in biblical story only happen outside of Eden as a sign of the fact that were dying and so as a way to honor the ritual drama that this Camp tells a story just by its arrangement
 people for however long they need to. I've got seven days needs to go live on the edge of the camp and travel at the edge of the camp going to do it but this language is being sent away on to the outside this is the language from Genesis 3:22 24 about Adam and Eve being sent out to be a little argument and are consequence and it's a consequence not because being richly a is wrong but because Rachel and Purity is about contact with death and death is a sign of living outside of Eatin and why are we outside of Eden because of the Fallen rebellion of humanity so my point here is that it's an interesting little boy verse paragraph and you can link it to the Leviticus and be like okay I got it that makes sense but look at how it comes right after the live it up just one and two describing the camp like an Eden Leviticus 3 and 4 I really try to create the perfect space here
 pointing the Levites and their jobs are the same words used to describe Adam and Eve's job and now we are casting out of the Camp David this is both to honor the purity of the camp that was just set up and to The X-Files originally a okay so that's a crazy idea then that when I am actually a I do got to go live outside of camp or was this just kind of like this one time thing they were doing during this moment in their time of ordering them in the campus was just kind of like we're all set up now let's just do this ritual where everyone is unclean go to the outside and let's mark this moment or is this something that every time I come into contact with a dead body not only do I wash and do the whole thing I got to go outside Camp yeah I think for the period in the wilderness idea cuz it's going to get brought up again I'll be around in the book
 but once I got into the land in Jerusalem it was a different circumstance and so what changed but these laws still here in the Torah communicating yeah communicating with them in a message in the storyline capsule starting verse 5 chapter 5 there's a new law thing say the sons of Israel when a man or a woman commits any of the sins of Adam Adam acting Unfaithful against the Lord will that person will become guilty so what they should do is confess the sins that they have committed the first let's just remember if any man or woman commits any of the sins of Adam
 what are the word but we got Adam and Eve on the brain hide from everything is come before or let's just say there's a human that commits one of the sins of Adam that's what it says in Hebrew one of the sins of Adam beer then that person becomes guilty what they should do is confess their sin what did Adam and Eve not do when God came up to them if they head what is this that you have done the woman she did it may be hidden and they blamed him and the snake you deceive me so it's just interesting Little Biscuit meditation literature this later little kind of Riff Off the eating narrative draws attention to something they've been could have just confessed right there then when you go back and think about your life why didn't they just say they're sorry yeah we could have been spared a lot of trouble it said they were sorry
 interesting is interesting they were told like how you eat that you're going to die yeah maybe they didn't think sorry was going to cut it so let's just say that there's you know a human that commits one of the sins of Adam then they should confess their sins and then they shall offer a restitution in full for that wrong and even at 1 CEST to it so you quoted this before this where this comes from that if I injure someone yes I pay him back + 1/5 but then on top of that I'm going to go and do the what's the offerings called the ishan in Hebrew it's the noun of this word guilt soft called the guilt offering or the the restitution offering so cuz we've learned about that offering already in Leviticus 20 Leviticus this detail about the fifth in Leviticus adding one test yes yeah that wasn't what it was that was there too so what's interesting here is this little law
 the guilt offering the restitution offering it's almost copy and pasted from Boca Leviticus chapter 5 in the new material now but there's a couple different that's okay so you're invited to go compare this restatement because a lot of it was already given in Leviticus and when you do that you go to we call Leviticus chapter 6 and it's the same laws about the same offering just a little bit different so here's the lava starts a tattoo when a person sends and acts Unfaithful against the Lord and let's just say he deceives their companion to see if their brother in regards to some deposit or security that was trusted to them or maybe robbery or maybe he has extorted his neighbor like his brother
 he found something that was lost and lied about it in any of these things that a person might do it begins by saying let's just say there's two Israelite neighbors the brothers and one brother wrong the other in some way that may happen when he becomes guilty he has to restore what he did and then add one fifth to it and then offer this genre guilt offering so that's the law from Leviticus chapter 6 so this numbers while this restatement of it and numbers is worded a little differently and it doesn't mention the brother of the neighbor that just says when you commit any of the sins of Adam and knocked Unfaithful a then then you're guilty and it doesn't give examples and it doesn't give any examples but you go back to the source of it when it was first dated and
 you get us a story about let's say there's some guy who runs his brother let's say you were trusted with something but then you wronged your brother I know a story about that the story about the sons of Adam and Eve am I My Brother's Keeper why you think like that I'm responsible for my brother Abel Cain and Abel yeah I think what does it have to ask question why is this lobbying restated already got this llama bit ago and when I go look at that one so we've just established eat in we've brought death to the outside of the camp and we've ordered this Eden and then God says and when they're becomes a can able kind of situation I can't have to deal with this is how to deal with it yeah and Cain is replaying in the design of Genesis Genesis 3 and 4 have all these important connections to show
 that can is replaying an intensifying the failure of his parents and so here at this law let's say somebody commits one of the sins of Adam and does this thing that you go look at where I'm getting this law from it's all about when a guy runs his brother then here's what you're supposed to do so this laws here to activate the next step of the Genesis story line about sibling rivalry and brothers wrong each other and violence and resulting in violence so just like the Exile of Adam and Eve was sad right at the loss of being in the Eden of life but here in numbers when that story was echoed it's about protecting the purity of the camp
 so here when the Cain and Abel story is echoed it's about Allah about how you make yourself right with God and right with your brother's so we're trying to undo the failures of Adam and Eve and now undo the failure of sibling rivalry I see The Melodies here but as like in a way of like here's how to protect yourself from yeah it kind of turned it what's that story what's the next law about so bizarre numbers 5 verse 11
are we having a good time
 yeah I spoke to Moses saying speak to the sons of Israel and say to them let's say there's a man whose wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him and let's say some other man has sex with her and it's hidden from the eyes of her husband and it is undetected hidden
 let's say there's no witness against her and nobody caught them in the ACT but let's just say a wind of jealousy jealousy comes over here and he's jealous for his wife he passionate as passion a protective passion for her and whether she's slept with another man or whether she hasn't slept another man here's what the guys supposed to do about the ritual in a minute but this is a whole lot about what happens when a guy is pretty sure his wife has committed adultery and slept with another man and had illicit sex outside of the bounds of the Covenant what's he supposed to do the horses that you can read this law it's weird even offensive to many sensibilities I think that I and you and many of us listening to the podcast
 read it and disturbing for all kinds of reasons and you can read it and just be like okay I guess this was some weird kitchen is realizing why is it here like what's it doing here yeah this is a random yeah like a hodgepodge of them realize that we're eating so here's what is fascinating about this law this law is that coming the vocabulary and the sequence of Genesis 6 through 8 about the illicit sexual liaison between the sons of Elohim and the daughters of Adam and then the resulting passionate Justice that God had for his creation to wash it clean with water and to spare a Remnant out the other side that is righteous specifically that Humanity's violence had grown yes and so there was that they need to be reckoned with but then there's a story where the sons of Elohim meaning Lakes camping
 have sex with human women and create an offspring that are they called the Nephilim they're they're called the Nephilim and the giborim than that yeah the vinyl Warriors of old and the first giborim that we meet after the flood has a guy named Nimrod is the founder of Babylon so this is an origin story about what was a common motifs in the ancient near Eastern propaganda for Babylon in Egypt which is to say Their Kingdoms were founded by half human half gods and while that's celebrated in Babylon right in Genesis beer it's going that was not good targeted as a sign of cosmic rupture Cosmic failure and it's the fall Narrative of sorts of ya of the Angels yep and it's a mirror and inversion of the woman in the spiritual being in the ceiling and taking that happens and eaten is on the other side that's part of the reason why the flood
 and specifically that the Gibble Reimer those Nephilim are violent Warriors who like Cain and Mike Lemak in the previous story before that begin you know when vacation spilling innocent blood all over the land does God looks in the land after this happens and it's like the land is full of violence and so I got does is send the flood to purify the land to respond to the outcry of the innocent that's risen up before him and then to purify the land with the Waters of the flood but there is one who is righteous and blameless Noah and his righteousness covers for his family and so God delivers him through the waters out the other side of the flood and Noah gets off and he offers sacrifice when she gets off the boat and God says I will never again curse the land
 I will never again flood it with Waters or strike all life so the flood is equated With cursing the land and striking his life on the land so that's the flood story and I guess what I'm going to try and show is that this law placed right here in the sequence of numbers is still in the slot of the flood story activating Galaxy and because here is yours blocked for safety and of Numbers Chapter 5 so the guy is going to bring his wife and bring as an offering like a grain offering the priest will have her stand before y'all way the priests will take Sacred Water and a clay jar and he'll pick up some of the dust that's on the floor of the Tabernacle so he's going to take sacred dust and put it in the water
 then the priest will have a woman let her hair go loose to put the grain offering in her hands that's the offering of jealousy and in the hand of the priest is to be the bitter Waters that brings about a curse Waters of the curse and that's different than the waters with the the temple dust the holy Waters in the temple desk is the Waters of the curse or is different. He takes a jar get Sacred Water puts temple temple dirt in the water and that's the water bitterness against her if it's called the water of bitterness that brings a curse on the word bitter is spelled with the same letters as the word curse so it's the water of cursing the brings about a curse but it's going to taste you said the flood in Genesis 6 is described as a curse Genesis are just as a team called the curse on the land so the priests will have her taken off
 and say listen it's no man has had sex with you and if you haven't been a faithful to your husband then guess what these Waters of bitterness that bring about a curse will be innocent will be fine they won't do anything bad to you however if you have committed adultery and if some other man has had sex with you then the priests will have the ones where enough when you drink the water your thigh will fall and your abdomen will swell and the water that brings a curse will go into your innards and make you swell and your thigh will waste away and the woman shall say I'm in I'm in
 yeah this feels very like like I'm Shaman and kind of thing two purposes are like medicine man kind of stuff that the woman who hasn't committed all three will be just fine her womb will produce seed but the woman who has committed adultery essentially she'll become infertile and saw the rest of the mountains so the woman who is righteous and innocent the waters will wash over her and she'll come out the other side and be able to produce much seat but the one who has been unfaithful will produce no seed anymore and her family will die out with her so to speak so
 if you take this out of its narrative context and just think about it as a ritual practices really I remember sitting in one of my first Bible classes at Pomona University and I was in class on the pentateuch and I remember a friend of ours we both know sitting next to me and when we're talking about this law and he was just like does this ever happen to men like the men never have to do this like to so I was I member it was the first time where for him the Bible was becoming an obstacle to his faith he was really bothered by this law and it doesn't seem shamanistic
 even chauvinistic and speaks to the patriarchal cultural setting you could just see cuz if a guy even if a husband too suspicious is suspicious that he have to put his wife through this and you just like the screwed-up yeah and that's how I feel to be abused totally all of those things are true and all the other things are more valid like as readers we are experiencing the text that way and might of our social location and that doesn't mean it's not important that means it's what we experience so what I want to do though is make sure that my experience of this and why do my social location and that's important to honor that shouldn't cancel out the process of trying to hear this on its own terms
 but what does it mean to hear it on its own terms you could try and hear this law as it expresses ancient Israelite folk religion but that's not what you think if that's the purpose that or there'd be a whole lot more of this and a little bit more organized exactly because there's like this is yes there's nothing well and maybe some other things have sort of like it but can I stands alone and it's in this fairly kind of his random Place yeah this is not like a guide for Shaman snow and this is a great example of the laws of the Torah aren't just a copy and paste everybody of all places at all times if you want to do the will of God just live by the laws of the Torah so this is a great example of where the law it's a parable as it where it's placed here this whole section is a riddle for laws put next to each other this is the third one will look the next one next and each of them were probably
 hello like rituals and lost in the life of ancient Israel but the author of the Torah has selected out stories poems and laws and arrange them in sequence to communicate a literary message through the cycling of themes and the reason this law is here is because it communicates something within this larger section of numbers as a participates in the larger themes of the Torah and so this is the other thing is in the Torah the words for adultery or prostitution primarily referred to Israel and idolatry and Idols Israel mixing with other gods and the First Act of prostitution in the Bible That's I applied to the whole people of Israel is the golden calf is called this real active adultery and prostitution and so the idea that one who has been
 faithful to the Covenant is washed with the floodwaters and only the righteous Will Survive out the other side to produce seed and be fruitful and multiply this is standard prophetic imagery for talking about Israel's Exile from the land as a flood of God's judgment and the righteous Remnant who survives out the other side to produce much seed and so on so this little law is actually in a microcosm talking about the moment of the biblical Melody of the god D creating but the right around that being spared to produce seed on the other side and then the next LA what we call Numbers Chapter 6 is a picture of a righteous Remnant Israelite and who they are and what they're all about not called The nazirite Vow but for the moment I just want to honor that this is a really uncomfortable law the one you see it and its literary context it makes sense
 the context is man there's so much in his subtext here so much subtext that Israel has been ordered around God's presence in a way for us to imagine Eden and that all of Israel is being appointed to be the new Humanity to bring blessing to the world but then even more so the practicality of it is that the Levites have been chosen to be the new Humanity on behalf of Israel yet so then you have that Arrangement we've got the sense of Eden and then we've got the ritual Liam pure meaning those signs of death that are still around moved outside the camp and Adam and Eve were exiled but here like
 Community gets to stay but there is an exile of sorts but it's death being a separate Death From the Source of Life and those people get to come back when there were actually fewer a symbol of death being exiled and then you get this reflection on the sin of Adams and Sons which is that not only does our foolishness bring death and brings violence against each other and conflict between our brothers and so you get this reflection on that yet with that guilt offering think you offering and how to make it right now to make a right yeah that's right and so then if you follow the story of Cain and Abel and you follow all the violence that comes from all these descendants of Cain that just gets multiplied and like the sky to Lemak who just as like I get to just kill whoever I want to be great and then you get the story of the like half gods are like the most of all
 Lancia and so God has to come and wash it clean with a flood of water or a Remnant comes through and that's called a curse on the land this story which on its face is just a weird shamanistic kind of story of like what if a guy suspicious of his wife committing adultery that practice whatever that was is taken and then put here and I crafted and use the language to then bring us into the next part of the melody which is things are going to get so bad that is going to have to be a washing and only those who are innocent a Remnant will come through and where you've said is yes they're using the imagery of someone being unfaithful and marriage but where does that improve really come to life in the Hebrew Bible the most
 and that is Israel's violating their Covenant with Yahweh by giving their allegiance and worship. The gods which is depicted as adultery and sex with someone is not your Covenant partner standard and in fact in the matching part on the other side of numbers in chapter 25 there's going to be a whole story about Israelites marrying and having sex with and participating in worship rituals to the gods of Moab in Midian and it's it's actually precise match in the design of the book so what I'm saying is the author of numbers assumes
 is that the reader is able to make all this Connections in parallels
 so I don't expect everybody who's listening to podcast right now to be persuaded by that but I have yet to come across anyone who can explain what this laws doing here in the location and sequence that it is and much less the two laws that came before it and the law that comes after this one so let's check this out this will be confirmation of my thesis is the next song
so if we just went through the flood waters what I expect is somebody to come out the other side who's you know Rochester blameless something to do with maybe the righteous offering of now and then. Thanks thank offering it wasn't Ascension offering such a and to come off the boat as a new Humanity let's told to be fruitful and multiply and keep their Covenant with God then what happens with Noah Wyle plants a garden oh yeah he drinks from the fruit of the vine and get Charlie umbrella to start over gets really drunk and then Melody start up Numbers chapter 6 verse 11 say to them let's just say there is a man or a woman who makes a special value of dedication the value of the naseer so that they want to
 easier themselves to y'all went this is a new category of a dedication to something else yeah I know where is Nasir means tubes that one apart and so it's called the value of the nausea referring to someone who his ears them self to be out way to his ear it means to literally select out of and dedicate it to something else is that the Holiness of Holiness but the word Holiness is a different word than those here is to be set apart for being in the proximity of the source of all life in this is being set apart just referring to the selection out of one who is set apart selected out of its what's interesting is that that word those three letters and z are noon Sian rash are the same
 three letters as the nezzer that refers to that golden plaque Crown the priests wear at the high priest wears and so it's interesting that's as belonging to the law what is the plaque says on it is I belong to Yahweh
 and let's just say there's a average Israelite who wants to take on the life of another year one who is set apart for Yahweh if you want to be on the high priest what this whole chapter is going to go on is he's going to take on the lifestyle of the high priest but any Israelite man or woman can do it LOL that's what the right balance any Israelite among the kingdom of priests can take on the lifestyle and live as if you are the high priest pretty awesome I always knew that black the Nazarite vow was a pretty baller move but I'm excited to learn more lifestyle rule number one no drinking wine or strong drink well that like rings a bell it should in two ways should ring Two Bells
 the first Bells Noah for spell Noah yeah cuz I'll be like no I need the vineyard gets drunk and there's a problem second Bell is Aaron Sons they like in the middle of Leviticus preset set up everything is awesome and they go in with Strange Fire the Rogue liturgy they just go into the holy of holies on their own terms and later as a consequence God says through Moses rule don't drink no drinking on no drinking on the phone this job so now here right after the flood waters of curse right after that law is about a new Noah who is to dedicate themselves as someone who is righteous and blameless set apart the Yahweh and no drinking when you're Nazarite
 all the days of his his ear that he is set apart you shall not eat anything produced by the Grapevine this is just for pain. As long as you don't answer right as long as you are fulfilling your commitment to becoming an Asiago this isn't like a lifetime Val it's as long as you want to do it all the days of this vow of his nezzer no razor will pass over his hat Harry like Adam why do human who's cutting out a letter saying that he's cutting out of and eat their own hair
 what are they are they cutting scissors sharp stuff around for sure reflecting on he's going to look like Adam really yeah let the locks grow long you think the picture of Adam is you supposed to think of a barbaric human what I'm saying is I'm trying to make sense of this description what's up with the hair so it's not where you let your hair grow and then often the Shaving of hair is often a transition ritual in many cultures use but the letting of one's hair grow long is often about like coming like a beast of the field long hair so yeah it's like this person takes on the and wine and strong drink speaks his issue of fermentation in the Bible does in the same way that leaven or Yeast is like no leaven or Yeast during the after the days of Passover and it's a concept that that fermentation
 is like this distorted you're distorting something's natural form even the fermentation is a natural process there's like the concept of there's food and its pristine form but then there is food that has been rotted has become rotten or fermented so grape juice is one thing wine is Right carotid fruit of the vine and so the nausea is none don't even nothing produced by the Grapevine not even pre or post fermentation just nothing so you have a lot about don't eat from the fruit of the vine and let your hair grow long like your Primal hibben okay and that one shall be dedicated as holy to Yahweh all the days of his separation he is not to go near or touch a dead body back to the high priest couldn't ever touch a dead body
 yeah not even even berries on parents here yeah so the other people could they just be commercially in pure correct so you can let's try to go to wash space I tried it and it's not sinful to do that but for the high priests don't do it it would be because that any moment he needs to be able to be he's on, he's her call he's had stopped to go into the temple and start living like the high priest all the days of his nausea he is Holy to Yahweh but let's just say that all of a sudden death strikes somebody dies it's really suddenly next to him my Mike falls on him okay
 the verse 9 says if somebody like you not to die it's right there and they fall over and touch them and maybe it touches those long locks of hair well then you got to shave it off you have to shave his head on the day when he becomes clean he shaves it on the 7th day so he's going to be ritually a for a cycle of seven days and then you have to shave it off and then on the 8th day he will come and bring an Ascension offering that will cover for his contact with death is ritual impurity and he will reap consecrate he'll make his head holy again and then this this long-lost about when he finishes
 is that stays he needs to bring a series of offerings for himself and present them before Yahweh and when a Nazarite finishes his or her vow to cut off their hair and then put it on the fire with the offering and bring up the hair and that's Numbers Chapter 6
 okay so where are we going on here is that this whole little section is playing through the themes of Genesis 1 through 9 the first cycle of the chord Melody of the Hebrew Bible but we're doing it all in the context of the camp of Israel in the wilderness which is why I can do Eden and so all contact with all signs of death or to be sent outside the camp all situations where a brother owns a brother there to be reconciled all acts of Covenant Elan faithfulness are to be identified and put through a flood water testing so that righteousness and Seed much seed can emerge out the other side resulting in an Israel so that any of us realized and set themselves apart as a new Adam or Eve holy to God dedicated to being in the presence of God and near the Holiness of God's light source
 let's numbers 5 and 6 so you think this by conclude your thesis of this is replacing the melody because the Nazarite vow what is it other than putting a special attention on the call of God on an individual to be his intellect The Remnant to them be the new Adam to then go and while that is the role of the high priests are the high priest and then in the fractal then also the priest and then also all of his real special little thing that happens that anyone could go yeah I want identify with that and like this hyper yeah intense way I feel intense way and that's the nazirite vow yeah so these four laws are all it's a meditation on what it means for all Israel to become the kingdom of prey
 playing host to the author of all life and goodness and beauty and adapting themselves and these four laws are meditations on that has a general theme but they do it in the language and literary sequence matching test 1 through 9 through when they're done you go through a cycle of 7 and now we're all the way back to Genesis one again recreating themselves at the end of their value through a cycle of 7 when the guy was over the Melodies complete analogies complete and the next law is going to be the blessing of Aaron which is about Yahweh bringing Light May his face bring light to your and we're back today one of creation and blessing and we're just going to keep cycling over and over again wow so remarkable I just stopped
 play music that is amazing so the Famous Nails right in my imagination is John the Baptist or some other ones in the scripture Samson in the whole narrative is about how he violates its every day of his life and that's why he's not supposed to get drunk but keep getting drunk and and why he's not supposed to touch dead bodies but he just finds that honey in the carcass of a lion is like a guy have that tiny the weird all the we have details all the details and I happen to play the hair touching dead bodies not getting drunk Samsung just like brakes all the Nazarite vows and Aunt so fast I think the stamps the store so those are two main nazarites up in the Bible and John the Baptist yeah I such a strange little
 yeah that's highlighted what school is that it shows that even though the high priest was super set apart and the holy of holies was only accessible to that one person in that one role with another idea democratizing the role of the high priests that any Israelite man or woman could take on the status of role of not status but the role of the high priest and become an image it's very similar to this corporate and individual concepts of the way in the New Testament Paul talks about being in the Messiah or in the body of the Messiah so what's true of the Messiah is true of anybody who belongs to the Messiah those are categories that are actually all rooted back in the storyline of the Hebrew Bible on this concept of the anointed one cuz the high priest is the first Messiah the first anointed one who is in the Messiah that is represented by the high priest
 cool can act like Ivory skin ya go round and kind of play act as a high priest of sorts is that I could dedicate myself to Yahweh so holy and adapt my life to the fact that I get to live in the camp and y'all way to Wells and I want to honor but otherwise our kind of just doing your business as usual yeah that's totally is going to have some longer hair as a lawyer are you not going to drink wine at Passover and East Canterbury touching each other's bodies is there any corollary to this in modern Judaism still well sorry I forgot let's go back to the New Testament when Paul Paul makes a valve and that's right though yeah and he goes to Jerusalem and Chase his head and that's mentioned in the book of Acts
 yeah next chapter 21 when Paul wants to go back to Jerusalem in a bunch of his friends say like hey people don't like you the religious leaders in gruesome don't like you so Paul ya takes a Nazarite vow he goes to the temple or when you gets arrested is when he goes to the temple to offer the offering when his bowels completely sorry that's the other mention of the Nazarite vow so yes there was actually a whole section of the mishnah and the talmud that's dedicated to Flushing out more detail to the Nazarite vow
 yeah it was a practice and it's been you know transformed in developed and lots of different Christian Traditions it's kind of the equivalent of what became like a vow of solitude one of the valves of becoming a monk or a nun in the Christian tradition it's like there's this subset of people that can dedicate their lives to a higher degree of Holiness and dedication to the service of God and they become beautiful images to us of what's possible for human life totally dedicated got a normal Eaton's yeah you totally yeah that's right so that's the numbers one through six and so what's going to happen in the rest of the section we're just going to keep working the themes of portraying Israel at the Eden that is being recreated by the life and light of God's presence and as they get ready to leave and go out
 Into the Wilderness and so in the next conversation what we'll do is take on what we call Numbers Chapter 6 through 10 and it's the same thing we're going to work through the themes of Genesis 1 through 9 again beginning with the blessing of Aaron may you always shine his light just like they wanted Genesis may always shine his light on you thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week for wrapping up the first movements of the scroll of numbers where the narrator once again he guessed it rips on the themes of Genesis in 6:22 a new cycle of the melody that's going to pick this is real and it's encampment all over again so the first cycle in 1 through 6 was about establishing the camp as a new Eden this cycle is going to establish the new Eden to get ready to go today show is produced by Cooper pelts edited by Dan demel and Tyler Bailey Lyndsay Ponder with a
