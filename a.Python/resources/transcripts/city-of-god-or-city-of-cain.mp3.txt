we are walking through the biblical theme of the city in the last episode we talked about the Golden Age of Jerusalem the time under King David with Drew slum was marked by unity and peace with its neighboring Nations however this golden age doesn't last long the unity of Israel last Solomon's lifetime as well but the cracks in that Community start to show so that Solomon dies his son is not able to hold the tribes together and they split apart the tribe of Israel splits into two camps the northern kingdom later to become Samaria and the southern kingdom known as a Judah with the capital of Jerusalem remains and is Erie through the Kings scroll Jerusalem and Samaria are like between monster it's like a dragon that Sprout to head but then the two heads are constantly fighting and trying to annihilate the other one but they're both manifestations of one terrible monster today we'll look at how the prophet Micah claim
 the Jerusalem was built on human blood a pretty bleak assessment yet the story doesn't end for Jerusalem here at the center of the scroll is a poem in what we call chapter 4 it's about how in the last days the mountain of the House of Yahweh will be set up as the head of all mountains then all nations will stream to it in the nation. Hey let's all go up to the mountain of Yahweh with envisioning a day when this human City Jerusalem will become the vehicle of God's instruction and Justice today to Mackey and I look at how the city of Jerusalem intended to be the city of God came like the city of Kane I'm done call engineer listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us
John High all right we'll talk about the city if we are in the city of God Heavenly City yes but God is building a Heavenly City the God yeah has founded from all eternity okay of which human cities can potentially become a reflection yeah but that's not how we started the story of this conversation to Big Insight from last time we were talking about city as a theme was going back and bringing our attention back to the fact that when Cain built his city which is the first city in the story The Bible First City in the story The Bible there is a hyperlink there of Payne building the ear which is Hebrew for sit through that kind of like and God building the Acer. Building Azar happens in
 Jesse chapter 2 and that's God taking Adam pulling him apart into two and creating woman who Adam calls the who God says what he's going to do when he does that is provide the delivering Ally yesterday there without him Humanity cannot accomplish the task of the God has given it and so God building the woman building the azer the weird phrases in Hebrew and you're supposed to just pay attention to it because Ben Kane bills that year and days are in a year in Hebrew, second, and so you're supposed to be you're paying attention to this hyperlink of like okay God built something for man just like create life and a flourish and it's the mother of all of life of humanity and then kayn builds what in the bill Comanche Nation cities are the mother I mother of sorts of
 tension yeah womb for civilization that flourished in biblical poetry in profits in the Psalms cities are often called or describe metaphorically as women lady Zion lady Jerusalem the daughters of Jerusalem lady Babylon and so on and so if the story of Genesis 2 and 3 is about Adam and Eve choosing how are they going to flourish and multiplies to be the Earth be the image of God in the garden and the Temptation or the test is the tree the knowing the bad that represents doing it on their own terms building that rain on their own terms they take that and things go south and so in the same way when you get the story of Cain and he's got it I'm going to protect you even though you've blown it you've you've murdered your brother I'm going to protect you
 give me the sign of protection and Kane goes out and he then takes his wife build a city and you're supposed to put this on analogy of Adam and Eve taking country and so we start time I saw the city as an extension of the tree of knowing good and bad or the choice that the humans were faced with at the tree in the garden is set on an elegy to the choice that Cain is faced with as he builds the city and so it makes you maybe do some imaginative meditation of what would it look like for came to say God and you build the city and I have your wisdom and build your city with you I get it now I don't want to send the Croucher yeah ruling me anymore with the build that City that's right yeah then what would have happened what would have happened
 and what we know from a later repetition of the City theme in the Torah is the provision of the Cities of Refuge which are for those who like Cain have murdered someone but they haven't had their trial yet they can go there and their life can be protected and that's what God wanted to provide for cane so cities can become a place of preservation of Life cities can be even though they're introduced in the Bible as a big problem they can be a preservation of life and so in this imaginative world of can we build the city of God With God the place you think of is Jerusalem is not working David then right and that's what we looked at in our last conversation was in the story of David taking Jerusalem over establishing it as the capital bring the Ark of the Covenant in there in the Tabernacle that whole story
 has in the subtext of it all of these flags of going this is going to be a problem look at look at this is a problem the story of David bringing the ark to Jerusalem the celebration the sudden death of one of the priests is all packed with hyperlinks and analogies in the language of the failure of Adam and Eve in the garden yeah he build it he needs it after himself they don't follow the instructions of God and how to transport the ark the whole thing is just kind of just riddled with problems and then where does the salt go in the scroll it's leading towards the city of Jerusalem become a place of idolatry and Kings who ruled with with violence and not so we're going to focus on in this conversation okay cool we also talked about was how that founding event
 I'm bringing the ark to Jerusalem it detected it as problematic yes but as a potential Garden of Eden on Earth I mean Heaven on Earth type of place and we saw how in the Psalms that were later sung in Jerusalem by the priests the choirs they seem to imagine the Earthly city of Jerusalem as an analogy to stumble over a pointer to the a Heavenly city of God that is the source of all Humanity were a source of all the new Humanity in Psalms 46 and 87 but those Transcendent dreams eventually all came to nothing in the Earthly Jerusalem right now
so I thought we could use the anchor for the step of conversation with a poetry of profit we never read together maybe one verse from the prophet Micah I think we talked about Micah 6:8 and kind of justice video he is showing you how human God is good and what the Lord have mercy to Micah he is one of The Price is Right profits he lived in the southern Kingdom after there was a near Civil War and split a sack real quick over here so there's David and that Unity of the tribes last three exactly his lifetime and roll
 but his son Solomon had many sons will talk about that his son Solomon is appointed just came and actually excuse me the unity of Israel last Solomon's lifetime as well but the cracks in that Unity start to show so that when Solomon dies his son is not able to hold the tribes together and they split apart and so the tribes of Israel split into two Maine camps there's the tribes that go with the North
 call the northern tribes there often called Joseph sometimes Efrain or sometimes just Israel and the most of the tribes were up there and then in the South and we're talkin the north of Jerusalem north of Jerusalem Jerusalem is almost right at the boundary between the two text a little bit north of Jerusalem but close and then Judah is in the South but the Tribe of Benjamin is enclosed within to this territory in the southside of Judah and Benjamin in the South so Micah Prophet lived about two hundred years after
 the split of the two kingdoms and during those times Jerusalem became the prominent capital city of Judah in the South but the northern tribes also had a monarchy arise that wanted to build their own rifle capital city and is he read through the Kings scroll Jerusalem and Samaria are like the twin monster what's a good example it's like a dragon that Sprouts two heads but then the two heads are constantly fighting and trying to annihilate the other one to become the lawn heads up something like that but they're both manifestations of one terrible monster Micah's prophecies open with a slow head and hear the word of Yahweh that came to Micah of motor shaft
 during The Rains of a name is a bunch of kings of the Southern Kingdom to that your reins of your thumb cause and has Kia jotham ahaz Hezekiah do you think was Raising this is the vision he saw concerning two cities in Jerusalem the opening these are all focusing on Two Cities Israelites it is to Dragon Headz of the really screwed-up family that is the family of Israel is the screwed up my point of view
 so you begins listen you people's all of you listen o land and all who live on it
 Sovereign Yahweh is going to Bear witness against you Yahweh from his holy Temple which is in Jerusalem
 Yahweh is coming down from his Dwelling Place he comes down and Treads upon the high places of the land so this is like this is the Divine Temple the Heavenly City I mean it doesn't say City here but if she always Temple so here it's where this image of the Heavenly Temple of which Jerusalem was supposed to be an Earthly match like the Tabernacle was but as we're going to see here Yahweh has some things to say about how his Earthly Temple is disconnected from that my temple now so what follows is a poem The basically is a reversal of Genesis 1 the mountains melt Valley split apart like Wax before fire like water rushing down a slope the cosmos is going to collapse why because of Jacob's transgression
 of the people of Israel what is Jacob's transgression isn't it's the Marriott
 what is judah's high place that's a technical term in the process the high places during to the places where idolatries happens it would be on some Hill they would set up a shrine bowl and an altar and offer sacrifices to some illegitimate God at least illegitimate in the eyes of the prophets so what is Judith high place is a Judith whole region is Jerusalem at the place where a Dollar Tree's happening in high places is normally where you refer to these kind of low-grade many shrines to Colorado
 but Jerusalem is being described as one of these high play shrines and therefore I will make Samaria a heap of rubble a place for planting Vineyards with cheers negative cuz me and all the buildings will be removed and it'll just be, I just filled again Fields again yeah but also surprisingly optimistic you can be wifey comeback reclaimed I'll pour her stones into the valley meaning if it's on a hill and like all the stones yet Apple didn't fall down all the way there or foundations and idles will be broken to pieces you get the idea so why is this the case well chapter 20 to those who plan iniquity those who plot evil on their beds at the mornings light to carry it out because it is in their power to do it
 they covet fields and seize them
 and houses they take them they defraud people of their homes robbing them of their inheritance who was in the prophets mine here is this a king or a general or the system just like squirrely squirrely dude is just like just running a muck out in his community on his mind he picks it up 6:9 lesson Yahweh is calling to the city and to fear your name is wisdom when y'all way comes to your city with a message it's pay attention this pet wisdom ya should I forget your selfishly forgotten Treasures you Wicked house
 so I declare you innocent of dishonest scales or bags of faults weights using imagery of the marketplace here so they're being corrupt in their Commerce feelings you're wealthy people are violent those who inhabit you are liars tongue speaking the seat he goes down or 16 you all have kept the statutes of Omri and you have done the practices of the House of Ahab is the king of one of the kings of the northern tribes that features Big Time in fact he's the king of the northern tribes that gets the most airtime in the store is King soccer famously he was the Rival for the opponent of the famous Prophet Elijah and Elijah
 over a century by Mike has time so he another words what he sees is that Jerusalem and Samaria have become all the things he's describing because they are living out the practices of Ahab the carrying on the legacy of Ahab so the point here in Micah is that clearly the cities of Jerusalem is Samaria have become the opposite of the Garden of Eden you so basically all I mean since all the people in the city are participating in this is not just a king or general yeah it's like this is become the nature of the culture of the city and dishonesty and plotting violence here's a summary from chapter 3 hear this u l of Jacob you rulers of Israel who despise Justice and distort what is right you build Zion with Bloodshed and Jerusalem with wickedness
 and it goes on and talks about the leaders the priests the prophets
 adjusted a Dan of scum and villainy in the MOs Eisley it took care of you today Star Wars after the uncirculated yeah I'm a wretched Hive of scum and villainy building a city a blood he says Jerusalem is a City built on blood and it says I do a hyperlink to Abel like Cain City Kansas City
 so what What you talkin about so he's using these descriptions but like what are these descriptions correspond to a touchdown on a narrative about Solomon get underneath how is Zion built with Bloodshed that mean and what does it mean that Samaria has followed the ways of Ahab and what these little references are is hyperlinks back to moments in the story of kings that I want to go just kind of survey 22 points and we'll watch how the city of Jerusalem and the City of Samaria are both depicted as potential Eden cities on Earth that went awry and they fit into this larger portrait of the potential of the city
 so that's Micah let's go to the story of Solomon in the book of Kings
 Dunt Dunt Dunt Dunt.........................
 thanks..................
 We're going to pick up a story right at the beginning of the king scroll and we just have not really talked much about King's I have a lot of meditating I need to do on King's but the Story begins with King David as old and about to die and what were told us that he just can't keep warm
 and they put lots of layers of blankets on him and can't keep for I've been there I've been there I've been there recently yeah well I was like a nightmare right yeah okay yeah but dealing in just shivering and you just keep pile on blankets so much going on here that we're not going to have time to talk about but his courtiers get this idea of let's find a young unmarried woman who can just lay next to him in his bed to keep him warm know what's interesting the word warm is spelled with the same letters as the name of one of Noah's sons ham and that weird story what ham does with his father or his father's wife in the fuses in Vegas of us are trying to make a power move
 to usurp his father so this whole story is going to be about which son of David is going to inherit the position of power from his father and it the first sentence says he could not ham so I thought it was a Hebrew word play hyperlinking back and calling up the design pattern of the firstborn anyway it's really clever techniques and allusions to the story of Cain and Abel and two ham and his brothers are all over these chapters so what's going to happen is that one of David's sons who is guy named adonijah
 says you know what I'm going to be king and he's the firstborn from among is the first son born on all the wise that they've got a good reason to think right that's right so what's interesting is that that sounds can set himself up and have a big coronation ceremony in Jerusalem but Nathan who was Aqib prophetic counselor of David and Bathsheba who was the infamous wife David took and had sex with and then murdered her husband the son he had with Bathsheba this name Solomon
 and so Nathan and Bathsheba come up with this plan basically to try and beat out of Niger to the throne so they come up this plan where they go oh and they say to David remember that owes you took that Bathsheba you know that her son would be the King after you so you should act on that has now like today is the real thing there's no record of David ever making that promise they just come in and say that he made that promise here and they convinced David that he made that promise that's what he says like oh yes I did make that promise I should to fill it today so the whole thing is like what is this court Intrigue or so anyway they convinced kind of like also
 Jacob deceiving his father hold this whole thing here to yeah cuz you have a mother and father and a son and I'm just trying to get together to take over so basically the point is they succeed and Solomon gets installed as king and other Niger and everybody aligned with him is all the sudden afraid for their lives so this is how it chapter two begins Solomon made King chapter 21 times you near for David to die he gave it charged Solomon his son
 I am about to go the way of all the Earth he said so be strong be a man keep what Yahweh your God requires
 walk in obedience to him keep his decrees and commands his Torah is regulations like it's written in the Torah of Moses do this and you will prosper in everything you do everywhere you go you always will keep his promise to me so if you're faithful yeah but he will keep his promise to me which is if your seed your descendants are careful how they live if they're faithful with all their heart and all their nefesh all their saw this is Moses language you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of this
 so first let's say follow God's instructions and if that's true it's all of the laws of the Torah and the wisdom my offer and a lot of it's counterintuitive remember especially about the Kings like the accumulated lots of gold and silver don't marry many wives do not important Gyptian stallions into your chariot forces stuff like that also songs about to do but on David's part you're like he's some kind of acting like a Moses here might be faithful to the Covenant like don't trust all the people to do that but if you do it you can kind of heard them in the right direction
 so you know what my uncle joab Son of Sardar why did to me remember what he did to the commanders of two of Israel's armies off in there an Amazon yeah he killed them he murdered them he said their blood in a time of Peace as if it was a time of war and with that blood he staying the belt around his waist in the sandals on his feet did you skip a part of the story with insulin plant this & David's mind to get revenge or this is his idea is his idea so he's got a grudge against his relative joab here and write myself to not family members of David but people to David cared about you and he describes joab in the language of Cain
 in murdered he spilled their blood deal with him according to your wisdom as long as your wisdom as long as your wisdom says don't let his gray hair go down to the grave in peace do what you think is good as long as it involves assassinate again
 remember there's this guy shimmy the son of the benjaminites from bahurim you know the guy who call down curses on me that day that I had to leave Jerusalem Flee for my life and I'm sure that if he came down and met me at the Jordan and I swore to him I am not going to kill you with my sword you know but now you shouldn't treat him like an innocent man you're a man of wisdom you know what to do bring his gray hair down to the grave in blood
 yeah they just got a hit list here then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the city of David
 ruthless man yes this is like David turning into a mob boss yeah I got to hit list take down some of my enemies hold some grudges but yeah totally language you have wisdom do what's good to you but you know what you need to do so that is very mob language where it's like if you had to testify or something but I told him to do it was wise in his own eyes so evidently that was to kill my enemies so these two aren't the only people who died in the following chapter is the next story is about that older brother who try to make himself King he comes back and he tries you know this is like Jacob and Laban schemer trying to deceive other schemers you know so his older brother comes back and he makes a move asking if you can marry that woman they got to keep their
 born when you couldn't keep warm and Solomon interprets this as a slime move to try and regain the kingship which is another set of hyperlinks to ham and Noah and so on but essentially what he does is have adonijah executed it says down verse 23 of chapter 2 may God deal with me ever so severely that I do not judge has not paid with his life for this request so he puts herself seemed a little extreme but what you realizes he's protecting he's protecting his power he thinks that his brother's trying to scheme his way back to the surround you this right so he has his older brother assassinated
 then we're in the law of Moses was all the assassination commands so then he goes after his relatives and so here's what's interesting King Solomon was told that joab fled to the Tabernacle and he was sitting there beside the altar is always at this moment me feel so cinematic totally kill me here I'm here I'm grasping on to the office and it's like when kids are playing tag and they establish a base a company and actually the reason why that significant is because that's a legit place to go to do that yes there's a lot of the tour about like not killing someone in the courtyard
 so he goes to home base and King Solomon orders one of his Hit Men Benaiah Cinco strike him down and so right there in the courtyard of the temple Joe has murdered right there cold-blooded you could say but joab murdered in cold-blood exactness Lemak after Cain my ancestor can kill where it's at the spiral Spiral. So then with the King does To Shimmy the guy who cursed David he's shows Mercy he says you know here's the thing how about this build yourself house in Jerusalem and live there but if you ever leave the city I'm going to kill you or who is Jimmy To Shimmy is the second guy that is David said to her last night and she says if you ever leave the boundary in the city Drew
 your blood will be on your own head and still three years later what he's told this guy shimmy had to Slaves who ran away and Simi was told your slaves are in the city and so he saddled his donkey and you went to go get them and when Solomon heard about this then he had him assassinated and then after all the assassinations
 2nd Kings chapter 2 verse 46 now the kingdom was established in Solomon's hands he Consolidated power so you're saying Mike is reflecting on these stories and stories like the bloody assassination yet cuz it's interesting is that stands out is it the story of Cain Cain murders Abel and God says I'm going to protect you and so you get these stories of David has been wronged by people just like able been wrong and the wisdom he and Solomon kind of scheme up isn't like how can we be generous towards our enemies and create places of Refuge upside down instead they're like yeah let's kill kill our enemies and I think the way the Nerdist play out
 his brother makes an attempt for a power move in his court year and its immediate responses he'll pay with his life just like done joab run to the dwelling place of Yahweh you know which is a he's appealing and he's killed in the courtyard and this guy shimmy is apparently dealt with mercifully but the moment he violates the house arrest he's he's killed and this is a part of the complex portrait of Solomon and so here the first scholar who really opened my eyes to this was a scholar Jay Daniel Hayes in article that's really wonderfully titled call does the narrator come to praise Solomon or to bury him
 narrative subtlety in 1st Kings chapter 12 11 we get to the classic and chapter 3 where God is like hey I'm going to give you anything you want the story leading up to that I have mail to really figure it out because it feels like Solomon's doing a Dollar Tree right before hand that's kind of is that he married the daughter of pharaoh king of Egypt and then he sees that people are sacrificing on the high places and you just said that's the that's bad yeah and so he goes okay well then I'll just go and I'll like make that more official write essentially he said but Solomon loves y'all way and walked according to the instructions given him by his father David
 he was still offering sacrifices on high places yeah that's a pretty big thing yeah I agree cuz there's the Tabernacle in the courtyard so Solomon and in this and many other ways he's going to build the temple but then you find out who builds it was forced labor slaves which the King was not first four then he goes to offer a sacrifice on one of those important eye places in the office at the house is a on the song alter wrong alter a place where got like in the law of Moses if I go to take these down into the ground and Solomon like you know pseudo Yahweh place and that's where God meet them and says you know I'm going to give you anything you want so weird to me
 yeah it seems like the portrait of Yahweh is that of extremely patient generous meeting people in their Folly and error that's not the story salt and I was told stories, so I was like Mom and was doing everything right and so God came and said because of that I'm going to give you what help whatever you want that's right so this this is the sa article by Jay Daniel has published in the journal for the study of Old Testament many years ago but he works through from all three chapters 12 11 then you just shows like what we just did he just closely carefully starts reading these details and every step of the way
 there are aspects that can be viewed positively and aspects that can be viewed negatively his point is that it's through irony hyperlinks narrative Illusions the Solomon is depicted as a mixed bag type of figure Because by the time you get to 1st Kings 11 best of Kings he's the worst of Kings he seems like he's gone from the best of the worst and by chapter 11 he marries many foreign women besides Pharoah's daughters and you know worships other gods and so on the surface you go chapter 1 through 10 is good chapter 11 equals bad and Hayes's argument is read more closely and he's good and bad like all the way through right that's the basic the basic point so it seems to me that when Micah talks about Jerusalem as being a city founded on bloodshed
 that he has so many stories like this song on the brain so that's Remember by Mike is Dale Israel a split and become a double dragon with one had in Jerusalem the other had in Samaria Samaria was founded by a guy named hombre and basically what's happening up in the northern kingdom is you read through the book of Kings is this just powered military coup after military coup and leave military commanders win a battle get some favor build a private Army and then Proclaim themselves King and they just keep taking each other out
 so one family lasted for many generations nuts the family have Omri and home rebuilt Sumeria as the capital city and a table was his forget P son or grandson who becomes king quite some time they have is married to the famous Jezebel who was a princess from Tire up in the north remember Micah said that Samaria is a place where leaders covet they desire Gardens and Fields and then take them for themselves and they follow the ways of Umbreon Ahab so let's Ponder another story 1st Kings chapter 21 know it happened after these things everything came before obviously
 some time later there was an incident involving a Vineyard belonging to a guy named novel. He was from Jezreel
 see this Vineyard was in Jezreel but it was right close within eyesight of the Palace of Ahab to the king from his Royal Palace can look and he sees this beautiful Vineyard nice Garden said to give me to use as a garden for vegetables is all words from Genesis 1 and 2 principal is in Genesis 1 there's the different kinds of plants that God calls forth from the ground into the attic the green vegetable
 so he has a little bit of Royal vegetable garden last year I had the chance with my family I went to go teach at a school that wasn't France for a week and I got to take my family with me was really amazing experience and we stayed on a little bit longer to go travel and see some historical stuff like you do when you're in France and we went to this one region that was just packed with medieval castles
 they're all turned into museums and my kids favorite place to go and all these Castle Museum's was the kitchen and we went into one of these museums where the kitchen was all like recreated it was really remarkable to go look at a twelfth-century royal Prada anything in my mind I don't have no idea what that would look like I was just a big rim with a huge fire horse but all of you know this meat and game hanging from hooks on the ceilings piles of vegetables grown in the Royal vegetable gardens which they had recreated up around the school to see like a pantry what is a twelfth-century Kings Pantry look like and white bigger than our little Pantry covered now so anyways that's what's in my mind right now but it was such a small small minority of the
 population that got to eat the way that many people consider just like normal diet today yeah but it was Royal Feast back then so every time that we're having dinner now at the dinner table I try to remind them that we're having a a royal Feast for you and I got a nice meal and you just all the different ingredients that have been put together and all these unique ways and just the sheer luxury of it and the Spy the accessibility of Spices Thai Flavor is like normal you know Mom is any grocery store here that I know of in America has a big bisection yeah that would have been just the Hyatt to be able to get access to any of that stuff would have been just kind of luxury
 bus it's good to imagine any of you listening go ahead and Google what a medieval
 kitchen look like it's really a good education and food this is an American Standard so we can get the hyperlinks Hebrew will get a little more easy give me your Vineyard give it to me so that I can have it for my vegetable garden cuz it is right next to my house
 and I will give you a Vineyard that is more toes more good if you want I'll give it to you in money I'll give you money so you decide he wants it and he's going to he's got the money he doesn't say I'm going to take it what it says give it to me give it to me and I'll give you something more for good Indian place is like when the government comes in and says hey we're building a highway here by your house from you yeah yeah yeah
 so I never said that they have Yahweh forbid that I ever give you this into her attempts for my ancestors actually he's been great literally here right that's right so he's appealing to the land boundaries they were established in the days of Joshua and so you always assigned you to the tribes and they were if they did happen to sell property to another tribe which is a bummer yeah it's a bummer yeah this is in the Year of Jubilee regulations the whole thing is the reason you would sell your ancestral land is if you don't have enough money to cover that and you have to sell it but every seven times seven years that land is restored to the family owners but it's like a story of the king to take him too much he wants what Yahweh has not given to him you yep that's right he wants a garden
 if out the garbage can see it from your house so I went into his house Sullen and vexed English translation he is what do you say in anguish and depression man a man without his vegetables and vegetables the king just he didn't get what he wants he didn't get what he wants that's the thing and with your account and when you're working you get what you give to me how is it that just some dude just stood in his way he is playing into his house and lay down on his bed he turned away his face and he would eat no food
 he would not eat you would not eat so the irony is that Adam and Eve
 we're at the tree of good and bad right and for them it was eating by seeing Desiring taking and giving and eating and they violated the command to not eat here he wants to eat from this Garden but he cannot and so he refuses to eat this is kind of creative inversion of the eating immature but you can you see the portrait building where he's being depicted like Adam and he's here but he wants this garden and Heather is an interesting thing where that he is there's some reluctance of him to actually use his authority to take it Direct that's right and he appealed Naples appeal to your way to put this place a little bit King novels is putting they have in his place by appealing to the command of Yahweh
 but Jezebel his wife came to him and said why is it that your new off your life energy has become so depressed that you do not eat
 well he said there's a guy about a field I spoke to enough about the Israelite and I said give me your Vineyard for money or else if it's good to you I'll give you a Vineyard in its place but he said I will not give you my Vineyard
 Jezebel his wife said to him hold on
 are are you the reigning King over Israel who's the king here get up eat eat turkey let your heart be glad I will give you the vineyard of not vote Israelite Sonos Adam and Eve imagery here that's the wife who will take and give so that the king can eat their clear out of any preference for dinner
 and now she engages in deception so she's both liking to ease and it was now she's about to become a snake she wrote letters in a halves name sealing them with a seal sending letters to the elders to the Nobles living with novels in the city and she wrote a letter saying I proclaim a fast and seat novels at the head of the table
 feet to worthless men before him who this is interesting the word worthless here is a billy of two sons of Billy Alles what she says and Hebrew been I've been a belly off the word Billy all means in Hebrew worth noting translated worthless but Billy I'll be came in second temple literature one of the names for the Satan or the devil and Billy out all that Final El when the Hebrew word got shifted into Aramaic and then into Creek came to be spelled Billy our orbit liar do you know about this
 the liar yeah still not connecting okay yeah but liar is a name for the Satan or the devil or the prime spiritual evil one in the New Testament Paul references the liar
 and you're in 2nd Corinthians or 2nd Corinthians chapter 6 yeah there's a paragraph where the evil one where the Satan is referred to in Greek as beliar so it s Temple. This becomes a stand-in for the Satan and I have become compelled that that stands true even in the final stages of the formation of the Hebrew Bible so she she says put the two sons of the one worth noting which down one level is just too worthless man or two men who are representing represent the evil one exactly so let them testify against Navarro thing we heard you curse God and the King they are being accusers are false witness and take him out and stone him to death and so that's what they do
 yeah and she hires these two guys another assassination of the stone novels verse 15 when Jezebel heard the novels has been stoned and was dead she said to a Hab get up take possession of the vineyard The Vineyard that he refused to give you for money for navo that is not alive anymore but that when they have heard the novel's was dead heroes to go down to the vineyard and he took possession of it and then who appears who meets him down at the vineyard the Prophet Elijah and essentially what he says is you and your wife are going to
 pay for this with your life and it takes a while just like after that to me if it takes a while before they paid with their lives but that eventually but what happens
turn Micah the prophet Micah there's a button that has been found it on Bloodshed and people are just planning schemes to take Fields yeah yeah you're like oh yeah it's just like the story of Solomon and just like the story of Ahab and Micah actually mentioned they have later bye-bye name so let's pause ER so that we have two portraits of the human City so let's go back with Revisited the city of Kane we talked about it like then we have the city of nimrod then we had the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
 when we had Fair City the cities in Egypt and they're they're the first cities the in one generation are a source of Life giving food in time of famine but then in later generations they become a source of death with the enslavement of Israel then we looked at Jerusalem Jerusalem is the capital of a nation that splits into two and now here we are two capital cities in both of them by the time Mike that is on the scene they're both pretty corrupt and Mike is pointing Outlook they were found it this way if there's something inherently corrupt yeah it's a way to say Zion was built with Bloodshed Samaria is a place for the seizing and Desiring and seizing and taking
 what doesn't truly belong to those who desire Season Take by depicting the city's on analogy to these earlier cities in the Bible
 soda and months and it's pretty clear the analogy that's being set up it's another replay of the human condition but the portraits are different from each other so one is a king who comes to power through Court Intrigue and then it's a mix of good and bad he's told to be a wise leader but kill all your enemies you know even if they haven't done anything to you yet kill him before they do
 so that's a whole other that's a new portrait the city that's different you know that's why I guess maybe that's or like Sarah at the beginning of Exodus with Pharaoh fears what these immigrants could do and so instead of allying with them he enslaves them so in the same way Solomon's being told instead of finding a creative way to deal
 with people you can't trust you to kill him that's the wisdom of Jerusalem
 well I think my big takeaway from this conversation right now is that it's tempting it's always been tempting I think in my tradition to take the stories of the Hebrew Bible and try to kind of find the heroes in them and so in the same way Jerusalem and Samaria wild rousselin Jerusalem is the city the city of God is like and saw him in this wonderful King and King David we kind of gloss over all the problems and we discussed celebrate like hate it happened. I was using it and we've been pointing out is like embedded in the stories is this very critical and inviting perspective of the root of this it's it's corrupt and hear that corruption is focused on individuals the Kings yeah these Adam and Eve
 the Royal Priestly you know figures so it's a way of taking what in a city is always corporate and communal but its focus is it in psychologize it in the story of one person who is representative of the whole it's back to the similar themes of scarcity of fear of losing power and influence
 or were they have is the strain of not getting what are you want I desire that and I want it and this is the portrait of the human City and something about the city magnifies the magnifier we've been talking about that a lot media is just as leverage point of taking anything and just the volume turned up the potential for good and the potential for bad it's magnified so at the center of the scroll is the poem in what we call chapter 4 that is actually almost verbatim to a poem that's in Isaiah chapter 2
 but it's about how in the last days
 the mountain of the House of Yahweh will be set up as the head of all the mountains raised above the hills and All Nations will stream to it and the Nations will say let's all go up to the mountain of Yahweh to the house of the god of Jacob so he may teach us the word Torah instruct us his way as we can walk in his paths
 because from Zion the Torah will go out and the word of the Lord will go out from Jerusalem so it's envisioning a day when this human City specifically Jerusalem will become the vehicle of God's instruction and Justice which David said he was passing on Solomon but you like now that's a weird kind of wisdom and the word of y'all way which Ahab rejected when they both reminded him of the word of Galloway that it's not just that it will be followed but actually this city will become
 Center Point for all the nations to come into and so now we're back to our conversation from the last episode about somehow the relationship of Earthly Jerusalem to the Heavenly city of God the biblical poets can talk about one as if it's the other in a way that I think can feel confusing to us the right seems like he's actually talking about but you read the story is new like how will that City ever become this kind of place well and by the end of last conversation we went to Paul he starts spiritualizing it I just called Heavenly Jerusalem or not necessarily spiritualizing if but he takes the reference to refer not to the Earthly Jerusalem but rather something other the kingdom of God
 which is in heaven like
 so that's the future that Micah can see some emerging some way that the city of Jerusalem can become the city of God that brings peace and justice to all the nations so how will the Earthly Jerusalem ever become a source of heavenly life to the nation's the scroll in the Hebrew Bible that focuses on that question more than any other is the guy's a scroll which is all about A Tale of Two Cosmic cities Cosmic Jerusalem and Cosmic Babylon and only one of them will be left standing so that's when we can explore next
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're exploring the theme of the city in the scroll of Isaiah who prophesize God's judgment on Jerusalem for oppression and idolatry a fiery tests coming for Jerusalem but the purpose of the fire is to destroy what is a so that what God has called it to be will be brought out of the Flames to become the faithful city of righteousness and Justice this episode was brought to you by our podcast team producer helps associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor Dan Campbell and editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey also makes this episode and Hannah will be provided the annotations for annotated podcast in our app Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible of the unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make is free and remains free because of the generous support of thousands people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this with us
