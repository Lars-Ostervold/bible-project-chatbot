Jon All right, we’re here. We’re going to do a question response episode. Tim, hi. 
Tim Hello.
Jon Carissa.
Carissa  Hi. 
Jon And I’m Jon. We’re going to jump in and answer some questions 
from the Character of God. Long podcast series that we did.
Tim Yes. Yes.
Jon You just said it was 12 episodes. Is that what you said, Tim?
Tim I think that’s right. 12 in the final counting. And we’ve gotten more listener 
questions sent in throughout this series than ever before. Hundreds.
Jon How does that make you feel? Does it make you feel 
like, “I can’t answer everyone’s questions”?
Tim Well, it’s similar to the dynamic I noticed in pastoral 
ministry after enough years go by. There’s really just a few 
questions that are core to everybody’s question.
Carissa  The same ones.
Tim So the same. There’s probably really just about 10 key question 
questions that 200 people are all asking in different ways. 
As always, we can’t answer all but we tried to pick ones 
that each question represents 10 or more people. 
Jon And these questions will span the entire series. Or is it just about anger?
Tim No, these questions will span from our last Q and R. So basically, anger—
Carissa  Loyal love.
Tim Loyal love.

00:00:00
00:01:00  2Tim And faithfulness. Actually, faithfulness released on 
the last day of submitting questions. 
Carissa  Okay. Yeah. 
Jon So anger and loyal.
Carissa  But really, I think most of our questions are about anger. 
Tim Yeah, the anger series, which was six hours conversation, generated lots of 
really insightful, perceptive questions. So that’s mostly what we’re going to 
be talking about. God’s anger, the meaning of the cross, and ultimate death. 
Carissa  Just that.
Tim Just some light topics. 
Jon Easy, breezy.
Tim Totally. I thought we could start with actually two questions—
two ways of asking a similar question. One from Laura 
from Ohio and another one from Rob in California. 
Laura  Hi there. At first, when you described Yahweh’s wrath as him handing 
over people to their own folly, I thought you meant his wrath was passive. 
But after looking at the locust plague in Joel and some other examples 
in Scripture, I’m beginning to think it’s more nuanced than that. Can you 
help me find better words than “passive” to describe Yahweh’s wrath?
Rob Hi, this is Rob from Santa Barbara, California. You said, “God demonstrates 
his wrath by handing his people over to the natural consequences of their 
own destructive decisions”, which is certainly true. However, I can think of 
at least two specific instances where God seems to have directly inflicted 
punishment, which I don’t think you’ve mentioned. In Numbers 16, God 
causes the ground to split apart and swallow Korah and the others, along 
with their families, and then he sent fire and consumed 250 men who were 
offering incense. This seems like direct punishment to me, even though 
Numbers 26 says it was a “warning.” Then there’s the bronze serpent incident 
in Numbers 21 where “the Lord sent venomous snakes among them; [which] 
bit them and many died” because the people had been complaining. Again, 
it sounds like a direct punishment. Could you please address these and 
any other cases where God’s hand seems to be directly involved? Thanks!
Carissa  These questions are about how involved God is in sending 
consequences or punishment, and also about terminology. Should 
we be using the words “active” or “passive” or something else? 
Tim Or “direct” or “indirect”? Mm hmm. Yeah, that’s exactly right. I recall 
back, it was a long time ago that we had them. Because we were 00:03:0000:02:00  3even trying to find right languages, the three of us were talking. 
Because remember, at some point, the “phrase natural consequences” 
came up. And what that brought to my mind was, well, the word 
“natural” made me a little twitchy because our concepts of what is 
natural...And then we tend to have this varied disintegrated view of 
the universe, that there’s natural and then there’s the divine...
Jon Supernatural.
Tim  ...what God does.  So that’s supernatural. This is tricky because it’s not a 
topic in our thinking. It’s actually the framework in which most modern 
Westerners do our thinking. So we actually have to realize we’re in a 
fishbowl and stare at the glass and try and see the glass when we are 
using that language of natural, supranational. Because that’s totally 
foreign to how the biblical authors see the world. So they don’t tell these 
stories within those types of categories, natural or supernatural. 
Jon Yeah, if it’s completely passive situation where God is just allowing 
the natural consequences to unfold, well, you call that passive.
Carissa  You can categorize it that way if you wanted to use one of those categories. 
Jon One could.
Tim One could. But what I’m going to do is problematize the active-passive...
Carissa  Categories.
Tim ...categories as well. I don’t think saying that this narrative is God 
actively or directly bringing punishment, like fire or the earthquake...
Well, you mentioned, Rob, a couple of narratives where you could 
use the word “God actively” or “directly” brings an earthquake, or 
send snakes or fire, this kind of thing. Whereas other ones could 
be more passive. God hands Israel over to Babylon because of 
a broken treaty that Zedekiah broke with Nebuchadnezzar.
 So I’ve become increasingly unsatisfied with this passive-active distinction 
because the biblical authors don’t think in that category either. Either 
of those categories. So a great example of this is actually the Passover, 
the 10th plague on Egypt, where in Exodus 12, God keeps saying “I’m 
going to Passover and I’m going to visit ruin or bring about the death 
of the firstborn.” But then in Exodus 13, what God says is He’s going 
to allow the destroyer to pass through and strike the firstborn.”  
 So even in that narrative, you could say the biblical authors actually 
have a way more nuanced and sophisticated way to talk about God’s 
agency than we typically allow for the Bible to have. We want to 00:04:00
00:05:00
00:06:00  4press, was God directly involved, or was He indirectly involved? And 
the biblical authors I don’t think would understand that question.
Carissa  It is significant though that that idea of having a mediator or 
some...it seems like God uses agents to bring about destruction 
multiple times. That’s a pattern in Scripture. And I don’t know what 
that means but that seems to be significant to the authors.
Tim Totally. Yes, that’s totally right. Actually, this is something I’ve been working 
on. In the next year, start working on a twin pair of theme videos that 
we’re just going to call either life and then death. Two important design 
pattern themes that run through the whole Bible are portraits of life. And 
the way two ultimate life and life with God is eternal life in the language 
of the Garden of Eden story. Then also in the language of the Garden of 
Eden story is death. But as you leave Eden, the agents of life and death 
become the stage, becomes populated with lots of different agents.
 We looked, in our conversations, at the flood, for example, how the 
language of the flood shows that humans introduce violence and death 
into the land and so God says, “I’m going to bring about the ruin of 
humanity with the land.” So we’ve talked like the floods accelerating...
Jon The decreation.
Tim ...this decreation. So what’s super important is how the design pattern 
of the flood keeps repeating itself in all of these narratives like a ricochet 
throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible. Rob and Laura, all of the moments 
you mentioned the story in the earthquake of the sons of Korah, or the 
story of the snakes, Laura, the story of the plagues, if you pay close 
attention to these texts, they’re all built on echoing the language of the 
flood narrative. They’re further developments of this theme of the flood. 
So, for example, the earth splitting, the language of the earth splitting 
and swallowing up people is directly echoing the language of the splitting 
of the skies and the water. In the flood story, the heavens are split so 
that the water comes down. In the Korah narrative, the earth splits.
 So even to call the Korah narrative God directly bringing justice, if you’re 
standing there, you wouldn’t see God. What you would see as an earthquake. 
So the earth is the agent of divine justice in that narrative in Korah and 
his rebellion, which is also true of the flood narrative. Are you with me? 
Jon I’m with you. But I think the distinction that people may be trying to tease 
out is, did God directly caused the earth to split? Or is the earth splitting a 
natural consequence of some other person’s decision that God allowed?
Tim Well, exactly. I don’t think the biblical authors would...
they would say that doesn’t make any sense. 00:08:00
00:09:0000:07:00  5Jon But it does make sense. 
Tim Why does it make sense?
Carissa  Is the question kind of more about God’s character and His disposition 
toward people? Like is He involved in bringing punishment because 
He’s just super angry with people? Or is He just turning away and 
allowing people to experience their own consequences? And for 
some people, that’s a significant difference. Is that the question?
Jon Yeah. Well, I think what’s happening is, Tim, you’re saying, there’s a more 
nuanced way to think about this than a simple either-or. But something 
about our conversation has led a number of people to kind of something 
clicked in their brain and they’re like, “Oh, yeah, okay. So God isn’t just out 
trying to zap me. He is patient and He’s letting things unfold. And the things 
that I’m doing is creating the chaos that’s destroying me.” That makes sense. 
 So then that leads you to think, “Oh, okay, so God isn’t actively trying 
to be angry and wrathful at me.” It’s almost like this cosmic karma 
kind of thing, which is like, “I’m getting what I deserve.” And so God 
feels very passive in that situation. I think what Laura and Rob are 
saying is that doesn’t seem to really fully explain the portrait of God 
in the Bible. Because then you get to these narratives where God 
seems a lot more involved than that. So you’re saying, yes, He is, 
the problem is in our dichotomy here, not in...it’s not either-or.
Tim That’s right. 
Jon But the way you’re putting it, the way that you said biblical authors 
wouldn’t understand what you mean by “was this an earth quick or was 
this God?” I guess I can understand that as like an ancient thinker.
Carissa  Yeah. 
Tim Even as a modern thinker.
Jon Really?
Tim I think so. I’m not trying to get weird prophecy type here. I’m just saying 
it’s a sophisticated way of thinking about cause-effect sequences. 
There are many different ways of talking about levels of cause and 
agency. So there’s ultimate causes. There’s necessary cause...This 
is like Aristotle. I don’t know. Sufficient causes, proximate causes, 
immediate causes, right? We just assume this in our minds. 
 In Psalm 104, for example, which is a creation poem praising God 
for all of these different things happening in the different tiers of the 
cosmos. There’s this part in the middle of the poem where it says, 00:11:0000:10:00  6“Praise God for His works.” It says “For his works.” And it starts naming 
creatures in the sea. And then it says, “The ships of humans that go 
on the sea” but humans made those ships. For the poet, that would be 
a proximate or immediate cause. But the whole poem is celebrating 
God’s ultimate agency, causality as the originator of all that exists.
 So in the same way, even though humans ruin the land with their 
violence, God is the ultimate one who is either going to allow it to go on 
or allow creation to collapse in on itself. But ultimately, it’s God allows 
it. It’s as much direct as it is passive. And that’s why I just don’t think 
active or passive are terms that help us understand these narratives.
Jon Okay.
Tim I think at core, if we’re letting Genesis 1 through 11 set the melody for 
the rest of the Hebrew Bible, it’s that God’s posture in the story is to 
generously create a safe, ordered, stable place, the dry land, and then 
within the dry land, a sacred hub of space in the middle of it all that’s 
the source of life flowing out from the river, and so on going out to it. 
So the moment that humans do something to threaten sacred space 
or threaten stability, God will allow the cosmos to collapse back in on 
itself. And that’s what’s happening with the flood. But that’s their view of 
earthquakes too. That’s an earthquake is God no longer sustaining the 
pillars of the earth and allowing the pillars of the earth to crumble.
Jon And there is a sense that God will speed that up.
Tim Totally. 
Jon Which it feels more active as well. 
Tim Yeah, totally. But it’s the same with locusts plague. It’s 
animals. Dangerous animals. So in the garden, it’s cultivated. 
So God keeps the dangerous animals out. 
Jon Let’s talk about locusts. If there is a big plague of locusts because 
of some environmental conditions, there was the right conditions. 
There was enough food for them, they laid enough eggs and they’re 
born and they need a lot of food. That’s like the natural explanation 
of why there’s all these locusts. And let’s say that God sees that 
coming and He’s like, “That’s great.” That’s a fitting consequence for 
Egypt. I’m going to let those locusts come. That feels kind of...
Tim Oh, and you’re talking about in the plagues on Egypt?
Jon In the Plague on Egypt. 
Tim Yeah, okay. Got it. Got it.00:14:0000:12:00
00:13:00  7Jon It feels kind of passive but still in some way active because He could 
have stopped the locusts from coming. Or there’s another situation 
where God’s like, “Egypt needs some locusts and so I’m going to 
plant some locusts seed over here and I’m going to set up the perfect 
conditions so that the locusts could come. And then I’m going to 
direct them over to Egypt.” And that feels even way more direct.
Tim Sure. 
Jon I think in every situation you can do a thought experiment of sorts 
of how actively involved was God in that moment of wrath.
Tim yes.
Jon What I hear you saying is you don’t even want me 
to try to think in those dimensions.
Tim No. Because notice what you had to do is make up a little story 
and insert that and read the biblical narrative in light of your little 
hidden divine figure who plants eggs or something. Right? 
Jon Yeah.
Tim So the narrative isn’t trying actually to create a systematic, comprehensive 
philosophical account of God’s agency in the world. What the biblical 
authors want us to know is that God is the one who provides the relative 
stability of the cosmos that keeps us safe. And it’s real. But that stability 
is sometimes compromised. And whenever that stability is compromised 
and chaos breaks in, it’s a moment of...well, there’s two accounts of it. 
One is that it’s because of human evil, flood story, the Korah story, the 
locusts in Joel, it’s all because of Israel breaking the covenant. It distorts 
the moral order, and therefore distorts the cosmic order.  
 But then you get the book of Job and Ecclesiastes who come along and 
say “but not always.” Sometimes there’s just the Leviathan hanging out 
there. And he bites your hand off because he’s a Leviathan. And it’s not 
because God hates you. It’s wrapped up in the mystery of the cosmos.
Carissa  So that’s to make sure that readers or the audience 
doesn’t attribute every act to God as the cause
Tim Yeah, that’s right. Or they don’t want us to assume—this is argument 
of Job—just because chaos breaks out in someone’s life and the 
stability of their order is shattered to pieces doesn’t mean that they 
were a covenant violator like the generation of the flood or like 
the...it might mean that, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that.00:15:00
00:16:00  8 Again, all I’m trying to do is for years, and I’ll be doing this till the day I 
die, is trying to reorient my worldview to at least read sympathetically, 
and try and understand what the biblical authors...how they see the world 
and how they depict these things is that God is the one who has carved 
out a little snow globe of stability. But that stability is always under threat 
of the waters above, and the waters below and of the dry land cracking 
apart. And of wild, dangerous animals from the wilderness invading their 
way into the cultivated order of the sacred garden. Those are the two. So 
you have dangers above and below, and you have dangerous outside.
Jon And what we can say is that when this order is fractured, God will do a 
number of different things. Sometimes just be patient. Sometimes He’ll 
actually speed it up, and sometimes He will fix it. I think we kind of want 
this systematic explanation for why God does what in what situation.
Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Jon And what I’m hearing is that’s not the questions 
the biblical authors are wrestling with. 
Tim Yeah. Or it’s just if the Bible was designed to give us that kind of 
comprehensive explanation, Christians wouldn’t have been arguing 
vehemently about this for 2000 years. So it’s as if the Bible stakes 
out in arena of core convictions within which we can then wrestle 
with these complex issues. What the biblical authors want us to know 
is that God’s character is just and that it’s generous and good.
Jon And I think that’s ultimately what people want to know. Is God good? 
Carissa  Yeah. That’s where the question is coming from.
Tim Yeah, totally. That’s right.
Carissa  His disposition.
Tim So you read the severe stories of God’s judgment, like in the Pentateuch, you 
know, Rob, you mentioned the story of Korah with the earthquake and the 
lightning, and so on. But again, part of it is also each narrative is also just one 
little tile of the bigger Mosaic. There’s the whole Hebrew Bible. For example, 
in that, that story is set in the middle of seven rebellion stories in numbers 
11 to 21. And you have to read them all together, and they’re all developing 
one bigger picture. That helps make sense of each individual one. Anyhow.
Carissa  The terminology is not passive or active. It’s the terminology used by 
the biblical authors is more this terminology of handing over, but it’s 
not getting into the active-passive debate. But it’s more emphasizing 
the consistency of maybe what happens with how the people acted. 
There’s consistency there. And even in Korah’s rebellion in Numbers 00:17:00
00:18:00
00:19:00  916, that people are complaining about the land that they’re in, and 
then the land swallows them up. And the people are offering incense 
and then fire consumes them. It’s like there’s still a consistency in 
how the story plays out even though it feels very destructive.
Tim Yeah. Dude, Number 16. This is actually really amazing. Because 
they’re rebelling against Moses and the high priest who is the anointed 
one. It’s a story about the rebellion of God’s people against their own 
Anointed One. Come now. It’s a rebellion against their own Messiah, 
and it results in their self-destruction. They reject their Messiah Aaron, 
the anointed high priest and that results in their ruin. So there’s always 
more going on in the stories than just what’s happening on maybe 
your first reading. There’s a lot. But that’s true of the whole Bible.
 One other thought. You were making that really good point, Carissa, 
and then it made me realize too these conversations about anger of 
God were not meant to be a comprehensive study of the theme of 
divine judgment. I was isolating the phrase, and there was hot anger 
to God. And what you notice is when you study that phrase, one of the 
most consistent companion phrases is “and He handed them over.” So 
that’s why I drew our attention to that handing them over theme.
 So there is this important leak between God’s anger and handing people 
over. But there are many narratives about God hiding His face, the 
cosmos collapses, somebody’s life collapses, where God’s anger is not 
mentioned. I don’t know if we’re going to do a theme study on that.
Carissa  In Sodom and Gomorrah, His anger is not mentioned there.
Tim Correct.
Carissa  Which we’d think it is because that there’s such a strong 
connection with judgment in that passage.
Tim Correct. And that itself is another...it’s like the flood. God 
promised but that he wouldn’t rain. But what He does in...
Jon In the flood story He promises no more flood.
Tim In flood story. no more flood or rain. But the next time the word 
rain is used in the book of Genesis is the raining of the fire.
Carissa  It seems like a little loophole.
Tim I know. I thought about that, too. But it’s another instance of the cosmos 
collapsing. In this time, it turns lightning. Raining fire is a standard Hebrew 
phrase for “lightning”. It’s lightning. And you were told in Genesis 14 that 00:20:00
00:21:00  10the land is full of these pits that have all of this flammable sulfur in it. Or 
pitch and tar. Lightning ball on one of those? It’s going to go out. Anyway. 
Carissa  Yeah.
Tim Carissa did a great summary. I keep problematizing things, 
and Jon you’re sitting there looking unsatisfied.
Carissa  There are problems. Especially with Korah’s rebellion, even when we try 
to understand what the authors are doing with that story and how it fits 
in the overall storyline, it’s still Korah and all of the family members that 
are associated with Korah, including their little ones. I remember reading 
that specifically. The authors included that it was also little ones who 
were standing at the tents, and they’re all swallowed any earth. And I 
think that we have a question about that too. Community judgment or...
Tim  Yeah, that’s right. From Isaak in Germany. 
Isaak  Hi, I’m Isaak from Aachen, Germany. First of all, thank you for all the 
work you’ve put into the Bible Project. I’ve learned so much from 
all the resources you provide. I struggle with the notion that God is 
handing over frequently targets a whole group of people, often based 
on the actions of a few. I realize that I view this in the context of my 
individualistic culture. However, that sometimes feels unfair to me. How 
can I better understand God’s love, wrath, and justice in this context?  
Tim Excellent question. Isaac, you are expressing very 
articulately, something that many, many, many people, 
including the three of us, I’m certain, have felt.
Carissa  And it’s true that sin affects the whole community, even people who don’t 
deserve it. Our parents’ problems affect us and so on and so on. So maybe 
there’s something that’s true about that in the stories of Scripture too 
where it feels unjust, but it’s also kind of the way that the world works.
Tim You’re saying that even within hyper-individualized Western culture, if 
you really think about it, it doesn’t take too much time to get the fact 
that my decisions affect the people around me. My negative decisions. 
Carissa  Yeah. The negative consequences of my actions 
will unjustly fall on the people around me.
Tim Yeah. And whether it’s generational or my neighbor. 
Carissa  Yeah.
Tim Yeah. I think that’s one helpful way to go with this. Isaak, you put your 
thumb on another part, which is I think there is a difference of cultural 
worldview and a different way of viewing the human individual and 00:23:0000:22:00
00:24:00  11their relationship to the community. And you’re right. Every significant 
philosophical, political, and economic movement in the West over the last 
400 years has been about creating this new thing called the individual 
who is the autonomous. And if they have enough privilege and status, 
they can be mobile and create a whole life independence from their tribe 
and family. You can go move away, get a job, never need anything from 
your parents. I mean, it’s just I think unhealthy way to be a human being 
but. But it’s our cultural setting. So I think you’re right, we read these 
narratives with an extra layer of strangeness. It feels extra foreign to us. 
Jon Help me understand. The tension though is not whether or not I believe 
other people’s actions will affect me. Because even in a hyper-individualistic 
society, I might completely tie myself off from family and maybe my 
friend and move somewhere and try to be as individualistic and rustic 
as possible. “Heck, I’ll move to Alaska.” But I can’t escape the fact that 
I still live in civilization. Or even if I move out into the woods, I’m going 
to be dealing with the consequences of bears and moose and stuff. 
There’s no situation where I’m purely only affected by my decisions.
 So I don’t think the conflict here is realizing that other people’s decisions 
affect me. It’s that is it fair to be held accountable for other people’s 
decisions? Like if there’s some sort of final judgment or if God’s going 
to intervene and start giving consequences out, shouldn’t He be able 
to tease out the difference between the people in the community 
that caused it and the people who were just along for the ride?
Tim Correct. Actually, I need to do more work on this theme but I’m convinced 
it’s there. I think this theme of one person acting and their evil bearing 
consequences on the many or the many acting, and then it creates an unfair 
circumstance for the one. And this is a major theme that gets inverted and 
turned over in all these narratives in the Hebrew Bible. It is really interesting. 
 One significant time it comes up is when God says, “Should I tell Abraham 
that I’m going to bring ruin on Sodom and Gomorrah?” Because he says, 
“The outcry against the cities has risen up to me.” And that’s the blood 
of Abel. The design pattern. So the outcry of the poor and oppressed. 
So God says, “Should I hide from Abraham?” And He says it while 
Abraham standing right there. It’s like “Carissa, should I tell you...?”
Carissa  It’s like a parent talking to their partner in front of their child.
Tim Totally. So Abraham gets in God’s face. He says, “What? My nephew’s there. 
And he’s not perfect, but he’s like...he counted him among the righteous.”
Carissa  But isn’t the reason that Abraham appeals to God 
because surely the just Judge wouldn’t do that.00:27:0000:26:0000:25:00  12Tim Correct. So in other words, Abraham is afraid that God’s about to 
violate His own character by doing one of these cosmos...
Jon By zapping Sodom and Gomorrah while there’s a righteous person there.
Carissa  Which is interesting, because, okay, in this communal society, 
non-individualistic culture, Abraham still in the story is 
discerning between the individual and the community.
Tim Absolutely. Yeah, that’s right. And notice God’s the one to get 
Abraham talking in the first place by speaking in His presence.
Jon Then they start negotiating.
Tim And then they start what you think is negotiation. But then you realize 
that every turn God just says yes. God never bargains. Abraham’s just 
like, “ 45?” and Gods like, “Yes. I will forgive the city on account of 5.”
Carissa  The worst bargainer ever.
Tim Totally. “ 40,” “yes.” “30?” “Yes.” “20?” “Yes.” I mean, the repetition is 
driving home that God will allow the righteousness are the one to cover 
for the sins of the many, or at least the righteousness in that story of the 
few. In that case, Lot’s righteousness is not sufficient to cover for the 
many. Well, it’s more complex. But the point is that narrative is raising 
this theme that you’re saying, Isaak. It’s problematizing it. And Abraham 
is saying, “Wouldn’t be just for you to let the whole cosmos of Sodom 
and Gomorrah, the little mini Cosmos collapse on that account.”
 So I think the Korah narrative, we mentioned earlier, is inverting that. 
What God says to Moses when the leaders with Korah rebel is “I’m done 
with all these people,” which has happened like four or five times now. 
And Moses says, “Will you…” Here, I’m going to quote it. So what Moses 
says to God is, “Oh, God, God of the ruach of all flesh, when one person 
sins, will you be angry with all of them?” So Moses raises the issue again 
just like Abraham did. But this time it’s the inverse. It’s when one person 
sins and leads the rest into rebellion, will you punish everybody? 
 Another inversion of this is Daniel. Daniel is sitting in Babylon through 
no fault of his own. He’s legit. But yet he will take personal...this is in 
Daniel 9. He’ll take personal responsibility for the entire history of his 
ancestor’s rebellion against God. So in that case, he doesn’t differentiate 
his individual self from his tribe. And even though he’s righteous, he 
will count himself among the many sinful people. So there’s something 
happening here. The biblical narrative is exploring explicitly this theme 
about God’s fairness, and about how individuals and their community’s 
sins and consequences relate to each other. And it’s nuanced I think. 00:30:0000:29:0000:28:00  13And it’s all leading up forward to the suffering servant, who will be the 
one, in Isaiah, who bears the sins of the many. And then Jesus takes that 
mantle upon Himself, as the one who dies for the sins of the many.
Jon Paul summarizes this in Romans. Right? That came through one. 
Tim Oh, that’s right.
Jon So, through that One, all have died. And in the same way, 
life comes through the One so many can live.
Tim Yeah. “So Isaak, you stand with Abraham in being concerned about God’s 
character and God’s justice. We’re back to that meta motif of the Hebrew 
Bible is the mosaic. I mean, it’s hard to do, but it’s like all these stories on 
their own are working together towards this bigger depiction or exploration 
of these themes. And you have to take each of these individual narratives 
on their own, but then let this mosaic emerge. That’s pretty more nuanced 
than I usually give credit to. I don’t know if that makes any sense.
Carissa  Yeah. When I read this question, I was trying to think about the question 
behind the question. And I think he states it at the end that sometimes 
it feels unfair. So it’s a question of God’s fairness or justice, how God 
views people in those moments when the community is suffering for 
a sin that...Or maybe not even for a sin, but just because of wicked 
systems because of whatever reason people are suffering. Where is God 
in that? And where’s His fairness? And I don’t know the answer to that. 
But I think, as I was reflecting on this, some of the things that came to 
mind are just, well, this verse God doesn’t delight in people suffering.
 Well, actually, this whole chapter, Ezekiel 18, starts off with that parable, 
that the children’s teeth are set on edge because of the parents’ sin, 
and the people are complaining that...or they’re actually saying, “We’re 
in exile because of our parents. We didn’t deserve this.” And God’s 
answer to them is, “No, I don’t really work like that. You’re in exile 
because of your own stuff.” So He’s addressing that same question. 
But at the end of that passage, God’s saying that “Hey, I don’t delight 
in the suffering of the wicked. Any suffering that comes upon people, 
my hope is that they would turn from their sin and turn to me.” 
 It’s like, again, that picture of God as compassionate as always wanting 
people to turn back to Him. For me, that’s what I want to remember in 
those moments of like, man, there’s so much suffering going on in the 
world, and it is unfair. That’s the only thing maybe that gives me comfort 
is God’s compassion toward that. I don’t know if that makes sense.
Tim Yeah, it does make sense. Something that’s emerging out of all these 
questions we’ve talked about so far, which is only three, but they’re 00:33:0000:32:0000:31:00  14whoppers, something that’s sinking in with me more, I feel like it’s taken 
me a long time, when we come to these huge topics in the Bible, the 
Christians and Jews have been arguing about for millennia. When I see 
all of these different camps staking out different viewpoints on these 
issues, to me that becomes like a little flag saying, maybe the function 
of the Bible isn’t to give us clarity. But it’s trying to create the venue 
within which we go to wrestle with God with our deepest questions. 
And what we discover is not a systematic answer. What we discover 
is a portrait of God’s character that emerges throughout the story 
that we are to take with us as we go into the complexities of reality, 
and justice and suffering and death and pain and joy. And that kind 
of becomes like a north star guiding us through a complex world.
Carissa  Yeah. God’s character is the north star, and also the function of each of 
these stories in the broader narrative. Those are maybe the two main 
questions that can give us more solid answers than a category or a system. 
Tim All right. Let’s take on a question from Kayleigh Lewis. 
Kayleigh  Hey, guys, this is Kayleigh from South Africa. My question is about the 
description of God in Psalm 2. It seems strange that the psalm speaks of 
God’s wrath being quickly kindled, or flaring up in a moment — which 
sounds like the opposite of being slow to anger. I’m pretty sure the 
psalmist was familiar with the passage from Exodus 34, but why does 
there seem to be a contradiction? Thanks and keep up the great work.
Tim So good. So perceptive.
Jon Psalm 2.
Tim Thanks, Kayleigh. What you notice is there’s a phrase in Psalm 2 that 
describes someone’s anger, whether it’s God’s or someone else’s. 
We’ll talk about that. But it says “quick to anger”. Obviously, you notice 
that in contrast to the phrase “slow to anger.” First of all, gold star for 
just noticing this inversion of anger language. But I think it’s actually 
a good example of maybe applying what we were just talking about, 
about this way of engaging the Bible that thinks both in terms of the 
little tree I’m looking at, but always keep an eye on the forest. 
Jon What’s the verse in question here?
Carissa  Psalm 2:12. It says, this is NIV, “Kiss his son, or he will be angry 
and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare 
up in a moment.” Blessed are all who take refuge in him.”
Tim Or in Hebrew, “It takes little for his nose to burn.”
Carissa  Is that the literal?  00:34:00
00:35:00
00:36:00  15Tim Yes. So one important distinction here is that this is the anger of the 
Messianic King. And his anger is directed towards the tyrants and corrupt 
rulers of this world who are introducing the opening paragraph of the 
poem. So the bad guys are in the opening and closing paragraphs. So you 
know, they’re thinking of your Nebchadnezzars and your and Sennacheribs 
and your Ashurbanipals, and all the other bad guys in the Bible.
Jon All the kings.
Tim All the king. 
Jon All the bad kings. 
Tim Yeah. Imperial tyrants. So first of all, if you have never 
lived under one of those or in the nation, enslaved by 
one of those, you know, it’s always good to be...
Jon Try to be empathetic.
Tim ...empathetic that all the people who wrote the Bible lived under 
those kinds of tyrants. So the hope in Psalm 2 is for a Mashiach, 
an anointed one, that Yahweh will raise up who will confront 
those nations. And in verse 9, break them with a rod of iron and 
shatter them like earthenware. Welcome to the Psalms.
Carissa  This is an example of God’s anger being good in the eyes of the psalmist 
that it’s just...it’s bringing justice for those who are oppressed. 
Tim Yeah. And specifically, that God employs an agent, namely, the Messianic 
son. And with evil tyrants, He’s quick to get angry and will bring them what 
they have coming to them. So that’s a portrait of the Messianic king in Psalm 
2. This is Psalm 2. There’s 148 more. So this is just the first little tile, so to 
speak, in the mosaic of the Messianic King in the book of Psalms. So, as you 
go on through the book of Psalms, what you discover about the identity of 
this look for messianic King, I mean, he’s breaking heads here in Psalm 2. But 
then when you move forward, that portrait gets made a little more complex.
Carissa  Totally. Even just the next psalm, Psalm 3, the psalm of 
David the king, when he fled from his son, Absalom.
Tim Exactly.
Carissa  Like not just other kings, but his family member. 
Tim Yes. David is one of the main portraits or figures of this anointed king, 
and the first collection of Psalms from 3 to 14 shows him on the run, 
hiding, powerless, weak, and crying out to God for help. You’re like, 
“Oh, so that’s what it looks like when God sends a messianic King 
is he’s powerless and he cries out for God to vindicate him.” 00:37:00
00:38:00  16 Carissa, you’ve worked extensively in the next section of Psalms 15 
to 24. And it’s very much the same. It’s like Psalm 22, for example.
Carissa  Totally, yeah. I think you were going here, but the portrait of the 
Messianic King is the afflicted one. He’s the poor. He’s the afflicted.
Tim This is a good example where the biblical authors will often begin a 
book with one statement and then they’ll go on to explore it as the 
book goes on, and wit and problematizing that and showing like, 
but then look at this, and then look at this, and then think from this 
angle, and think from this story, and then from this poem. And then 
you walk away with a much richer picture of how that messianic 
King is going to bring his authority over the evil nations.
Jon What’s interesting is that’s a much different type of hermeneutic 
than I think most people were taught in the church. From 
maybe a specific tradition. Which is, if you find a verse like that 
in Psalm two that says, “Don’t make the Messiah angry...
Tim He also breaks your head.
Jon Or specifically His wrath is quickly kindled, you can then take that, 
attach that verse to an idea, which is the Messiah is going to throw down 
fast. And then that’s your proof text. That’s one type of hermeneutic. 
Where I hear you saying that there’s this other hermeneutic that 
there’s all these portraits and it creates a mosaic. And if you really 
want to figure out how the biblical authors think of it, you can’t just 
pull out any one verse card. You have to look at them all together.
Tim Correct. 
Carissa  I think that’s what Kayleigh is bringing up too is that, okay, so there’s 
a portrait of God being slow to anger and then there’s a portrait of 
the Anointed One being quick to anger. So it is a complex portrait
Tim  Yeah, it’s a surface tension.
Carissa  Yeah, it’s a surface tension.
Tim This is great. Kayleigh used the words “there seems to be a contradiction.” 
So I guess the question is, what constitutes a contradiction within a book? 
It actually has a lot to do with my assumptions about how the book works. 
Is it a contradiction that in a cookbook there’s like a recipe with carrots and 
a recipe without carrots? Well, no, because I don’t expect a recipe book 
to be all the same. But somehow we do expect the Bible to work together 
with a kind of systematized coherence that I think is foreign to how it 
was actually designed to work. And this explains I think a lot of modern 
Westerners’ frustration with the Bible. Or that when we create too much 00:41:0000:40:0000:39:00  17order out of the Bible, and then you let somebody just go read it from page 
one, well, their faith is scandalized because it doesn’t read as smoothly as 
the systematized version of the Bible that my tradition gave me. I think what 
we’re trying to explore in this project is getting into the ancient Israelite 
author’s way of understanding these texts by how they were put together.
Jon So to say that God is slow to anger doesn’t mean that God’s Messiah...
Well, God’s Messiah, you would imagine, especially if they’re from a 
Christian theology, which is that Jesus is God incarnate, that then the 
Messiah would be slow to anger. But if the Messiah is slow to anger, that 
doesn’t mean that Messiah can’t get angry quickly. In a general sense, 
characteristic, I could say if someone that’s a patient person, that doesn’t 
mean that there’s not going to be situation where you find that person...
Tim Sure. 
Carissa  Okay. The parent analogy helps me so much I think with anger. 
I could imagine a parent being patient and slow to anger as 
a general character quality. And then someone bullies their 
kid in front of them and they’re like, “Oh, I’m pissed.”
Jon What’s interesting is that the context of Psalm 2 are these rulers 
who have been getting away with what they’re doing for a long 
time. In a sense, God’s been letting it happen. And the Messiah 
is coming and now he’s saying, “Okay, enough stuff.”
Tim Yeah, that’s good. That’s a good way of putting it. 
You guys want one more little tidbit?
Carissa  Yeah.
Tim Super nerdy thought. I looked this up after Kayleigh’s question 
because I remember this from long time ago. In the book of Revelation, 
Psalm 2 gets quoted and alluded to multiple times. And there’s a 
passage in Revelation 12 that’s all developing design patterns from 
the seed of the woman and the snake in Revelation 12, about this 
woman who gives birth to a male son, and then there’s a dragon that 
tries to eat the male son and so on. But what happens is that...
Jon Verse 5?
Tim Yes. In Revelation 12:5, she gives birth to a son, a male son, who is going 
to...and John uses the Greek word poimainein, which means to shepherd. 
He’s going to shepherd the nations with a rod of iron. And he’s quoting 
from Psalm 2:9, which is right before when the Messianic son gets 
angry. So instead of having “shatter the nations,” John has “shepherd 00:43:0000:42:00  18the nations.” What’s happening here? The letters of the Hebrew word 
“shatter” are ra’a’. The letters of the Hebrew word “to shepherd” are ra’a’. 
Jon Oh, same.
Tim Yeah. In fact, the Greek Septuagint translated ra’a’ not as “shatter” but as 
“shepherd.” So what John’s doing here is he’s actually picking up the image 
of Psalm 2 from the Septuagint but he’s reading that shattering of heads 
in light of the whole book of Psalms development of the Messianic King, 
which is the king is going to become the shepherd who lays down his life 
for the sheep. That’s how he delivers and confronts the evil of the nations. 
Carissa  Yeah, talk about a complex portrait.
Tim Totally. This is so important. So this shows us how John read Psalm two. He 
didn’t take some two verse nine out of context. He’s reading that line, in light 
of where the whole trajectory of the Hebrew Bible is going with this point 
of the anointed one. And that guides him to an interpretation of Psalm 2:9, 
that inverts shattering to shepherding. Anyway, I’ve always thought that...
Jon And then translated in NIV as a “rule”. 
Tim ESV has “rule”. Oh, because “shepherd” is a common image of King in 
the Hebrew Bible. The king is a shepherd. So to shepherd is to rule. 
Jon Okay.
Tim But their translation of ruling the nations maybe hides the...
Carissa  Discrepancy or the different use.
Tim Yeah, the different use. Because the shepherd who is struck on behalf 
of the sheep is a core image in Isaiah and in the book of Zechariah.
Jon The Messiah in the Revelation does shatter some stuff.
Tim What’s that? Oh, well, yes, that’s technically true. But you get 
into these texts, and they’re all doing things that are a little more 
sophisticated than maybe our proxy charts allow them to. 
Jon Okay. We’re not going to get through as many questions as we 
probably had hoped. But that’s typical. But let’s do one more that 
will likely be a doozy. And it’s from Sarah Allen in Wisconsin. 
Sarah  Hi, Tim, John, and Carissa. My name is Sara Allen and I’m from 
Madison, Wisconsin. In relation to the storyline of Jesus taking the 
place of rebellious Israel by being “handed over” to the Roman 
oppressors, what did he accomplish by that substitution if Israel 
was still destroyed by Rome anyway? Thanks for all you do.00:45:00
00:46:0000:44:00  19Jon I was asking this question.
Carissa  Yeah, I remember that. 
Jon And I reflected on it a bit more and I felt like I settled in on the 
question a little bit. But I want to hear what you have to say.
Tim I’ve been thinking about that conversation three of us had a lot too. I’ve 
had two things come to mind as I process that more. One is Jesus is 
introduced in the gospels as beginning His public mission within a renewal 
movement started by John the Baptist. And that renewal movement was 
saying, the axe is at the root of the tree. Don’t think that you are part of 
Abraham’s family just by bloodline alone. To truly be a part of the New 
Covenant Israel that the prophets anticipated is to come out of Israel, and 
be a part of the New Covenant Israel that God’s creating right here right 
now. And then Jesus sees Himself as creating the New Covenant Israel 
within the national state or whatever, larger group, and so on. This is classic 
faithful remnant themes in the Hebrew Bible. There’s always been just...
Jon Paul says not all Israel is Israel.
Tim Correct. Correct. So for what Israel is Jesus dying, you could say? 
Well, for all Israel. But for whom is it effective? Or for whom does 
it actually do something? Well, there’s a whole bunch of people 
that rejected Jesus and they didn’t follow the Sermon on the 
Mount and it resulted in a revolt against Rome and Rome came and 
clobbered the place. But there were a whole bunch of Israelites, as 
Jesus defined them, which is those who follow His teachings.
Jon They become a remnant.
Tim Yeah, totally. So for them, Jesus’ death and His resurrection became this 
gateway to a whole new humanity. And that’s how they started to talk 
about it was that Jesus was the start of a new humanity. So that’s one 
layer is that the city being conquered by Rome doesn’t negate Jesus’ 
vision of kickstarting the kingdom of God’s new covenant humans.
Jon Because Rome didn’t take that out.
Tim Rome didn’t take that out. And they tried.
Jon And they tried.
Tim For hundreds of years. And they never grew succeeded.
Jon And it just grew.
Tim And it just grew. And the reason it grew was because they 
believed in the resurrection and they gave their lives like Jesus 00:49:0000:48:0000:47:00  20as an act of total faith and surrender in the God life. So over that 
Israel, and then all the Gentiles who got in on that Israel...
Jon Who grafted in. 
Tim ...who grafted in as Paul says, they are in Israel. Again, I’m just trying 
to develop the portrait of the apostles over whom death has no power 
in theory. And what kind of death? Well, Jesus said, “People can kill 
you, but that’s all they can do. They can affect your participation in the 
resurrection and new creation,” which is ultimate life. So that’s one level. 
I don’t know if you ever thought about that. I’ve one other thought.
Jon Well, that’s where I kind of was landing. And I think what’s uncomfortable 
with that is, what do you do with Israel then that wasn’t the remnant? 
Because there are all these promises to Israel. And I think people want 
to be faithful to saying, maybe there’s some of these promises that still 
remain for Israel proper. So as soon as you start getting very clearly decisive 
about, well, yeah, but Rome came out and took out Israel, but not the true 
Israel because true Israel is now this remnant, which is now the church, 
I can see some Christians getting really twitchy to borrow our phrase.
Tim And I would never say it that way. That’s not how the apostles talk about it. 
The apostles talk about how Jesus is the image of God, the truly human one, 
and He is the faithful Israelite. He’s the seed of Abraham. And He’s Israel. 
In the language of Isaiah 49, “You, the servant, are Israel.” The individual 
servant gets the title of faithful Israelite in the book of Isaiah, and then who 
are included in the Messianic Israel, those who put their faith in Him, at least 
in this argument of Acts of the Apostles. So into that new covenant, Israel are 
invited people of all nations. As Paul says, first to the Jew, then to the Greek. 
But the thing is about the whole family, a new family, the family of God. 
 Let’s get to the second aspect that I’ve thought about is that for Jesus 
to die for the sins of Israel, is how He dies for the sins of humanity. 
Those are not different things. Because the narrative logic is that 
the family of Abraham are the people through whom He’s going to 
deal with the sin of all of the nations. But then the problem is that 
they’re just as corrupt as all of the nations. So for Jesus to die...
Jon Solving Israel’s problem solved humanity’s problem.
Tim There you go. That’s it. So by saying that Jesus was dying for the sins of 
Israel by dying at the hands of pagan oppressors is how He dies for the 
sins of all the nations. I think all of this is what Paul has in mind when he 
says in 1 Corinthians 15 that the Messiah died for our sins, according to the 
Scriptures and he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures. 00:51:00
00:52:0000:50:00  21 So Paul has in his mind, this idea that you only understand the 
death of Jesus in light of the resurrection, and you only understand 
both of those according to the Scriptures, according to the biblical 
narrative. And then the question is, oh, well, what is that narrative? 
That’s what we’re trying to go after here. So those are some of my 
thoughts after that conversation. I don’t know. Jon and Carissa.
Carissa  A lot of the questions that we received like this is that the 
question underneath the question is, what did Jesus accomplish 
in His death, especially if He was the substitute for Barabbas 
for Israel? What was it that He actually accomplished?
Tim There’s so many ways. Like humanity, we repeat the sin of Adam and Eve. 
We do what is good in our eyes, and we create death and not life in the 
world, individually and corporately. I wish somebody would find a way to 
defeat death and die for my sins. That would be amazing. That would be 
great news, in fact. I mean, I’m being overly simplistic. But I think that’s 
how the narrative works. And then you can fill in that portrait with a whole 
bunch of other more clarifying themes. But I think that’s what it means.
Jon So I just want to ask one more question that 
piggybacks on the very first question.
Tim Oh, sweet. 
Jon But the active-passive thing, this kind of close a loop on that. 
Because he brought up two stories, Sodom and Gomorrah. 
Tim Rob’s question?
Jon Rob’s question. He brought up Korah, and then 
he brought up the venomous snakes. 
Tim Totally. 
Jon Let’s talk about the venomous snakes. Because in the Korah story or in 
the flood story, I can kind of get there, which is its decreation. It’s like God 
sustains creation and He can take His hands off the steering wheel and 
let us drive into a ditch. And you kind of get the sense of like, okay, earth 
splitting in half, in one perspective that’s gnarly and vindictive. Like, well, 
what kind of Zeus like God is going to pull that off? But when you think 
of it in the terms of sustaining creation, it’s easier. Venomous snakes. 
 I mean, it seems like God was just like, “You know what sounds fun? I’m 
going to send some venomous snakes.” You know, like, “What would really 
freak these guys out? Venomous snakes. That sounds like a great way to 
do it.” It feels like something like a bond villain would come up with. 00:53:00
00:54:00  22Tim Sure. That is certainly how the story read by itself apart from the mosaic in 
English appears to you. This is the seventh rebellion story in the collection 
of seven rebellion stories, and they’re all mutually hyperlinked together and 
really important and significant ways. That’s one thing. The second they’re 
out in the wilderness, and what they repeat is the rebellion from the first 
one is “you brought us out of Egypt. Why did you bring us out of Egypt to 
kill us in the wilderness? No bread. No water. Well, you know, maybe except 
the water you provided from the rock and except the bread that you gave 
us, and the manna. We detest this miserable food.” So, snakes. Come now.
Jon Yeah, snakes.
Tim So they’re in the opposite of the garden and they are in the 
opposite of the state of innocence that Adam and Eve were in.
Jon Okay. 
Tim So the snake comes not to test to them, but rather the 
here the snake comes as a form of divine justice. 
Jon And this is where Moses has the bronze snake that he holds up? 
Tim Totally. But then Moses makes this snake. So the agent of God’s 
judgment is transformed into the agent of salvation. God takes 
with the snakes do and then He transforms it into an object of faith, 
which becomes salvation for the people. So God can take what He 
sends to judge them and turn it into salvation for His people.
 Jesus tracked with this story. In John 3, He brings it up with 
Nicodemus. And He sees in this story God’s love. This is in John 
3. God so loved the world that He gave His only Son. And just a 
paragraph later, he brings up the goal. The story right here about the 
bronze serpent. So Jesus sees this story in a big mosaic about...
Jon Even though we’ve found ourselves in the opposite of the garden, and the 
opposite of innocence, God will find a way to reverse the curse of the snake?
Tim Yeah, totally. I think in terms of the question out of the question, these 
are the people that God has chosen to represent Him to the nations. 
This is their seventh act of rebellion in the wilderness. And it’s almost 
like poetic justice that it becomes an Eden-like snake to come.
Jon And take them out.
Tim ...take them out. But even that, because of Moses’ intercession, the 
people came to Moses, Moses intercedes. And then because of 
the intercession of the righteous one, judgment is transformed in 00:56:0000:55:00
00:57:00  23salvation. That’s the arc of this little story. And it sounds like the story 
of the whole Bible all of a sudden. And I think that’s on purpose. 
Jon Do we need any more closure? Any parting words? Carissa?
Carissa  No. 
Tim It was a pleasure to talk with you guys, have this conversation. 
Thank you, everybody, for sending in your questions. Really thought-
provoking. I always love hearing what people are thinking.
Jon Thanks for wrestling through these ideas with us and keep it up. What I’m 
learning is that this is just inviting us deeper, which is a beautiful thing. 
 Thanks for listening to this episode of the BibleProject 
podcast. We make the Bible crystal clear. 
Carissa  On snakes. 
Tim The Bible is so hard to understand. 
Jon BibleProject is a nonprofit. We’re in Portland, Oregon. We want you 
all and us together to experience the Bible as a unified story that 
leads to Jesus. So that’s why this podcast exists and the videos
