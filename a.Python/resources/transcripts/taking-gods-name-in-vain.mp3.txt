is John and this is Tim and this is my projects podcast hip and today we get to interview our friend and Scholar yeah, times, and I only been doing the interviews with Scholars whose work I found really helpful or this case someone who made it awesome work and it's someone that we know Carmen is a professor of Old Testament Prairie College in Canada and we also happen to all be in college at the same time where we all crossed paths but she's awesome and she has a book out that was an extension of her doctoral thesis all about burying yahweh's name and the book is a bearing God's name by signing the matters has a great book highly recommended but we're going to talk to some it seems in that book anyway this is all focused on one verse in the Old Testament one of The Commandments ten command
 not to take the lord's name in vain yes it's often translated yes but we'll talk about what it means by that maybe isn't the most accurate translation and then somehow the whole story of the Bible unfolds in at 11 commands to pretty cool so they enjoyed the conversation we hope you do to text Brenda.
all right Carmen you're here with us yeah hello how are you it's great to be here with you before we talked about your books and the Ten Commandments do the thrill of talking about the Ten Commandments first tell us a little bit about yourself your story how you ended up in Dove Cove scholarship and the start there are stories intersect and in other ways they're very different so I grew up in a Christian home and I grew up in Colorado and always loved the Bible like even as a kid loved reading scripture and that made me kind of weird I would have a couple of kid like hearing it but you actually do like to read the Bible yourself as a kid when I was little when I was in second grade I took my Bible out on a playground
 started a Bible reading club now it would be way cooler to do that now cuz we could use Bible project video and then kids would actually come but but we just sat around for a whole recess reading out loud and I don't know how far in Genesis we got but that was I think the last time we met
 so nobody else was into this read through the entire Bible at recess idea that I had continued it on my own although I wasn't super duper consistent I did finish my first read through the Bible by a fourth grade and so I when I was looking for colleges I knew that I really wanted to dig more into God's word and I was thinking at that time I wanted to be a Bible translator what better job could you have them bringing God's word to somebody who didn't have it yet so I got to Multnomah Bible College which is where the three of us met
 and I I discovered a passion I didn't know I had for teaching and so I started thinking less about Bible translation in more about Bible teaching and it was largely through the influence of railu back in his Bible study methods class that I was like Wow there I've always loved the Bible but no one's ever showed me how to study it before how to read it well and it just came to life for me in new ways and I began to think about you know how can I do more of this and then Ray asked me to be a Bible study methods lab instructor which team also was and yeah and I I loved it so much it was like it was like realizing this is what I was born to do I met you I was a freshman and you were my Bible study methods lab instructor and I remember honestly being really dazzled your composure in your excitement about
 teaching about the Bible and it really left a mark on me and then I don't know if you remember this I was taking the class with Ray and I think it was a junior or senior and you were you were grading for him I did a paper on Obadiah I brought the subject up cuz it's the shortest book in the Bible starting in the prophets and so you had to choose a prophetic book and do a paper and I just have a diet and you gave me a good grade and thankful for that has proven that that good grade was earned during that time I was also a t a 44 dr. Carl cut and and that gave me another side of just biblical studies and and I thought man I really want to do this for the rest of my life and then I learned how to do this like to teach college-level Bible you have to have a PhD in between there so you and your husband Danny Danny
 by Daniel you got to spend some time overseas and then you went to graduate school in Wheaton Illinois started my masters while we were in the Philippines started taking classes and then when we transferred to Siem headquarters that was our mission it was right next door to Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary they have a Charlotte campus yeah and they give a discount to Siem missionaries to take classes and I thought well here we go I'll get going on this so it was I was probably in my first class when I realized no I really need to go on for PhD I love this so much so that we went from there to Wheaton where I did my PhD underdann block and then we were back in Oregon for a little while and I was teaching at Multnomah and at George Fox University as an adjunct and then this job opened up at a little out-of-the-way school in the Prairies of Alberta name Prairie College
 it's been great this is my third year here I get to teach the whole Testament I'm the whole department so everybody has to have me and everybody has to watch your videos and is it really in the Prairies is it like you look out yeah we have a town of about 3000 + on all sides there's either Wheatfields or Canola Fields professional life calling way you've invested yourself in biblical scholarship I call that club of people with great affection viable nerds qualify and think I am a nerd maybe just I'm I'm curious so you and I both had all three of us had classes with Ray lube and removes the influential teacher for all of us and so I'm curious for me so many things came alive in the same way when he opened up the Bible in class
 with him but in a way that I have never experienced he had a way of modeling what it looked like to read these texts in a way that I've never experienced. I hope to emulate in some way but I think you do have you ever tried to encapsulate what you think it is that you passed on to you or what was it that lit up in you I think one of the biggest things is curiosity he has a way of leading students through the text in a way that he doesn't tell us what he thinks or his answers he just leads us on the process of discovery and then we discover it I don't think I do it as well as he does and my classes I tried to emulate in an in then I I just have to tell people what I think but it was actually in his Old Testament biblical theology class we had to do it at race a Biblical theological themes through the whole Bible
 did my first one on Gardens and then I did my second one on tree so it's been really fun to listen to your trees podcast stories and see all the ways that you're pulling out things that I saw then but but going way deeper because I didn't have Hebrew at that point and so there's a lot of Hebrew connections connections that I was missing you brought the whole Bible together for me in a way that I could see it was one unified stories I had never seen that before I spent my whole life in church I'd had some passionate teachers but nobody had ever shown me the big picture the way he did yep yeah yeah well well said what's maybe take some time to focus you know this was a teacher who helped us learn how to read the Bible as one whole you spent a good part of your graduate student career focusing in on something very small that came away to think about the whole Bible which is kind of cool it is so you did your research on
 one of the Ten Commandments and found there a way of telling the whole Bible through the lens of the theme of that commandant of the name come and talk to us maybe about the origins of the project for you and then going to give us what's give us the deal what what is this what your dissertation bearing yahweh's name at Sinai and then you re shaped all of that for a wider audience that isn't isn't necessarily full of Bible nerds which way to go with super super fun so yeah I got into the topic Dan block gave me the idea of studying this command he had a way of reading it that I've never heard before and I was intrigued and wanted to test it out so it's the command not to take the lord's name in vain and he said to me, and I don't think this is about how we speak the name
 or the use of the name in speech a lot of people take it as as a Prohibition of speaking yahweh's name or of speaking it in certain contexts or in certain ways or of using his name in oats or in magic or custom I usually is English speakers think of that as you're driving down the freeway somebody cuts you off and you're not supposed to say oh still in God's name because that's disrespectful so damn block said, I don't think that's what's going on here because in Hebrew it's you shall not lift up or carry the name of Yahweh your God in vain there's no speech specified in that in that verse and I said oh that's fascinating I want to begin so yeah my dissertation was a full-scale investigation of that command from every angle that I could imagine I looked at the history of interpretation
 how is this Ben read I identified 23 different ways people have interpreted it and I thought well maybe I'll just group them by eras in history like maybe we've moved from one interpretation to another but I found that that these 23 interpretations are sort of scattered throughout history and they cross the cross Faith lines like lines of Faith Traditions so so it's not like all Jewish interpreters read it one way and I'll Christian interpreters read it a different way there's proponents of each of these views in lots of different camps movie was first talk to me about what you think it means and then maybe how it's different or is more more compelling to you than some of these other you don't have to list the 2023 if you're talking about the ones that are most common and maybe the ones that are reflected in our English translations command is telling the Israelites not to misrepresent Yahweh
 so at Sinai there at Sinai and Yahweh Reveals His Name to them and he chooses them to be his own people and in in do it by doing that or the way he does that is by placing his name on them sort of invisibly is like an invisible tattoo or a brand or he's saying you're mine just like if you wanted to say you know pick your favorite backpack or something in that it's yours you might put your name on it we put our names on things to claim ownership so at Sinai Yahweh puts his name on his people to claim ownership of them and therefore they're not to live in such a way that his name is brought into disrepute that his his reputation is negatively affected so it's very broad it's much brighter than the other interpretations it's not it's not just limiting what people say or when they say it or how they say it it affects every part of how we live so a lot of people as ice
 earlier connected with speech but there's not a single speech-related word in the command other than the word named you could say what we say names but we also do other things are with them in Modern English versions that's usually translated to take take or misuse misuse the name of God
 names and again. Just Cycles back to the way people think about saying God's name as a cuss word that they're not supposed to do right but it's really broader than that yeah the verb and always this is one of the easiest Hebrew words to remember yes you just picture a space shuttle whenever you read the divorce you shall not carry the name of Yahweh your guy looked at other passages to try to explain what this must be made we don't carry names so this must be like a shorthand figure of speech in a way of referring to Speech but I think right at Sinai we have the interpretive key because we have the instructions for how to dress the high priest in chapters 28 + 2
 nine of Exodus and he has on his his chest he wears the 12 precious stones each one engraved with one of the names of the tribes and it says and so Erin she'll carry the names of the tribes of Israel into my presence and so it's using the same word it's not saw and and Nae Nae song and Shem used together in the same context right here at Sinai and not only does he wear the names of the tribes which indicate that he that he represents them his ministry is representative of all 12 tribes he's not just praying or working on behalf of One Tribe he works for everybody but he also has a name on his forehead and it's engraved on this gold medallion and it says holy belonging to Yahweh on his Medallion so we actually physically has you always name on his forehead and he's moving in and out of the Tabernacle representing the
 people to Yahweh and representing Yahweh to the people it's in that context that God says to his people you shall not carry the name of Yahweh your God in vain as though they too have
 God's name on their forehead and so they should live in such a way that befits someone who belongs to him so you would link all of the to the opening words of the Mount Sinai story about God wants to make them all the the kingdom of priests in Deuteronomy Moses's reiterating everything that happened at Sinai for the Next Generation as they're getting ready to go into the promised land and he says that they are a people holy belonging to Yahweh and he uses the exact same phrase there about the people as a whole that is what's written on the high priest forehead so he he's wearing a medallion that says holy belonging to Yahweh they are a people holy belonging to Yahweh Kingdom of priests so Aaron's walking around as like a visual model of what they're supposed to be and the connection to the name he is the representative they're all
 Chris that one representative and he actually has belonging to Yahweh written on the golden plate a plate of gold yes on a turban look at the Royal picture but the point is this is like a crown kind of yeah it's cold and it's inscribed dash light halfway and so y'all way has the name Yahweh has the Ahmad in front of it that is a way of saying belonging to this this this priest belongs to Yahweh it's really beautiful yeah it is and then about where he carries the name where is that an exodus 28 I just wanted to read it out loud 2829 yes that's right whenever he enters the presence of Yahweh he will he will bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the breast piece of decision so interesting the NIV
 different direction there yeah what are you looking at their okay the Naas has Aaron will carry the names of the sons of Israel and Ivy had he will bear the names OK Google the names carry the name to hear the priest is representing the people before God he Bears the name and so you would just take that same logic and the whole people there's the name of the meaning they represent this I want to make that super clear how you do the logic there is not actually used in relation to the plate of gold on the high priest forehead it doesn't say he now says the Divine name understand so I'm I'm extrapolating from the other names that he's carrying on his person but we I think the representative function of the nation becomes really clear in Exodus chapter 19 when they arrive at Sinai
 the first thing you always says to them through Moses is in Exodus 19 4 through 6 you yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried You On Eagle's Wings and brought you to myself now if you obey me fully and keep my Covenant and out of all Nations you will be my treasured possession although the whole earth is mine you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation so there's the kingdom of priests but the phrase that I really liked his treasured possession because it's the Hebrew word segulah which is not just a warm fuzzy this isn't just a term of endearment this is a technical term used in treaty context do to designate someone as the king's representative their authorized representative so y'all has already told them they're going to be his representative and then he says in the very next chapter don't carry my name in vain and then we see that physically with the high priest and then he tells the
 Euro people holy belonging to me so taking all together I think the picture emerges that this command is much bigger than both taking or some other speech-related so and I didn't necessarily ask you this beforehand but maybe you have it off the top of your head this in vain enough to give us a pretty good picture maybe talk a little bit about what kind of misrepresentation is it work there I think in this context what works is to think of it as in effective flea or like you're supposed to be my Representatives but you're going out and living like you're Pagan neighbors and so so people aren't getting the impression of what you always liked the way they should your bearing his name to no effect or too ill effect there's a few passages in Jeremiah where Les Schwab occurs I don't have them memorized I feel like once in chess
 to hear I got you is talking about how he's been bringing Justice and consequences on his real Sin and he said yes in vain I've been punishing your people they don't respond to my correction so I'm working I'm I'm I'm trying to discipline them and they're not responding so it's in it's like an empty or ineffective or it's not doing what it's supposed to do it both becomes a lot more brats as he said few minutes ago don't represent my name to no effect or so the people get the wrong impression about me it becomes more open and also becomes much higher Stakes it seems to me yes and in some ways it's more narrow because a lot of people think of the Ten Commandments as universal moral prohibitions but if you're going to read this command as an injunction not to misrepresent Yahweh
 it only applies to the Covenant people right because you only bear yahweh's name if he's claimed you as his own which is only true of those who've entered into that Covenant with him so it's a then is narrower in scope in terms of who is talking to but way broader and as you said the stakes are higher Commandments was just about I was taking and cussing it's like kind of a skip over of the Ten Commandments done it idles instead but this idea of it being connected to our identity as the ones I got the name and what God wants to do is Mission in the world is still open so much bigger and more compelling it and it seems connected to the Genesis 1 and 2
 bearing thing yeah I have a sequel or a prequel in mind about being God's image for the book we haven't really talked about yet because I don't think that being God's image and bearing his name are the same thing every human being is the image of God whether or not their Covenant member but they do every human being does represent gods rule to the world we are all stewards over creation and yet this subset of humanity who's been brought in to Covenant have this additional responsibility to Bear yahweh's name so they they are connected but they're not the same thing
 could you also say Lil B I like how in your in your book you spend a lot of time at Mount Sinai and not just in the name command and talking about how part of me is just like will the Ten Commandments were in ancient Israel lock code and I don't need to worry about him this wisdom in them but then another part of me is like this is something I really need to pay attention to and Christians have had an ambivalent relationship with the Old Testament law for a long time there's some who feel like well the only ones we need to pay attention to are the Ten Commandments those are still valid all except for the Sabbath command cuz that's the one that is legalistic or something but we don't know what to do with all these other laws that it is a cross-cultural experience reading them and we feel like something's changed because of Jesus we can always put our finger on what it is and so it's complicated what do we do with these laws and so you know some people say well let's just unhitch and let's move on and just
 focus on Jesus in the New Testament but when I go back to 59 read these laws this didn't come naturally for me this I got from Daniel block as well he sees Grace oozing out of these laws at Sinai he sees all sorts of examples of how God is meeting his people graciously even just in the fact that he's telling them what he expects in most ancient cultures people are highly anxious about not offending the gods and there's this sense of trial-and-error trying not to offend the gods and if something goes wrong like our crops don't grow where our child is sick then we must have done something and now it's our job to figure out what it is but the gods aren't talking to us and so for y'all way to come and reveal his name and invite people into a covenant with him and then say here's how I want you to live it takes all the angst out of following him because he's he's showed us what it's supposed to look like we don't have to guess
 yeah there's a lot of grease in the laws well I think to follow up on that that is in my short like adult life in typical scholarship I think we're getting our educations in a post post-revolution error about how Protestants think about the Old Testament law it's related to a whole bunch of stuff that will bore most of our listeners or and excited for you connected to the or you know this movement called the new perspective on Paul but essentially Protestants realizing that we've been operating with a caricature of Judaism as a whole and of the Old Testament vision of the law to these people could you could write some 119 and you can write the longest chapter in the Bible every lines celebrating the beauty and Grace of what these walls represent two people and yet we come in and we come at it assuming I think many of us do that these laws were their way of earning salvation or making themselves right with God
 and so we know we don't need that anymore because we have Jesus and we have Grace and forgiveness and so then we don't need a way to earn earn our salvation but what's crucial to notice about the laws is that they come after God rescues them God has already brought them out of Egypt when he gives them the LIE he is not standing at the border he doesn't have Moses stand at the border of Egypt and say hey guys I can get you out of here just sign on the dotted line that you'll do all these things and I'll release you it's not that it's it's there already free and the laws are a way of showing them how to live in Freedom
 and if we re conceive that then I think it shifts it in a way that we can begin to see how it might be valuable for us as well if it's not meant to earn salvation and instead meant to shape the way we live as a grateful response to Salvation
 how to make us a couple of the questions that I had something addressed in the book and some that I would be like oh I wonder what she would say that about this so are the other important passages in the Old Testament where God's name is connected to the people there's one passage in Deuteronomy 12:4 Moses the saying hey when you going to the land that there's going to be this place that God's going to choose anticipating that'll be a central temple in the phrase it's used you know like 45 times the chapter is I will make my name take up residence there so yeah I'm curious how you would connect this to the people representing the name but now the name is almost like a person living in the middle of the people yeah I think actually this this idea of a hypothesize name like a a name that's become its own thing is a misunderstanding or Miss
 translation of the phrase here I am relying on Sandra Richter's Harvard dissertations on this phrase so the phrase in Hebrews leche con leche a country that right there it's in my book but I didn't include the valves up so literally it's to cause his name to dwell there but I think she convincingly argues that this is a borrowed idiom from akkadian that actually just means to claim ownership by inscribing a name so not that the name is a separate entity separate from you always presents that is there but that y'all way comes and he he inscribed his name there or he he puts his name there the same way that he's putting his name on the people saying this is my authorized location of worship she's done brilliant work I find it convincing that means there's actually four things in the Hebrew Bible where God puts his name to claim it he puts his
 I'm on the people on the city of Jerusalem on the temple and then the the Shocker is in Amos chapter 9 he also there's also a reference to the Gentiles who bear my name
 which is picked up in Acts chapter 15 by James to explain how Gentiles can be Covenant members without converting to Judaism first and it all revolves around in this is where it just sort of blows your mind when you trace the steam like the early churches solving their biggest crisis their biggest theological crisis with reference to the idea of bearing God's name if the Gentiles bear God's name then they must already be many members of the Covenant those who are following Jesus are the ones that Amos was looking ahead and talking about each one of those a little bit deeper so the temple you're right I was just looking at it and refresh my memory the phrases to set the normal verb to put her to place about the temple God says I will put my name in there so that it shook on it takes up residence there is a couple of different versions of the phrase that I that I deal with
 my dissertation and I'm I am relying on Sandy Richards work here at least in some of the phrases similar placing the name upon or putting it in or with yeah that's fine and it's this so if so when we look at put putting the name that takes us back to Numbers Chapter 6 where God prescribes through Moses the Priestly blessing that Aaron is going to pronounce over the people so may Yahweh bless you and keep you may his face shine upon you that blessing that we've heard so often in in our church services cuz it's beautiful that the very next verse says and so they should put my name on them and I will bless them
 and to me that's the clearest place in scripture where you get an explicit reference to putting the name on them which which brings all that I mean if you felt like all the other stuff I was saying in Exodus 19 228 was a stretch or like I was making up fen-phen in Numbers Chapter 6 is like nope there it is he's putting his name on them so the priests are proclaiming or announcing God's blessing on them by using the Divine name three times Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh and it's like this act of verbal branding making them his own upon whom the crown is written belonging to the Lord carries the names of the people before the Lord and then he put he puts the name that we can make a video about this I am waiting for this weather
 I talked in one place about Aaron's garments demonstrating the interpenetration of Worlds like where he's moving from the outside to the innermost part of the Tabernacle and back out again and how he carries and represents in both directions is really cool we are we do have on the books in the next year or so to Begin work on the video on the priesthood but I think could do it will do more of that of that bridging of the Divine and human Realms but I have a name thing okay and then yes the famous passage remembered I did a project on this passage in graduate school and it's a very odd phrase over the nation's whom my name is called over them yeah it's the same phrase that you get in 2nd Chronicles 7:14 which people love to say if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray it's in Hebrew it's If my people over whom
 my name has been called like this reflexive the name is been spoken over them and we know from number 6 why or when that happens it's as the priests declare the blessing and God claiming them there now the people who belong to you always so if those people who belong to me humble themselves and pray then I will hear from heaven and heal heal their land how I remember seeing that but just hearing you say that brought it in the clarity so let me ask you this how does Jesus mention of the name in the famous Lord's Prayer how does this fit into the puzzle of the name it's amazing because it to bridge the gap from the Old Testament or the New Testament hear Ezekiel 36 describes that the Exile happens in part because of and as a result of the Exile the result is the profaning of Yahweh
 name this is one other line of support for the way I'm reading the name command if the command is prohibiting false Odes then profaning the name should be whenever they break an oath but it's actually we have a whole list of ways that the name is profaned and it's much broader than that and one of them is as they're going into Exile the nations are seeing what's happening and they're like oh this is yahweh's people but they had to go out of his land and so you always reputation is suffering he looks like a god who's not very strong
 because of the Exile an important text to read then in Ezekiel 36 he says that Israel has profaned just kind of a funny English defiled defiled her unsanctified the opposite of consecration you're taking it from holy and special and making in on holy holy holy meeting set apart for something so profane would be that it becomes to comment dishonoring it associated with Shane Moore has profaned my holy name because it was said about them of these people these are the people of Yahweh they belong to Yahweh but they had to go in Exile out of his land some of us like a public shame them going out of the land is it looks bad bad PR PR to bring them back to the land not because they're they did
 but because he needs to write his reputation he needs the Nations to realize who he really is so first 23 then of Ezekiel 36 I will restore the Holiness of my great name that's been profaned among the nation's yeah so you're talking about this an important piece in and up to Jesus prayer so he prays Hallowed Be Your Name which is Halloween is the opposite of profaning so it's making God's name holy again so we'd have to ask what why is it Unholy and look back here it is he goes 36 and say oh God's name has been profaned by their Covenant unfaithfulness and by their being taken into Exile and so now the opposite of that would be to bear his name well again to demonstrate Covenant faithfulness so I think that what's going on is Jesus is not just
 God I hope you're happy or hope people think you're holy I hope people like you yet no answer number that you're right I believe that Jesus is is actually committing himself to the resync defecation or the the Halloween of God's name he wants to Bear God's name well as praying to be someone who has got its name is what's your name be hallowed or or Sanctified I think we could fill in by my own life by your people let your people do this and yet he's the one who saw two leads the way in showing how it can be done
 yeah okay so can we stay at the logic is Israel was called to Bear the name not in vain but towards some purpose or to some end that their history of unfaithfulness asking a priest as asking my brace their failure to do that resulted in a fainting of the Ya-Ya the the dishonoring of God's name and Jesus steps into that story of failure and sees himself as the Priestly Royal representative who will restore the Holiness of God's name among the name of the Hmong the nation's that's how you would kind of put those pieces together participating and we're also committing ourselves to it it goes from one of the least significant Ten Commandments to like one of the most significant
 and especially in terms of someone is following Jesus you know you can you have all these lock codes and which of these do I find the wisdom that still is relevant and I went to seems like such a gem cuz it's at the heart of what it means to be to be following Jesus represent God I count the commands there's disagreement about how to count them actually hard to count the Ten Commandments about the command is the command not to worship other gods which includes within it not making Idols because you you can't worship other gods without an image of that God you you wouldn't make an image unless you're going to worship it so that I think the two there are one command and I have other reasons for that in my book
 so that makes this command the second command so the first one is I'm your God and the second one is You Are My People which is the Covenant formula in a nutshell I will be your God and you will be my people so these two are the most significant commands because it's from these two that everything else flows if you get your worship right and you get your identity invocation right as God's name Bearer everything else comes from that yeah you know this is just occurring to be in the moment but The Sermon on the Mount in a way is you know it's also very much oriented towards restoring A Renewed Israel to renewed allegiance to a Messianic Torah from the laws as he says not to put them aside but to show what a community would look like that's fulfilling them yeah and he he actually raises the bar on the commands that I think he's reading them as they were originally
 attended I don't think he's setting aside what happened to Sinai but there's this human tendency to narrow things and just like just tell me exactly what I'm not supposed to do and I think that's how we could account for the very narrow interpretation of the name command in history like just tell me exactly what I'm not supposed to do where is Jesus is like if you even have a lustful thought you've broken the command not adultery so he's he's breaking it back open again and it's in the scope which is what I'm trying to do with the name command the history of interpretation of 1 verse as almost it's in many ways a domesticating it like making it more manageable Morton making a demand less of me and and I'm sure that's not necessarily the motives of the translators are people involved
 but that has been the end result hasn't it and it interesting thing we we didn't touch on earlier is that when you narrow the name command to be against false Oaths which is probably the majority of you out there then you have two commands in the list of Ten Commandments that are almost saying the same thing as you got a command against false news on the command not to bear false witness against your neighbor which is really like so closely overlapped just one more reason to rethink how we've been reading it okay let me let me ask you one more thing I've heard you talk about this another setting and I thought you would cool off in the Book of Revelation the name God's name and then the anti comes up in a pretty famous text about people taking the Mark or the number of the beast's name
 at the end of Revelations 13 but then in the next chapter the Visionary see the whole group of the mark the name of the Beast or the number of his name and the number of his name that's interested okay with the Beast that has a Mark or a name on their part of the pieces like bearing the name of the beast at the beginning of Revelation 14 they have his name and the name of it their father written on their forehead so yeah talk to us what this all means I think up until this point we've had invisible tattoos or invisible Brands and in John's Vision suddenly the invisible brand that everyone's been wearing all this time becomes visible
 it's like one of those cool I don't know if like a task this is going way back and in my brain but I feel like I used to go roller skating as a kid and they would stamp your hand when you came in but it was one of those like glowy kind of stamps you actually couldn't see the ink unless you were under one of those special stamp that nobody can see until they come under the ultraviolet light so everybody has a tattoo every one of us has a tattoo that indicates to we belong to or who we think we belong to who if we given our allegiance to and in Revelation we get to see it evident so yeah and you have one of two names the number of the name this is the famous 666 passage at the end of the Revelation 13 that's a whole other
 rabbit hole isn't it but okay so this group that has yahweh's name it's written on their foreheads which has to be connected all the way back to the high priest exactly is true of the high priest is also true of all of the people right in at Mount Sinai in the same way you have the lamb standing on Mount Zion with his name and the name of his father written on all of his people
the one question I get a lot is what I think about tattoos and after I spoke at the naked Bible Conference with you and that was the number one question I got afterwards I got two people were asking about tattoos so is the prohibition of tattoos in the Torah related to this and I think it is I think I think I think it isn't it to Toronto me 14 a brother told not to Mark themselves for the dead you are the children of Yahweh your God do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead for you are a people holy to Yahweh your God so there's a sort of disfiguring going on in the cultural context that I don't have details about but they're apparently marking their bodies for the dead and that's got to stop because there are people code Ashley Yahoo they are wholly belonging to Yahweh just like the high priest so if you're going to wear
 his name then to wear any other name shows a dual Allegiance or a double mindedness that's Deuteronomy 14 one there's I think maybe another passage that mentions tattoos yeah cuz one that specifically calls at tattoos for the dead are you saying that oh yeah because throughout throughout the Torah you have this developing portrait of spiritual forces of Badness beginning with that mysterious figure of the snake throughout the doors is growing amalgamation of images and so the gods of the underworld or the dead this at the thing I guess I'm just thinking of how John the Visionary would see the beast dragon ultimate bad guy and talk about his name on you and it makes me think that almost certainly this thing about putting marks on your body connected to the underworld
 has to be in the mix here are connected with dead so do not cut your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourself so so we're obviously in a different cultural context now we're tattoos have a different meaning but I would say to anyone thinking about a tattoo does this conflict with your professed allegiance to Yahweh send mixed messages or does it reinforced your identity in some way it's worth thinking about popular popular hair too actually in the Prairies of Alberta I think we might be on the other side of it there's a billboard that I ride every day off
 weather in Portland for life after all unless you unless you to one sentence is admittedly a very important part of the Bible Ten Commandments but it's almost like it becomes a prism through which you can sync all the way back to image of God even though it's different it's connected and then all the through the story this real Jesus the Revelation that I took qualifies all the criteria for how we choose thing but yeah it's pretty cool and when you said it's about Allegiance and I think that helped me the most kind of settle it into me like the impact of it that this is about being the person who is on I want to make it sound to try tonight on a team not on the side but aligning yourself with the creator of the
 it's much bigger than just a prayer and it's much bigger than following a set of rules spare its bearing the name it's who we are you know there's such a quest for identity these days I need to find myself or find out who I am or what I'm supposed to do with my life it's all at Sinai who you are and what you're supposed to do is at Sinai this specific ways that you walk that out differ from person to person but if you are a follower of Jesus then you bear yahweh's name you bear Jesus name among the nation's so whatever wherever you get your paycheck from
 the way you conduct yourself is where it's at I won't try to improve on that summer as well said well thank you for putting in all of the effort I'm sure there were a lot of late nights and maybe sleepless nights you know I was like I know
 who in case of the dissertation was grueling it took me five years of research and then plus my Master's thesis going into it was connected as well cuz I did it about sekula but honestly writing the second book which is for the church and repackaging everything for the church was so much fun it was like I've described it as like pushing a boulder downhill as I get to I didn't have to do new research it was just like getting the message out that all uploaded it was all uploaded it was just time it was so much fun to write yes it tells Club the book the name of the book and where people can find it in God's name why Sinai still matters it's on Amazon it's at Barnes & Noble who also you did us a great honor by breaking new ground in book Technologies I did
 but no one's ever tried
 do this before but all the way through as I was writing I kept thinking I need to show the Bible project video for Holiness right here or is on the wall right here or I'm coming it's right here and and I asked in adversity press my publisher can we like put QR codes in this book that links the Bible project videos and they said yes so there's an appendix in the back of the book that Scott QR codes that are tied to each chapter and there's discussion questions and scripture reading tied to each chapter as well so that small group as small group could go through it easily together I'm also recording a video curriculum to go with a book called good for you all that's great make sure we put a link in the show note podcast you can look at that right now if you want but awesome yes thank you for your hard work represented in these books it makes me so excited when good biblical theology is made it accessible to a wider audience is just the experience that all of us had and if
 when you first see how the Bible works together through these themes it just changes how you see everything it does well thank you guys for all your hard work I'm just thrilled with the videos the podcast everything it's such a great resource for the church awesome well thank you for taking the time alright alright thanks so much yeah you bet

G but now I'm from Kigali Rwanda East Africa I first heard about the project since I taught at Multnomah Bible College of Multnomah University and Tim and John were my students there right now I use the Bible project with my students at Africa College of theology in Kigali they love the break from listening to me to listening and watching the videos as they explained
 the scripture my favorite thing for sure in the Bible project is it is taking scholarly information and making it accessible not dumbing it down but making it so someone gets a window into the best thinking about this wonderful book called The Bible we believe the Bible is a unified stories it leads to G or a crowdfunded project by people like me find free videos study notes podcasts and more at the Bible project, thank you.
