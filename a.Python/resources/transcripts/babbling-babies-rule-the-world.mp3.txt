hey this is John at bible project and today on the podcast I get to talk with Dr to Mackey and dr. Carissa Quinn about the eighth poem in the Book of Psalms show me to become a very important chapter for me as I realize more and more how the entire story of the Bible is about God's Relentless pursuit of humanity to partner with us even though we are weak and quite frankly pretty stupid most of time and so the question is why would the god of the universe the creator of the heavens and the Earth want to partner with us at the most basic it's a poem reflecting on God is the creator so this poet has internalized Genesis 1 and is offering us the meditation not just about God's relationship to the world but God's relationship to humans and what humans are all about soul mate was also an important poem for Jesus and the apostles Jesus expressed an interest in this song
 so did Paul and the anonymous author of the letter to the Hebrews this is actually a frequently quoted pump in the New Testament now in the beginning of the poem is a riddle which one of the weakest things you can imagine what perhaps it's an infant crying in his helplessness from the mouth of nursing babies and little infants you have founded a stronghold because of your enemies to stop the enemy and the Avenger how can the week be a fortress against the strong that's all I had in today's episode thanks for joining us here we go
 okay we've been making a new type of video as Bible project we are calling visual commentary and this conversation is on the next visual commentary is going to drop and it's on soulmate and your dad talked about some is a man Carissa hey how are you happy so we're here to talk about soulmate Tim you're going to lead us through it so let's jump in Psalm 88 is my translation that we're going to use in the video and it has some little tweak it might be different from common English translations but we'll walk away at through it doesn't awesome bomb explain just super quick why you tweak it mainly because sometimes there's nuances and Hebrew text where did the Greek texts that are English translations can't fully capture no matter what translation it is even if it's a really good one and so sometimes have
 multiple alternate translations can highlight little details that are there for the reader some filthy few of those yeah I noticed you can always see the repeated words he always translate the repeated words the same yes yeah yeah yeah it's an interesting feature that the book Loft there's love these repetition to get their main point across and Modern English translation tend to reduce repetition by using a variety of English words because repetition sounds a little lazy. English but it's actually a communication design texting you have the Bible and so that's how much estick is your name and all the land you set your Splendor above the skies from the mouths of infants and nursing babes you've established a strong hold because of your adversaries to stop the enemy
 and the Avenger when I consider your skies The Works of your fingers moon and stars would you established what is human that you remember him and the son of humanity that you attend to him they have made him little lesser than Elohim yet with glory and Majesty you've crowned him you made him a ruler over the works of your hands all things you've said under his feet sheep and oxen all of them and also Beasts of the field birds of the skies and fish of the sea what crosses the pads of the seas oh yeah way our Lord How Majestic is your name in all the land
 and I drop if there was an ancient ruin the Michael Brown's probably drop it right there David is connected to this prom at the heading of it what is yeah we didn't owe her yes I'm sorry we'll talk about it but you're right I didn't include that up David David Psalm of David begins with a phrase that nobody quite knows what it means I'm not say I usually translated it for the choir director John the dark prep just for the leader of the end right before the time of Jesus who translated this the Hebrew Bible and a Greek translated that phrase with the Greek phrase for the end for the tell us the next raise is all hoggatt eat with some kind of instrument or two and then it's a song
 relationship to David which is what we're riffing on for the next few visual commentary videos we did dinner at 1 obviously creation theme song A Tear as well as the land and the skies are so you automatically have this picture of all of creation that the land in the skies with this Majestic demonstration of the name of the reputation of Yahweh just like a painting is a testimony right to the Brilliance or creativity of an artist that's the best of you here so it's as if the skies and the Lander a physical manifestation of you always
 royal power and splendour that's the opening and closing notice the opening line and the final line of the Palmer identical Majestic cuz that's not a word I really use a Bible word for me Majesty Majesty what about your majesty that someone said but to be Majestic to be keenly than the Hebrew word idea and its most basic meaning is powerful it can be used as a storm waves in the Psalms I did a little in the notes there's a list of nouns that get this adjectives and sometimes it's a person in Authority a king or leader but Jess is often it's something that's powerful or huge
 The Cedars of Lebanon can be called a deer something that's so big powerful and impressive good Caesars like the Red Rock mountains or maybe that's a good look. Now what about the opening line is Lord How Majestic is your name and all the land you have set your Splendor lender not a word I'd use it either but it's still a little more common to me Splenda calendar you might you might like sarcastically say something like it all of its splendor but not that sarcastically like like if you made we all three have little kids and you do art
 you know and to view the parent it looks amazing out to anyone else looking at it it's it's kind of pitiful but you know that's the kind of thing and Splendor this is another word is more specifically connected to Authority and someone or something in a place of authority and that look so impressive it is Splendid. So it comes from from the French Splendid that means Radiance or Brilliance does that is that the idea in Hebrew radiant's are brilliant solo had this like brightness not Majestic a deer that's not that's what I was hoping to have a physical display brightness Brilliance of gold even dresses you
 yeah it's vocabulary of royalty and Authority as it's not just how great you are how great is your name it's yahweh's the king over all of this that's right yes which is going to be interesting because the body of the Palm is about how Yahweh made somebody else came over creation but we'll get there at the most basic it's the Palm reflecting on God is the Creator and we've read a lot of Genesis 1 stuff in there about the skies in the land humans humans being made really important before we dive into that we'll talk let's just take it over to you humans are really important the Sun the moon the stars and the Stars they rule over the humans rule over the animals there's a list of animals that comes right out of Genesis 1 on the brain
 so this poet has internalized Genesis 1 and is offering us the meditation not just about God's relationship to the world but God's relationship to humans and what humans are all about
let's know something else on this is if you're taking the whole Bible Old and New Testaments in the context Jesus expressed an interest in this phone and actually so did Paul and the anonymous author of the letter to the Hebrews frequently quoted Tom in the New Testament and I just want to flag this because the way Jesus and Paul David it's become a meme for them how do Jesus understands this poem and what he gets out of it and also Paul it creates what for me was a pile puzzle for a while cuz one of those moments where you go back you can read in your own Bible their Bible and you walk away going how did they get that assumption with that that the way Jesus and Paul and the apostles are interpreting this is how we should be able to interpret it to I want my default response to
 they certainly understand it better than I do so if I don't see what they're seeing my sumption should be I'm the one in the dark which opens up a whole opportunity to discover cool stuff let's just real quick in the gospel of Matthew chapter 21 the triumphal entry Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a donkey is famous scene Palm Sunday is on the donkey the people are lying down cloths garments in front of them palm branches and what the people are shouting is also from the Psalms the quoting from Psalm 118 saying blessed is the one who comes in the name of Yahweh hossana in the highest Rescue Bots Rescue there they're using Hebrew transliteration of Hebrew
 mother bears picking and choosing not to translate Hashanah but this fellow with English letters is that what they would have probably said out loud and then let's see is it it would be in Hebrew but then then Matthew would be great right yes another where's matthew yeah that's right so Matthew has chosen not to translate it but to spell if Hebrew word has Greek letter and sorry English translations take their cue and they don't translate it they spell the Greek word in English letters even though it's we just leave it translated Hebrew word yet so we're told the Jesus goes in Jerusalem the city sister and the people are saying who is this
 crowdsourcing this is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee but when the priests and the Bible scholars saw this describes they saw all the things that he was doing in the children who were shouting in the temple saying Shawna son of David they got angry and they said to Jesus do you hear what these children have you ever read the Bible I would have you ever read the Bible you know there's not a place where it says out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise from Psalm 8 verse 3
 so somehow he sees himself and what he's doing as somehow worthy of the same type of Praise or connected to the praise that comes out of this baby's mouth and this highlights the role of the babies and soulmate is baby is installment there is no babies and soul mate for the mouth of infants and babies use tablist and Jesus says Praise Jesus quotes from a different version of Psalm 8 than the one we have in the Hebrew Bible I think this is the most confusing verse of the song so I would like to know what Jesus meant going to flag it Jesus thinks he's babbling babies of Psalm 8 actually important and there a way to understand who he is and hit the crew around him and what they represent
 in the story of Israel so that the scribes are there saying hey this is ridiculous Jesus you got these kids running around thinking that you were going to save them like this is silly and then Jesus quotes from Salome and it says don't you know it's all made this is what the psalmist songs like she said it's from the mouth of babies that that God's going to do something and so it's very appropriate for us to be running around if he is quoting this line and has specific you know resonance in that moment cuz there's children around but he's got the whole poem on the brain the whole poem comes to bear on what Jesus is there to do and he wasn't just like going through his mind like what part of the Bible is there about kids singing and I'll pull it out and text it to listen to moments wherever the Apostle Paul also was attracted to song
 once and 1st Corinthians chapter 15 once in a fusions chapter 1 in both contacts he's talking about the resurrection of Jesus from the dead and how Jesus was installed as the king over all creation especially over the enemies of creation so in 1st Corinthians 15 he's talking about how in the first human in Adam all die so also in the Messiah all will come alive but each in his own order the Messiah was like the first fruits and then after the messiah's resurrection from the dead, those who belong to the Messiah when he returns then will come the end when the Risen Jesus will hand over the kingdom to God and father when he has abolished all other ruling authorities and powers for the Risen Jesus must rule until he's put all enemies under his feet the last
 enemy to be abolished will be death because Summit he put all things under his feet some to to me I guess our may be as other quote or is he called himself to that you know he's under his feet that's how it looks from blending together the wording of Psalm 110 with the wording of Psalm 110 is about a king from the line of David who will rule as a royal priest like milk is a deck built in Jerusalem so long ago so Paul's interested in Psalm 8 because of this picture of a human ruling over all things especially over the enemy's the threatening enemies of God academies of death and some Powers the power and death yackley how'd you get there I thought this was about just humans and how God made them his Partners to rule over animal celebrate you mean
 what words have spoken thus play Resurrection installation of the Messiah in the new humanity and all the cosmic enemies of God are under his feet and that it's about one specific person oh yeah that's right yeah the Messiah you just said soulmate is about making human Partners to rule we didn't really flush that out I kind of just read the song to power granted that's right but what you're saying there in in the song the bad words like what is human that you remember him yeah you have crowned him crown crown him made him rule over the works of your hands all things you've sat under his feet and so this is the Majestic King God who is appointed the humans yes we want to be animal over the animals and somehow Paul reads that palm and he starts talking about the Resurrected
 who's been crowned with New Creation life to rule over all of creation than Vanquish God's Cosmic enemies sheep and cattle don't sound like gods and I think I've been having these conversations with you long enough to know how he's connecting the dots yes because what's aimer talking about is the image of God yes and we've talked a lot about how humans are made to be in the image of God keep failing in that one element of Jesus being Jesus is that he's human yes and he represented the vocation of Being Human Being God's image in the way that was meant to be and so if our calling is to rule and God's behalf have that much Jesse majesty and be crowned with that that is ultimately failed in Jesus as connecting those dots he's bringing Jesus in the soul mate even though when I read Psalm 8 I'm just thinking about me
 and the other humans around me like he's connecting it to run it so maybe it's so there's one other set is one other key story and biblical theme that's hyperlinked in here that helps Jesus and Paul make that connection between the first human Humanity that failed the ultimate Humanity the god appointed to succeed which is Israel's Messiah the true image of God and the ski Missing Link there how do you get from the first image of God in Genesis 12 the ultimate image of God that's the Risen Messiah and key link there is the story of David the role that the story of King David plays in the Hebrew Bible is like the key link between those two and the other day David story in terms of stuff we were focused on in the Bible project David story hasn't been a major focus and I really want to start turning my energies there
 yeah I just realized this the other day working on something other than Moses and Jesus David story takes up he's the character who has the third most amount of pages dedicated to a story and are you counting like the historical books and the Psalms also if you counted the songs that are connected to David that he would be on a par with Moses for sure whether or not David wrote the Psalms the superscription says little titles yet they updated it to their spaghetti Associated sanding the Messiah is and why Jesus said and did almost all the things he said and test the David super important and so this all makes a great example that I hope to make clear if I can communicate I'd love to go to David but can we talk really quick about if it's under his feet thing as a couple things that striking me one is when when you
 soulmate and he says God made Humanity a ruler over the works of his hands yes and all things got set under Humanity's feet and then it talks about like the animals but before the animals anything about that he's looking up at the sun moon and stars and for them that's the host of Heaven the creatures that are actually more Majestic more splendorous than us and they're actually shining totally and then the focus comes back to humanity and it's like wow we're just like these other creatures so everything is under our feet well okay everything on land is under our feet but the powers above and death itself like we're still subjugated to so that's not under our feet and then you get to Paul and Paul making this connection is saying now it is that was Christ now it is and the powers as well as under his feet
 put it off like the goodies of our conversation so that I'm sorry to say what you think it's not saying this for the poet says when I see your skies the work of your fingers or is it is 3 in the English or is it a sorry I'm sorry I'm here the first three when I see you or you are the works of your fingers and then they're outlined moon stars that you have established what are the works of God's fingers Heavenly Heavenly little lesser than the Elohim Spiritual Beings up there most likely reference to those The Works of your fingers that are with honor and mash
 you made human the ruler over the works of your hands in context the same phrase The Works of God's fingers in God's hands going to say the works of your hands everything you put under his feet and the name the animals but it's suggestive that the same phrase describes the sky inhabitants and the Bandit habitants and all of them are you see Rome, son of man exalted to rule over the beasts but what are those beasts the beasts are donations to our nation's but the Nations that have been LED animated by the power animated by by the the powers the beasts the Beast song what I want to do pause on any more goodies and just walk
 Summit fits into the book of Psalms in the songs around it and then how once you see that it plugs into the Genesis in the first atom in the last Adam and all of the exciting stuff that Jesus and policy here I think shines with more clarity that's how they learn how to read the song that way especially knowing that overarching story image of God Genesis wand that's what sound mates about and then Jesus is Ultimate image of God's Not So that's true on the macro level but there's even a more specific way that that line of thought is all connected and it's through the story of David as it's portrayed in the Book of Psalms so that's why I'm going to try and leave us next
okay so one step super brief but we could spend a long time here especially cuz Chris is this is your one of your areas of focus in biblical studies which is about the composition and the design of the whole book of Psalms 150 we have one video couple videos on the Psalms were coming yeah so the books been organised through a set of repeating little editorial refrains in 25 men blocks sometimes called books and soulmate is found within the first the first of those five so for such as name that just five five sections of the song and it concludes with a fine 5 song conclusion 146 3150 are all connected and Chris that you didn't win the next Bishop connected to number
 especially because the very first song talks about meditating on Torah and then there are five bucks of the Psalms and these books you can find even in your English Bibles their title of book one but two but three so all kinds of things to explore their we're just going to leave it for later book one is blocked off because of Psalms 1 and 2 that are joined and then it comes to a conclusion at the end of Psalm 41 which is the first of these editorial refrains so no words at the end of for Psalms throughout the whole book there's a little editorial refrain that doesn't seem to fit the original song by itself it seems like it's added on like a little on the back cover of the book something like a chapter a burger and some it's really obvious it'll be like a really sad song of lament and then you know and then the last line of the god of Israel
 yeah well that changed real quick so you got a big block Psalms 41 when you step into a block of Psalms this is the whole field of biblical studies but the main technique is actually pretty intuitive it's through repetition of key words and ideas across Psalms that if you read and reread them the way someone tells you to you'll start to notice little groups and connective subunits and so on and so booked one which is Psalms 1441 itself has you know the first two Psalms as a conclusion and then for the intro for subgroups support groups to book one and I've gone back and forth their French scholar Gianni barbiero
 and then Peter hello what kind of the two lead Scholars and then dr. Chris Glenn has also made academic contribution arrangement of all of Psalms 1341 and so some 80 curs within five books with in the Psalms within the first book there's five sections in intro and then four groups soulmate is found dead center of the first group which Psalms 3 through 14 and that's theirs payoff for paying attention to why it's been placed in the in the center there are other groups are like this to it's the center not just because it's right in the middle but because there are songs on each side that can I mirror each other or doing something similar so you can tell that it's supposed to stand out as a center for the Book of Psalms was like a five-part movie series where in
 like the first movie and if this movie has like four main acts he has a little intro to the whole play to the whole in that for the whole series and then the first movie has four main acts and we're in the First Act of that movie right in the center that First Act is to the things that are on either side of s'awesome it because some it's been putting in between these two things on each side that match each other and the illuminate what's happening with so many in the middle so this will be an exercise in reading a group of songs and think about the song correct correct it's like you just these are just a collection of poems together to where it's placed in this is what I am 33 14 or a sub-unit a meaningful intentionally crafted. Unit was Psalm 8 as part of the center of it
 how to say if you're reading through the songs and want to read this way what you what you can do is look for words that are repeated from one phone to the next or even asking how does this song develop the theme from the last song or how does it continue the narrative strand or narrative thread forward and close with the same word so say Psalm 8 opens and closes with the same line Psalms 1 and 2 open and close with the same word someone begins with blessed is the one who doesn't hang out to that soaks but their Delight is in the Torah of Yahweh on the final line of Psalm to is how blessed are those who take refuge in the Messianic Son of God that something was all about a double blessing yes it's a poetic device that sticking those two songs together as the introduction
 blessing as I read in Ponder these texts one is how they write the Torah and it shaped the way of life to a tree and it teaches you to take refuge in someone the Messianic King from the line of David the guts going to send to bring Justice to confront the evil of the world that's the basic to that little weird Refuge taking refuge in the Messianic King Tut's important and to watch as it gets repeated through all of the songs yet come to Refuge I'm like I think my youth group was called Refuge by the way psychological create a refuge in the woods and I've had multiple times
 but I think it's a really cool word because if you look at it throughout the songs it is this kingly word were they the king is saying usually got the king is saying I'm going to Shield you protect you create a refuge for you if you think about like a king protecting his people that's the picture of it yeah yeah the world's a terrible place and dangerous and so knowing where you are safe what places are safe for you where you can take cover find rest in peace best Refuge because it implies that there's outside chaos and enemies start safe in the song to what makes the world not safe is Kings and Emperors who rule the land with violence and arrogance and that makes for an unsafe world when you have air
 rulers who don't acknowledge any power higher than themselves so you leave the introduction to the song Scrolls and you're thinking okay so God is going to raise up this king who is who to be well I read a book called Samuel and kings in the Hebrew Bible and I certainly know who it's not I know it's not a guy named David while and he was a refuge for other people for a while but eventually he blew it big-time and passed on the torch to his kiddos and yeah I know it's actually not any of the kids from his line is they all blew it like a hold of humans so this interesting puzzle the Hebrew Bible puts in front of you that this poem about a king from the line of David but you already know David isn't that one so is yours so here's what's interesting you lie song too and you walk into Psalms 3 through 7
 and there are beautifully arranged will composition of those Five Pawns deranged as a symmetry in other words correctly the ponds that come before Psalm 85 lb the first half of this First Act in this first movie and it's it's three has Five Pawns about David running from his enemies totally freaked out persecuted oppressed and stop them opening scene was running from enemies right after the introduction about the kangaroo in all of his enemies yeah okay you get this like a movie star it's like you can be a tree of life a king is coming and then cut David's running from him yet or not just his enemies his own son of David when he had to flee from his son Absalom so the great moment where it is a hyperlink to
 2nd Samuel and you're supposed to upload the whole story supposed to know it inside now Psalm 7 which closes this little subgroup says a lament of David which he saying to you always say about the words of kush the benjaminite which is a deep rabbit hole on one way or another it's connected to either the story of Absalom his son's Rebellion or to the time when David had to flee from Saul and hide in caves Wilderness either way the first section of palms and the Palms in between are all about these moments of week terrible weakness and helplessness in the life of King David another beautiful that he cries out to God save me your you are my refuge. But it's about the king taking refuge in your way and asking God to rescue him
 as opposed to the king providing rescue for other people which is their individual laments are there limits of one person because they're a lot of different kinds of Psalms 23 and they're telling a story or they're within the part of the story of the the king feeling from his enemies help me help me help me. She's a popular spirituality in the ones I forget which book it is just as wonderful chapter on prayer which categorizes the prayers of her life which are help me help me help me or thank you thank you tickets again yeah but that One automatically sounds different the first line super different about babies becoming a fortress
 or bad guys and then and then and then the upside down rule of humans and we go to the next collection of Five Pawns which is Psalms 9 through 14 a little more complex about their Arrangement so we won't get into details because if you don't have a whiteboard in 4 hours and fourteen are also unified there more poems about David but also David starts talking about a group like he has a crew that's a long with him and that he cares a lot about and he calls his crew by a whole bunch of names and titles he calls them the poor and the oppressed the needy the afflicted ones to helpless the orphans I think that's yeah so there's this expansion from Jess David as that example Afflicted King to All The Afflicted people
 David and a whole bunch of people who are oppressed and afflicted by the nation's by Kings by their enemies by evildoers and that's Psalms 9 through 14 a sandwich here we have a sandwich one piece of bread is David running from his enemies is David's crew being Weak and Powerless Outkast and Powerless in the selected and in the center in the center the PB&J is is this Baby's baby battling enemies the turning point or the hinge or something between us to like what happens in Psalm 8 that suddenly David story becomes the story for All The Afflicted I don't know if that's something you're going to answer but it's an interesting question when we think about all of them does basal is one big drama happening in the section of Psalms there's people running for their lives. There's David
 the people associated with him feel really weak and now Cassie every week is a powerless they're outcasts and they're constantly being chased by enemies table here on page seven of the almost all of the names that the bad guys are called the oppressors the enemy's the Wicked the nations were the peoples and evildoers and there are enemies in samet David says you know that's right the baby Babble Turn The Fortress that rescues them from the adversary has three three types of bad guys from the the oppressor from the enemy and from the the Avenger like Avenger repo vans
 I thought they're here. They're not here so here's something that connects all made to the surrounding Palms it's about God rescuing his people we can help us from their enemies actually that's really helpful because that line this verse to it's such a weird line from the mouths of infants and nursing babes you've established a strong hold because of your adversary stuff you know in the story okay this is been a lot of attacking David the week Afflicted king of God selected ones from their enemies and from their oppressors and they are the weak and helpless pawns what's unique about Psalm 8 is that the helpless ones aren't oppressed Kings or poor people that look babies right it's like the ultimate image of a dependent creature helpless depends are still human babies yes I mean so long
 there's a handful of species that have that long of a development. But you know who I watch a lot of documentaries and well-documented and some creatures to the running around so that's the bad guys I also have a little chart here for all of the titles or metaphors for the God's chosen people in Psalms 3 to 14 and some of them were expected you know the righteous or the upright but The Afflicted the poor the innocent the crushed the helpless the orphaned infants and babies is all about people who are helpless to change their circumstances and gods in the business of raising up and exalting people like that what kind of cool so we got got interesting progression then Psalms 1 and 2 told me about an exalted King Psalms 3 through 7 then show me David On The Run not exalted powerless
 Summit lift it up and exalted human of Genesis one that's somehow a lion or an analogy with babies and then after Psalm 89:14 we're back to David and whole crew of helpless people of crying out forgot to deliver them this is meditation literature is it supposed to what's going on here why is this exalted king of Psalm to set on an elegy with powerless King set on analogy with babies and a puny human race set on analogy with David again but now with the whole bunch of helpless people associated with him this is all meant to mix in a pot in your mind and see the NC the Pieces come together so it seems to me that is the steam developing here that the exalted King with the exalted one Those whom God loves to exalt
 the helpless in the powerless who take refuge in him for people who have come to the end of their own resources like David or like babies who don't really have any resources their bodies you know the reason poop and sleep so that's the territory that were in here God loves to exhaust a lowly and take take down the high and the mighty I feel like that's the thing that Jesus like to talk about now and then yeah and it seems like it's more than helping or exalting the lowly it's that they are also saying they're participating in the mouth from the mouth of infants and babes you've established the stronghold yes and then the humans ruling helping. So let's just let loose a very quick dish to her through psalms 114 but you kind of get the point here also just trying to model of what it looks like the read groups of Psalms it's noticing these kind of connect
 search come back to soul mate look at these two parts of it and think about it and wide of the Palms around it
when we come back to Summit we notice it has two movements we heard about you always Majestic name of of the skies in the land and that's pretty awesome name the next line is this thing about the babies which to be honest for years I just kind of weird why we talked about babies and it's a weird line makes me feel good when you say that
 that's how like 90% of the Bible's.
 Let's read it so yeah way your name and sky and the land your Majestic your powerful from the mouths of nursing babies and infants you have founded a stronghold Refuge Refuge to Refuge stronghold from the sounds of babies you've established your founded a stronghold because of your enemies to stop the enemy and the Avenger okay but when you pass out all the funkiness you get this picture of babies crying out and their cries actually become a place of refuge and this is all happening because God wants to save them from exactly
 how many is a riddle that depends on you having meditated on the surrounding Farms about helpless Wicked ones who have no power to save themselves but when they call out to God he promises to deliver and God becomes their Refuge yeah that's what I was just wondering could you interpret that as you just said this John but the cries the cries of the week they go up to God and he establishes a stronghold even though it says from the Mouse crying that God establishes because God is supposed to oppressive powers in the world that's what song to told me and that's what's being told right here I was reflecting on some to would have been like from the King to come has an iron Rod he will stop the enemies in Avengers that's what you'd expect
 that's right but then the story of David comes along and is actually on the run the king that God would love to exalt is actually more like David when he was at his worst most helpful which in a way could be the same message that that King the powerful King to come is also an Afflicted King and yeah well be an Afflicted King like that could be the model of the king to come if you just read Psalm 2 and finish the book of Psalms do I kill the bad guys can have some too kind of feels yeah it says pay homage to the sun kiss his feet lest he become angry and stomp your face and make way but then the portrait of this king gets filled out through the rest of the book of Psalms and just if we're just in the first section and all of a sudden this is a king whose powers and weakness
 just like babies first part song then we come to the weary play the themes of the first part but now we're going to do it with Genesis one on the right so again I look up at your skies all those powerful things beautiful shiny lights up there beautiful his beautiful it is beautiful a Splendid Splinter like I I look up to see the the beauty up there into the humans are stinky their creatures loud and then why she the poet starts reflecting on the phrase in Genesis when the image of God so you made the human a little lesser than I love him so whether that refers to the one God who were there that refers to the shiny like a tube of Elohim being the Hebrew word for Spiritual
 text correct yeah but despite the dirty origins in the puny powerlessness of humans compared to the cosmic powers above you crowned humans with this Destiny we have this capability and calling to rule over the works of your hands and over the animals and the name is domesticated animals supposed but then also animals that are not really under human control like birds and whatever passes through the season the birds of the sky to the Sea and anything else that's in the sea under their images it's sort of like you know this is how an animation works we work an animation studio will you put a sequence of images next to each other and you to start swapping them out you start to notice
 play some ships between them how they're similar have a different so you can have the king of song to David flee and crying out to God and exalted babies crying out and God building a refuge through their calls for help you have humans puny but yet lifted High to be rulers over creation then you have David again in Psalms 19:14 just you start swapping all those on top of each other and you see a collective portrait emergent that sounds a lot like what Paul the Apostle was talking about about a crucified Messiah who's been raised from the dead to be the ruling power over all enemies whether human rulers are cosmic rulers are there by reading saw me as a part of a larger set of ideas here in the Book of Psalms and then also invite of other parts of the heat being that you get to Jesus's story and you're
 Jesus displayed his power but in this really backwards Way by allowing himself to be arrested. Crucified heralded as a king by children and so Paul is going yet that's really is part of this whole movement of the Psalms of God he lives up the week and so we got himself comes to display his power what do you expect it to look like
 what do you spell mania
would you say when we read Psalm a.m. other songs but soulmate here we should be thinking of the story of the king but also the king as the representative of the people some of the words God helps the king or he establishes the king and he also if you're Afflicted it's an encouragement to remember that God hears and that he cares that seems like what comes after cellmate encouragement for the the other Afflicted people Christians will be just as God raised up in the Saya he will also exalt and raise up those who belong to him or in the language is home to those who take refuge in the persecuted get exalted Messiah that's where this gets even more closely connected to this reflection on the the role of humanity being so elevated and having lost that
 and wanting to reclaim that how is that done so humans have the ability and capabilities to master their environment in ways that can be like giving and generate flourishing for each other and got the creatures we also have ways of doing that that are obviously destructive and the question is what story is guiding how you know how to use your capabilities in your powers and you know Jesus was raised on this literature and he thought the perfect like Royal Harold's to Usher him in to his way for a king to be enthroned is supposed to be crucified and give his life for others and then after that active self getting love to be Vindicated and exalted
 unique jewish-christian redefinition of true power Bibleman more depth this idea of Jewish meditation literature cuz you reflecting on Genesis one but you're also reflecting on this whole movement of the Psalms but then you get to go and see Jesus walk thing on it reflecting on it and then you can go back and you think about it again and David story and David story and it's all ties together and then if she hardly seems but to me it always feels like it comes back to then this this one thing which is like God wants to rescue us towards our calling and we are weak creatures but that's okay and God wants to do something with our powerlessness could be our greatest asset if we face it and are honest about it that we recognize that everything that we have
 was to offer the world anyway isn't from ourselves it's it's the gift that we received from others and ultimately from forgotten you tag that when Jesus quotes it so soul mates from the massive babies you have made a stronghold and then Jesus put this is from the mouths of these babies you have stablish prank that wish to praise correct so Jesus ya miss quoted the Bible quoted the Greek bible the Septuagint so they went with the they went with the Septuagint translation to English but it's an older version of the NIV to so they must have updated a couple centuries before Jesus Jewish Scholars translate the Hebrew Bible in Greek and when those Scholars came to the
 fine they didn't strictly translate they were puzzled to buy this image of from the mouths of babies you've established that the Hebrew word hose which means either strength or a strong place like a fortress and that strange metaphor for us I called it a riddle on purpose they the three translators smooth it out by providing a paraphrase where they interpret the stronghold as being the praise the crying out to God of Praise no actually I think that's actually a legitimate interpretation yeah cuz crying out feels like praise or lament if it's kind of more of a what do they call that a lot of translation but paraphrased it's an interpretation interpretation and English translators do this all the time and they do their best
 ever you translate one language to another you're always interpreting thing he presented and Matthew's gospel is quoting from the song but the version is that's in Jesus's mouth is the Greek version not the Hebrew version of the other thing other quotations from the Hebrew Bible in the gospel of Matthew don't follow the Greek version go follow what seems like Matthew Zone translation from the Hebrew so and the whole question is did Jesus speak Greek and people spend their whole careers about bilingualism in trilingual ISM of Jesus but either way Matthew was satisfied with having the Greek version present what Jesus said we know Matthew new the Hebrew version of the Bible he could have put it in his mouth
 are flexible when it comes to precise wording for how they call their Bible do sometimes quote a quote from whatever translation best makes the point you from the results verge of the times will merge different parts of the Bible together total I can make some new hybrid verse correct yeah that's why when you look at New Testament quotations of the old it often doesn't match exactly and that's cuz they had a different standard for quoting and interpreting than we do used to bother me and now I come to see you this really significant cuz usually it's cuz they're tracking with details or ideas that may be why is it not bother you as much anymore because it's kind of forces you to meditate and tell me yes exactly right that the rabbit hole goes deeper that sounded like are you able to relax your body and breathe and that's why it doesn't bother you, does that bother you I meant because it's invitation to as Tim would say make
 take a walk and think about it thank you guys yep good times
