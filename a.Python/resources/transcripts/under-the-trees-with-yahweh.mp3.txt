from the very beginning of the story of the Bible trees represent God the blessing then on day 6 God gives the fruit trees for the humans and the animals to enjoy it so that sets you up to see trees as a special Divine gift to the land creatures from Genesis chapter 1 then in the next litter of unit in the Garden of Eden narrative the introductory narrative shows God forming human from the dirt outside of Eden then planting the garden with the trees in it and then putting the human in the garden and then saying eat from all the tree is and there's a really good one the tree of life in the middle trees also represent a moment of testing but then the other one that will kill you if you take the wisdom about knowing Good and Evil on your own terms of the test they have to choose to trust God to continue eating from the Blessed tree of life and if they don't then they'll find themselves cut off from life that's on 2nd Movement
 Genesis is all about Abraham and Sarah how God is going to use it this couple to bless the world Abraham and Sarah depicted as a a new Adam and Eve who got a call in to return to the Garden so he can bless all and so it isn't surprising that we see the theme of trees continue what is Abraham do after taking a tour of the land God promised him as part of his Blessing he sits under the great trees of mamre later is a story of God himself meeting Abraham at those sacred trees all of a sudden becomes visible by these sacred trees Abraham God comes to meet with his chosen one at the door of the tent at the heat of the day it sounds just like the Garden of Eden when God shows up in the windows today so we had eaten moments but now he's meeting with a visible physical appearance the way and they're going to eat we're starting to sense a reversal of the failure and blessing testing failures
 you never knew trees could be this exciting I've done Collins's Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie Krista Quinn and I talk through the second movement in the Genesis scroll the part of a year-long journey walking through the Torah Movement by movement and this movement is all about Abraham tracing the theme of trees thanks for joining us here we go
hello Teresa good morning yes it is what time it is when someone listening to us for this morning for us we are walking through the Bible Movement by movement Tim what's a movement in the Bible the Bible is made up of two collections old term the Old Testament Mega Collection also known as the Hebrew Bible also known as and Friday for their titles consists of three large sections the Torah the prophets in the writings in the Torah there are five Scrolls Scrolls has been organized by the author is not into chapters the chapters that are in you know if we take the Bible today they're helpful but they're not original the original design structures that the authors put there
 our signal by all kinds of other ques 5 repeated words instead of the light what we are calling the largest level of blocks of material it within each scroll we're calling them movements on an LG with Symphonies Symphonies have usually three or four yeah usually for for movement in biblical books have usually three sometimes four large literally was just wondering to myself why why didn't the author's break up the text into chapters or sections in the first place and two movements and indicate it and then I realized will they did indicate it was repeated words and it just with other devices than a chapter number right like we do have a different devices structure of the contents of the scroll also this is a couple conversations ago in the series on the Bible as communal literature that these texts were designed to be performed allowed recited memorized
 recited and so in the recitation and when you hear it and larger chunks you start to notice the signals through repetition and so it's just a different cultures way of organizing the contents of the scroll we're not trying to make up where to read the Bible in these different movements we're trying to discern the literary structure of the text that the author is intended to put their butts right so and usually the larger scale movement it can take some work and Scholars debate on the boundaries you know of the literary movements but for Genesis it tends to follow the sequence of the main characters in Generations so literary movement one goes from creation to Noah and his sons so from Adam to Noah literary movement to which we can talk about today follows the life of Abraham his emergence out of Babylon and then up to the staff at 3 is the story of the next two generations from Abraham Isaac and Jacob their stories are combined in a really interesting way and then
 Fourth Movement is about Jacob's sons which books on Joseph and his brothers there a new theme song movement one we traced the theme of Gods rock and actually in a 2012 doesn't show up right here the word or synonym for John please translate for somebody and I hit some rock meaning Spirit or wind or breath test and so it's the great conversation walking through the movie one looking at that we're going to pick up a new theme and it's the theme of trees which would not be on my hit list of biblical themes except that we did make a theme video about it yes and it was really really wonderful and what's it called is it called Tree of Life Tree of Life
 let's jump in because in the theme of trees will start making sense I guess as we find it in the Garden of Eden come down first let's talk about recap real quick what trees mean in the Garden of Eden story and then how trees on high places become an image that the biblical authors especially in Abraham narrative can pull out and put in front of you as a way of echoing the the Garden of Eden Melody so to speak so it's the opening movement of Genesis 1 through 11 begins with God creating a high Garden Refuge or he offers life and blessing to his people he didn't even and then that has forfeited and lost but the whole goal is to restore Humanity to that Eaton blessing supplies by access to God's life through the sacred trees this probably happens a lot where when where and further sections are for their movements that they still begin.
 Genesis 1 through 3 probably recall that a lot exactly where the Symphony movement metaphor so helpful cuz the opening you know whatever however many minutes to dissolve Symphony the first movement is giving you the Baseline Melodies and notes that are going to be developed in weeks is a good example of the tree is right on pages 1 and 2 well what we call pages in the opening literally units of Genesis Scrolls didn't have Pages correct. It's right and then that image gets picked up and employed and developed and really neat ways throughout the story of Abraham because Abraham was going to see in a moment is depicted as Abraham and Sarah depicted as a a new Adam and Eve who God is calling to return to the Garden so he can bless all the nations through them and unfortunately things don't quite go that way... So first book with trees and Gardens
yeah I think when you say tree the first place maybe one of the only places most people would think of is the garden if I think about trees that are significant and then maybe the burning bush but that's exactly so Genesis creation narrative trees play a really key role on day 3 and day 6 of God's creative work so after God separated Watters from Watters called the dry land of the merge she calls specifically fruit trees to emerge up out of the ground with seed in them for avocado weed so much guacamole and our house healthy fats sometimes I pretend it's not a fruit or a vegetable
 green that makes me feel better people think it's a vegetable items to we need to move to Hawaii and just have a yard sell fruit trees on day three then on day 6 God gives the fruit trees for the humans and the animals to enjoy it so that sets you up to see trees as a special Divine gift to the land creatures from Genesis chapter 1 then in the next little a unit in the Garden of Eden narrative the introductory narrative shows God forming human from the dirt outside of Eden and planting the garden with the trees in it and then putting the human in the garden and then saying eat from all the trees and there's that really good one the tree of life in the middle but then the other one on the kill you if you texted the wisdom about knowing Good and Evil on your own terms that so right there that image of trees and eating is depicted as on a high place
 cuz there's one river that flows out of it and then supplies the holy impeding blessing water to the rest of the world so the sacred tree we're having another one God's eternal life and blessing is available to the humans freeway but there's a test I have to choose to trust God to continue eating from the Blessed tree of life and if they don't then they'll find themselves cut off from life and that is what happens if you walk out of these first stories creation story in the Eden story and returning to the place of the garden to eat the tree of life and have God's blessing these all become key images that are going to be deployed later later on the story for example the first literary movement of Genesis goes from Genesis 1 to 11 but there are three parts to it I'm in the first part goes from creation to the flood and then what's interesting when you move on to the next part of Genesis 1 to 11 it begins with God sending his room
 out his Spirit out over the waters so that the dry land can emerge after the floods to be playing the days of creation and then will you learn this no start sending out birds and eventually try one of the birds comes back without a little shrimp plant and you're like all the plants are emerging know the dry land is at razorback the office sacrifice the whole other thing but then he plants a garden and God says Vineyard and gave him the blessings you gave to Adam and Eve god-blessed Noah and his wife saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and you're like he's a new Adam you said this during the tree conversation a while back and Hebrew a tree is also a bush or Vine right that's right yeah the Hebrew word it covers a broader range of species than I were treated as
 it's can refer to bushes and plants and shrubs and what we think of as trees and growth but if it's sticking up out of the ground basically higher than your knees it's in the category of of its wooded to write a flower like a dolly or something it's going to be high but it's not going to be to do with what the stocks made of the ATM because the word tree is also the same word for would also cover what we think of is vying by Grapevine with you look at them they look Vineyard and a garden but the briers and Thorns are we supposed to
 give those as like would see anti trees 314 God addresses Adam after they ate from the tree got Chris's the ground painful toil you eat of it it will produce for you he doesn't bring up fruit trees now but now he what he brings up is anti fruit trees would see yes thanks Sorensen's thistles so they're also Woody and sick and they haven't ate since like quality to them but they producing fruit the benefits of fruit trees that are connected with life and blessing and then thorns and thistles that are connected with curse and until it seems like even the fruit trees trees that produce seed
 fall under two categories with a tree of with a meeting from the tree they should have or shouldn't have you and the tree of life it's almost like there are two different kinds of ya even a good looking fruit tree can lead to death and that foreshadows later how humans will be yes divided into two kinds of seeds that's right how different people a good-looking human can actually pose they test for another human this was going to happen in the Jacob and Joseph stories especially anyway excellent observation plants a garden and then he eats the fruit of his garden just like Adam and Eve dead and his nakedness is exposed just like Adam and Eve's leading to something shameful and divisive among his sons just like Cain and Abel and the whole thing replays that face so after Noah's sons multiply and divide this is the table of nations in Genesis 10
 with followed by a narrative about why the nation's divided and it's about the building in the city and Tower of Babylon and so that you get the narrative about the scattering of Babylon and then the literary design of Genesis 1 to 11 the scattering in Babylon sits in the same literary position as the flood narrative it's God's response to an uprising of human arrogance and evil and so the flood like judgment is repeated but in a different way not through water and rain but through the scattering of Babylon and so closes the first literary movement with the scattering of the nation's from Babylon but the lineage continues one of the three parts of Genesis 1 to 11 and there's in the middle of some kind of genealogy that traces the seed of the woman from Genesis 3 on in constantly singling out this line and so this is how Abraham was introduced his father was in the tenth of
 ten Generations from Noah just like know I was ten Generations from Adam and so you get ten Generations from Noah and what you get is a guy with $0.03 just like Noah was ten Tenors in real time and he had three sons so welcome to present him that's coming out of Babylon Stanley's coming out Babylon and what God does is speak a blessing over him just like God blessed Adam and Eve just like God blessed Noah After the flood and now God's blessing a new Adam and Eve after the scattering of Babylon so you can follow the progression so here we walk into the Abraham story maybe we'll just catch the main parts of the Abraham Story three parts to Abraham story so Abraham's the second movement of Genesis and is itself has three parts
 an interesting Lee those three parts keep mapping on to the same plot line patterns that work in Genesis 1 through 11 so the first part of Abraham narrative goes from the end of chapter 11 up through the end of chapter 19 and there's three blocks of material in here 3 years with and threes has listening as confusing as hell yeah but the point is that there are lots of tryouts structuring things in groups of three is within three is a major communication device in the Bible so what's cool about the section is organized in the really neat way in symmetry the first group goes from Abraham and Sarah leaving Babylon with their father and then journeying to the land of Canaan where they experienced God's blessing and this is the famous Abraham blessing God bless you make you a great nation great name God bless all the nations through you
 you're saying is that Abraham's family left Babylon at the beginning of his story and the culmination of this first part is about the king of Babylon following the family of Abraham the king of Babylon gets a big Coalition and comes over to where Abraham is so Abraham leaves Babylon but then Babylon leaves to come to Abraham and this is the story of the battle of the king, it's not cuz of that there's a blessing there too so this movement first part begins with blessing and it ends with blessing that begins with leaving Babylon and it begins with Abraham as a victory over the king of Babylon at school then that section is mirrored on the other side in the last part of the first first Fart Car expensive is a 18 + 19 + 19 also began with a renewal of the promise of blessing in the form of the promise of a child which they haven't been able to have and
 it ends with God bringing us if your judgment on the city of Sodom and Gomorrah but rescuing a lot out of those cities which is exactly what Abraham said he rescued lot from The Kinks Kinks Babylon she got this two sections and then right in the middle is stories of real failure, God makes a covenant with Abraham. Abraham just come to the moment of trust major failure in chapter 16 with Sarah Hagar and then you get an act of God's judgment and mercy on Abraham's genitals with which she just use to abuse his Egyptian slave Hagar and it's that sounds odd and severe remember this whole thing is about the future lineage of his family yeah the seed of the family so the first kind of movement there and trees play a key role
 of the sequence right here so then
so the first appearance of a tree on a high place in Abrams story is right when he enters into promised land in Genesis 1 through 11 the tree is this sacred most sacred of sacred places right in the middle of the garden and it's connected to God's life it's where humans experience Eden and a flourishing life themselves a suit you have the uploaded already from Genesys ending in the debacle of Babylon now Abraham's reversing that he's called out of Babylon and God's going to bring him to a new Eden which is here called the land of Canaan so the first thing God ever says to Abraham is the famous blessing it's a poem that comes in three parts in the focus is on how God is going to give to the Abraham and to see
 Al and go to this land that I'm going to show you there in the land I'm going to make you a great nation I'm going to bless you I'm going to bless those who bless you and those who curse you I will curse so that's going to protect the chosen one and all the families will be blessed and you so you get this connection hear of your nail and with a big family fruitful and multiply the last thing that you did great is the same word or Route 4 x so where does it go from here there's a little story here at least 10 asparagus you read over and passed through the land unto the place of shaquem Unto the oak of Mora and the Canaanites there that in the land the first place it goes is to this place called Shake him and he goes to a tree
 like what does matter OK Google where did more that is spelled with Hebrew letters that are similar to the word to see or to show to make visible what God just said that Abraham has go to the land that I will show you where make visible to you and then he goes unto the land unto the oak of showing or seeing so that it's the place the goddess he's in the bed with a little tour of the land that God promised him up in the northern Hill Country and there by the oak of seeing 47 Yahweh became see about the Abraham and he said to your seed I will give this land and so he built an altar there to Yahweh who became see if all to him which is not something your way does not to very many people and even to the people he has become stable it's not very often that might be recalling seeing the land
 and foreshadowing signal and another places but also seeing Yahweh it's the place where God will meet with his people become see a both of them and yeah that connection with God he moved on from there and he went to the mountain on the east of they tell they tell is the Hebrew word House of God and he spread out his tent house of God on the west and i e on the East and there he built an altar and called on the name of Yahweh so he goes from the land where you always meet with him at 4 in the altar at the place of seeing and he sees God that it goes from there to a high mountain we had the tent and near that tent is called House of God and He does another alter and worships I mean full-on it's like he's consecrating the land is doing a cruise ship tour dates for shadowing the Tabernacle at a place called House of God he has a tent where they build an altar and worship Yahweh this is like the origin story
 yeah what was Abraham creating and dedicating this land up in these Hills on the high places to be the place where he will meet with God in this all eaten imagery trees tents mountains worship God becomes visible. It's where we're supposed to see these things together the oak of seeing on a hill the mountain beit El Bethel House of God and 10th we're supposed to kind of those things together so that later if one or the other is brought up we upload all of that exactly the Mora Mora second place he goes is a mountain near house garage near the tree he built an altar on the mountain with the tent by house of God he built an altar
 what's up still it's kind of like they're two separate places one with the tree one on a mountain two different parts of the Holy Land yeah yeah but they are sitting next to each other literally so that you began to associate the imagery so that in a way that the whole expanse of this land is eaten but by putting the next to each other in the narrative you're already associating tents and trees and mountains and House of God and altars and visions of Yahweh in someone so cool a craft and then it from Journey Don Force nine going all the way down to the negative so he just went from north to south on a warship to her and at every stop in the court of the land specially it's like a new reason they go see you in the new Eden blessing to the nation's what could go wrong
 everything actually everything is about to go wrong so we won't go into it but the next story which is Genesis 12:10 onward is a failure narrative that mirrors out of me still and that's where he goes down to Egypt because of famine put Sarah's life in jeopardy or did not her life but her safety in Jeopardy so we don't have time but we do have time to talk about is right after God rescues Abram out of Egypt with great plagues he sends plagues on Egypt to rescue Abraham goes back into the land at the beginning of chapter 13 and then this has a paragraph for going to look at right now
so in that paragraph Abraham went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that belong to him and lot who was with him his nephew back to the negative Southern desert and now he's got loads of animals and silver and gold cuz well the king of Egypt gave him all this and the reason he got it was because of his life down there and you went on his journey is from the negative back up to that's out the house of God back to the place of his tent there at the beginning tween House of God in between my back to the place of the altar but he built there at the beginning and he called there on the name of Yahweh so this is a beginning Lucio to that story acts like a restoration back to the land okay I blew it come about Yahweh bailed me out and I'm a come back and read dedicate my life to the Lord as a summer camp
 Abraham and lot part ways lot goes down to Sodom what he always says to Abram is help lift up your eyes from the place where you are look to the north and to the South and to the East and the West all the land you see I'm going to give it to you and your seed forever I'm going to make your seed like the dust of the land he's seeing again just like that tree of your seeing that's right you seeing the land just like when you first went into the land he's going to make Abraham's seed be fruitful and multiply but here using the imagery of dust he's going to make a living family out of dust come on I got the Garden of Eden rise walk about in the land of the day exactly the same exact it's a unique form of the word walk for a few Bernards is called hit by all about
 not walking in a straight line but it's just raw from hell but it's metallic new policy yeah just like God would hit us with Adam and Eve in the garden and just like Noah hit her last with God and so he was spared from the flood though so now you have a new Adam and a new Noah who walks about with guy eating land as he strolls along its length oh and real quick you should know that that's when Abraham set up his tent and he went in 12 to buy The Oaks of mamre to buy Hebron and there he built an altar to you alright Nutri new alter yep Nutri and now the tree in the tantrum in the same place at the matching part of the grey in the tree or a different spot now they're the same tree and instead of the Oakland Mall right now it's the Oaks at Mama re Mama re mean it's the same letters scrambled
 call Raymond Wright has two hams in there who's a good example of where this little narrative debt matches Abrams entry into the land that we just read and then it's like an envelope structure around the two stories of failure failure in Egypt and then the unfortunate division between him and lot but you have eaten restoration images on on both sides whenever a human goes to a tree on a high place it's this way of signaling this is a mini Eden the moment connecting with God probably involving blessing or seeing God or something like that so we had a god bringing his chosen one out of Babylon into the new Eden they went into that new Eden and met with God by the tree in the tent in the mountain and then there were the failure stories that mirrored Adam and Eve's failure and Cain and Abel's division
 can you get a restatement of the blessing and don't remember in that restatement it's specifically this language about Abraham is one who walks with God now we know I walked with God that's what marked him as chosen to be spared out of all of the chaos and violence that was going on in the generation of the flood isn't it very interesting that the next story is going to be a great about a great outbreak of violence among the kings of the Nations led by the king of Babylon so I'm talking about Genesis 14 here the next story is so rad so very next story is about how the king of shinar which is what Babylon was called in at 11 so the king of Babylon comes and do you remember in Genesis 10 the guy who's responsible for the building of Babylon Nimrod he was called one
 those Mighty Warriors he was one of the Nephilim one of the Mighty Warriors so just think through it this is Noah lived in the days of the Nephilim in the head from when God destroyed them with the flood like judgment and so now I hear you have a new Noah Abraham and what we're going to see is he is not only going to be spared from the violence of these new nephew Liam like Warriors but he's going to be victorious over the help yeah so we have all these Kings the whole story we can't get into it The Narrative of Genesis 14 through goes on verses 1 through 10 it's just as long to scription of all these Kings and their huge battle armies and they go and they're just like this land Canaanites and there it's like battle Rampage through the land and there's five Kings Canaanite Kings Who come out to battle these other kings and they just they're broken than a flea and so that's the whole scene and then lot Abraham's nephew
 is there and he's captured where is Abraham doing all this is so great well here's the refugee from the battle came and reported to Abram the Hebrew and where was he living the good life living a good life he's up he's up by a tree and you know sorry I am now the narrative says you know why it's called though cuz Mama re mama is the name of a guy he's an Amorite which is a sub-clan of the Canaanites not a Hebrew Hebrew and he's chilling by the Oaks at Marlborough and this little plot of land is actually the Amorite and actually the brother to guys mom Ray was the brother of a guy named Garden grape cluster and he was also the brother of another guy
 on their certainly looks up real quick what are near me I forget on there I looked it up before I remember I just had a flag still ain't friends hanging with a guy named cluster and grape cluster Division and lots captured and blood and violence the Abrams up in the garden place yes it's not yeah it's not clear what the meaning of on there is the violence of the giborim on the violent Warriors of the nation's down low in the valley but up on the high place near the tree he's got a broom chilling and remember this was where he had his tent and built an altar and he knocked the very Eden playlist God is there with him there with him and the name of one of those
 Isis Garden great class today and you know why they were up there will they had entered into a covenant so it's like why are you telling me about this these guys in this Covenant cuz it is it brought up again till our bunch of Canaanites getting their butts handed to them by the kings of Babylon right but then you've got a handful of the nation's who they are when they are and they're like this guy's got the connection to make friends with our United so let's go hang out by his tent by the sacred tree and enter a covenant with him and lo and behold they find themselves spared from the violence of the nation's unconnected to Abraham are taken out and battle and
 the ones that are connected to him are experiencing Eden and like an Eden blessing with apron apron will become a blessing to the nation's when the nation's enter into a covenant with his family they will find themselves experiencing blessing so the store is going to go on and talk about how Abraham and his buddies get 318 like gorilla wires together and they go and Chase the Kings down and strike them in the middle of the night and if it dries and then when Abraham's returning I get another blessing that matches the first blessing you got one you got from God after 12 and now it gets the blessing of Melchizedek and that's a whole rabbit hole and that's the end of this literary you know this first and we just walk through the sequence of Genesis 1 through 11 accept the storyline has been played not out in multiple Generations but just in the life of one one man of the year
 a little part of his life exactly
let's go to another one unfortunately skip over the story of Genesis 2:15 through 17 not that there isn't cool stuff there but there aren't any trees but if they would like to think what I just did for you every time I got your back I'm going to give you the land give you a big family and Abraham struggles to trust in God he struggled so much that in the next chapter he and Sarah fail. Trust in God and try to produce the seed This Promise family on their own by abusing sexually abusing their Egyptian slave so God shows mercy and blesses promises to bless the slave and her son but also says it's going to be through a son from Abraham and his first wife Sarah that the child's going to come so God shows an active judgment and mercy on Abraham chapter 17 and then boom we're back in the 18 and 19 back to the flat line and this story's rad so Genesis 18 begins
 and Yahweh became seeable to Abraham by The Oaks of mamre okay here we are again but doesn't matter one letter different at a tree yet we're in Eden territory and hear the focus is going to be on the 10th and evening so he was dwellings or how is a tenant need an image is not from just one through eleven it would be from reading the Bible backwards and realizing the Tabernacle is put up on the mountain where Noah got off the bus he planted a garden eight of its fruits is Nick Adams was exposed and he went into his tent so you had a tent in a garden with. So that was a no is at that tent was so then I went into the land in chapter 12 and he went to the tree then to the mountain called how so
 and on that mountain there by that mountain he put up a tent and he met with God and built an altar by the 10th so this is like a reclaiming it said that's right so you but it was all designed with an eye towards the Tabernacle yes cuz meditation literature be read forward after I have in a call on the mountain high place that is eaten exactly then you're thinking of that to the way the narrative I'm using the language of the Hebrew Bible scholar Michael Morales who wrote a book called The Tabernacle prefigured and he's tracing how the Tabernacle is the realization of all of these Clues and noticed that our buildings throughout the books of Genesis and exodus I like that is a prefiguration of the temperature so all of a sudden becomes visible by the sacred trees Abraham oh yeah and he's sitting at the door of the tent is exactly the same phrase used to describe where the priest offer sacrifices at the door of the tent in the Tabernacle
 the heat of the day yeah, about that calm I am home I am home alone God comes to meet with his chosen one at the door of the tent at the heat of the day it sounds just like the Garden of Eden when God shows up to Adam and Eve's the wind of the day I am in the Wind of the day from the door of the tent to meet them and about the crown so becomes visible in the form of Three Men and he said please if I found favor in your eyes don't pass on from your servant let me get a bit of water so you can wash your feet here sit with me under this tree
 come and join me in this eating Place watertree God's about to sit down with his friend under a tree rest in the garden take a bit of rent so you can sustain your heart then you can pass on Shirley this is why you've passed by your servants you can meet with me and have food under the tree so we've had eaten moments but now he's meeting with a visible physical appearance of Yahweh and they're going to eat under the tree this is as close to this is great because when when God was strolling around in the garden in the Wind of the day last time with Adam and Eve things went South so it's like oh good maybe this can be reclaimed whistle of the failure and eaten so the men said into the tent to Sarah and he said hurry three measures of wheat flour needed
 make cakes that you and I are studying through all this vocabulary Leviticus chapter 2 offering thank offerings or as a priest tomorrow making up the offering this described in Leviticus chapter 2
 in the net with the cattle to the calf good and tender this is my favorite I remember like sitting at my dining room table was an early morning and this hit me and I was like oh man I probably said something then ran to the cattle and he took a calf good and tender and he gave it to God and humans can eat under a tree he took and he gave that's okay boy from Adam and Eve to yes exactly what about the good the toast took what is good in Genesis 3 the signal failure but was so rad is the word good here's the Hebrew word tough so Eve soft fruit of the tree of knowing good and bad toe Vandross she took it and she gave here
 takes a calf that is Toad and rock and rock and here he takes good and tender oh wow so good to this hyper linking to the fall Narrative of taking of the tree of good but it's at least in this moment so he hurried to make it he took the Kurds in the milk in the caffeine made and he gave it to them and then he stood by them under the tree and it ate together that's the third time tree is mentioned is right as they start having a conversation about how next year at this time you're going to finally have that son the blessing of seed be fruitful and multiply so this is the hot is a Hi-Point lots of blessings under trees so far
 yeah I love the sister it's really cool and what's great is the trees are just kind of the surface image on the story is so many more hyperlinks in here it's like an invitation when you see trees by the 10th degree read The Narrative carefully and what you'll start to notice is all this other vocabulary from eating but it's all being inverted that's my favorite one okay so the arc so far is we went from entry to Eden trees tents mountains blessing failure for the restoration to it and then a rescue the story of the violent Kings of down below 12 the Nations that cling to Abraham to Covenant by the tree find blessing and safety and you had another round of failure with Hagar and then here now we're restoration the Ethan blessing again cycling it through somebody's reading through and they come across a tree so far at least in Genesis
