there are four gospels in the Bible all of them tell about the life death and resurrection of Jesus one of these gospels stands out as different from the rest gospel John and so why is it that the Gospel of John feels so different it feels like a retelling of the Jesus story with a level of reflection and it's the same basic clamps with Paul and the other Matthew Mark Luke of making but the way Jesus talks and John and the way the narrator's voice talks about Jesus it feels like you're in a different movie you're in the movie that's about the same person but that has a really different director so today on the podcast Tim and I discuss the identity of Jesus in The Gospel of John going to look at a lot of amazing passages including this one in John 17 for Jesus prays for his disciples and he says Holy Father keep them in your name the name which you have given me that they
 maybe one even as we are one beautiful thing that Jesus and his father have had going for eternity the defines what God means to a Christian that God is a community of love and that Oneness and unity of love in their Oneness is mirrored by Jesus followers when they show unity and Oneness with each other by acts of loving service and Sacrifice from John Collins this is the Bible project podcast in today how John talks about the identity of Jesus in relationship with Yahweh god of the Bible
 thanks for joining us here we go
 we're talking about the identity of God in the Bible and I've been all over the Bible and then this episode we're looking at the Gospel of John and how John has had the most time to reflect on the identity of Jesus as a relates to God is formed vocabulary and phrases and ways to think about it it's marinated for the most amount of time it's right and so his gospel is very unique and its tone and language because of that but it's not because he's saying anything different than Paul and the other Apostles in their gospels it's that he's crafted in Poetic and and purposeful in the way he's saying things yeah yeah and he's had decades we can tell from the letters of John you know he's planted a number of churches and there's been controversies
 churches about the identity of Jesus read first John that's what it there's there was a group that split off cuz they didn't believe Jesus was fully human explain something over and over been truly learn the way to explain it that hits home correct the best yeah that lands yet really well that's totally personally that's one of the great gifts of having spent so many years just teaching and preaching on a regular basis and so would be just being in a classroom being Bible teacher cuz you're just constantly every time that issue or that passage of that text is on the table it's not brand new to my mind but it is to all these other people yeah and so the questions they're asking make me oh yeah shouldn't say it that way right this way yeah so John's had decades longer than any of the other Apostles to hone his language about the identity of Jesus
 you can say it in a way and you look at how the person is responding is it lighting up in their eyes are they confused and then you got all that work that didn't work out and John has the unique privilege of being the last of the living fossils as the tuition goes he was he lives somewhere in the like the 90s lady he had a few decades more than any of the other apostles who the teams were all murdered or killed but he lived and seems to die at a ripe old age according to the gospel house within the gospel that yeah he long outlive Peter and all the other Apostles right in the last chapter of John 21 so he also had the privilege of his mind and heart developing along as being able to do that to just reflect so the Gospel of John steals like that it feels like a retelling of the Jesus story with a level of reflection and it's the same basic
 DePaul in the gospel of Matthew Mark Luke are making but you can tell it's he's chewed on it and thought about it and and that the spirit employed that reflection in the composition of the book which means it's more the language uses a slightly different different is unique yeah yeah John and the way the narrator's voice talks about Jesus it feels like you're in a different movie that's about the same person but that has a really different director okay right then you know it was done by two different directors yeah usually doesn't go well as in the story of Jesus I think it went excellent did a great job with the reboot that's right parts of the story you know the most famous example is Jesus
 prosthetic protest in the temple runs over the tables and end and it makes sense event the stunt she pulled that gives everyone the bombed-out final put them in the crosshairs on the L John is recorded the events so it's in at the beginning of the story chapter 2 and it's because of what Jesus says in that exchange he talks about himself being the temple which is something that John's introduced in chapter one that he just wants to keep her own developing it so he's reordered the chronology to according to his theological somatic ideas for developing so anyway they go another thing going on the thread you can follow through the Gospel of John is the way he Echoes the Shema in different stories or in different things that Jesus
 actually this interesting Richard become one of my favorite New Testament Scholars he's written a lot on John and I was just listening to a lecture that he gave on one in the Gospel of John the word want a 12 x it refers to the one for the unity of the people of God and there is echoing passage in the in the prophets about God's people being unified after the Exile but then there's a whole bunch of passages that either the word one is used to talk about Jesus and the father or that use the concept of Oneness or equality Unity between and his whole point is that these are stories and staying so they're using the concept of the Shema we have one Lord and God so here's your just three examples just so you can come see the principal at work first ones in chapter 5 John chapter 5
 what John sees me where Jesus is just healed that paralyzed man by the pool that by that pool of water and it was a Sabbath day so virtuous leaders of their they get angry because the guys carrying his mat on the Sabbath and that's breaking the rules cuz I was doing this on the Sabbath so it says John 5:16 for this reason the Jews and here it doesn't mean all of the judges cuz everybody there's two us a handful of people persecuting Jesus because he was doing these things on the Sabbath so he answered them my father is working
 unto this moment
 so my father is working on the Sabbath and I myself and working
 for this reason the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him not only cuz he was breaking the Sabbath but because he was calling God his own father making himself one with God equal with God so when they see Jesus doing something and then saying that's my father yeah doing it God's doing it and I'm doing it with him God's doing it and I'm doing it and they see what he's getting at so this is a good example where the word one doesn't occur but the concept of Jesus claiming Oneness with God that what if you see me doing something you see got to pick up his plant immediately
 is that a story in John chapter 10 it's at the Feast of dedication or Hanukkah where Jesus in Jerusalem and he's giving a speech he just gave the I am the Good Shepherd to be in chapter 10 and then the culmination of that speech in these debates that he's in with Jewish leaders is he says I and the father are one right so just the Classic Jesus phrase yeah I think about how Paul said it member we looked at that passage Paul says for us followers of Jesus there is only one God and one Lord the one God named Lee the father who created all things and Jesus Messiah through them all things are created so he's taken the Shema and in the place of God is the father and the son together are the one God Jesus doing exactly the same thing I and the father are the one God are one
 and this is closely related to a phrase will look at it more but this is the first time he gets used in John 14 where Jesus is talking to the disciples and secret not the room and he's talking to fill up and you said fill up don't you believe that I am in the father and the father is in me the words I say I don't speak on my own it's the father abiding dwelling in me doing his work so these are all together when you see Jesus at work you see the father at work. Funny act like a phrase I am in the father and the father is in me yes yes like physically 3D space how can something be in something that's right that's all so I can't be in something and have that thing inside me to write yes if I am inside a room the room can't be inside of me right inside my mouth that you're not in the nuts right
 is it physically possible to correct the only way it's possible is if it's the same thing your mouth is the nut yeah I'm sure there's probably yeah it would be like what what is simultaneously inside you and you are inside of it yes so it will become said this was helpful he said essentially he thinks this I am in and it is in me is another way of trying to put language to this one this thing that is a human being one with the father that when you see Jesus at work you're seeing the father at work are 3D spatial imagery only gets us so far yeah cuz he's talking about Unity there you can get two things and merge them closely together and say that they're one so you can do that but then this in
 Mutual in this is another spatial metaphor that actually doesn't make literal sense but conceptually it's talking about the closest Unity you can possibly imagine you could also stay out of water when you're swimming I'm in the water water the waters in me is it in you well Cindy body is water reflecting on the Shema reflecting on his years with Jesus and what he believes about Jesus based on what Jesus said and did and the Gospel of John has language in that shows that year as a mature reflection and he's retelling the story is and teachings of Jesus in light of that reflection and so you have this Oneness and I am in and it's in me it's in him and school is for me to kind of opened up these passages the year of this language as it's getting to the limits of what language do to make a claim about
so what we can look at now isn't is another example where is this phrase about it's about the name the Divine name in The Gospel of John and we saw this and Paul's letters how Jesus will take Old Testament passages that have the Divine name Yahweh rendered into Greek as Lord and then you put Jesus into the slot the Lord slot so the phrase Jesus is Lord is very Jewish way of saying Jesus is Yahweh so John again same idea but he's marinated it the idea has marinated you and maybe the ideas and him and he's in the so this thing about the Divine name that reverberates all throughout the gospel here's one example
 it's in John chapter 8 Jesus is in a dispute with a number of Jewish leaders and Bible teachers and they're making accusations actually trying to undermine his credibility talking about how he is of Unknown Origin or that he's possessed by evil spirits so what he says it actually is listen I'm actually The Fifth Element of our scriptures and all of our hopes and yes is famous line ray says listen Abraham your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day meaning of the promise of God gave to Abraham that through your seed blessing would go to all the nations here it is I'm the seed I'm the seed and Abraham would be so stoked to see me right now but you guys you say you're the Seed of Abraham but man you're not acting like it
 so then his what do you say his debate Donuts did you say to him what's up oh well it says Abraham Rejoice to see my day and he saw it he saw and was glad I was glad you said he would be glad if that's a good point and second temple Jewish literature because in the narrative Arc of the Hebrew Bible Isaac Abraham giving birth to the one and only Isaac even though he had Ishmael before he becomes a first step of the real I think of the seed bless all nations are we saw it in because as a reader you can see through the whole narrative Isaac is the first arrival down payment right of single at leading all the way up to the line of David and Saul the reader as a unified story means the joy that Abraham had over Isaac is the joy over the arrival of the Messianic seeds David got it
 just read this Bible is one unified story so Abraham rejoiced and the juicehead him wait you're not even like 50 years old and you're saying you seen Abraham but you didn't he didn't say sorry for your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day he's what you just described it was well he saw the down payment that he fertilizes I'm saying that's the way reflecting why Jesus says something like that okay I understand in Jesus says something people weird misunderstanding what you seen Abraham look like of course not guys. What are you talking about maybe had moments where you say something somebody responds and it's exactly the response you were hoping for say the next thing right
 I got it where people misunderstand Jesus for the perfect set up perfectly sets him up do you say that something that supposed to be said that's great so Jesus says listen I tell you the truth before Abraham was born I am and then they picked up stones to throw at him I think most people do Greek or Hebrew on this this was the go-to verse Story to defend the deity of Jesus English-speaking two thousand years later this year well yeah because how it was explained was he's using the Divine name I am and he's saying he was around before Abraham who is this guy now he's not just a human and he's not just a demigod he is Yahweh himself I am
 there it is this is a great example I think the point here is that fits into a wider pattern of a certain Jesus as one with the god of Israel but yeah your instinct was right you know who who we'd have to have these conversations with the most Jehovah Witnesses people of other kind of brand because they're really they're really felt about you and never talk to a guest at Pappas Burgers number of times different scenarios and it's like Bibles cracked open and we're like arguing about what the heck yeah yeah that's right I mean you can see why father and son
 and the first born haha has in the history of the church multiple times caused some interpreters to see that as claiming the Jesus is a created being born and is the preeminent human but that he's a created being and an example of that and so that makes sense of that particular way of phrasing it the sun image but that doesn't account for is all these other patterns were Jesus's fully identified with Yahweh or with the father that would make you go back and say oh perhaps that born language is were first born is metal a metaphor about Jesus status on the heath came into existence so in Greek the way he says this is it sound as unnatural as it is rendered here in English before Abraham was born
 born in the correct angle should be I was I was yeah I was like I've been around before Abraham was born I was around I existed existed before Abraham was born I exist
 present tense of the grab that present tense is that
 for Jesus to claim to be one with the father means and to be with God and God in the beginning means that his relationship to time is fundamentally different then a creature I think that's what the language would mean are these presents to every moment so y'all way I am the one who is in Greek is a go and me I am the one who is in the Greek Tramp Septuagint translation the Hebrew phrase I will be who or what I will be that's the Hebrew phrase I will be a future future tense they gave me and then in the Septuagint got translate does present tense future in Greek at the present I am the one who is ATS right and if you always will be the one who will be intense doesn't matter you are
 also you are the one who is and you were the one who was and you were the one who was that's right yeah you can say it any three you can say in present a few days you are being the one you are but yeah so this is great because it's not just the word he doesn't ever say use the word name but he is picking up on the very meaning of the Divine name namely the one who is any source that about himself because the name of God being a define attribute that was personified as well I remember that phrase that we looked at the name open my name and him I will put my name in the temple yeah and then in the angel to Angel the angel who goes with you I will put my name and him yeah and so here is Jesus saying that he is the Divine name as human then they're going to be other passages when you finally get to John chapter 17 I'm setting
 around here when you get to John 17 this name is our minds will explode any Miss Dennis go off the charts this is the climactic summer and then we'll come back to John Spirit okay
all right so all these things we've we've talked about the word wisdom The Glory Glory the name and they all come crashing into each other in Jesus's prayer this climactic prayer and then he goes on from here and gets arrested so he opens up father the hour has come glorify your son so that the Sun May glorify you even as you gave him a sortie overall flash a human given us authority over all flash son of man that's Daniel 7 so I got man stuff the glorification of the persecuted son of man who got trampled by Thursday so that's why it's because we've already established that he is the glory of God yes but there is an hour of Glory that's yet to come and that's this son of man being seated at the right hand given authority over all
 the whole story of Jesus is viewed now it's kind of one thing the human one rejected and trampled by the beast but that trampoline is actually the means by which these exalted to the Glorious Reign share in God's ran over all things so he's picking up on the Daniel 7 and The Suffering and Glory that are there at work and Daniel and Isaiah so that to everyone that you have given him he's talking about himself in third person so father everyone you have given him the son may have eternal life this is eternal life that they may know you the one the only true God and Jesus Messiah whom you sent to his eternal life without knowing god there's about knowing Jesus and of course the point is yes and what does that mean that it's real life is knowing something oh yeah dude
 important passage to help people whose see the phrase eternal life referring only to the thing that happens after you die that's explicitly not what it means right eternal life is when you move from a state of being a zombie of among the living dead and you move to a place of being reconnected in Covenant relationship to your creator which is the father and the son and so it's yet knowing relational Covenant old knowing your eternal life begins now telling very powerful
 Hugo's on now father glorify me together with yourself with the glory that I had with you before the world existed is this the kind of like the emptying kind of thing that what's the DePaul fancy word yet Paul talks about is this a sense of like okay Jesus was with God and was God was full of Glory but somehow by taking on flash he emptied himself it seems like what he's saying is like he has a new reality right now where he doesn't experience the glory he had experience before the member in chapter 1 John said the word became flesh and we saw his glory Jeff but throughout the Gospel of John the whole narrative tension is some people see it some people see Jesus as the glory of God become
 other people dumped but there's coming a moment the hour is come when Jesus will be glorified with the glory that he had before the world began so there is a sense in which Jesus life before his crucifixion and Resurrection was a hidden glory to glory that wasn't fully revealed and here in the Hebrew Bible what what exists in the beginning with God what's the word and wisdom so that the glory
go down to verse 11:11 he begins to pray for the disciples and he says Holy Father keep them in your name the name would you have given me so that they may be one as we are one very nice yeah yeah yeah yeah but now it's the name the name the first time this is really registered for me thinking of the name being the Divine attribute the one and only name yeah and I and so to keep them in your name is basically another way to say keep them in you yeah but who is you was your name it's me it's me yes yes that's it so that they may be one as we are one not already that's clearly working on the level of analogy this is not saying that Jesus followers
 become God be kind of interesting disciples are never in another they are in the father and they are in Jesus Jesus the father in each other but the disciples never in each other the way that the disciples show their Oneness with each other is love this is how the world will know your followers of the one who is in the father and the father is in me how do you know one and I love each other so it's the act of love to so beautiful we're getting to it did we're getting to the sweet and want to share with us is that the thing that Jesus and his father have had going for eternity that defines what God means to a Christian that God is a community of love and that Oneness and unity of love in their Oneness is mirrored by Jesus followers when they show
 unity and Oneness with each other by acts of loving service and sacrifice so there's nothing about when I write when I disadvantage myself to benefit you as an act of selfless sacrificial love that we are uniting the time creating a bond in humans and when family members do it for another powerful when friends do it for another one another powerful but it's almost more powerful natural bond and when strangers do it for each other or when people were enemies or enemies do it for each other that's a that's a powerful symbolic statement about you and me as fellow humans and the Oneness of love between the father and the son is most closely mirrored or Illustrated when two humans show love for each other that's where this
 things going there you go whatever done like a sociological philosophical study on what culture would be like what size would be like if everyone acted selflessly surely there's some novel has been written or movies and I don't know them fix it like but beyond I mean kind of like I think I think what people typically say is hey doesn't work because someone is going to be a bad apple and that bad at all if everyone's acting selflessly is going to eventually get the upper hand on everything and the the wolf in sheep's clothing and so you can actually act that way doesn't actually work but I'm wondering if anyone's ever really thought through that liked is that the case or if most people were acting selflessly and there were
 where are these sheep are wolf in sheep's clothing and they came up sporadically would they eventually be converted to the way of love and this is the power Paradox member that they're talking about which is like how do you gain power how do you really gain and keep power in his whole point was you don't do it through these mock of alien ways and that I guess he's the one that's written about sorry that was total aside and it's where all the stuff your head starts spinning has not already then Jesus moves on from praying from the disciples like that he hung out with to say I'm not asking in prayer on behalf of just these this is life as I know
 but also for those who will believe in me through their word the future generations of the Jesus movement I asked that they may all be one even as you father are in me and I in you that they also may be in us that the world may know or may believe that you sent me to see now me and you and you and me is another way of saying one that they may believe the glory that you have given me I've given to them that they may be one just as we are one i in them and you in me that they may be perfected in Oneness reunity I think of how it gets Trends as my translations I think this is how it usually gets translated so that the world may know that you sent me and they may know that you loved them even as you have loved me father I desire that they
 also the ones that you've given me maybe with me where I am so that they may see my glory which you have given me for you loved me before the foundation of the world who writes his father the world as a known you but I've known you and these no know that you sent me I have made your name known to them and I will make it known so that the love with which You Loved Me Maybe in them and I in them the love which you have loved me maybe and then and I which is the love of Jesus is the physical embodiment of the love of the father because he has the one and only the left one ultimate loved one. There's almost tried to draw different pictures throughout the years to help me but the claim is that Jesus and the father and his we're going to see through the spirit
 are a community of eternal love what was God doing before creation is having a snack I don't know each other you loved me before the foundation of the world is a says like when Jesus wants to talk about the essence of God's Eternal nature in existence it was I get that in the abstract. I mean if there isn't anything that exists in what ways are they loving each other each other but this is a claim being made is the only way a human control of is if there's another human love is a relational other-centered experience in the claim of the story of Jesus at the center of the universe is a beautiful mind who is a community of love a one and more than one community of luck cuz what
 I mean to say love except their mother has to be and other to love so God the community of Love lovers
 and that you and I that the Universe exists as the outflow or the Overflow of God's got to love that the universe is a testament to the fact that God wanted to share life and love with more than just the community of God's Own so we're being invited into a whole new dimension in an espresso be made multi organisms okay so let me draw this at least multicellular organism but also more than one that's not the history of the cell replicate itself yeah we are a bunch of different cells working together on one level to make one
 humans are one thing and all so many things yeah we're weird yes I don't know what other phrase I meant when I first saw The Wizard of Oz as a child I lost so so like weird it out it was such a strange story that price on a date or something I don't know categories for it and was also from older films and so it's it was this weird Otherworld I don't know the moat East and categories being worked it was just completely other to me and so now I feel like every day I wake up and I'm convinced and experience reality as more strange than what I remember that stuff we've been lulled into this we get used to it
 used to what are we doing here what is like oh yeah this is normal flying space rock on speaker made up of I went to Oregon Museum of Science and Industry yeah here in Portland and they're having a really cool like Saddam Pompeii is really really neat but then we went to the earth science exploration center or whatever and that this whole thing on gas and that was here and so I'm set my sons and move on to the next thing but I sitting there staring at it I got it about the atmosphere and about how the only thing keeping all of our water and oxygen from the air being sucked out into space is a layer of invisible gas that formed by heat coming off of the forming H2O molecules in the water and that eventually that thing for him from all the like the single cell organisms are floating in the ocean
 that's right yes yes yes and there is like their whatever hitting the atmosphere formed that ozone limits like Ron the flying space rack space space space Rock the son of the powerful laser and the only thing sustaining all of us well there's many things but one of the main things is this invisible gas layer that could just not be there and then we would not be here so it comes along and is telling a version of the flying space Rock story and saying there's a person at the center of this whole thing and then the moments you know that you're in touch with the meaning of the universe is when you experience love from another and when I give out love to another and that itself is just a shadow of
 reality of the heart and character of the being who generated this whole thing that's the claim be made by the store and this is why I also then John and his epistle can say God is love God is love which is important because for John God isn't first and foremost Creator and ruler he is those things as a being of love if an eternal community of other centeredness is the very definition of the Christian God then what it means for that being to create will be very different than what it means for solitary Divine being to create sure and the way the Divine community of Love rules the world will be very different than how you know the solitary lone deity drool and talking about this eternal community of love that is one is trinitarian theology correct there's a phrase that's it yeah people use that's right
 phrase that later Christian thinkers and leaders gave to this thing that's happening all through the New Testament that is itself a way of talking about Jesus Built on language that comes right from the Jewish scriptures themselves and we'll make a 5-minute video explains all that quote from Larry hurt one of my favorite New Testament nerds here apps. It says the Gospel of John draws on a rich almost interchangeable association between God and God's name it expresses a uniquely intimate relationship between Jesus and the father indeed for the author of The Gospel of John For Whom the biblical Traditions he means the Hebrew scriptures they provided the authoritative store of vocabulary and images and themes by which to express the significance of Jesus for him this Divine name tradition
 constituted the most profound way to talk about the relationship of the Sun in the father to say you have the one and only name and that name is given to me in my name so to speak of Jesus as invested with the Divine name or it's given the name or manifesting God's name and his words and actions coming with the name or coming in the name of God is real phrases from John this is to portray Jesus as bearing and exhibiting God in the most direct way possible in the conceptual categories of the biblical tradition and within the monotheistic commitment of a tradition that was what he saying is this is the most Jewish way possible unified Jesus and the god of Israel has one in the Centre is to follow Christian started using terms and conceptual categories from say Greek philosophical traditions and this is where you start getting words like the father and the son are of one being or one essence
 sportube many distinct persons but one a sense but it's important to see that the use of the Divine name tradition in John is on its own terms equally radical and a direct Claim about the relationship between Jesus and God there's a Greek way to talk about it at the church is mostly in the church has mostly kind of used that logged onto that cuz of the way we think really comes more directly from Greeks thought that's been from Jewish. That's right so the reason it's important is what it means is that the Trinity and father son is Spirit persons who are one Essence those are later language and categories but they're describing the same exact reality that the New Testament is trying to get out from beginning to end the New Testament is doing it with categories in language from the Hebrew scriptures and it but they're making the same radical Claim about Jesus and and many of the disputes about
 is the Trinity of Bellator idea was imposed on the Bible that's just a fundamental category mistake or is he usually just that we don't know how the Hebrew Bible works or talks well if you've ever talked about in terms of god's complex Unity is Greek paradigms and Greek vocabulary and then you say hey cool show me where that's in the Bible and you go to the Bible and it's not using Greek paradigms it's not using that language capillary it's not using the vocabulary views to define the whole thing. Seems like you just made this up yeah that's right but if you go looking for the Jewish ways to talk about this and the Jewish vocabulary it's all over we haven't carried on the tradition of using that's right I know that is the biblical language you know we can appreciate foreign language
 I don't know Greek I don't know French so if I'm in a room with someone speaking yet I don't know what you got translate in English but in the same way there's as foreign languages is this foreign ways of thinking that's right it's foreign categories of thought language is inseparable from culture and worldview and so the way that a Greek person that I got first century Greek person thought it was different than the way I first century Jewish person thought and 1st Century ad Jewish person talking in Greek that's right it's still thinking yeah yeah like a Jewish person yet he's in Greek language yeah I always think of it as it's Greek you know not intentionally and they are using I mean the fact that they're using the Greek language means that there's already a step of cultural Transit
 happening right but the author who does that the most is Paul and it's because he had way more diverse education it's memes than any of the other Apostles so he kind of was bilingual you can talk my bubble butt by thought that's right he can speak in thinking both Hebrew Bible style Greek Instinct that way and you can sync in Greek philosophy Curry and his letters often show him in both modes sometimes simultaneously where is for John it's way more it's just the fabric of the themes in the language is right from the Jewish scriptures yeah this is the way it's being patient with the Bible or rather the Bible's been patient with us right and is allowed us to not hear what it's saying for me my which is one of the things I hope that for the video it's allowing or helping people hear the claims of the New Testament about Jesus but on their own
 terms and to do that we have to create a map conceptual map of how that you were getting you have to create we would call himself see if we don't have that are Jewish else yeah so that then when we get to these claims you go that goes on that that's right at the shelf and that's so much we never had to do that so much in any theme in anything video that is free so many shelves it's right and not only recreating shelves with cream very confusing shelves and yeah true do you like one really confusing thing is this whole difference between son of man and Son of God super stick Euler narratives underneath you the East and you have to kind of rip the the concept free of the mental model we have our and then let it
 reshape and that's in and of itself is a massive Endeavor and there was another one we were talking about that was like oh yeah that's a big misunderstanding that I feel like we're going to have to be careful with these are all just to create the shelves so then we can then go cool now how does the Bible talk about the identity of God as a relates to Jesus yep and then we have even so, spirit so much right but we didn't Paul and John got some work cut out for us we do yeah this is why I've been thinking this is not a 5 minute video I'm down a different kind of videos
