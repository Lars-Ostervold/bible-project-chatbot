last week we began a new theme study looking at the dragon in the story of the Bible the Bible is not the only ancient texts or dragons play a key role dragons pop up all over ancient near Eastern literature dragons are like the first Global meme of the ancient world there a way to talk about chaos and death their forces out there that want to take the life of the precious good thing in my world and everybody knows that feeling in one way or another and the dragon-slaying meth was a common ancient near Eastern way to an Explorer about that on both the individual level and then on a corporate communal and Cosmic level now when we talked about Miss we usually think about made up stories fiction for the ancient world understood myth and a much more nuanced away the technical sense of meth is a symbolic narrative that exploring or expressing
 Universal concerns that human existence usually about the origins of the cosmos and the nature of the cosmos and they're using these symbols to explore the human experience that everybody sense then and until now and everybody on the planet now actually has the same experiences and feelings we just have different symbols and language for them so probably uses symbolic language and talk about Mythic creatures can I trust the Bible mean is the Bible accurate are you saying that narratives in the Bible aren't true because they may employ the language of Mythology or symbolism that's my question told their family history in narrative poem poetry they regularly Drew on the same set of symbols that their ancient near Eastern Neighbours did because it was a common symbolic language of their time today
 Jackie and I talked about dragons and ancient near Eastern mythology I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
it's in here we are here we are talking about dragons dragons in the Bible yeah it's kind of misleading is it like last time we talked what you really showed us was there's a lot of creatures in the Bible that you could translate some of them with the word Dragon but then there's more the theme of like chaos creatures dangerous chaos creatures of the sea and of the Wilderness and there's lots of variety of types of bees animals that are connected in terms of what they mean so lions in our dark predatory creatures of the Wilderness that on tonight and so are crocodiles or something like that but the one creature that has a word used to describe both the sea monster and the Wilderness monster is the word NACA in Hebrew which means snake or serpent stuff and then there's a big vocabulary
 of what the water version yeah that creature is leviathan class 10 and the time means upon which which I'm monstrous reptilian creatures with multiple heads today so the reason why were talking about this is it's actually a major repeated theme throughout the story line of the Bible starting with page one depending on the translation you read but they're in Hebrew on day 5 of creation and all throughout imagery of snakes and dragons and monsters is used throughout the biblical story as an image for wealth part of what we talked about right now in this conversation and then the story of the Bible culminates with the victory over the dragon in Revelation the basic point of our last conversation was just to say there be dragons in the Bible and they're all over actually an all over all the parts of the Bible yeah I know you you show
 that in Greek the Greek translation of the Bible the Septuagint use the Greek word so is examine explore the cultural Back store is that the biblical authors are working with so we're going to look at is the dragon combat meth in ancient near Eastern culture and literature and their the monster is primarily a sea dragon with the biblical authors do and this is what we do and all that so it's to follow is take up that cultural symbolism that's very common in their day and they tweak it and develop it and do interesting things with it and that's where you get the variety of monster creatures that are all Associated where it all started with the Ancient Ancient cross cultural mythology about the storm God fighting sea dragon cool this will be great because I think my
 category would a dragon is is pretty narrow and I think I mentioned this last episode I just think of your classic you know winged dragon living in a cave boarding pot of gold and he doesn't live in the sea yeah I actually have a category of a sea dragon okay yeah so like let's create one let's create it and to do that let us turn to a variety of ancient stories many of the much older than the Bible that we're in the air and in the language and literature in which the Bible came to existence so what we're looking at is the ancient near Eastern culture background of the dragon-slaying Smith
 so in the ancient near East and actually beyond the ancient near East there is a really widespread symbolic narrative told across cultures that preceded the Israelites and surrounded them and it all has the same basic plot line with the same characters it's really fascinating so just as a note I learned a lot from Robert Miller's Works Hebrew Bible scholar called the dragon the mountain and the nation's I learned a lot from a recent PhD from University of Chicago medicine Richie wrote a dissertation on visions of Gods and Monsters
 and then an older where it got John Day British scholar called God's conflict with the dragon and the Sea so fascinating so here's the basic summary you can go back to the oldest roots of Indian culture in Hindu religious texts how old are we talkin well the textual versions are dated somewhere around the notes likely in oral formation. From 1900 BC through 1000 BC 900-year formation history but Abraham's cruising the promised land maybe around 1700 BC appreciating his might have been around before yep before there's an ancient hittite version that comes from around the. When Abraham and his descendants are cruising around from the Old Kingdom. Of the tides around 1700 BC
 there is a version of the story told by the Koreans which is a really unique people group least their language is cuz it's not Indo-European or Semitic language really interesting in a familiar with this crew around 1500 BCE their kind of way up in the north of turkey then you have a city of which the coastal archaeology site in Lebanon on the coast of Lebanon and they're around the time of Joshua and the judge is 1,500 to 1200 BC they have a really elaborate version of the story and then we get to Assyria and Babylon Mesopotamia and there's this from around the same. 1500 so it's kind of like if you look at a pond and you can see that there's a ripple going out you presume there's a stone you can kind of angle from where the ripples are
 back to where the center was yeah that's kind of the idea of how the story spread is it's an all these cultures around this time. 1900 to 1500 and so most certainly had its roots go back even to the prehistoric. We're all these cultures descended from prehistoric meanings before any written or written language that's right so we're right on the brink yeah in the 1900 BC right yeah well for the alphabet to be off of that so the hieroglyphics in the Sumerian or a thousand years it's been around for much longer. But in terms of an oral story about the storm God facing down the Sea Dragon it must have lived on orally for much longer. To have all these descendants and he's very different languages and cultures okay cuz here's the basic outline of the story there's a sea dragon with the minions and what is it used
 like oh I'll show you lots of pictures of lots of pictures of it actually hurt you just want to do that now I mean yeah I kind of want one in my head so this is the work of God Richie that I just mentioned she's got together really what is the most comprehensive now collection of depictions of of the Sea Dragon so here's one from the latest Syrian. And it's the storm God carrying a bunch of lightning bolts in his hand so really what it looks like is a long snake was Kris Kross scales but it has horns and he's trying to little feet Sophia oh yeah right two little tiny hands of time here is an Acadian cylinder seal salsa Mesopotamian he's got a deity with a long spear has horns on its head and it is piercing one of the many Heads 77 of them
 of this 7 headed monster with four legs and huge spikes coming out of its back and then there's a deity on the back kind of holding onto its tail so that the other day and spirited here's one for much later this is from Greek like a Greek vase that dates from around 600 BC and here is actually reflecting a Greek mythology went down into Greek culture so Heracles and the old house both bashing the many heads of like a Hydra that's what's called a Greek mythology Hydra Hydra who tours with water and create so the water monster and that one looks like a bunch of snakes coil together as like one yeah here's one that's interesting this is Mesopotamian from a temple and a town called New Madrid around 870 BC and here so you have a
 Rodney Norte but he looks exactly like how like the king of Assyria with dress he's got lightning bolts in his hand and what he's facing off with you tell me what that thing looks like Josh yeah it looks kind of like oh my gosh this is like every animal so its legs and some of the leg they look like ostriches legs yeah sure yeah and then starts to become scaly and you get the same daily body that like turns into this crazy head yep kind of like what maybe like a lion would look like if it didn't have if it was just didn't have any fur domain but has horns and then horns and just crazy things yet looks almost demonic yeah and then has wings and has wings Eagle wings and that it's standing up like it because it's like looks like it's standing up like a bird would but then it but it
 he has a knot bird like it's like almost like a lion hands yeah yeah yeah so this is going to be important when we eventually get to Daniel chapter 7 which is describing monsters that sound like what this thing looks like this is really high fidelity is this like a recreation of it or let's see yeah this is a church dinner Rock so yeah this is a like a shaded version of high-contrast so what's interesting here is so this is again if you were to Google like Nimrod or battling the monster you know Google give me the some of the famous famous image the posture of the storm God is the same as the posture of the first picture I showed you which is from a little cylinder seal took these are little tiny like clay seals that are in circle cylinders and they have a little drawing a test on all the sides and you would roll
 play out and you would use it to make a decorative mark on a piece of clay or something like that there are hundreds and hundreds of these folk have surfaced so part of my dad Ritchie dissertation was to say that most people in the ancient world would have not read that the versions of the story that I'm going to tell you about they would have heard the story and some pictures more they would just know it by seeing it everywhere seeing it on letters while seeing it on temples seeing it like what Billboards is that their major us so this was one of the iconic popular toy of the ancient Eastern world really fast so here's the basic storyline of how it goes there's a basic plot line there is a sea monster now you have some images yeah but what that sea monster does is it lives in the sea and sometimes it's just a body to ask the sea
 and it's threatens the stability and Order of all life on the dry land a hard to imagine then what what sense is it threatening the order of well life on the table to go to coastal region that's not just like gold white sand beaches something like that writes where like the waves are crashing on the Rocks yeah yeah this is like a northern Greece like where the Poseidon meth was in like it just like caves and act like you know the coastal Cliffs of Ireland Scotland or the coast of Oregon coast of Oregon be at a place like that in an hour and a half from right now so anywhere where the sea is crashing up against the dry land and shattering it to Pieces bashing against rocks okay so that that's a fundamental Human Experience and stuff
 Patsy wants to give me wants to get up onto the dry land constantly about every five seconds it sends a big bashing life experience so that image is turned into a narrative about forces of disorder of chaos that are constantly threatening bashing at the shores of the ordered place that is where the humans have the realm so the Sea Dragon is so you can either be the dark see that's threatening or you can think of the sea as kind of brought together with an image of it the monster up see so who's going to know who's going to rescue us the storm God so the god of the waters above cuz it's the dangerous in the waters below the waters above
 so just as terrifying as watching the ocean you know wash up and crash at Cliff is watching a storm cloud come like I did once I lived in the Midwest for a while of like a storm just comes out of nowhere and just has its way beautiful clear day when you see the clouds on the horizon within 30 minutes is just like bunkers I'll be outside and it's terrifying and then it passes on you know so that idea of the storm that is scary in its own right yeah you know a storm is scary but less because of all the water typically it's usually because it's cold and windy to and in that like ripping apart and your shelter gets destroyed yet but isn't water to be celebrated water from the sky mean that was like six right okay so the storm Waters
 have a different role cuz the ocean waters if they cover you up you're done don't tsunami you done but the storm God comes and he'll give gift of rain that brings fertility to the land to the storm gods are often associated in some way with fertility broken so the storm God can come and go out to sea and like if you ever want that don't have no idea it looked like a battle so the way the mythology works is the storm God goes out from the land just ordered from over which it rules cuz it's definitely the most powerful thing about above and so it goes out to the Sea and there's some multi-stage conflict usually involves bashing of head
 then the sea dragons body in different versions of the myth becomes a benefit in some way so the dragons body can be split and again the dragon is an image of the seawater himself so like in the Babylonian version to the sea monsters split in half like Slade we talked about this and 1/2 is to re-establish order in the waters above the other half is to establish order in the waters below and then dry land protected sometimes the monsters body is dragged up onto the dry land and then is giving us food for all the creatures to come and have a feast
 after the victory Of The Sea Dragon the storm God moves up onto a high mountain and has a feast sometimes the feast is the dragon's body other times it's just having a big Feast on the regular storm. Just wear a Royal Palace is built from which the storm God rules over the rescue the newly ordered Cosmos that's the basic story there's a monster fight stronger winds don't Godwin's ascends high mountain Feast for everyone for the Royal Palace from which the storm God rules the world
Okay so
 what does the story and what does it mean if the storm Godwin's like I'm just imagine being an ancient person I'm going to still go out to the Sea and see the Seas don't still chaotic as well that's exactly right so and what the size of the Dragon been flicked exactly right so what is very interesting is in the ancient hittite version of this in which the storm God is named Luna and the monster is named Ali Anka oh and this sea servant by getting drunk with wine and then once it's drunk that he chopped its head off but this story was narrated and re-enacted Stage actors as a part of the annual New Year Festival in other words it was reenacted every year and that'll happens every year in the spring to Mark the transition from Winter into spring again
 so it's about another word that cyclical this needs to happen every year the battle happens every year so there's the myth is a way of giving symbolic language to the cycling of the seasons of death right of the deaths in the fall in the winter with the powers of chaos bring death to the land and nothing grows but then never Christmas but the spring rains come the spring Storms Come and they bring rain and the storm God comes so every year you celebrate a new victory that brings a new season of fertility to the land that is also true for the Mesopotamian version which is the stories captured most vividly in a well-known we have to read some of this before in past series called in Newman a leash which is a big complex it's also a story of creation so there
 the monster's name Tiamat who is saltwater she represents the ocean and then rather than herself being a dragon she has a huge Army of monsters that include dragons but also Harry hero men like monster wires hairy monster men lie and monsters scorpions Fishman baldi's hybrid Mana creatures but and marchak the patron God of Babylon is the storm got but what's interesting is that this was ritually performed also every year not a spring festival called the hockey to Festival so it needs to happen every year because nature is a self-playing out this battle and humans are just helpless little you know man they get like this
 powerful just Dragon ritual and we celebrate like a bunny
 Cricket like pastels is my buddy in the Resurrection Sunday is supposed to be celebrating yeah it's celebrating the crucified messiah's victory over the snake Easter chocolate dragon dragon snake dragon that I'd with a decapitated head yes I bite into it would be much more fitting I'm getting a vision hear you said what would we call the dark chocolate Dragon talks about how he wants his family Easter to be the biggest celebration of the Year Holiday from you but it doesn't sound about
 let's address the question which is this so I just I named a bunch of cultures we could go into each one and again if I if you want to go down the rabbit hole referee Robert Miller's book did I mention earlier is really great I think it's really nerdy on all of these other Back stories so in each of these cultural Stories the word myth is what's used to refer to them in like the scholarly literature so in the word myth the way it's used in religious studies in the west today in academic circles is actually really different the meaning of meth is different than what it means for most of us in like they did a language I mean my my kids like my kid when we say meth we mean you're telling me a lie often and regular vernacular fabricated to deceive could just mean May.
 unbelievable story superstitious you know that kind of primitive maybe for kids so that is not the meaning of the word that people that Scholars are using Anthropologist Professor religion so the technical sense of myth that has developed in just the last couple hundred years is about this a symbolic narrative this exploring or expressing Universal concerns of human existence usually about the origins of the cosmos or the nature of the cosmos where it came from and what it is exploring the relationship between the Transcendence in the Heavenly and above and beyond and then the Earthly in the mundane in the day today and how those two overlapping attract exploring the reality of the Divine and the human and how those to interrelate
 and then also another kind of binary in there is about death and chaos and Terror and darkness and evil but then also Beauty in order and goodness and humans experience both of those realities on a given day and miss the way it's used in the way we're going to explore this is about using narratives that gives symbols for all of these things and so it's not hard to see how this works but it's not trying to figure out that people actually believed there were dragons in the sea not with these stories are about you stories are just a symbolic maybe but that's not the point. The point is is that from the earliest I mean it's really ancient cultures and they're using the symbols to explore the human experience that everybody sense then and until now and every
 the planet no actually has the same experiences and feelings we just have different symbols and language for them back ya want us to appreciate when we say meth we don't mean just some fantastic story or something made up an incredible
 but more specifically or more appropriately we're talking about a story which is trying to help us understand and Russell through to the most important and most kind of existential realities that we encounter life and death chaos and Beauty good any distance good and evil in life yeah yeah and then the ultimate the beyond the Transcendent the Divine and then the Earthly in the human and the mortal and these things are so so big that in order to try to understand them we have to use we don't have to but we like to use fantastic imagery larger-than-life characters and stories and help us appreciate the gravity of the ends to give meaning feeling concreteness to the experiences that
 I mean just to make it concrete for example for my first years after my first son was born in my second my kids are like Toddlers and my job whenever I spent time with them was essentially the one of the main job was to make sure they didn't kill themselves or get themselves killed or hurt and so you know just going for a walk with two toddlers this for me it really stressed because they're constantly what I'm seeing is that you know all the stuff that could hurt them and often there were a lot of close calls and so for years my last moments of being awake before falling asleep every night would be some moment memory that would come into my mind about how close one of my kids was to death of a nation and it was so weird and I started talking about this and I realize this is a really common experience like with other parent
 not everybody but some so another words what an amazing experience to have a child and it's so that such a rich experience and beautiful so fun to take your toddler to the park and look at flowers now that it's amazing but yep that's the same there's a snake out there there's a snake out there and it could take the form of a dump truck could take the form of an angry dog yeah I feel about the weather in Ithaca take the form of a barrel snake and a coral snake of a cliff of a storm wave we out of terrifying experience with a sneaker waves on the Oregon coast once that almost did take somebody's life. My kids but somebody else's kid and so like their forces out there that want to take the life of the precious good things in my world and that feeling everybody knows that feeling in one way or another and the dragon myth dragon-slaying mess was a common ancient near Eastern way
 to talk to an Explorer about that those feelings on both the individual level and then on a corporate communal and Cosmic level
so it's true myth this was c.s. Lewis was trying to communicate with The Chronicles of Narnia true myth miss that is actually speaking to the truth of The Human Experience great and so in that category to say is this true or not in the sense that we is modern people want to ask that question because it's not an appropriate questions of narrative and Truth we're primarily thinking of historical reference are the characters events and dates represented in the narrative do they refer to what I would call it actually happened at Esprit or hunting route at Ya toy and that is not these types of symbolic narratives don't have this their purpose to refer to reality in that way but they're referring to are these Universal realities and experiences through the language of symbols so the reason why this is important is because there is a
 good and right concern among people who have a conviction about scripture that it is both human and divine that through these human words from ancient Israelites inspired by God Spirit God speaks to his people that nothing injuring conviction about the Bible that God's people have had Jewish and Christian many years so there's a concern when does idea of symbolic narrative comes up of weight are you saying that narratives in the Bible aren't true because they may employ the language of Mythology or symbolism so that's not what we're saying we're saying is as this family Israelite family told their family history
 in narrative or in poetry they regularly Drew on the same set of symbols that there are ancient near Eastern Neighbours dead because it was a common symbolic language of their time and specifically you're talkin about how for example in Genesis one when they tell the story of how God their God Yahweh Elohim created and ordered the cosmos they mention that in the in the waters chaotic Waters God put the Sea Dragon batoning batoning a can for them they've heard of the taunt they know about the timing everyone's talking about the puppy and you haven't seen the Billboards the clay pottery and they've heard the stories and they're just they taken many different forms and so when they're like want to explain reality they're like you know that sea monster that you celebrate the Battle of every year
 true God of the universe created that stunning okay yes so hear this gets us to an important reality first of all the meaning of the dragon and then second of all the way the biblical authors both adopted and adapted this cultural story The First the dragon comes to represent what the dark Waters represent which is a force of disorder of what threatens life order goodness Beauty exists in the word evil it doesn't quite capture the flag picture has a better word but it's what is opposed to life in order and goodness here on the dry land which is pretty much what I would even care about that is evil I mean that is that is the bad that is the enemy but to depict it as an animal had just had the conversation the other night cuz we have a rabbit
 and I never get out here for almost a year Well nine months or so one of those wonderful little rabbit entered our life and when my son treats it like a stuffed animal carries it like a stuffed animal that rabbit resists a sharp little Claws and if we don't get them often enough which we don't and so it scratched him accidentally the other night and so he was in like fight or flight mode 9 and so he was trying to understand this adorable precious creature that he loves us like chubby I like big ones or like kind of little tiny so
 taking the door but it's so amazing it's b i l we call a lot beard down big brown just stuffy cuddly and it just wants to sit and snuggle but it hurt him and he was trying to figure out how to relate to the bunny now that it hurt him and so we had this conversation about how do you know the bunny doesn't know right from wrong like the bunny didn't have the intent to hurt you so I would have got me thinking about is so interesting how when we do we use the word evil to describe a bunny or an earthquake or a you know a wave from Alice in there yeah it's easy for us to attribute human purpose and intent which is the result of Consciousness into something
 that is not conscious in the same way so anyway but whatever it is that threatens life goodness Beauty order it's chaos disorder and as we're going to turn to Genesis 1 in the next conversation will see that the biblical authors use all of the same images that their cultural neighbors do but the dragon is a symbol for chaos disorder anti creation opposite of creation so what gods on a mission to do in the Bible however and the biblical authors have a deep conviction that God is on a mission to not just create and sustain a realm of goodness and Order and Beauty but to partner with humans in making sure that it flourishes and spreads forever and ever amen and so as they tell the story that expresses that conviction about the one God they regularly bring up the dragon myth since the images of the Dragon meth
 in their poetry in in in their narratives you could just call these three basic Dragon taming strategies they meaning of glad there's three ways that they deal with the dragon what I'm not saying is the biblical authors just copy it and retold copy and replace two sings Bill Withers talk about the dragon dragon referencing this larger body of dragon salty and so to what end why do they care about the dragon and what sense is it important to them it's the symbol in their world of chaos death and disorder which is opposed to the purpose of God the FAE please the gods the table and so they don't just adopt the dragon symbols into their poetry and stories wholesale they always tweak it they adopted and they adapted and they adapt in three ways
 to make clear who they think the dragon is in all these stories the dragon really like gives the storm got to run for his money like sometimes it's a rounds of the storm God to fight the dragon sometimes he barely B it one time we were in the movie Riddick version called the epic fail in the Bible he actually he defeats the bail fight the dragon dragon and overcomes that and then builds a big Palace and has a feast for all the nations that he rolls over but one of the guests that he invites to a feast is a god named mote which has the Semitic word for death he fights death to this Beast because he wants to show off what he beat the dragon and at his own Feast death swallows up they'll kill them at his own fist
 and so then Bale has like a girl friend her name's I'm not the goddess of war and she's so mad and so she takes out moat she defeats death and then rescues ball from death and then bring him back to life again raise so of ball from like the belly of death another where's my point is just in all these versions The Storm God really mrs. matin in the dragon and you're like I'm not sure which way this could go here at Winterfield the biblical out there's never tell the story that way here so they use Dragon taming strategy number one
 Whatever by all the market can do I can do better so yes defeating the Sea Dragon is hard a real challenge for the storm God no challenge for kids can do it easy so you got something like Psalm 74 which will depict Yahweh as doing
 easily what marduke rabaul did which is bashing the head of the Dragons the song 74 says God is my king from of old who works Deeds of Deliverance in the earth you divided the Sea by your strength you broke the heads of the sea monster in the waters that awning you crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him his food for creature of the Wilderness that's what the storm God would often do and here so you're saying there's no epic battle here just like but what they're taking for granted is that they put Yahweh in the slot of baller Modmarket great every ball my dude does Yahweh doesn't he doesn't matter so that's one strategy is to actually retail the combat story but you always the one doing the fighting another way that the book lost his tame the dragon is to reframe
 the power and significance of the Dragon so if it's like of a world threatening Monster In The dragon-slaying Mists of their neighbors there sometimes biblical authors will downsize the dragon and just make it like a little rubber ducky so floppy eared bunny Psalm 104 verse 24 how many are your works you made them all and wisdom the Earth is full of your creatures there's the great and wide sea animals moving without number living things small and great there are the ships that sail there's Leviathan that you formed to play a friendly creature here
 there's nothing. That was a big deal yeah yeah you sent out there just for walking around this is the strategy at working the 7-Day Christian story Genesis one where he is just one of the creatures out there he's a part of God's good world you don't have to be afraid in the ultimate purpose of God don't fear or rather it's nothing compared to the true power and authority of the earth once you got another words in the first strategy the sea monster is really bad news but yeah we can take care of it just like the storm God in the second strategy the monster gets downsized in comparison to Yahweh and the third strategy well is what we'll fill out more in the conversations the following the third strategies the dragon is a symbol for violent humans and Their Kingdoms that spread death
 the land like a flood of violence and so often the downfall of human tyrants and kings and Empires is described in the language of the downfall of the Sea Dragon so Nebuchadnezzar is unlikely Book of Jeremiah he's straight-up called a sea dragon that swallows up Jerusalem and spits it out but then listen Jeremiah chapter 51 but then you always says I am going to stand up for Jerusalem and I am going to dry up her Waters and make her Fountain Run dry and make Babylon heap of ruins and haunt of jackals
 defeating the Sea Dragon is defeating the sea is defeating the sea is a few days which is defeating Nebuchadnezzar against a human Kingdom who's actually been actual historical human King and Kingdom but using the the dragon-slaying symbolism to describe that Victory so these are the ways that the middle classes use the dragon myth they use it to describe reality so use it to describe their family history but they use the language of the mess to do it and they tweak it as they do so all right so we'll jump into these will be the strategies that play as we have been as well framework framework and then as we go through basic it's just too or the biblical story from Genesis to Revelation looking at places where the dragon imagery is brought up
 well I everybody this is Dan, again podcast team and I'm back with another employee reduction and we got a few number of these now but I think about before you walk to the stairs I think you the newest employee that can't buy my products for about 9 months and I work on our operations team and has get to work with like everyone in the organization to help see what they're doing and like how we can like even make a greater impact with the work that they're doing what is the most interesting data point you can say like off.
 A really really cool to see women sometimes don't feel like they have a place to stay early in the Seminary setting but are like own classroom experience becoming increasingly at home for women who want to learn the Bible one more thing tell me specifically podcast number that would just be really interesting
 oh this is so hard off the top of my head or no man I don't think I can know that number do you know that I'm asking you you're the number for how many people listen to there podcast in the car number for Lucky not like please for capita so like the number of podcast plays over the number of humans who are estimated to live in a country are top five countries for the podcast are you ask New Zealand Australia Canada and Singapore yeah so outside of work I was doing the dishes I am a little bit
