okay it's a John hello hello we are going to do a question response to the number scroll we did nine episodes walking two numbers coz there's three movements in numbers we did three episodes each and covered a lot of ground and you went through about I don't know how many questions and freaked out and picked out about a dozen that you want to try to get through as always it's broken record but way more questions than we can ever deal we are like so slow and explain these questions which is fine I think but I'm just means we don't get to very many but I try to pick the ones that are repeated the most some words that represent themes that have kind of been waiting for all the different questions numbers or or otherwise known as in the wilderness
 yeah John get it right that's it by mid by Amit far did I would like a deep the embodiment let's rock that's right okay first question is from Johnny who lives in the UK based in Ho in the UK you showed how the weapons cheats brightest arranged in patterns and sequences for instance the seven Rebellion 7 keeps coming up my question is do you think that it happened exactly like that or did they write in Spanish things or maybe even leave out sets in rebellions to keep the number at a nice round and symbolic 7 thanks thanks Jeremy I love that I feel like I used to always ask this question of you yes I'm sort of version of this question
 it's fine because John got stick together because while I am getting more comfortable with I think the heart of this question or at least I don't want to get too redundant I think it is on everyone's mind as we talked about the literary design you have these Scrolls we actually occurs to people who have some kind of investment in the historical truthfulness of scripture in other words Christian tradition like emphasizes that to the same degree and four people raised and traditions where historical accuracy of biblical narratives is like a boundary line issue this issue comes to the Fort immediately when you start talking about literary creativity on the part of the biblical author and traditions is Scorpio accuracy not that important well I'm just saying there are traditions where
 they haven't either that aren't at home in Europe or America the didn't undergo the cultural developments in the enlightenment something here primarily of Eastern traditions of Christianity are comfortable with these stories being allegory or that those cultures didn't undergo anything like the Reformation or the enlightenment the questions just don't surface in the same way for many people in those Traditions so hard to wrap my mind around for a fish to think about what it's like to live in another fish bowl but it's true cuz these are questions that didn't occur to Jewish and Christian many Jewish Christian readers for centuries specifically the question of did this happen exactly the way it's written in history in time-space did this occur in exactly as being portrayed that's a particularly modern questioned in the ways that we ask it in and approached it
 that doesn't mean it's a legitimate it's our question no matter when or how we happened to come to that question it's a question that's on many people's minds but I think from my fishbowl the importance of the question is about trustworthiness can I trust this collection of Scrolls and if it's not telling us about something that happened actually happened then did Jesus like live and say what was reported that he said did he rise from the dead as reported or is that also something I can think of as being all name and author has helped me really think this through and helpful ways in recent times Joshua Berman and it's kind of personal book called anemia mean which is Hebrew for I believe biblical criticism
 historical truth and he was raised within very conservative part of Jewish tradition but he has gone full bore into the biblical studies and historical cultural context of the Hebrew Bible and he firmly is like a Believer part of the Jewish tradition that says that's where he says he's a Believer animal I mean means I believe but at the same time he's also convinced that both Jewish and Christian traditions we take our modern categories which are spectrum of fiction to historiography and then we try to fit the biblical writings on to the way we have to that Specter corrected that spectrum and he just says that it's just not how ancient history writers thought about what they were doing and this is very helpful and where he goes is comparing biblical historiography to ancient Egyptian Babylonian and Assyrian historiography and what what you see
 is a concern to represent the traditions of the past as they've been received but also to use literary creativity to help later generations understand the meaning and the significance of what has happened and the glitter of creativity and historical representation and truthfulness are not at odds with each other and their cultures way of imagining history writing it is for us and I think that's essentially where the rabbit is it's at odds if what you're after is what you call before video camera footage after like what would I have seen where I was transported back to that time to 7 Days. That's what it feels like when you read numbers you know 11 through 20 it just feels like boom boom boom boom boom
 and that's the literary effect that's been designed to have that fact and the question is does that represent what I would have you know what happened to me if I've been there so you're saying that the ancient others the others here they weren't interested in trying to create the video camera footage reply but at the same time I don't hear you saying that they were trying to be anti historical or no no it's hard to imagine a people group on the history of a planet that has its identity anchored more history than the Jewish people it's all about historical memory that is recast retold and reshaped for each generation to help us understand the meaning of the history and are you know one's role within it but literally creativity was how they communicated the meaning of that history as they passed along these texts
 7 rebellions is it is an excellent example in it but also we pointed out along the way that numbers has a number of very explicit moments where the store the literary sequence of the stories are out of chronological sequence of when they happened and the story doesn't hide that fact that just alone tells you that this author has some other agenda than just to tell you what you would have seen if you would been traveling the Wilderness so if I still feel really uncomfortable with this that book you recommended is a good place to get a very helpful introduction to Modern concepts of historiography versus ancient concepts of historiography and what happens when we don't honor the biblical authors and in their standing in the need of it has this great case study which is Baxter the historical truthfulness debates about the Exodus and what actually is really fascinating cuz he's able to show
 is the people who try to fit The Exodus events into the video camera footage model or into the complete literary fiction model neither one of them can actually account for the story as it stands in the scroll I can understand how the video camera footage doesn't fit right we talked about like just the number of people going through the Wilderness as depicted is kind of crazy and that's another good example of an ancient literary and his story of graphical Convention of using numbers since its numbers battle members that nothing but I guess I don't appreciate the other side which is why wouldn't just work as a piece of fiction it is really hard to account for how foundational The Exodus event is an Israelite culture and history and how it has surfaced in manifest itself that story is manifest
 it's often so many different forms over such a long period of time in terms of both texts written about it but also cultural practice me Passover still celebrated today so there's that also the narrative accounts have all kinds of historical details in them Egyptian like Words woven into the account Illusions to Egyptian cultural practices that are the subtext of many details in the story that would just be to create an account where all of that is fabricated centuries later by scribes who were removed from the time and place of the actual events the IBU have to come up with this fantastic Theory yeah sometimes the best fantastic the theories as the video camera footage has to come up with to account for how to million people could a drink from 12 fountains in
 opens up a messy middle that makes some people uncomfortable but also I think it's important to realize this isn't about skepticism like the reason why we're talking about the 7 Rebellion just because of actually reading the biblical texts more closely than ever before right and you see it's literary Artistry and now we're trying to account for what's actually there in scripture as opposed to validate my presuppositions yeah one end of the spectrum another yeah this feels like a summit you have to climb in order to then be able to appreciate like the true some it is like now why are there seven rebellions and what are the seven rebellions telling us about the character of God and about the story of Israel and the story of all humanity and so I think I've I still uncomfortable I'm still the fish in the bowl going man as soon as you start pulling this thread what did
 what goes out the window and makes me really uncomfortable but I find so much better fit and saying well it's Summit this other mountain and let's see what's there and there's so much that you learned and is beautiful and my God's word comes to life in a new way there. I just kind of become comfortable going outside but as soon as Johnny I said yeah yeah I've been wrestling with it many years and anytime books come out relevant to the topic you don't they're on the top of my list by Joshua governments took to think it through and another way what's fascinating about Joshua Berman's treatment at the topic is he is sitting with in the Jewish tradition in Britain now I guess place to where I am trying to find myself in the Christian tradition which is this not all or nothing either none of this happened as represented or
 happened only blow-by-blow video camera footage as represented there and it's not being skeptical to try and find that messy metal cuz you're actually being more honest I think to reckon with what's actually there was in the scriptural texts themselves and you can do this within the Hebrew Bible talk about this you can read the accounts of the origin of the monarchy of this rail all the way down to the Exile on Samuel and kings and then you can go to the chronicle scroll and read them in parallel columns like these books exist to do for you and you can watch the chronicler adapt details leave things out add details and used litter and creativity to reshape the accounts and it doesn't mean that nothing happened
 I bet it does mean that that author is passing on what happened to communicate a unique aspect of those events meaning that's different than what the author Samuel King's was trying to do yeah and so it's it's inherent within the biblical story itself to adapt itself to show later generations new meaning within the events but I don't know what else to do I guess we could just try and have a different Bible
 why are you could just you could just pretend like that's not in the Bible but I don't know I just thought I'd that's not being honest but I know it's hard it's very hard not to fall into the extremes when it comes to these topics sure and so one thing we've you brought up a number of times when we get into this territory is that the the histories in our lives and the stories that are most important to us we don't actually talk about them and treat them in the way that were expecting like the Bible to be feeling it more like a history book we're very comfortable in our own personal histories saying crafting
 and understanding our story you talking about like retelling the story of how you and Kristen met the right or the Story of My Life vocational Journey you know from like I'm thinking about tax in between that and a few days in a setting and and it's like yes you want to be truthful and accurate but also you want to make sure that the important ideas emerge and also the I mean kind of the truthfulness of the experience and what you've learned and how its cashed out in the meaning that you can now see in the event that is precisely because it's in retrospect right and so you can craft an account for this particular audience that might be slightly different then how you would cry after a year from now for like a different audience yeah but it doesn't mean it didn't happen cuz you were there but yeah I know what point are you being untruthful
 the Beck expectation The Listener or the reader brings yeah yeah
 thank you Johnny it's that I feel like it's the topic that we need to talk about at least four times a year, Johnny thank you all right let's go to Carl and Wisconsin from Cross Plains Wisconsin here in the wilderness a census is taken twice once while at Mount Sinai and once is there about to enter the land at Mount Sinai they count well over six hundred and three thousand wow 40 years later as they're about to enter the land they only count 601000 what are we supposed to take from this it doesn't seem like they've been fruitful and multiplying like God's promise would indicate thanks friends
 that's actually good kind of case study in the conversation we were just having brought up a census saying if this was just the men being counted men of like fighting ability okay so I can 2250 I think 16 million people here right so that aside of that so many people go many questions about the numbers and numbers and we did address it but maybe people didn't have to listen to one of the nine episode did to the work of a scholar Daniel Fouts this done recent work on the way numbers function in ancient near Eastern census lists and in battle accounts and is very similar to the question that we were just having so we can blink his his work
 show notes but is there a similar Dynamic about the scale of the numbers but that's not quite your question Carl it's about the difference of the numbers in the two census lists in numbers and you have to add him up to be able to see this I think it's a good example where the first of all their big round numbers anyway like the numbers that are given in the sense of us they usually in multiples of 50 or 100 if the idea was this is a story of Israel being fruitful and multiplying just up and to the right then that would stick out as being like what the population went down but we're call Carl the Hulk this is there's one senses before they leave Sinai and then there's one senses after forty years in the wilderness and the main theme of the forty years in the wilderness is about how is real
 rebellion and consistent refusal to trust in God's promises landed them in Exile from the the Heathen land of Canaan so my hunch the narrator's aunt say this but my hunch is that the diminished population number is a reflection of that toll that is real Super Value has been taking on it in the form of the loss of life which is a sign of being outside to be just the loss of life and so I think that's probably what's going on so I guess that's the God's promise the fruitful and multiplying is the fact that it didn't go down to like ten thousand but that it you knows is not that far below the original a little bit but none the less the number goes down as well as the feeling of the reader just keeps descending into pessimism about whether those people will ever accept the gift
 God blessing that yet so we've seen this theme when Israel's in Egypt they're being fruitful and multiplying we see the theme when they're in the land you know like I'm thinking of Solomon talking and to God just being like this people is large and X does develop and you see that it's at work not doing it but there is a moment here going wow but in the wilderness it's stalled out yeah yeah yeah it's this tension between Israel's
 refuse all the trust God that keeps diminishing their life but yet God doesn't bail on the people even though he feels like he wants to do a couple times we can share that with Moses and Moses intercedes on our people so what I appreciate Carlos just you drew attention to a little narrative detail b in a part of the number scroll census lists that most of us are like begging you to skip release Kim and so call you didn't skim I noticed those numbers and I think they are meeting for at least that's my hunch is that what we're supposed to see in the decreasing population of Mount there
 okay next we have to have two questions that are paired they're both about the use of themes and imagery from numbers in the New Testament so the first is a question from Dina in Washington state and then from Chris in Connecticut Connecticut silence hard see you when you are in English but anyway the first and then Chris and John my name is Dina and I'm from Washington State trout The Exodus and the Wilderness series y'all talked about the story when Moses hits a rock for water to come out just disconnect to Jesus when he calls himself The Rock and living water and does God telling him to strike at the first time you speak to it s time instead have any significance thank you for all you do God bless you
 hi Tim and John this is Chris from Gales Ferry Connecticut and 1st Corinthians 10:4 Paul says that the Israelites drank from the spiritual rock that followed them in the Rock was Christ how might this passage comment on The Narrative of Moses striking the rock numbers 20 all calls it a spiritual Rock but the Israelites drink water from a tangible rock that Moses could hit is Paul suggesting that Moses struck the pre incarnate Jesus with his staff when he struck the rock thanks for all you guys do yeah it's great questions
 so yeah how does Jesus relate to The Rock The Rock in numbers underneath both of them is a few observations to Dina your question in the Gospel of John in particular where Jesus describes himself as a source of Living Water the Springs eternal life to others and then the story of where Jesus is pierced by the soldier when he's being executed in that is only in the Gospel of John and we're told that blood and water flow down from him those are meaningfully connect the points in John and actually both of them connect back to earlier threads and John one where Jesus is at the well with the Samaritan woman and he talks about how he is the source of water that gives life eternal and then that connects back to the thread where Jesus goes to the temple and like throws down
 turning over the tables and says destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days and then John Whispers In Your Ear. Paul is talking about this is body so how does it Temple body relate to The Living Water yeah because within the Hebrew Bible there is a consistent depiction specially in the Psalms but also in the profits that depicts the temple as a cosmic Mountain Garden like eat like a Eaton you can play out of which flows a Heavenly River so you can go hear Psalm 46 47 48 Ezekiel chapter 47 viz vision of the river in the in the new Temple is all over in the mountains the Templar blowing wine and Jesus turns water into wine
 pictures of Eden as a hill high hill where it's one river that comes out of the center of the garden splits into four and then Waters all of the different regions so yeah there's this Mega theme of Living Water to the same video on this so you got the four strings that come from a head water in the Eden Mount you got is ezekiel's vision of the Temple Mount and the water the water that like water is the Earth and turns the Dead Sea like a garden pond and like you said a bunch of Psalms that talk about flowing water and this is a picture of like because the water from the Garden of Eden is what gave life to exactly right now and so it is water but also its if there's something it's kind of God's energizing and what what is it more than just water
 it's a it's a symbol it's a narrative image that keeps reappearing reappearing depicting a river coming out of the cosmic Sky Mountain flowing down to earth to become the source of its life girl plants and to make humans and it's in the fact that it comes out as Cosmic place is saying it is actually it's using a physical image to make a metaphysical Claim about God's relationship to Creation mainly that all of the wife taking one example the life that we see that appears when there's water all of that life is ultimately sourced in something that transcends creation above and beyond it who is the source of all life and existence and being for every moment of every molecule of Life as We Know It the Eden River
 narrative way of making a metaphysical Claim about God is the source of all life and being it is what Jesus does at the well with the Samaritan woman exactly what he sang to her the water you can drink this water and you know you'll be thirsty again but drink of the water that I get metaphysical water dekhle yeah so or more spiritual what a freaking nipple so all these narratives and it kind of explains why this image of the Water of Life can be connected to so many different geographical places in the Bible so Eden which is really having heaven on Earth but then also the temple which and there never was actually a river coming out of Temple in the temple now if you like I'm going to wait forever I mean they make conduits to funnel water on to the temple area because they have to deal with all that
 sacrificial blood but also there's some think of all the moments like with Hagar the two moments that had Garden Hagar and Ishmael in Genesis are about to die in the wilderness and God revealed a spring or well you have to them and so the stories of Israel in the wilderness and the bus striking of a rock that issues in life giving water is making exactly the same claim at the Eden moment which is to say it's a moment where God sustains the life of his creatures in a very direct and Powerful way that can't be explained by any of their circumstances cuz all around them as Daft as surprised life so surprised even in the desert now with the rock so The Rock will actually begins life with the image of the Eaton Mountain coming with the dry land and merging up out of the waters and on day 3 of Genesis 1 and then this
 sound from which the river pops out the top Genesis 2 verse 4 and 5 okay so we talked a little bit about this and are metaphors video a long time ago is that the idea of land or rock or in Fortress being up above the chaotic Waters being safe also then becomes a symbol of being up above your enemies are trying to get you in this place of Refuge Refuge from the realm of death that lie below and remember the two opposite images of chaos and death in the Bible are you the chaos Waters as in Genesis 1 or a desolate Wilderness which is where the Eden Story begins Genesis 2 verse 4 and 5 so when you're in the wilderness wandering in Exodus or numbers the fact that there would be a rock sound like a small amounts in a way
 imagination of the meaning of the rock what you're looking at is is a little Refuge looking at a little micro Mountain little micro Mountain yeah from which flows the cosmic River it's a little wow so in that way it's this little image of the cosmic Mountain eating its eaten and showed up in miniature in a middle of a surrounded by goodness surrounded by Wilderness in Exodus 17 which is the first Moses strikes The Rock to bring out the water what God said to Moses it's very hot. I was just working on this yesterday God says go to this rock and look I will stand on the Rock in front of you and you will strike the so you always it's as if we're talking about the fire Cloud gear Pillar of Fire and Cloud that's how you always showing up in the wilderness that's how we standing there
 goes to dwell on top of the Eden Roc and then you'll see this picture of Heaven's is throne room Earth Is His footstool he's going to stand up and just like be there with you yeah and Moses strikes the rock with the staff and in Exodus you know that's the staff that he used to strike the waters and split the sea and to strike the Nile River and to turn the blood and make it undrinkable little detail in the first plague when he strikes the river it becomes undrinkable and here he strikes The Rock okay so there's a whole theme of John Moses striking yeah and then either brings order disorder yeah it says it's God's created greater Powers Genesis 1 power in the staff and God dwelling over the rock is for sure another narrative image that's a parallel world in God's glory taking up residence in the temple so much so that even in at the end of Deuteronomy Moses just straight-up calls God the rock you are the rock rock it becomes like
 name for God in the Torah and The Prado and salt actually the only thing you do is very suggestive this imagery which connects them to your question craft about that moment 1st Corinthians 10:4 Paul actually three have calls the rock Messiah and talks about as it as a spiritual rock that followed them in the wilderness of drawing attention to the fact that an exit 17 Moses struck the Rock at a place called Mary Law and then on the other side of Mount Sinai there's a story in a 20 where they're at a different place it's called kaddish holding us a holy Place rock at the holy place and when Moses strikes the rocking but he doesn't speak to it what the narrator says these are the Waters of meribah
 these stories are linked linked in a symmetry around on the other side of Mount Sinai so the narrator wants you to see that you're at a different location to Shamrock but just the same Waters flowing out of the rockcast a Waters and so there was developed in Jewish tradition and you can go at like in the early Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible called the targums they talk about the how the Rocks Moses struck the first time was rolling and in the place of saying the rock is Yahweh which is what you're supposed to put the Messiah in the always slot when he calls him The Rock The Rock in the source of life so that I just called the units of when Jesus gets speared and John is the rock getting yeah for sure John wants us to see that symbolism there
 that's interesting that Moses he struck the Nile turning the water to blood strikes The Rock living water comes out Jesus is struck blood and water and separated comes out really fast so thanks for very perceptive questions and what school is that John both John and Paul they're not just making this up they are tuned to the details of the stories and also they are tapping into very common themes within the Hebrew Bible and the way Jewish leaders of their time. We're paying attention to those details and uniting them wonderful thank you spell like mean j o n o ya from the USA we're like brothers hey John and Tim on episode 319 you discussed number is 27 1 through 11 where God creates a new law so that daughter is canon
 Heartland when a father has no Sons to give it to it seems like God's lock and change and adapt to new situations how does this make sense with what God tells Israel in Deuteronomy 4 to where they are strictly commanded not to add or change to the law God had given them especially since Deuteronomy 13 1 through 51 is real to Stone someone who does signs and wonders to get them to reveal doesn't numbers 27 open up a dangerous tour where Godzilla can be manipulated looking forward to hearing what you say thanks
 it was interesting as we have to John's Ajani in a question that you asked before and now I John who is asking a question that I know is like we talked about 2 and I think it's something you've expressed before also yeah but I think here he's actually a very explicitly and I'm really helpful way I love her very direct explicit questions if in one sense we get a story where you kind of learning that the law is adaptable to a new situation not only that but like the girl Deuteronomy is Moses adapting the law or a new generation
 what do we do with a verse that says do not. Blah well maybe that's what it means Shema to the statutes in the judgments I'm teaching you to perform so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the Lord the god of your father is giving you you shall not add to the word and I'm commanding you nor take away from it so that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God chapter man you don't take away to the word to this basically his speech here which is going to be turned into a school correct the Revelation that is to the Visionary quotes this is this to his which then becomes a bit of a proof text in my tradition to say like hey can is closed this is what we got Bible
 that's what God means yeah right that's kind of assumed right there yeah yeah in Porton thing is that this line and Deuteronomy 4 is actually picking up a a Trope in ancient near Eastern Covenant treaties so this was Moshe Greenberg's commentary on Deuteronomy in The Bible series I think when I first came across this and he was both a scholar of ancient near East literature and Hebrew Bible copious examples and see what he's talking about is the function of these treaty introduction is essentially to say you can't just change the terms of this relationship at will but what's ironic is within the biblical tradition
 this is the introduction to Allah collection where Moses is not changing the terms but he is adapting how Israel can be faithful to the Covenant because of the change setting that's ahead so it's either a contradiction that its face value or what this means is actually fully in sync with what Moses is doing in Deuteronomy which is adapting numerous laws from earlier for it to change settings that make sense or perhaps were wrong and he's not actually adapting the laws as a pretty clear that he's adapting was oh well I guess you just compare them just compare them so whether it's like the the calendar A Feast for example in Deuteronomy 14 of and you compare it to Exodus 23 or Leviticus 23 and what you'll find is how the like the annual feast
 go to be celebrated gets dialed in and Deuteronomy with all kinds of additional details were adapted details because now you're going to be in houses on leveled land whereas the earlier ones were full-on like adapted for setting for celebrating intense as a migrant community in the wilderness so genuine adaptation okay so if this is a Formula by using Covenant treaties you're saying then the purpose of the formula isn't to say hey this will never get adopted to a new context the purpose is then what to say this is a covenant these laws are the terms of a covenant relationship between Yahweh and His People Israel and you don't get to determine
 the terms of that relationship this is yahweh's entering into the relationship with you and what's happening with adaptations of the law is not Reinventing the Covenant relationship in the opposite we need to honor this Covenant relationship and actually now that we're in this new situation the laws as stated might lead us to do something that won't Faithfully honor intentions of God for this Covenant and so that's where these adaptation moments come in that's certainly how God responds in the daughters of zelophehad story where God says yeah those daughters are right there right there right and John you bring up Deuteronomy 13 which is about warning is real you noted react severely to people leading them away toward Covenant faithfulness but that's exactly the point is in Deuteronomy 13 what these profits will try and do
 have you give your allegiance to another. That's not what these dad that patients are about yeah they're about increasing your faithfulness to Yahweh but doing it by means of wisdom discernment adaptation and then it as we talked about free followers and Messiah Ford with Holy Spirit guidance but I want to honor John that it is it is a appears to us at attention like the laws you know once and for all for all time but then the same laws are getting adopted the laws are presented in such a way of saying like hey this is it follow it completely and things will go well and you don't follow these things and his big consequences and
 until you get the sense like don't mess with these laws and in one sense that's true don't mess with them in a way that will lead you out of Covenant faithfulness and start worshipping other gods put your loyalty somewhere else like that that's a huge problem but then you get these stories where is reelz in a new setting the other story was in Kiss maybe with the with the Passover and if you're like onion lean and so they have to add to block any kind of come up with a loophole in the law and until you get these stories and then becomes attention of you okay answer you so you do adapt how do you do that in a way that's still honors our covenant relationship with you
 door manipulating God's law and then I think I think it really depends on what side of the debate I guess you're on
 can certainly you know we brought it forward to the Jerusalem Council in the New Testament and certainly by we you mean you and I did in our conversation about the story of the daughters of zelophehad we went over and talked about yeah cuz you had the Messianic Christians who were Pharisees who were I mean they could appeal to scripture about circumcision and some of the early Apostles an ax an ax and so to those Pharisee Messianic followers of Jesus this was a dangerous door being opened but what James and the apostles conclude is this actually is not an innovation this is actually honoring even more consistently what has been God's heart from the beginning which is that the the blessings of Abraham
 go out to all of the Nations and really it's about the identity of God as Paul will say in Romans is God the god of Israel only is he not the God of all Nations and if he's the God of all Nations then so for Paul this isn't just about rules about how to obey God it's about the identity of God is what's at stake and those put those debates this interesting I just tried recently to do a lot more reading in the history of the early Creed's in the Christian tradition I'd struck me while I didn't notice this email me the really what all those early Creeds are about in the debates in the trinitarian debates there about the identity of God like what God is it that we believe we're connecting to
 and that's what the apostles believed was at stake also and I think that's what the Covenant formulas are about this is about your allegiance to the god revealing himself Through The Exodus
 and through through the Messiah so it certainly isn't clean and tidy and I definitely want to honor that John and you're in you in person and John the question but its Dynamic and I guess that's what it means to us. Are you trying to massage or change or do some sort of Jiu Jitsu with the law and order for license to live apart from Yahweh and to kind of whatever take the fruit has iron take or are you doing it to try to live more Faithfully to the Covenant in the setting that you find yourself in its rent to like that's the main thing and what that will look like doesn't always look the same
 to each person and I think that's what makes us such a fraud question is like one group can say that that's why they're doing XYZ that looks like an innovation in the tradition you and another group can say we're just going to keep doing it the way we've always done it and that can actually prevent the story from moving forward in the new territory and get knots what was at stake in the Jerusalem Council and I'm so it's not easy but Paul says I'll become all things to all people he tries to adapt in a way to honor and love the people in the settings in this is so built into the Jewish and Christian story this is what the end of the musical Fiddler on the Roof musical Fiddler up on a angled roof line
 as he sings the song about tradition has been so long. I'm thinking about the film version of the musical but it's like how far can you bend before you break right like at the whole point and so it's a tension built in to the Jewish and Christian story told in the scriptures is it that Dynamic musical captures a yeah or as Paul doesn't try to get at that when he's like I don't know you'll know the first better than me but he's like look Freedom we've got freedom but Freedom isn't so that you can be captured by since it's right yeah it's just to serve and love your neighbor as yourself Yeah Yeah Yeahs this is when he's riding to the Roman churches who were divided up along the boundary lines of cultural practice about diet
 carry laws and Festival calendars so
 thank you John alright let's move on to Katy and Canada my name is Katie from Edmonton Canada we see in Hebrew scriptures that God chose a people a family and then gave them a promise land and when they finished journeying through the Wilderness and came to the land of Canaan that God had promised to them they found that the land is already populated with people and yet this was the land that God had for them so my question is how the same concept of God giving us the land has been used in really awful ways I'm over history and specifically for our country and Canada and taking the landing culture from the indigenous people here I wondered if you had any thoughts of how the history that we find in the Hebrew scriptures how that connects to some of the awful things that have happened
 appreciate it and we talked about this a little bit actually I think we are going to talk about it in the Deuteronomy look at conversate. It's okay I just want the flag at Katy first of all thank you like this is such an important question especially for people living in cultures that are the fruit of colonies that took up residence in inhabited lands do you know our neighbors to the north UK vs in Canada but this is you know this is a reality that is as old people taking land from each other but it's very much part of the global stage right now people taking away from each other and saying it's God gave us there we deserve this land because we got God on our side you and you guys are less
 and even human in some ways yep that's right so I think just to be very Frank Katie when you asked how do we reconcile portrait of taking the land and God's name in the Hebrew Bible and then the way that those narratives have been used to legitimate future colonizing after it's all right I wouldn't recommend we try to reconcile it if they use to which those notices have been put that has been incredibly destructive and damaging and it just as it is a fact like it's a part of the legacy of of those narratives a question I think is is that inherently is that what those narratives were trying to communicate to later readers that you can do this too or is it just the fact that the president is set even if you argue that this was a command for one time and one place for that generation of Israel to take that populated land and then the seals when broke
 we have the seals has been broken in so you can say well God didn't ever tell them to do it again and when they went back after I saw Island Ezra Nehemiah they didn't try to do that or make some people didn't try to do that and how ezra-nehemiah relates that does a really complicated unsuccessful effort so you can qualify it all you want but as you say like once the can is opened it creates the president do I do recommend you try and reconcile it and it remains for me the violence of God and the act of taking his people using them as instruments of divine Justice on the Canaanites when the Israelites are no morally Superior to them
 it for me this is one of the parts of the Hebrew Bible that I be not friendly with them and it's never gotten better for me and so we'll talk about things that I've learned about how to design patterns in hyperlinks help you come and get the message what's going on more in Deuteronomy will do that but I just want a real it's a real pension as far as that goes for followers of Jesus I think it is really important to say that how Jesus and vision the arrival of the Kingdom on earth and the enemy's the Jesus named and what he thought he was taking over was not a piece of geographical territory and not human enemies in fact part of his whole message was another human is never your enemy they are the object of God's love and are to become the object of your own love is well yeah you give allegiance to Jesus
 and Jesus identified as he is Jesus looked at the people coming to arrest him what he says is this our belongs to you and to the powers of darkness which is you know and what process which is that our enemy is never flesh-and-blood new but spiritual Powers so here's my deep hunch is that those historical narratives of about Israel Conquest conquest of the land I've actually through design patterns are trying to communicate the same message that Jesus and Paul the communicating and that's why the Canaanite enemies are almost always linked to the Giants and Nephilim from the rebellion of the sons of God in Genesis 6 in other words even the narratives about them taking the promised land are trying to show that the Ultimate Enemy represented here is not and
 human but are the spiritual forces that are kind of the subjects about the whole keep Revival but even if you can get there and understand that is the message that you said that seals been broken and these narratives have been used and ran against that grain of their design to legitimate all kinds of really terrible things and all you can do in the face of that history has just lament and be honest and learn and learn
 I've learned a lot about this topic I'll just need three authors that have helped me a lot when is Gary barnidge Jesus and the land the New Testament challenge to Holy Land theology a ruffle some feathers really good another one is a co-author the book by Mark Charles and soon Chandra called unsettling truth the ongoing Legacy of the doctrine of Discovery if you're not familiar with how the biblical stories have been used to legitimate conquest and colonization then I really recommend that book cuz you will learn more than you ever wanted to know and hopefully be really Disturbed and then I Willie Jennings really really significant book the Christian imagination theology in the origins of race I'm really especially gets into some case studies in specially in them Spanish and Portuguese Conquest
 what we call South America and the way that the Bible was used to legitimate that some thank you Katie will have to wrestle through this more as we going to do drawn to me but it's important to just start recognizing a question even though and numbers cuz that's a part of the numbers School 2
 we got a little bit of time we could do one maybe two more now we've got a question from femi in California that's a really great question this fits into the category of people and listeners in the audience room like super smart. And this is coming over today from Irvine California and I was wondering whether we're supposed to be seeing a pattern of 10 vs 2 as in the 10 spies that didn't want to go into the promised land Bruce the two that trusted God the two and a half tribes that were on the east side of the Jordan River vs the 10 and a half that were inside the promised land earlier in Genesis also the 10 older Sons of Jacob who are pitted against the two younger sons of Jacob and then later on the split between a ten Northern tribes of Israel verse the to Southern tribes and so is there a pattern that the tablecloth is a highlighting and is there a meaning behind
 thank you so much
 I think you showed us the pattern I don't know why I asked for some reason the 10 and 2 I had never been the prominent thing in the linking of these stories but now it is it's still very obvious. Yeah yeah yeah you have brought up the the northern and southern tribes and how that relates to Jacobson's connecting to the 12th and that's right so yeah if we do everything and all the way back when you have the 12 sons and then you have our begins he said yeah yeah with the 12 sons of Jacob and then you have two of the sons are from Jacob's favorite wife and that's Joseph and Benjamin and so they're the ones who get put in the most vulnerable position because of the schemes of the 10 old
 they're also the two youngest brothers so that story plays out but then with the split between the northern and southern Kingdom for example later on is definitely between Joseph representing the young girls if yeah and then do that but what's really interesting there is a 10 to 10 but then it's like flips and basically becomes Joseph and the rest of the tribes in the North and then in the South are is Judah & The Lion in the middle like a little doll in the middle of Judith territory is Benjamin Benjamin switched with his brother Joseph then he's like a line with Judah and then you get the tribal got 10 + 2 to the East and the west side of the Jordan that's 10 and to get you're talking about the story was that a numbers the story where you like they're ready to go into tribes
 after I feel like it's kind of nice over here and cat and the half tribe of Manasseh and then you get the others on the west side and then you get the spies and spies and the two spies who trust God are from the tribes of Joseph in the 10 and the two it's never the same tribe ya Ali the mix-up okay but usually Joseph and Judah are highlighted in the mix and I think the metal theme is this is a part of the elevation of a first born with elevation God continues to elevate one from among the many never the one that you would think and it turns upside down all human value systems next spectations and then not one when that one is chosen it often forces a division among the brothers or it forces the rest of those around to either go to college
 is done and celebrate it or you can resist it and then it will divide divide the family the story isn't as simple as the one God chooses ends up being the really awesome one that God does the right thing yeah and it's in the 12 Spies it feels that way very clearly has to act like we're going to trust God and they get to go into the land so if that's gravity for the Steam for you then it's like okay the themes about the two that are like on the right track but then everywhere else that shows up it's a lot Messier tribes that stay east of the Jordan their decisions really ambiguous yeah and then they are the first to get taken out when Assyria comes knocking a couple centuries later so it seems like the metal pattern underneath it is about God's
 choice of a Remnant or choice of a wine I'm out of the many that forces that Remnant to make a choice about whether they'll be staying in allegiance to the one that chose them and it also poses a choice for everybody around them so each of these versions of tend to is exploring that tension from just different angles and some interesting is there anywhere else that this theme is standing up to you that then we didn't bring it about 2:10 in the to notice this is all about the sons of Jacob yeah it's really is where this is coming out so I think those are all the iterations I can think of was interesting and judges in the judges scroll
 is the different judges come from different sets of tribes and then you get different tribes like coming around the one judge and I can't think of a 10in to example may be in the battle with Deborah and Barak I have to go back and look at the details so I think they may use accounting for all the tens and twos there's a lot of stuff in the New Testament in the Revelation or maybe in particular where the tribes are brought up very specifically is it ever done in this town and to kind of way that's interesting I eat another one list of the tribes in the New Testament is in the Revelation and their tribe or to have been left out remember the 13 brothers so what's the two sons of Joseph adopted in
 and then any of this to 12 at the figure out in the Revelation left it's a long-standing puzzle like why one of the tribes is not accounted for by forgive it's Danner alright that's okay one more than a mess with Caleb from Kentucky so much for all the work you put in the scripture in the podcast you mentioned several authors who helped you recognize the could you help me to better understand and see the reputation of eugenic seems within the Torah thanks for the short list of resources that can help
 when is the book by Seth Postell called Adam as Israel Genesis one through three as the introduction to the Torah and the Tanakh I mean that's a jam Summer Jam anyway Seth done a great job putting that together that's standing a very helpful kind of high-flying overview of the whole Torah by a scholar are you leather called waiting for the land the storyline of the pentateuch and I forget how I learned about his work he also has a book he has another book you can find them on Amazon that's also a Biblical Theology of Joshua two kings which is kind of a continuation but what he's really try seeing as how the Eden story sets the basic premise for every cycle of the of the story of the Torah and Prophets after that another group of Scholars I've learned a lot from is T Desmond Alexander it's an introduction to the pentateuch called from Paradise to Promised Land
 and he's also showing how every iteration of the story from Generations one of the next is playing out the themes of the Eden story may seem like a counsel of Despair or a council of like here's your message and I still excited but I really would be to just the so immersed yourself in Genesis 1 through 11:00 and then particular Genesis actually 1135 which you have a whole class from Adam to Noah which is just Genesis 1 through 5 and slowly go through all those texts and that cloud is available right is that class is almost all of the vocabulary to the degree that you can just hear the melody can you do that in your English translation but what it means is all learning not just to see
 birthday repeated words but then anytime and Eden theme gets replay it in a later story that might add so instead of the tree being good to look at when you get in a story where Potiphar's wife sees that Joseph is beautiful to look at so she tries to take him somewhere beautiful which is not used in the Eden story but it's a little creative twist in it and so now in your mind you're supposed to have not just good to look at the beautiful to look at and that can signal the Eden theme and so that's how it keeps building its vocabulary Cycles is it go on but really to just hang out in Genesis 1 through 5 or 1 through 11 memorize it and you will be greatly helped and noticing the vocabulary and imagery as it appears in later later stores
 okay that was the the numbers Cuban are you guys thank you for sending in your questions to really always fun both to read through them see what y'all are thinking and then to get to respond to some of them I think you guys are really fun part of doing this yes we appreciate all the questions we are sorry we can't get to all of them but we really really about you all of your interaction with this we've got the Deuteronomy scroll will do one more q and R and we'll have finished the Torah at least in this journey that we've done that's going to take us through most real time in the podcast through the end of near the end of 2022 will have a little bit of a b at the end of the year coming up a little bit extra and which I'm excited for and we'll talk about it more later but that's our time for numbers
