the narrator of numbers uses language carefully from where choice and narrative details what we find our intentional comparisons between Israel's camp in the middle of the Wilderness and the Garden of Eden in the middle of a wild and wasteful and we're being let on to what Yahweh is doing making Israel the next place we're God and Humanity in do all together we see that as he sets up Israel's camp and put the Levites in the place of priests and we see this theme play out again as God prepares Israel go through the Wilderness to the promised land so the first cycle and went through the 6 was about establishing the camp as a new Eden this cycle is going to establish the new Eden to get ready to go as he's real gets ready to leave we find some more laws laws about how the Tabernacle will be set up how the priests will act and some more rules around celebrating Passover and then we get an interest
 little story for some people realize that the rules for Passover are not complete until they come to Moses and they ask for some clarification what if I'm ritually in pure during the Feast of Passover can't skip it but I also can't join it what do I do Moses agrees this is a conundrum after we goes to Yahweh and gets an update to the law why are we getting a story here about Moses updating the law trying to shape God's people in the people who assume that there's always more to learn that I can always gain more wisdom and insight navigate life's complexities and that I have to keep returning to the Torah to discover greater inside so that I can go live my life trust that I'm living by God's will do list of laws will be complete enough navigate all of life's complexities yet Israel is now moving into the Wilderness they are setting out to
 find the promised land where they can live and be a kingdom of priests to bless all of the nation's this people have been redeemed they've become the host of the presence of their liberating God and now they have begun to reflect God's Own orderliness and Beauty And Justice and abundance in life is to go into the desert from John Collins this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I follow Israel Into the Wilderness and imagine them like a garden in the desert the story just let us pause for a minute and picture of what things could be like in our own life communities thanks for joining us here we go
 Camp lap pillow another conversation about the Torah and parts of the Hebrew Bible I would never read and we typically don't open up yeah yep it's Dad's been awesome we have been in this little subset of the series on the Torah we are in the fourth scroll called numbers in the Greek and English tradition called buy milk bar in Hebrew tradition which means in the wilderness yes because that's where we are at in the story is real is in the wilderness they've been selected by God brought out of slavery and oppression liberated and then given the special stats as God's willing Partners yeah the whole nation when God brought them through the Wilderness to the foot of Mount Sinai to make a covenant with them and said hey y'all
 but here does this Covenant you will become a kingdom of priests so it's a whole nation that all together is a priest that mediates got the character to the nation's but that also lives in proximity to the very presence of God and so that also means that you'll be a holy nation that is a nation that set apart for you always purpose in the world and therefore unlike other nations in important ways so they've been camped at the foot of Mount Sinai and here at the beginning of the bonded bar scroll God is preparing the people to set out so that they can become a mobile Garden of Eden with his presence of the centre-circle to buy new Adam and Eve's new Royal priests the Levites and Priests that are surrounding them in their camps and then surrounded by a fruitful and multiplying Humanity the 12 tribes around them in a circle
 we've been talking about this early chapters numbers which is about exploring through Hebrew Bible meditation literature style a how this camp in the wilderness is like a new iteration of the Garden of Eden a new iteration of humanity and a new calling for Humanity to partner with God to go bring blessing to the world and a reflection on the fact that every time this has happened there has been violence yeah and rivalry yeah and goes wrong and take those wrong and that God has to then purify the land watch the land clean deal with human evil and in doing that still says I'm going to keep working with humans selects humans out and then there's a new creation of sorts yeah that's right we went through that cycle looking at these four will seem obscure laws about
 Purity and not the peace offering but the the guilt offering and what do you do if you're suspicious of your wife having commit adultery and then what if you want to take a Nazarite vow has come from yeah you showed how all of them who are not going to get into it all of them cycle through that same Melody as God selecting Humanity creating a place of abundance in life and where we live at peace with each other and then how we will have to be tested going through the waters and if we are faithful with there will be blessing seed and a selection of that seed to then continue on this Legacy and that's the cycle that leads us to a new creation of sorts and
 for right now yeah that's right so the first kind of mean sub-unit of numbers goes from 1:1 to 6:21 before it finishes the melody through and sew in 6:22 a new cycle of the melody that's going to depict this Israel and its encampment all over again through another cycle through the themes of Genesis 1 through 9 but this time it's going to get us ready to leave so the first cycle in one through six was about establishing the camp as a new eat this cycle is going to establish the new Eden to get ready to go and that's the kind of the main burden of the section
 so it opens with the language of day 1 of Genesis and of the seventh day of Genesis so in Genesis chapter 1 God creates by means of his word and on day one God said let there be light but the light separate the darkness stay one on the 7th Day concluding God's creation is about God's presence still in creation on the day of rest and He blesses the seventh day and sets it apart slowly so this new cyclist teams in the opening chapters of numbers begins with one of the more well-known Parts people maybe have no these words but they may not know that they are from the fourth book of the Torah the Torah scroll is called the blessing of Aaron you know maybe I'll just let you read it it's Numbers chapter 6 verse 22 to 27 y'all do it and Ivy Fillmore
 the Lord said to Moses tell Aaron and his sons this is how you are to bless the Israelites this place B bless you and keep you y'all we make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you you always turned his face toward you and give you peace so they will put my name on the Israelites and I will die for this blessing to call where when you've heard it and how you Lord bless you and keep you may the Lord for face shine upon you and be gracious to you that's how it's really not yelling it was it like in the song like a benediction and maybe Services yeah usually has some sort of benediction 1 just thinking about this ancient Israel this is a Priestly representative
 who is given the responsibility or privilege of mediating God's blessing out to the people and so the blessing is about. Keeping you about protection May bless you make you fruitful and multiply it may keep you may he make his face shine light on you and it's all the language of Life Genesis One Shining Light from his face yes yeah the face of Yahweh being a Biblical image for the hotspot the radiant's is one of the main depictions of you always glory in the manifestation of his honor and power throughout the Hebrew Bible's fire and light so the face of Yahweh glowing yeah I may he show you Grace favor may you always turned his face or Lewis lift his face upon you serve like when you walk into
 when you walk into the room you always looks up well may he pay attention to you may you be someone that y'all way upstairs notices stand monster face instead of turning away from and last line may give you a shout out on a limb and then verse 27 is a back to the narrative it exits the blessing and Joey says so when the priestesses they are putting my name on the Israelites
 and I will bust them to put my name up on them that's like a summary of what when you say the blessing you are putting my name on them which is interesting cuz the high priest is when he would say this would be wearing a robe and a golden plaque on his head that says belonging to Yahweh so you always news on him yeah so it's at the one who's Yahweh name is is the pain extends his Blessing saying May Yahweh his name his name be on all of you so it's a way that the high priest wraps the whole community in the status that he's been giving us their representative to my name this also makes me think back so many conversations go to that story about the guy in Leviticus who blasphemes or curses the name of Yahweh
 this is kind of your sins of the name Pierce has the name helps us see like the stakes are high and you always name is on someone who gives them access to his presence and power because my name is there yeah it is a way to say that I am yahweh's I represent him and he always favored is my favorite yeah I am my beloved's and he is mine as long as long as the language of the song of songs he gives himself to his people so he becomes theirs and they become his poor in the phrase it's often repeated with the Covenant formula in the Torah is I will be there a God and today will be my people it's spouse coming like with snow and yeah that's it
 so here we are those lights there is the appointing of humanity as God's image and partner here we are wearing dresses one territory that's right okay so that's the blessing of Aaron what comes next what what comes next is the longest chapter in the entire Torah Numbers Chapter 7 has 89 versus and it is a list more less and it's a flashback The Narrative steps out of the time the time was introduced at the first line of the number scroll saying this is the second month the beginning of the second month after the second year and chapter 7 begins with a flashback date thing and it happened on the day that the Tabernacle was set up and then
 it by Moses happened a month ago so this is thrown in here some story from a month ago so it's a great example of how do you know the literary sequence doesn't always correspond to the exact event sequence know it seems more interested in another type of sequence if that's not already clear so the tent was set up in Exodus 40 it's anointed and Onaga right it's in the living room temperature at 8 in to reading them those two chapters is Leviticus 1 through 7 which is all said to happen in one day on the day with the tent was set up an anointed who were time-warping back and what we're told is that Moses anointed it consecrated it and all the Furnishings new I got that already happened we remember he also indicted consecrate at the altar and all of its utensil
 yeah we were there already so at that time so it's just all of that was hit at the there's two here's the new thing did you know that the leaders of Israel all the heads of the families who are tribal leader is in charge of all those who were counted oh yeah that's the crew that I met in Numbers Chapter 1 yeah there's lots of them other words this narrative could have been fit at the end of Exodus or in the middle of Leviticus do it it was saved because it's it was put in then you were like the tribal leaders who are in charge of the counted Israelites when was their accounting who are these tribal leaders so the narrator has saved it till later in the story after the census of Numbers Chapter 1 in the naming of the L and then now you get the story that's one reason it's also been delayed for other reasons so here's what you learned they made offerings and they brought gifts DIY
 6 carts and twelve oxen one Ox from each of the leaders of the 12 tribes and one cart from every two of the tribes and they also brought all of this gold and offerings for the dedication of Tabernacles still have gold I mean they a silver plate a silver sprinkling ball
 my name is about a lot of gold material out in the wilderness with them yeah they've already like what's a member they plundered Egypt mixing bowls so the reason is so long as it lists the complete list of items offered verbatim for each of the Twelve Tribes so how did each tribe contribute yeah because there was a call for material in that an exit for the making of the 10th for the furniture for the transportation of the 10th or for the offerings made in the tent in the first week of its operation was okay but it's another way that numbers is designed with material that links back to Exodus on the other side of Mount Sinai so this chapter matches all the material to make the 10
 Confucian Israelites made to make now here's all the Israelites contributing to transport the tent and what you're talking about is the fact that there's a cemetery in the Torah yeah we talked about another episodes but just say it again and Century in the Torah and right in the middle is the day of atonement and there's three books at the center of the Torah Scrolls Exodus Leviticus Numbers and numbers match in many ways and this is one of them is the offering in Exodus 25 and 31 to make the tavernacle matches these offerings transport the Tabernacle in Exodus numbers surround Leviticus which is at the heart and this is what you were just saying you're in at the Heart Center of the center of Center the Torah is the stories leading up to the day of atonement so the reason why the chapter so long as it's a copy and paste the same list of a whole bunch of items for each of the 12
 once you read 1 list you kind of you read the last two three to twelve times over so you have to ask why is it being repeated 12 times and we're back to the it's a literary device to communicate both abundance we're like using up a lot of squirrel space here yeah lavish use a cheap space on a scroll to repeat this list but it's also you get a sense of the abundance and of the generosity and of the literary order and orderliness of the camp there was some joy in like reading it again like how there's more for this time now that's a that's a tent was set up an Anointed The repetition is a part of a communication style at school
chapter 7 when we come through chapter 7 and we read the beginning of chapter 8 it says the Lord said to Moses and yeah I guess we're flashing forward back to the story time of numbers speak to Aaron and say to him you know when you set up the lamps you know the lights in the tent you know what is just feels like oh one more thing when you set up the lamps make sure that all 7 lights light up the area in front of the lamp stand this is a good example of expecting a lot of the reader first of all let's see where did I read about those lights again Leviticus Leviticus 24
 and there was two little paragraphs about how every day morning and night priest is to make sure all the lights are lit so that's Perpetual light so now here in this paragraph It's when you set up the lamps make sure that all seven are lit up to light up what's in front of the lampstand oh yeah what is opposite the lamp stand on the other side of the room for the offense the incense would be to the left of it by the door by the veil going into the holy of holies but I thought the lamp was if you go in the vale of the Holy space on one side is the lamp I thought the lamp was in front of the curtain to go to the holy of holies is lamps on one side okay and then on the other side symmetrical in the matching position on the other side is the table of bread and I'm in the front is just the curtain or curtain and then the altar of incense is standing by the curtain
 are you at part the curtains the curtain into the holy the holy moly yeah yeah that's right inside the three things in the Holy space 75 Menorah table with the bread and the incense and one more thing make sure you like all 7 so that you can give to the thing that's opposite facing it the showbread so doesn't name it bread but you're supposed to know so the light the Sevenfold light shines upon the bread and how many loaves of bread 12 loaves of bread so light shining upon all 12 and all of a sudden we're back to this with the blessing of Aaron asked for May you always face shine upon Israel how many tribes of Israel that is 12
 so this is a little sandwich around the longest chapter in the Torah it's a little blessing may you always shine his Sevenfold light of his face on Israel and its what the priest has outside the tent but now we get this little matching bit on the other side that's what the priest was doing to the people is actually happening 24/7 inside the tent of the always light represented by the Sevenfold lights shining on the twelve loaves of bread. Cool and it's a it's a little literary puzzle of like why these three things are next to each other that's beautiful it is beautiful that you didn't know before the real soon cuz Steve Barton what's the movie can't think of the movie but there's a scene such a classic scene he's angry and he's leaving his house
 a lot of Leavin I was in The Jerk yeah that's in the jerk that's right oh yeah
 Megan is this fellow that's right actually I need one more thing yet one more thing one more thing and then so interesting how that thing matches the thing from two things ago creating a little in this case a little Shining Light of you always face sandwich with Israel's obedient offerings in the middle you like sweet yeah you always you creating a little new creation of eating out here in the wilderness let's meditate on that you get that idea of the blessing of God in Genesis 1 and then that's how much it again with a blessing the lights shining in Genesis 1
 there's no offerings know it's about God providing a rich abundant well-ordered world for his human partner yeah yeah and then giving them authority to rule and represent him be fruitful and multiply or as here the emphasis is on the very orderly generous Obedience of his people to care for the little symbolic eaten in their midst of transport it moves to recognize all the abundance is from God now what's all so cool is that this is a good example of meditation literature this offering for the transportation of the Tabernacle
 symmetrically links back to the offering of the Israelites for the materials of the Tabernacle in here and the Tabernacle blueprints back in Exodus it's a long section from Exodus 25 231 and it's divided up in 27 speeches of y'all way so that whole section is about Yahweh asking his people to imitate his Sevenfold creative speech act by giving of what God's given to them to make the little eaten and that's what I think being drawn upon here by depicting the offerings of Israel to transport it and framing it with the blessing of Aaron and this thing about the menorah it is cool yeah let's just think so inauthor designed this whole section we call it numbers 622 through numbers 8 verse 4
 and the three-letter units in a real Cemetery that both communicate something on their own then they communicate once you compare it to its match in Exodus and both of those have more meaning when you compare them together back to Genesis one pretty bad but it's you know takes a while to get that you have to know the author is acting you to do such a thing before you even know to look for such thing as numbers 8 5 3 verse 26 are all about how life is good good example I said to Moses take the Levites from among all the Israelites and make them ritually pure purify them do this sprinkle Waters that will make them pure have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes this is a special piece
 kind of ritual that this is not how. Rachel's work let's see actually yeah in Leviticus this is the same thing when people Yahoo were purifying themselves from a skin disease shave your whole body got it
 I see someone in Leviticus 14 if you had a skin disease when you reenter the community you shave your whole body and wash with water I'm so here are the Levites are being set apart from anything associated with death they go through a flat as a where your find flat right symbolic and then like no I did After the flood these Levites after they go through a localized blood on their bodies have them take a young ball and a grand offering and go offer it up on the altar just like Noah did on Mount Ararat then y'all are to bring the Levites in the lizard lights are to lay their hands on them so this is
 earlier in the book we were told the Levites are going to be swapped in the place of Israelite firstborn and they're going to serve as their representatives around the tent now is the narrative about there being a pointed to do that so what Israelites would do to a sacrificial animal when they would bring it to offer put your hands on it put your hands on it to Mission it yeah you're the commissioning it as your counterpart is your counterpart as your representative representative so that's what Israelites due to the sacrificial animals that's what is your lights now due to the Levites who were swapped into the place of the first one who had themselves been swapped out for the Passover Lamb
 okay yes it's not a pact that okay I hear you but yeah that's cool yeah I think if you have enough all along carefully connections me to get but that's okay layering parallels on Parallel with the other pack. Now it says it's this whole tribe is being set up as a sacrificial lamb within this realm as well it's just about the role of the priesthood and of the Levites within Israel was a unique role that they were in proximity always Holiness which is good but also dangerous and they bear responsibility for the sins of Israel in the same way that a blameless animal does and is harkening back to when dog throws down on Egypt he he brought the evil that fell did to the sons of Israel literally the sons of Israel been killing them in the waters demands the sons of Egypt
 the life of the firstborn of Israel and Egypt and Passover we are so God says like a pet is the tenth plague and all the firstborn and it's not just a peach of this like somehow I'll get it leveled up to like every firstborn but then God offers a way through this to make farro didn't do which is the Passover Lamb to the Passover Lamb is a substitute for the life of the firstborn and then we get the numbers here we had that little Narrative of like all those first born kids who were kind of ransomed from that event final Act of Justice are now swapped out the Levites up like yah God Rance M Hughes so you are now you have this kind of special obligation to God could have saved you through this sacrificial lamb now the Levites come in they take that place and then what you're saying is not only now are they like feeling kind of
 obligation for God in a way but they're also acting like a technical and then when the Levites commissions them they go through the same ritual as when an Israelite bring the sacrifice to The Altar and commissions the animal as their own substitute so it's as if this whole tribe is acting as a sacrificial buffer that lives around the tent so that the power of God's holiness brings them blessing instead of overwhelming them so that they die yeah okay yeah it's very much like yeah a special group of like nuclear reactor technician who are get to put on there like thick yellow rubber hazmat suits and this select group when they are playing their role dressed this way they on our behalf of the community that lives around the reactor
 these can go in and tend to it so that the reactor produces energy for us instead of melting down and then destroying us all kind of yeah I mean that breaks down multiple ways but that's essentially it but when is it the Levites in these priests live in this Zone were there in such close proximity to the very source of all life that they can be a source of blessing extreme blessing like when the priest
 but that his hands and bless his people or they could be that their lives are at risk if they were to do something wrong which intent is going to happen in Numbers chapter 16 to go terribly wrong
 okay so that's the commissioning of the Levites so we had a re-creation of Israel through the blessing so they always face can shine upon his people wear now commissioning the Royal priests were selecting humans letting them out assigning them to work in the new Eden great wonderful Numbers chapter 9 then I spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt
 do the same time so in the first month of this is the book begin in the second month of the second-year Oh Susanna the flashback flashing back again to a month ago okay here's the thing the first month of every year that's over. You select the Lamb on the second Sabbath in the week of the second Sabbath you select a Passover Lamb on the 14th and then begin us the night of passover self chapter 9 have the Israelites celebrate Passover you know speaking of the Levites who were substituted out for the firstborn who were substituted out for the Passover Lamb in the previous section speaking of Passover how did Israelites celebrate Passover it's about time make sure you celebrate it at the time of meeting
 a zebra word on the night of the 14th day of the month you know just like go read Exodus so Moses told the Israelites to celebrate Passover and they did it puts the first Passover out of each of the original since the yes it's the night of the Exodus yeah so there's Reliance did everything there were some Israelites yeah they couldn't celebrate Passover because well they had touched a dead body recently and they were ritually a well this is a problem or something. That's why I didn't think about this one so we're meditating again on what it means to be a little Garden of Eden holy space traveling through the desert and what happens on one of these days we will meet with you always the people and we retell the story of how he set us apart
 and spared us through the first born lamb so that we could all be free to serve you all were here today what a awesome thing that we all could celebrate that with you alway dwelling in our midst but I do know what does Ben death in the camp and some of us have had contact with death what are we supposed to do I guess we're going to lose out I guess we can't be covered by the blood of the Lamb because we've contracted death is putting together a crisis here to know if you haven't read Leviticus this doesn't feel like that big of a crisis we making a mountain out of a molehill here yeah yeah this is a question about does death disqualify you
 from being covered by the blood of the Lamb Steve contracted ritual Purity by touching death what you should have to do is go live on the edge of the camp and not celebrate. Celebrate Passover but if you don't celebrate Passover what you're doing is saying I don't get to participate in the liberation of Yahweh of his people the real kind of her happens in the tents like that's part of pass over his shoulder like you're you're in the house with blood on the door so they came to Moses and Aaron said listen we became unclean because of a dead body most likely from burying a relative so we had to get somebody honorable burial yeah we had to do it the day before Passover and so we're waiting 7 days at the edge of the camp and are you saying that we don't get to do is pass over we can't be liberated all over again because we touch a dead body why should we be left out from presenting the Lord's offering with all the other Israelites and Moses answers and says he had a great point
 wait till I go find out what the Lord is going to come and we're going to do so that y'all were supposed to Moses tell Israelites when any of you or your descendants are in pure cuz you've touched a dead body or let's just say you're on vacation your way out by the way there's going to be lots of reasons you might miss Passover you might be out of town this afternoon work trip let's say a group went South to like you know trade with the minivan the trade with me tonight to get whatever this is that and they're gone they still need to celebrate Passover but they are to do it on the 14th day of the second month just do it one month later there to eat the lamb together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs and starts repeating rules don't leave any till morning don't break any of its bones
 follow all the regulations now is anybody who is not in pure and not on a work trip and they don't celebrate Passover they're dead to me they will pay the consequences of Thurston okay so is the meditation you gotta go to meditate so to be a member of the Covenant people of God mean I'm a part of the family that was liberated from death and slavery to the powers of Evil by the justice of Yahweh on evil but also by the mercy of Yahweh the provided that substitute new plan
 so this is a people by definition who exists because of you always Justice and mercy and the family exists because of it going through that experience but now every year every Israelite for all the years of their life meaning every generation is to see itself as living as if we are The Exodus generation and if you fail to do it unless you're going to work trip or ritual in Peoria then you are no longer a part of the people it's like forsaking your identity as the people who are both under God's justice and also a live because of God's mercy ice cream like renewing your contract with Scott every year and it's like yeah you're not going to renew
 then you're out at being a part of this people means perpetually recognizing that my life doesn't belong to me I could have died in Egypt and the life that I do have this a gift of you always generous mercy and celebrating Passover is a way of renewing that identity every year
 now what if death has prevented me from participating that we got to plan a desk can't prevent you from participating in that or responsibilities that you might have its powerful actually it's like it would be very easy to start to live in a way where I forget this is my core identity and I start to live as if my life belongs to me to be fair it's also easy to forget when doing rituals you know I mean I suppose it's the last easy but you can go through the motions of totally oh that's right of course but this is forcing you to stop in a time and place and to recognize
 and let your imagination be like shapes by by the site is there an experience that story into let it become your reality but that's a big deal is a big deal yeah once again highlights the role of habits and liturgy connected to a calendar and the story of God's people that shapes their memories and their identities in a really powerful way there's another element to this year but I'll just draw attention to cuz it might be a cool conversation is the fact that this thing happens so the loss of Passover already set up earlier in the Torah and their long to launch a mix of the 12 13 and you think what more is there to say but there's this whole narrative that recognizes mail stuff happens and we actually get in the business of living life whether the bearing a relative or going on a work trip
 and you're going to find yourself in situations where there's no law there's no law so what do you do and so this is a narrative dedicated to pondering what do we do when there's no rule from God about what to do in this scenario and what Moses has to do is go to the all by himself and get a new refreshing of the Old Law so that you can fulfill the original law but by not observing it on his face value so what are you do if you don't have a mosasaur and a great question but I think it depends on who you are good thing that Moses this happens a couple of times in the tour it's going to happen again in numbers 2 times actually with some Daughters of fry above one of Joseph sons are going to come and say like hey you know we're all supposed to get a land inheritance but our dad died in the wilderness and he didn't have any sons we don't have any brothers and the way the laws currently stated women can't inherit
 and Moses like I do know where we do so he goes the other way and you always like yeah new rule women can inherit land so there's something happening here the Wilderness generation is being taught that even the revelation of God's will at Sinai in the laws of the Torah needs to be refreshed and to the some complete lock code that they get to just check the last and I'm done yeah it's going to be this constant like coming back to God and saying what about this so what do we do now yes if you have a Moses you could go God's going to give them the new law but like no I'm serious like what do you do if you don't have Moses yeah well I think you better pray for God's spirit to give you wisdom
 and later in the Book of Numbers when Moses is told he's not going to enter the promised land what he's told us to appoint Joshua as a new Moses and God will give him a spirit of wisdom and what that's about I think is about how the generations after Moses can look upon the laws of the Torah but also with God's wisdom find new ways to obey the meaning of those laws even if it means doing something slightly different than what it says this brings us into the whole wisdom Traditions exactly right of like what does it mean to be filled with the spirit of wisdom in Numbers Chapter 11 Moses going to say man I can't lead all these people it's two bags too complex I don't know what to do and so God says Well Point seventy elders and I'll take of the spirit my spirit that's on you and I'll give it to them
 and so it's right yeah and soul in it happens there's so much of God's spirit that it spills over onto two extra people two guys name eldad mean Dad their names made the beloved one and darling little precious and so it overflows on to do more and there's a guy in the camp was like what now it came on more than 70 Moses got Spirits breaking the boundaries here and Moses is why you know what man I wish every Israelite in a good spirit that's a good problem it's a good problem cuz what God Spirit of wisdom means is that you can discover you can discern God's will for Your Life by Consulting the wisdom of the tour I would also going out and living out God's will in ways that or I could never address because it was given to a particular people at a particular time
so this is all the numbers if it's cool it's super cool it's a big name and numbers about the role of the spirit now I feel like just hinted at here and it's just it's just the first like hinted that the first a room over that thing that's interesting wow the Torah itself has stories saying you're going to need more than the laws of the Torah if you want to live by God's well well and then you know I've been kind of busy thinking about this and every other of Proverbs and this idea of understanding in the Bible that the the psalmist in Psalm 119 ask for understanding through the key points like I want to understand and it's so interesting to me because in one sense the laws like you know once you get it what's there to understand yeah like example and these are playing together for me what's a
 always talked about today anybody who has leprosy what skin disease or touch a dead body Exile cannot see how you can do Passover in the second month I understand I get it I feel like I missed it the first month I could do it the second month just okay do it what why is the psalmist going to help me understand I know so that I can like actually have life it's like it's it told you what to do and it seems like a lot of these all these laws you thought of that way but you get the foam is going to help me understand how many stance of that might have life and then in Proverbs 2 when it's talking about finding like wisdom and understanding it's like sexy guy after this like it's just this is treasure this is what you need there just like this Quest and Ernie's of this I've let you know don't just hear this and
 bya I'm going to check this off I would do all these things I find understanding that's really fascinates me the biblical story is trying to shape God's people into people who assume that there's always more to learn that I can always gain more wisdom and insight to navigate life's complexities
 and that I have to keep returning to the Torah to discover greater Insight so that I can go with my life and trust that I'm living by God's will yeah I think the impulse underneath Psalm 119 is the same impulse for what the story is trying to communicate cuz you're on the face of it it's okay celebrate Passover on the second month but what if I'm on a work trip on the second month exactly what do we do that do we come back to Moses then it must be like you guys you have the spirit of God Work It Out work it out August 14th is the third month so it's like this process of trying to wean God's people off of the laws not to ignore them but two left a lot of shape them in such a way that they can begin to make their own responsible decisions that's part of why Paul caused the law like a pedagogue
 yeah what he says is the laws of the Torah are good and point to life but they don't give you the power to obey them he locates that power in the gift we got Spirit and the power to then also understand them and let them give you wisdom like yeah I clicker training you there's something about these like yeah that's the focus here and that's what was here so when Paul's talk about his talk about just does he have something about like I was his James or something but like there's a sense of the law was like when you're a child and like
 you know you need some extra care but then there's like an opportunity to find the wisdom under the law and like yeah that's a part of his larger Chain of Thought in the letter to the Galatians Galatians yeah that's right and there's other Dynamics you know the going on in Galatians about circumcision and stuff it's specific to first-century Judaism and the Messianic house churches but the basic point is that the laws have built within them a Thrust that's forcing you to go be guided by the laws to be in making decisions that the laws don't speak to and you so it's actually very similar to what Jesus is doing on The Sermon on the Mount you would argue that the story is being carried forward when Jesus says you heard that it was said don't murder and I say to you and I say to you what's underneath don't murder
 well let's really understand this law give me understanding of don't murder because it's obvious don't take the person's life yeah that's right. Take another person what what else do you need to understand let's get understanding it's like the night before The Sermon on the Mount Jesus was up all night prayer praying Psalm 119. It was just so here's something Jesus might have prayed that night so I'm hundred nineteen thirty-four give me understanding so that I can keep your law and Obey it with all of my heart direct me in the path of your commands that's where I find the light and so it's somebody shaped by that desire that could see underneath the law don't murder or something more underneath the law celebrate Passover every year on the 1st month the 14th day and say there's something more.
 I stand here more God wants more for me with what Passover is about so much more that I can celebrate it a month later and he doesn't want me to miss out cuz it's so formative understanding my identity give me understanding so that may keep your law no just help me keep a lot like I said you gave me the total nobody wants understanding to go pay it with all his heart and his like he hadn't been there is something about what about a situation that the law doesn't address give me understanding so that no matter what scenario find myself in I keep the Torah well there's only 613 laws in the Torah and they don't address anything about XYZ
 but that's what understanding will give me so that I can obey it with all my heart I have this is cool I forgot that this was an element of the story when we started this conversation but the moment I remember that cuz this is a long-standing theme for you over the years we've been talking Psalm 119 that's kind of going to see the frustration but I think it speaks to something deeper for you well I originally sold my 19 the beef was just man if I'm going to be honest with myself the laws of the Torah are there burdensome yeah and they're weird and they're just like it's just like it's like going to it's like we went to a school where there's all these you know that all these rules you know why I don't go to an R-rated movie and don't like talking about the Christian college and it's like I didn't think of those and be like
 I want understand them put up with these and that's how I feel to me but for me I step outside and I go I'm not a nation is ReliOn of the following but here in Psalm 119 an ancient Israelite reveling in these it's so that was hard for me and I remember we were going through this with your time with the songs and I just was being just really playing I was just like I don't get it like why is he so stoked on these laws yeah I just feel like kind of finding yeah and that's obviously how the people who are closer to the original context of all these laws they felt the opposite right or could have felt the opposite that's right okay when they get it when they get like oh this is what's Happening Here is our shipping me to give me an opportunity to live in God's present these laws are setting me apart to be God's holy people like all the stuff yeah
 Passover is not just a once-a-year thing and it's not just a thing that happened to my ancestors it's something God wants to be for me the god of the Exodus for me every day every day is a Liberation From Slavery meditating and your life I could be liberated all over again today
 I mean God says you can do in the first month
 show Passover everyday but the point is like you'd get there by meditating on the meaning the significance of the heart underneath the command will the Delight that you would have when you realize I get access roads like blessing and this is funneling me into it yeah that's pretty awesome that was my first kind of problem solving 18 is not getting that and then there's been this more recent just trying to figure out why is the psalmist said maybe three times maybe it's more in Psalm 118 explicitly asked us to understand the law and like I'm really wanted to know more like what are they after there and so that's we worked through that a little bit here and I think there's something lovely. I think so too yep so in the section God has remade the people he's Shine the Light of his face upon them they responded by reciprocating generosity to give gifts to trance
 what's tenth God's chosen line put the Levites to work in proximity to the 10th and now we see that every year he wants to deliver his people all over again so we continue on this good Bible trivia when was the first time that the cloud and the pillar of fire the guy that God's people through the Wilderness where is the first time that that appeared at the Reed sea
 so you're going to access 14 and you're right it does appear there but it's not the first time it's the night of passover the moment passover's / Exodus 13:17 the people leave Egypt and God guided them by a pillar of cloud by day a pillar of fire to guide them so here in numbers after we have addressed the topic of Passover
 we read numbers 9:15 okay so remember how on the day the Tabernacle was set up resuming back in time again and the tent of the Covenant of the Torah was set up a member that yeah Leviticus 8 or 9 or something remember how a cloud-covered in uniform even the morning the cloud above the Tabernacle and look like fire truck number is 9:15 is full on flash back you up okay 4:16 that's how it kept on being all the time cloud-covered it and a night that look like fire whenever the cloud lifted her about the tent is Right set up wherever the cloud stopped Israelites camped at you always come and the Israelites set out that you always come and they can't
 as long as that cloud stayed over the Tabernacle they remained in the camp now let's say the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle a really long time Israelites would obey that or they wouldn't leave
 sometimes the cloud was over the Tabernacle just a few days and that the Lord's command they wouldn't camping at the Lord's command they would set out
 sometimes the cloud
 I'm trying to make this exciting we're just like all the things I do we're saying over and over and over again the cost a long time so your short time classmate a few days I'll stay a week so we're working the same over and over and over again they live and are led by the cloud the presents that we always knew is the thing that's going to guide them that's that paragraph 10:10 here's another thing to Trumpets a beautiful hammered were they obviously area trumpets trumpets at Sinai it's go up the mountain now is he always thunder and lightning bolt trumpets till I can operate the Tabernacle
 origin story for the trumpet season and use them to call out the community when you want to assemble all the leaders in the Clans remember their names from chapter 1 then blasted traffic if you want all the camps to start to get up and get ready to go last that trumpet two times let's say that you're going into battle with an enemy like we might meet up in the wellness yep blast those trumpets let's say let's say it's you want to celebrate one of the festival's where we meet with y'all way pass over at one of the seven example glasses trumpets trumpets when you leave last time when you stay last time when you meet with God
 plastic trumpets
 so this is interesting the section begin with the blessing of Aaron and the mentioning of the seven Lampman Nora and we were told there that the menorah was made out of hammer work very rare word and now at the end of the section we are being reminded of its of the trumpets made of hammered work those hammered things we're right next to the literary unit that reminded you about the day the Tabernacle set up both to be transported and then to be led by the cloud and fire so we're start we're getting ready to go to the chapters 1 through 6 were all about recreating the little eaten in the wilderness now this whole section is about recreating as real as the mobile Eaton getting ready to leave And So It All Leads up to numbers 10:11 and John we're going to leave him outside I we've been here a long time I don't know how many conversations
 a Mount Sinai here but on the 20th day of the second month of the second year you know that cloud you know that. But yeah we just learned about the cloud black cloud lifted up from the Tabernacle of the Covenant tour and the Israelites they set out from the desert is tonight or go and man they travel from place to place OK second month 20th day so they've done the Passover in the middle of the day of the Feast of unleavened bread yeah I have to go to Moses and so the divisions of a camp of Judah they went first remember this from chapter to this is a good example where we repeating all the stuff from her earlier chapters and that you can feel its we're rounding off a literary unit here and we're going to set off in
 the new one so it goes and starts renaming all the camp divisions and their banners that that carries they marched through the really long list then the Levites carry the whole thing so yeah that was check three and four and Cat finally the rear guard this is like I have read the lists so many times now again the repetition communicates the orderliness and orders a big deal is the opposite of chaos chaos out in that Wilderness new so From This Moment forward the Israelites set out into the Wilderness and what we're going to see is the story again of Genesis 1 through 9 the Cycles going to start over again in the second literary movement and they go into the Wilderness going to be good for a minute a hot minute and then it's going to go terribly wrong here just I start going wrong in chapter 11 there was this rabble
 among the Israelites who began to desire food they have a desire for food like the woman saw that the tree was good for food and desirable Saturday yeah yeah yeah I was going to be this big Rebellion among the people against Moses because they want desirable food so it's good for a minute but it's even for a minute and then we're going to be right back into the talk about next but it just kind of show you how it works but for the moment let's just pause with the Camp's marching out and everybody is the carrying you know all the tents and the cloud and the fire is with them you always with his people and they're on the march to a New Creation lot of order there's a lot of understanding about how this is all going to work we got the priests we've got all the offerings we've got God's blessing in his presence in the Tabernacle and were ordered
 multiplying more flourishing and we are off that's it has a major hinge in the storyline of the Torah and this people has been redeemed they become the host of the presence of their liberating God and now they have begun to reflect God's Own orderliness and Beauty And Justice and abundance in life is to go into the desert and that's the picture we are left to ponder like a garden in the desert as they go through and the garden won't last long it's all going to go wrong in a minute but lets you know the story just let us pause for a minute and picture of what things can be like and what things could be like in our own life and these stories and become literature Frost and meditate on to consider what God's purpose and we loved his for our time and our day thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast
 we just finished the first movement of numbers next week we'll begin the second movement will explore a new theme the theme of the test and we're going to find all the intentional parallels between this testing and the testing in this world accidents and usually they are patterns of intensive keishin like what happened in Exodus will usually get picked up and intensified but sometimes flicker inverted by the matching stores in numbers the Wilderness constitutes a test for whether Israel with trust Yahweh and bring about little Gardens of Oasis a refuge in the wilderness and whether they're going to obey God's words and you can already anticipate where that's going to go today show is produced by Cooper pelts edited by Dan Gumbel and Tyler Bailey and Lyndsay Ponder with the show notes and Mackenzie box men provided the invitations for annotated podcast in our at bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make is free because of
