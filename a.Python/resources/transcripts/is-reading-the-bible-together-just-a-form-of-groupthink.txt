 Jon: Hey, this is Jon with The Bible Project podcast. Today, I'm going to continue talking 
with Tim on this biblical theme of reading the Bible together out loud. Last episode, 
we talked about the history of ancient Israel, how they read the Torah allowed in 
their community.  
 Today we're going to look at how that practice continued on into the New 
Testament with Jesus, Jesus who actually announced his public ministry during a 
public greeting of Scripture. In this episode, we're going to talk about key practices  
in the early church that helped that group form their identity. Practices, including 
communion, also known as the last supper, but also this practice of reading the 
letters of the New Testament aloud as a group.  
Tim: Because you when you're by yourself, you're like, "The Bible's weird." But then when 
we're a group together, we're like, "This our story and we're going live by this story 
and I find the Christian worldview more believable."  
Jon: As a skeptical person, sometimes this whole thing feels a littl e bit like just group 
think or brainwashing. I asked Tim about that too.  
Tim: It is a form of identity formation called brainwashing, but the point is, is that the 
person poking holes in that is themselves exposing themselves constantly to a 
different form  of brainwashing of just a different story about the world. Of course, 
the question is, which of those stories offers a better account of the human 
experience and of reality?  
Jon: If you've ever wondered about what early church services looked like, if Chr istianity 
might be some weird group therapy, stay tuned. Here we go.  
Tim: Out of Ezra, Nehemiah practice comes a practice that went two ways in Jewish 
tradition in Middle Eastern — 
Jon: Ezra, Nehemiah's practice?  
Tim: Both, they revived this practice. They read of it, and then they asked all the people to 
renew their commitment to the covenant. Then, what the story is, and the rest of 
Nehemiah go on to show is it didn't really work. People didn't really stay faithful. But 
that's another matter.  
 But histori cally, this practice went on. So Babylonian, Middle Eastern Jewish 
communities from later Jewish texts, the mission, and the Talmud have this practice, 
this synagogue practice of gathering on the evening of Sabbath or Shabbat, and 
over the course of one ye ar, they'll have read the entire Torah aloud in the E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
3 
 synagogue gatherings. All the way back in Israel Palestine, Jewish communities are 
taking three and a half years.  
 This practice developed in two different ways. There are Shorter readings, and then a 
practice developed where they would combine that shorter reading from the Torah 
with a selection from the prophets or the Psalms or the wisdom books.  
 It's the early lectionary. This is what became the lectionary practice in Christianity of 
reading from sec tions of the Bible.  
Jon: Which is in a high church?  
Tim: That's right. Yeah, for the most part. The practice when diverse directions in Jewish 
history after the biblical period, but it's been a practice within Jewish history all along 
- the public reading of Scripture. This is what moving forward into the New 
Testament — 
Jon: So there's no Jewish tradition where they just every seven years on the Feast of 
Booths actually just read through?  
Tim: That's a good question.  
Jon: There's no Hasidic? It seems like Hasidic Jews would do that.  
Tim: Yeah, we keep that going. I'm not as much off the top my head about more modern 
Jewish practices like that. There's nothing in the Second Temple period. We go to 
Ezra, Nehemiah, and then out into the spread of the Diaspora Jewish communities 
around Babylon and Israel, and these other practices developed. This is the setting 
the Jesus and the apostles are all a part of.  
 There's that story in Luke chapter 4. Jesus goes to synagogue on the Sabbath, and 
the scroll of Isaiah is  opened and handed to him.  
Jon: So they must be in that part?  
Tim: Yeah. the Torah reading's already been done. Now, this is the reading of the 
prophets. Whether he just neglected the order and chose Isaiah 61 or whether it 
happened to be Isaiah 61, we're  not told.  
Jon: He's like, "Oh, we're in Isaiah 61. Perfect."  
Tim: "Perfect. Let me tell you guys. This is being fulfilled in your hearing." There are a 
couple other mentions of it. Like when Paul and Barnabas go out on the first 
missionary journey, they' re sent out by the church in Antioch, and they go to a town E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
4 
 in modern -day Turkey called Pisidia Antioch. On the Sabbath, they entered the 
synagogue and sat down.  
 After the reading from the Torah and the prophets, the leaders of the synagogue 
said, "Hey, y ou guys are new to town. Give us a short word of exhortation."  
Jon: That was a typical thing in the synagogue?  
Tim: Yeah. Well, think back to that Ezra, Nehemiah practice. You have reading the 
scriptures and then expositing them or giving them sense.  
Jon: And there wasn't like one person who gets to do that, necessarily?  
Tim: Yeah, that's right.  
Jon: It wasn't just the rabbi who gets to do that?  
Tim: Well, there was the priests and Levites in Ezra, Nehemiah, but there are no rules 
about who can read.  
Jon: The two can expose it?  
Tim: Anybody can get up and read. Like Jesus can, or Paul and Barnabas after the reading 
are invited. "There are new guys in town, some new brothers , new kinsmen of ours." 
So they invite them, "Hey, give us a word of exhortation bas ed on the scriptures that 
we just read."  
 When Paul gets up is he does a whole retelling of the story of the Old Testament 
leading up to the Messiah. Then he says, "Then the Messiah is the crucified Jesus."  
Jon: And they're kind of like, "Whoa. We didn't expect that."  
Tim: This is same practice. It is the origins of the sermon in Jewish Christian tradition.  
Jon: In my small church ministry experience, you do not let people get up on stage and 
start expositing scripture without. The open mic time is — 
Tim: "Open mic." It's not really cool.  
Jon: It goes wrong. I mean, even in a small group setting, if you turn to someone and say, 
"Cool. Now, what do you think what might happen?" Someone's going to have some 
just crazy thing to say. Why is that such a fear?  
Tim: That's interesting.  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
5 
 Jon: There are some crazy people, right?  
Tim: Oh, yeah.  
Jon: There's that. There are people who they just waiting because they have this thing 
they're obsessed with and they're just waiting for an opportunity to obsess about it 
without love.  
Tim: Many people have been in those awkward home groups or Bible studies where 
there's the person who just hijacks the room.  
Jon: Can you just imagine like Barnabas being one of those guys, and they're in Antioch 
and they're like, "You're new bro thers." And also they're talking about space aliens 
and everything — 
[crosstalk 00:07:18]   
Tim: Note to self: Do not let Barnabas exposit .  
Tim: Maybe they knew some people there. I don't know. Early Christianity develops in the 
setting of weekly gathering s where the scriptures are read aloud and there's a short 
exposition of them or word of exhortation.  
 Here's what's interesting. Jesus and the apostles as they went into Jewish settings 
did this. As the followers of Jesus started to form their own worship gathering not 
around Sabbath but around resurrection morning, which is Sunday morning, they 
would gather in homes and eat a meal together and take the bread and the cup 
together.  
Jon: So instead of going to the temple...When would synagogue be?  
Tim: Synag ogue would be on Friday nights.  
Jon: And there was a specific place?  
Tim: Yeah, it would be at the synagogue.  
Jon: At the synagogue?  
Tim: Yeah, building designated. Christians didn't have any of their own building 
dedicated.  
Jon: And they're not going to c rash the Jewish synagogues on?  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
6 
 Tim: Maybe you might have some Jewish followers — 
Jon: It isn't like the Korean church saying, like, "Hey, you guys don't use this building on 
Saturday night?"  
Tim: There are no stories about that. All the evidence in the New Testament and after is 
that met in people's homes because it was all about a meal. Everything's focused 
around replaying the Lord's Supper together.  
Jon: Every time?  
Tim: Mh mm. Then we get a window in Paul's letter to the Corinthians that during the 
meal,  and afterward, somebody would bring a word, a prophecy, somebody would 
bring a teaching, and multiple people would contribute to the sharing time over or 
after the meal. That's the early Christian gatherings.  
Jon: So there wasn't just reading the scriptu re? 
Tim: It certainly played a part but there's more happening at least in the house churches 
that Paul started. But it's interesting because at the end of two of his letters he talks 
about the reading aloud of something and what it is, is his letters.  
 At the end of his letters to the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, he says, "I 
charge you before the Lord to have this letter read aloud to all the brothers and 
sisters." The end of Colossians, he says, "After this letter has been read to you, see 
that's also read in the church down the road of Laodicea. And in turn, get the letter I 
wrote to them and read that."  
Jon: Which we don't have.  
Tim: We don't have it, unless, it's the letter to the Ephesians. It's also the letter to the 
Ephesians. Just inte resting rabbit hole that we don't have time for there. We know 
that Paul intended his letters to be read aloud the same way that they would be 
reading aloud other sacred texts of the Scriptures.  
Jon: So, sorry to be picky, how do we know they we re continuing the tradition of reading 
the Torah?  
Tim: In 1 Timothy, in the directions is the third important passage. When Paul writes to 
Timothy who's a pastor, he's stationed in Ephesus. Paul wants to come help Timothy 
out with a bunch of pastoral probl ems, but he says, "Until I come, keep devoting 
yourself to the public reading of Scripture and to preaching into teaching."  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
7 
  Between all of this, Paul's having his own letters read aloud, but also in these house 
church gatherings, we're having just Script ure read aloud. Which at the time he's 
writing, Timothy doesn't refer to the New Testament because those writings are just 
coming into existence. He's referring to the Old Testament Scriptures.  
Jon: So based off of that verse, we know there was the public reading, the Christians were 
continuing reading out loud these Jewish Scripture?  
Tim: Yeah. They both picked up but also developed this Jewish practice of reading the 
Old Testament Scriptures allowed, probably in Greek for many of these people. And 
that al ong with the scriptures, Paul's letters are being read aloud, which the issue of 
that he viewed his letters as having the same kind of Covenant authority, almost 
certainly somebody would be reciting from oral memory, large sections of the 
Sermon on the Mou nt or something like that, teachings of Jesus.  
 Then also, as the Spirit led people, what he talks about in 1 Corinthians 12 through 
14 of the Spirit prompting people to share something they feel like God wants to say 
to their church community. It's a very active gathering over a meal.   
Jon: Would they  actually be at a meal the whole time?  
Tim: Good point. I mean, all you do is think of gatherings that we host in our home.  
Jon: Yeah. After a while, you go back to the living room  or something.  
Tim: We have a meal together, and we're talking and th en we put the dishes away and go 
living room and we just keep talking. We pray for each other and we don't sing. We 
don't sing songs.  
Jon: These Christians who are really interested in how the early church actually performed 
worship service or a gathering because of the belief that the way that it was done in 
the early church is the way it should always be done. And so if we could figure out 
what they were doing, that's the way we should be doing in church.  
 We don't have to get into whether or not that's a valid assumption, but how much 
can we actually know exactly what was being done? Because it seems like we're just 
getting these little piecemeal things. And who knows? It would have been done one 
way in a Jewish environment yet and then it probably would  have been 
done...because they have all the synagogue background, so would have been highly 
adapted from the way that they were used to do in synagogue. They changed the 
day, but they're still going to have all of that tradition to fall back on.  
But then you go to a city that's not Jewish and they don't have that — E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
8 
 Tim: And the majority of the followers of Jesus are Greeks and Romans.  
Jon: And they don't have all the synagogue background. And maybe some of it was 
imported in a little bit from the missionar ies that came and told them about Jesus. 
They have that background.  
Tim: Like the public reading of the Scriptures, that's a Jewish practice that gets adopted 
into these non -Jewish traditions.  
Jon: But they'll probably bring their own flavor of the way t hat they're used to gather into 
it too.  
Tim: That's right.  
Jon: The kind of assumption I would have is that it probably looks very different in every 
single gathering.  
Tim: Depending on the city and on the house, church community. I think that's right. 
There's no manual of worship gathering in the writings of the apostles.  
 One of the earliest post -New Testament documents that claims to represent the way 
worship and teaching was done in the New Testament e ra is called the didaskalía  
which is just th e Greek word for teaching or instruction. It's a little manual of like 
discipleship from the early church. It’s really interesting.  
 Mostly, some of it's like how to perform baptisms and the kind of catechism or 
instruction new converts are to be given. Y ou pray the Lord's Prayer every morning 
and every night, you fast once a week.  
Jon: For how long?  
Tim: One whole day. One day a week you don't eat to dedicate yourself to prayer. It's a 
little window into early Eastern Christianity. But even that doesn't g ive you like the — 
Jon: That's what? A couple generations in?  
Tim: Yeah, totally. We're decades out from the era of the apostles. This gets us more into 
controversial territory because both the Catholic tradition. The Eastern Orthodox 
tradition makes a clai m that the Liturgy of the mass have ancient roots that go all 
the way back to a period of the apostles. People have debates about these kinds of 
things.  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
9 
  But essentially we don't  have anything like the apostle describing what the worship 
gathering ought t o look like. The only thing we know for certain is that it was a meal 
which at some point reenacted to take Last Supper, the Passover meal with Jesus.   
Jon: And it was always a meal. Is that right?  
Tim: Well, we don't have any indication that these refer ences to meals were anything 
other than the actual meals.  
Jon: It's just so weird for me. For some reason, that's so shocking, and I think it's because 
that's so rare in the tradition I grew up in to actually have a meal. Like that one 
happens once a year . It's like the church potluck. And it's a bunch of work.  
 So like, 1% of the gatherings involve a meal. Every gathering involved a meal, that 
just seems crazy. But I guess you got to eat when you're in your house.  
Tim: It was a house based movement. The central symbol of the gathering was reenacting 
the bread and the cup.  
Jon: Which has the same kind of influence that reading scripture aloud lowed should 
have, which is, let's remember.  
Tim: And we discover also the reading aloud of the scriptures of the writings of the 
prophets and then the apostles taking the bread in the cup together, which is food 
so is in the context of a meal, and then the reading aloud of the apostles and 
prophets.  
Jon: They never just like said, "Hey, we've already eaten or some of  us will eat when we 
leave, so let's just take little bits of bread, little sips of wine?"  
Tim: This is a huge problem in the churches in Corinth that Paul lays into them for 
because there's no status in the Roman world. If you're wealthy, you could come 
early to the meal, and they would eat all the food and drunk all the wine before or 
later people who had to work. And then they get to work later, Paul calls them those 
who have not come. And everybody else is already little tipsy because they drank  
too muc h wine. And Paul's just like, "You call this the worship gathering?" He thinks 
it's a shame. Anyway, he's laying into them, but it gives us at least some clues that 
people are getting there at different times.  
Jon: So interesting.  
Tim: Then, later on, 1 Corinthians 14, he says, "What do we say, brothers? When you guys 
come together, different ones of you, one has a hymn to share, one has a word of E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
10 
 instruction, teaching, one has a prophecy, a tongue or interpretation. That's a whole 
other thing. Paul says,  "Everybody contribute so the community can be built up." 
Then he gives instructions about how tongues and prophecy works because the 
Corinthians were getting out of control.  
Jon: Would it have been possible during these early gatherings then since there are so 
many elements now that there would be times where scripture wasn't read?  
Tim: Oh, interesting.  
Jon: Before it was like that's all - you got together, you read the scripture, you did a little 
bit expositing, and then that was it. Now it seems to ha ve more. To such a degree it's 
like you got a meal, someone brings a hymn, someone have a prophecy, there might 
be all these different things. And then it's like, "Guys, we ran out of time, and we 
haven't cracked the scroll."  
Tim: We don't have the manual . All we have are these little tidbits in the New Testament 
itself and then the later from later [inaudible 00:19:05].  
Jon: It just feels like it went from the thing to now one of many things.  
Tim: I understand. That's interesting.  
Jon: Is that the case?   
Tim: Yeah. It seems to be that the bread and the cup becomes the center symbol, but we 
all know that the reading of Scripture and the reading of the Torah, prophets, and 
apostles was also a part of what Paul had happened in his house Scripture.  
Jon: And he tol d Timothy not to neglect it?  
Tim: Told Timothy, "Make sure you keep reading scriptures aloud to people." It starts to 
sound more and more like a church gathering except maybe a more modern setting. 
The bread and the cup have become disconnected from an act ual meal from most 
communities. I still don't understand the Protestant tradition of having the bread 
and the cup just once a month. It's utterly bizarre to me.  
Jon: But when it's not a meal, it's kind of a weird thing to do every week.  
Tim: Kind of. But  as such at crucially...talk about identity formation. Because the bread 
and the cup are you're eating story. Instead of reading aloud, you're consuming the 
story. You're engaging in it in a really powerful way that reminds you of who you are, E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
11 
 and who Jesu s is, and the kind of life that I'm called to. And that gets you to look 
backwards.  
 Like in Josiah, we look back, and we lament ways that we haven't been faithful. And 
then, like Joshua, you look forward to the new horizon that lay ahead and what kind 
of person the story makes you into. That's really what this is about.  
 The public reading of Scripture, whether it's connected to a worship gathering, or 
whether it's a more of a one off thing like in Joshua's day, the whole point is identity 
formation. It's  the creation of reality for people. And that's really the goal.  
[00:21:37]  
Tim: You're really interested in this - the history of worship gathering.  
Jon: Yeah, I'm sorry.  
Tim: No, it's okay. I know. Now that I think about it, it's like, "Of course, you wo uld be 
interested in this." It's context for you. It's like, how did we get — 
Jon: I would be afraid to make such a stand of how important...All of a sudden, I just 
started getting this sense of, "Oh, yeah, the Lord's Supper actually is probably more 
import ant than reading scripture aloud in the early tradition."  
Tim: I see.  
Jon: And that was the thing that you would always do. Actually reading scripture was 
really important, but that you could maybe miss. But you wouldn't not eat the meal. 
Anyways.  
Tim: I see. 
Jon: I'm also very interested in identity formation. I've thought a lot about and read 
about how our identity is shaped by our myths. In particular, trying to think through 
that in a modern context of what are the myths that we are told and reenact — 
Tim: By myth, you mean in the technical sense of a foundation story?  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Whether or not it's rooted in historical events or not, isn't the point. It's story begins 
to shape your sense of who you are and your role in the world.  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
12 
 Jon: For Ameri cans, there are certain stories that really form an American identity. A lot of 
them are these Western stories. You get these Clint Eastwood kinds of characters. 
And that becomes a sort of mythology of like the self -made, like, take care of 
yourself kind o f guy. There's the American Dream kind of entrepreneurial myth. I 
don't mean myth in that it's not true. It's just like story that defines who you are.  
Tim: This is how sociologist uses the word myth. Regardless of whether it's anchored in 
historical event s, or not, a mythical myth or historical myth function in the same way.  
Jon: Maybe there's a better word that doesn't need this kind of — 
Tim: Yeah, it's a good word. When you're saying that for America, I think even both of 
those are rooted in an older one , which is like the liberation freedom narrative. 
Freedom from the British rule.  
Jon: Yeah, we celebrate that.  
Tim: So it' we've carved out who we are in this new place. We won't tolerate this 
oppression of these institutions from our past, the self -made reality that assumes 
freedom and liberty of the individual and that kind of thing. These are core 
narratives in American culture.  
Jon: When we think of myths, we think of what Greek people told each other back in - 
2000Bc? I don't know, about Zeus and dif ferent things. And yeah, those were myths 
that shaped their identity. But then there are myths that shape our identity.  
 Then there's also practices that we have, these kind of almost liturgical practices of 
like...I guess this doesn't happen as much anymore, but growing up for me was like 
going to the mall. It's like a liturgy almost. It becomes the temple and it's where yo u 
gather, and it's all around.  
Tim: And the story is?  
Jon: And the story is about consumption and about identity of what you're wearing and 
who you are around. So that becomes part of the mythos.  
Tim: One of the most important sociologists of the 20th cen tury was a guy named Peter 
Berger. His most significant book was called "The Social Construction of Reality." 
Then his follow up volume was called "The Sacred Canopy."  
 In both of these books, he reshaped the whole study of anthropology and human 
culture,  and so on. His basic point was the story of human civilization...First of all, it's 
the claim that he made that no human experiences reality in some kind of pure form, E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
13 
 but that every human is already born into a particular interpretation of the world 
through thousand forms of media and socialization and family and so on.  
 It's like this metaphor that I found helpful of the fish swimming in water. So the 
tropical fish who by nature has been shaped as a being to inhabit warm, shallow 
waters among a reef, an d then a shark because it inhabits the deep, cold, cold, dark 
waters, they have no framework.  
 If you were to ask them, "Oh, how do you like these warm, shallow waters? What's 
your opinion about the deep waters out there?" Of course, the tropical fish is like, 
"What water? What do you mean? What is water? What do you mean shallow?” 
That's just reality.  
 His point was, that's exactly how human cultures are. But paradoxically, humans 
create those environments. So we are both the creators of those environmen ts and 
we are also created by them.  
Jon: And we have the intelligence to then step back and talk about them in a meta kind 
of way.  
Tim: It's really interesting. "The Sacred Canopy" was about how religious communities do 
this for people. Anyway, as this in teresting process that he talks about how it's this 
constant replaying cycle of humans...he calls the externalization where we create 
something to help shape our environment. Like create the mall, that's a human 
creation right within recent history.  
 But then because objectification that this institution, he calls it, hardens, and then 
people just begin to take it for granted. Then within a few generations, the mall isn't 
something humans created. It's now something that's creating human.  
Jon: Interesting.  
Tim: This is as fascinating. So every human's inhabiting the world by already being 
created with some vision of who we are, the story we're in. And so, how does this 
relate to the public reading of Scripture? The public reading of scripture in t he story 
of the Bible is completely wrapped up with this sense of forming identity.  
Jon: It's supposed to be that thing that forms you. It's like when the mall has been 
around so long, and you become a part of it, it's now forming your identity just by 
participating in the exercise of going to it. That's reading the Scriptures.  
Tim: It acts on you. And that's exactly the role that the scriptures have played throughout 
their history. That's why they came into existence was to retell the story of what God E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
14 
 has done to save and redeem the people, and then to invite those people into a 
covenant relationship into a new way of life.  
 The question is, how do you sustain that way of life when it's not the norm? That's 
precisely what the role of this scriptures are,  and it's why the public reading aloud of 
the Scriptures has played such an important role throughout Jewish and Christian 
history.  
 There's something that happens there that's intangible. When you have one verse 
up on a screen and a sermon is given, that  could be a very powerful way of reflecting 
on a biblical truth in a depth that you've never experienced it. But there's also 
something about hearing the whole story of the Exodus from chapter 1 chapter 15 
read aloud to you. It raises all these crazy quest ions. But you walk away challenged 
with a view of the world. And it gets you thinking like, "Oh, yeah, who's is really in 
control around here? God or Pharaoh?"  
 I think I told you this story of Roman. He watched The Bible Project video on Part 
one. He and  I gotten some conflict, I was asking him to do something, like come to 
dinner and put his Legos away and he didn't want to. He's five he got really ticked 
off.  
 It escalated to the point of essentially, like, "Don't tell me what to do." And I was like, 
"Buddy, there are sometimes where I just need you to do what I'm asking you to do." 
Then he brought Jesus into it. He got angry with me. As way of dissing me, he said, 
"I want you to be out of my family."  
Jon: Paxton says it too.  
Tim: Then he said, "I'm g oing to tell Jesus what to do. I'm going to kill Jesus. I want to be 
like Herod."  
Jon: Wow. He's taking control.  
Tim: He's being honest. He's being honest but he's using the biblical story to express 
what he feels. And he can tell this is a moment where I don't want to follow Jesus. I 
want to tell him what to do. In fact, I want to eliminate any opposition to my will. 
And Herod is what came to his mind.  
Jon: It becomes the language that we use to describe our experience.  
Tim: Totally.  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
15 
 Jon: And that's another beautiful thing, then, is that as a community, you have a common 
set of ideas and images, and pictures to express yourself and to interpret things. It 
bonds you too as well.  
Tim: I mean, I wasn't pleased with how he was treating me in that moment so we had to 
work through the consequences of his words and behavior.  
Jon: But imagine what he does that someday because of some profound truth or a 
moment of expressing his gratitude for something and he's using the biblical 
imagination to express it?  
Tim: Correct. I didn't teach him. We just read the story of Luke at dinner during the 
Christmas season and he watched the Lu ke video. Now that's the framework for 
helping him understand his experience.  
Jon: That insight by - what's his name? Burger?  
Tim:  Peter Burger.  
Jon: ...that we both create these structures and then the structures create us is such a 
great insight when i t comes to how we're going to live our lives. I feel like the people 
I read as outside of Christianity, who are talking about business and different things, 
startup culture, entrepreneurial culture, a lot of it is just about habits and psyche and 
things to  just make yourself a better person - more productive, happier, and all 
these different things. A lot of self -help kind of stuff.  
 Just that insight of when you create structure in your life, that structure is then going 
to recreate you on anything and th en specifically thinking of it as why I want to 
follow Jesus, then putting structure in your life where you listen to the Bible being 
read is going to create who you are.  
Tim: It's one piece of a larger set of habits that historically played a really impor tant role 
in shaping God's people.  
Jon: The Lord's Supper being another one.  
Tim: Then here we go out into the whole Christian spiritual tradition. It's really amazing in 
orthodox, Catholic and Protestant expressions of spiritual practices of what a 
hosp itality and generosity of silence and solitude of having building these rhythms 
in your life that sustain a healthy follower of Jesus for over the long haul. Historically, 
hearing the scriptures read aloud has this intangible effect on the human 
imaginatio n. E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?

 Jon: It's basically the saying, "You are what you eat," right?  
Tim: Yeah. Or you are what you listen.  
Jon: Yeah, you become what you listen to.  
Tim: That's a fairly simple and profound way of putting it.  
[00:34:36]  
Tim: A number of years ago, there's  one of the few rock star theologians living today who 
now an outside of nerdy theology circles, a guy named NT Wright wrote this really 
interesting essay called "How is the Bible Authoritative." He begins by saying, "The 
Bible is fundamentally a long narr ative, not a law book. And what does it mean for a 
long narrative have to be a divine authority in your life."  
 In the conclusion of the essay, he has this great statement. He says, "This I think is 
one of the reasons why God has given us so much story, s o much narrative in 
Scripture because story authority is the authority that really works because stories 
determine how we see ourselves, others, and the world, and how we experience 
God.  
 If you throw a rulebook at someone's head or offer them a list of do ctrines, they can 
duck or avoid it or simply disagree in one go away. But you tell them a story, you 
invite them into a community of people living by that story, and you're inviting them 
into a different world, you invite them to share a whole new worldvie w. 
 When someone enters into the Gospel story and finds how compelling it is, it begins 
to quietly shatter that worldview that they were in beforehand. Then there's no 
telling what can happen when God Himself breathes new lives and new worlds into 
being th rough His Word." It's kind of combining this Peter Berger observation with 
this ancient practice of scripture reading and the story of the gospel.  
 There's actually a really formative essays for me many, many years ago, where I 
resonated deeply with that because that was my experience. Even if going to this 
outreach ministry, the skateboarders and just hearing the stories of Jesus talked 
about or read aloud, the teachings, they quietly worked on me for year.  
Jon: Yeah, they are quietly working on you.   
Tim: Just like the story of Luke has been quietly working on my son's imagination.  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
17 
 Jon: I think that perspective is what was lost for me. What I think I picked up on being 
lost in my tradition was the way we did sermons and lessons and everything, it's 
always about a very quick razor sharp, "Here's what's you got to believe, and do it, 
make the decision make the change."  
 It's very decisive, very quick instead of the slow burn of it forming your imagination 
slowly and appreciating that. It still would happe n that way but there was no space 
to just let that be and to appreciate that. It was always about what's the next very 
decisive doctrine or application.  
 I wrote an essay about how story is powerful and the metaphor that came to mind 
was the difference be tween a knife and a sun. A knife is sharp and decisive and you 
can really clearly articulate something or systematize something quickly.  
 But the power of a sun it's very different. Slowly it takes millions of years to form, but 
once it gets heated up, it  gets so hot and radiate and it just starts to affect 
everything. Then it has its own gravity that everything gets attracted to it. It's a 
different kind of power. It's not fast and it's not so decisive, but it's much more 
powerful in a way.  
Tim: It's mor e permeating.  
Jon: The energy is permeating. It also has a gravitational force that pulls things to itself. 
The same way a good story, it creates a world where everything gets pulled into that 
way of looking at things.  
Tim: It gives you this framework that you cannot fit all your experiences into this 
framework.  
Jon: I could quickly give you a bunch of doctrines or rules and it's quick, it's decisive, it 
might make a change right now. But if it hasn't really like formed your  imagination 
and your value and your identity — 
Tim: Theologian James Smith, "Desiring the Kingdom," then he wrote another book called 
"You Are What You Love" more recently, his whole point is that Christian discipleship 
is about taking an active role in sh aping what you love.  
 He focuses not just on the imagination, but on your affections - what you desire, 
what you want, what you want out of life, what gets you most excited, what you'll 
make sacrifices for those. You do this for things that you love. And he thinks a 
Christian discipleship is about creating environments and communities that through 
habits begin reshaping what we love.  E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
18 
 Jon: There are Christian traditions that do that well, I'm sure.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. Transcends, the Sunday gathering. The Sunday gathering can play a 
role, but it's just one role in a much larger way of life. The scriptures have a huge 
role to play in that too.  
Jon: It's freeing for me to value that because the measurement of success is a lot more 
obscured. Like, when the sun  is being successful? It's like, you know when a knife has 
been working well and it's made a good cut or something. But a sun is just you get 
all these trillions and trillions of these particles coming together and then as it gets 
so packed in, it ignites,  and it turns into a new...But just this slow formation of your 
affections, your imagination. It's harder to measure.  
Tim: To bring back to something earlier, in this case, it changes the role of the Scriptures 
from being this thing that we act upon to som ething that acts upon us. You have to 
read it but then metaphorically speaking, it also is reading you right and you find 
yourself addressed by this word, this ancient word. And it's why - this is true to my 
own experience - when the scriptures are read al oud, when I'm with a gathering of 
followers of Jesus, I'm more compelled on a personal level than when I'm sitting by 
myself reading. That's just my experience.  
 When I'm by myself, I'm compelled in a different way. It's usually very different. But 
there's  something about standing or sitting next to a bunch of other people in my 
community, and I'm like, "We're trying to follow Jesus together." It actually makes it 
more believable to me. Because when you're by yourself - at least this is kind of our 
inner sk eptics speaking - but you’re like, "Okay, that's really challenging. Well, God 
did that and that story or what?" It's kind of weird, like the Bible's weird. But then 
when we're a group together we're like, "Yeah, this is our story and we're going to 
live b y the story.  
 The church is creation of an environment that then begins to create us. I find the 
Christian worldview more believable when I'm with other Christians. And the 
scriptures play a role in that and that's important, I think, to recognize.  
Jon: I'm imagining someone really skeptical listening to this conversation and going, 
"Well, it sounds like what you're talking about is just brainwashing?" I guess you 
have to start with, "Are you going to follow Jesus and you believe that the Bible has 
some so rt of divine authority in your life?" You kind of have to get there first before 
you can say that is important to let it work on you.  
Tim: But even underneath that it is a form of identity formation called brainwashing. But 
the point is, is that the person  poking holes in that is themselves exposing E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
19 
 themselves constantly to a different form of brainwashing of just a different story 
about the world. Of course, the question is, which of those stories offers a better 
account of the human experience and of real ity? You can use uncharitable terms like 
brainwashing, but it's the social construction of reality which is just — 
Jon: And it happens with everything.  
Tim: It happens with everything. The modern Western story is also a construction of 
reality.  
Jon: I really loved about that book "Sapiens." I think I brought up before, is guy who 
wrote that...his name's escaping me. He talks about how many of our normal cultural 
practices are constructs of nothing but money. Money doesn't actually exist. Like 
what is money?  
Tim: Sure, sure. It's a construct.  
Jon: It's a total construct. We just all believe in it, but it's make -believe.  
Tim: Perceived value.  
Jon: It's absolute make -believe.  
Tim: Abstract perceived believe.  
Jon: And we're totally fine with it. So we' ve been brainwashed. It's a belief that it's 
valuable. Same thing with democracy or different things. It's like — 
Tim: Or a social position like social capital where I have achieved these credentials, or I 
had this position and now there's a value and a wei ght and an authority that I can 
use to my benefit or whatever.  
Jon: These are all based off of essentially the myths that we believe in — 
Tim: About what's valuable.  
Jon: About what matters.  
Tim: I just had breakfast with somebody who grew up in South Africa this morning and he 
was talking about veterans, how in South Africa everybody's serves. It's just a part of 
everybody's story there. Like many countries, you get out of high school and you 
serve in the military. But he was talking about when he move d to America that was 
one of the things we noticed was — E2: Is Reading The Bible Together Just a Form of Group Think?  
20 
 Jon: Some people did, some people didn't.  
Tim: Yeah. But how veterans who volunteered it becomes this social honor. Anyway, that's 
a different narrative, a different mythology about military that cre ates value.  
Jon: So the question becomes, what is actually reality? That's the tricky — 
Tim: And you can describe it in terms of Math and chemistry, but even that, itself, is just 
one aspect of reality. So humans by nature - this is Genesis one. Rule the e arth, 
subdue it, create, shape the creation, take the raw potential within it, and then make 
new creation out of it that you will then inhabit.  
Jon: Think about what money as a construct has done to then shape us as people. If you 
go back to the Burger ins ight, we've created this thing that didn't exist and now it 
works on us, and it shapes us. All to say reading scripture aloud as identity 
formation, the work you have to do is show up and then let it work on you.  
Tim: That's right. You can put a lot of en ergy into a church worship gathering and 
architecting that to bring people to an encounter with Jesus through the scriptures 
and the bread and the cup, but there's another way that you can do in addition 
that's much simpler. And that's what we're intereste d in.

project possible. So thank you.  
 If you're encouraged to maybe try to bring some people together to do some  
reading of scripture in a group, we'd love to know how it goes. Remember, you 
don't have to do a sermon, it doesn't even have to be sharing time, just get some 
people together and read through a book of the Bible - it could be a short one, to 
begin with - and let the slow burn of those words work on your hearts and minds.  
 We love to hear stories. If you do it, you can email us at
