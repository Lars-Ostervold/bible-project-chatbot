 really just raising money to supercharge next year that's right so everything that we bring in in December is towards our 2020 projects for project got started right back in 2014 and this was your idea and then some other friends influencing you and you're thinking what if we could create Animation Studio make awesome video content and give it away here's the list as we've been able average monthly supporter for the bottle project gives around $20 a month right and we don't rely on some big
 give grants that's right yeah it's all just kind of listener viewer supported with Incredible yeah so we've just been able to grow the team as support his ground and it's been an amazing amazing journey and this last year we I mean we've passed we haven't passed my original list of videos but my original number for the idea how do you have a number for videos from the original Les we're still knocking out but we've added to the list that's right we have over 140 videos now on a YouTube channel yeah and we're going to put out another 15 and 20 20 finishing off season 6 and then starting season 77 we sure have him yeah that's exciting
 what's the NS podcast I mean we've been having conversations now with microphone on a strange thing that's really strange a lot of people listen to this podcast and on iTunes to know many things but on iTunes it's number 318 religion yes yeah we're right behind Oprah and Joel Osteen how it is it to the people can like Phillip Stadium I told her yeah that's crazy it is and then two guys from Portland talking about the physical theology one guy who knows a lot about the Hebrew Bible and another guy who just constantly try to keep up I would make a great show but yeah yeah there you go in the world somehow the Bible project podcast I'll gets listen to so that blows us away we're having these conversations anyways yeah yeah and it's a privilege to be able to have them that's what I we get to have them because people give us more
 need to make cartoons on the internet make beautiful animations explain things have been able to really take a deep dive into some new kind of initiatives for the Bible project right so we've been talking about this for a while classroom year-and-a-half ago on the podcast and got applications lots of you applied we film five classes so far correct and it's been a lot of fun so we did it fusions we did Jonah and when I say we I mean you know and it was a blast we've got Carissa building out a great kind of user experience question yet so it's a full-on interactive thing it's a lot of content and it's going to be some
 thing that you're really going to have to commit to it's like at 14 hours to get through class and it's for people who are teaching Through the Bible it is our target audience but if you're not teaching survival you stole my and then enter the Hebrew Bible is kind of going back and starting from the beginning when I say us I mean you was a great class and then we just filmed a enter the biblical cosmology which is Genesis one class Genesis 1 and I say we and I was an awesome class and under is Adam and Eve Story 3 Man costume. You can go there now but March 1st it'll be a rock and roll and another big part of the Bible project
 really picked up steam in 2019 was our localization project getting all of our videos and libraries beginning to be translated and localized in the language is all over the world yeah we had a new team member come on at the beginning of 2019 Allison Martin Allie lies he hired ya few more people she built a team and they're like going to town they're out there they're Twenty-One different languages in production as of right now is the End by the end of the year if you go to the Bible project, languages you can see what we got going yeah that's right you can see what's already in progress and then what slated to start going public can 2020 really exciting you're doing a great job they came up with a really thorough process and are now connecting with dozens of film studios videos lots of language advisors lots of people on the ground in different places
 things happen and if you're part of that listening thank you so much. There's a lot going on there other cool stuff have we were talking about the podcast but one thing we forgot was in 2019 we started doing interviews with Scholars whose books I found helpful for videos we're working on and I got to awkwardly sit in and Matthew Crosman Haley Goranson Jacob Scott McKnight Crispin Fletcher Louis and our very own on our team Krista Quinn and All Star lineup yeah man all stars are out there so the super fun and we will continue to do those as they make sense it's the end of the decade while feels momentous
 you know what's funny is that you're the only person in my life who keeps bringing that up really is it such a big deal no one else but I feel like I don't know what else to say about that thank you John. Oh you know I was going to have those 2020 glasses on yeah that's right yeah you know what year the glasses were great for was 2002 because then you had like that on both sides and in the zeros in the middle symmetry 2020 is also a cemetery I feel like and I said this before the twenties to be wild ride is this John futuristic by the time we have this conversation in the next decade by 2029 rioting right I mean it's going to get weird things going to get weird I guess so but also will be grapes and Bob project
 continue to chug along there's lots of videos we want to make this classroom Initiative for us isn't just about teaching I mean it's a great venue for you Tim to teach Through the Bible but to bring in a few yeah that's right I'm going to add two other teachers to the mix and that's really exciting to find out more about that as time goes on, but I yeah the gold would be five years from now this podcast is like the super deep archive on all kinds of Topics in biblical theology is all kinds of classes about books the Bible from a great lineup of Scholars all for free and lots more videos and even more ideas that we're cooking up and when I say we I mean you so you can we talk about video, Terry's okay let's talk about that well I think it's really exciting yeah so one of the most tactful impacting series The read scriptures
 yes yes because you actually get an overview of the whole book of the Bible and then it really empowers you to go okay I'm going to read this book now and so we were talking with our friends at the YouVersion Bible app who very graciously put our videos and their app and they said about doing videos on chapters of the Bible and you know how many chapters of the Bible there are a lot of videos over a thousand and then you had the idea of what let's just do the greatest hits was just go through and just like the let's do some really great chapters yes and by chapters we don't think of them as chapters because chapters in The Bible they didn't show up till much later and the chapter numbers don't always correspond to the actual literary design of the first page of the Bible at 6 Kruse.
 first creation story ends at Genesis 2 verse 3 units literary units in literary units and it's not very catchy. We also call him video commentary cuz you're really getting in the text yet that's right on that and I think it would be really really great videos cuz they're going to they're just going to have so much pay off for like when I'm reading the Bible yeah I feel like these really cool to see how a theme stretches throughout the whole Bible and it's beautiful then you open up Isaiah and you'd lost that's right but what if there were 66 videos or more for all the major literary units in the book of Isaiah what if one day that would be so awesome and it would be so fun for piloting that new series next year.
 some samples of what would be a video series that would start going through either the greatest hits or we might eventually land on a book and just like work through a whole bunch of other videos Water of Life coming out Tree of Life is coming out yet we're finishing the how to read series and we're going to start a new word stay serious and yes it's 34 versus six and seven most quoted verse in the Bible the most recorded and referenced verse in the Bible by other biblical authors as much as people quote Jeremiah 29 I know the plans I have for you that's called it outside the body has many calendars that you seen that on within the Bible itself is 346 + 7 is brought up 20 more time to favorite verse by biblical authors that's write so if you don't know what those verses are go look him up and then you'll just leave me alone excited
 about a whole series of podcast conversations and videos that will do on those two versus all right we've been bantering long enough yet we're just a really grateful and excited for this next year yeah we are eternally grateful to all of you for your enthusiasm and support for what we're doing we're having the time of our lives and and it's such a privilege to get to work on these projects and to know that so many of your behind us I thank you yes so happy New Year I think it's the thing that people say on the last day of the year happy new deck have a new decade from your friends but at the Bible project
