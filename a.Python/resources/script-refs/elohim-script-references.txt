The Reality of Spiritual Beings 
Jon: When most people think about the story of the Bible, they think of a story 
about God and humans. 
Tim: But remember, we learned that there’s a whole other cast of characters 
that appears throughout the Bible and plays a really important role. 
Jon: Oh right, the spiritual beings: angels, 1 demons, 2 and the like. 3
Tim: Right. And in the Bible, they inhabit the heavenly realm, which is parallel to 
our earthly reality and actually overlaps with it. 4
Jon: Now all of these spiritual beings have their own unique characteristics.
Defining Elohim  
Tim: But here’s what’s fascinating. The biblical authors have one word that can 
refer to all the inhabitants of the spiritual realm. In Old Testament Hebrew 
the word is " elohim ," and in New Testament Greek it’s " theos ." But here’s 
the thing. This word gets translated in lots of different ways, depending on 
which being is referred to—angels, gods with a lowercase “g,” or even God 
with a capital “G.” 5
 Jon: Wait, so one word can refer to any of these beings?
Tim: Yes. It’s because elohim  is a category title. It can designate any spiritual 
being that belongs to the heavenly realm.  
Jon: Okay. A title not a name, like the word “mom.”
Tim: Yeah! Right. The word “mom” can refer to lots of really different kinds of 
people, but they all share in common the same role in a family. And then 
let’s say a group of brothers and sisters are talking and one says, “hey it’s 
Mom's birthday.” They are using the title like it’s a name.
Jon: But it would be clear that they’re referring not to any mom but their mom.00:00–00:25

32:17, Psalm 97:9Yahweh: Elohim of Elohim  
Tim: Yes. And the same goes for the biblical authors. They call their God 
“Yahweh,” which is the name revealed to Moses. 6 But they also sometimes 
refer to him with the category title “ Elohim ,” using it like a name because 
they all know who they’re referring to. 7
Jon: Okay. But don’t the biblical authors think that Yahweh is in a class of his 
own, not like any other?
Tim: They do, which is why they say things like, Yahweh is “the elohim  of 
elohim ,” that is, the chief elohim  among all the others. 8 Or they’ll say, 
“there’s no elohim  beside Yahweh,” 9 meaning no other spiritual being 
compares to him because only he is the ruler and creator of all things. 
What About Monotheism?  
Jon: Okay. I’m following. But I thought the Bible taught monotheism, which 
means there’s just one God. 10 
Tim: Well, the biblical authors are claiming that among all the spiritual beings 
out there, only one is the source and creator of all things, including the 
elohim .11 That’s biblical monotheism, that one elohim,  Yahweh, is above all 
other elohim , that is, the other spiritual beings.
Now with all that said, we are ready to learn more about who these other 
elohim  are and how they fit into the biblical story. 
Credits  
Jon. You just watched a video on elohim , that is, spiritual beings. 
Tim: Now, there’s one fascinating group of elohim  given many titles in the Bible: 
the host of heaven, the sons of God, or even the divine council. And that’s 
who we’re going to look at next.01:21–01:57
