  1Introduction
Carissa:  “Praise the name of Yahweh, for he has 
lifted up the horn of his people.” 1
Jon: Okay, so what’s the deal with this horn? And why is God lifting it up?
Carissa:  Great questions! These words come from the climactic 
conclusion of Psalm 148 in the Bible. Let’s check it out!
The Story of the Psalms
Carissa:  First, let’s get our bearings. The Psalms scroll is a large 
collection of poems in the Hebrew Bible. There are 150 poems, 
or what we call psalms, which are arranged to tell a story.
Jon: The Psalms tell a story?
Carissa:  Yeah. It begins with the promise of a coming king who will 
bring victory for Israel.2 And it continues to tell the story of 
how God rescues David from his affliction and raises him 
up as king.3 But then Israel falls to enemy nations, and the 
people are left without a king and without a home.4
Jon: So they need a king greater than David.
Carissa:  Right. And so the Psalms then explore how Israel renews their 
trust in Yahweh as their King,5 and that he will bring about his 
Kingdom through a future messianic King from the line of David.6
Jon: Great—the story of the Psalms.
The Meaning of Hallelujah
Carissa:  Now the last five poems form the conclusion to the 
entire story, and they are all praise songs. 
Jon: And this is where we find Psalm 148—right in 
the middle of these final five poems.Visual Commentary: Psalm 148

01:02-02:11  2Carissa:  Psalm 148, like all these five poems, begins and 
ends in the same way: Praise Yah! 
Jon: Praise Yah. That must be short for Yahweh, the 
name that God revealed to Moses. 
Carissa:  Right! And this line is usually translated “praise 
the LORD,” but in Hebrew it’s “hallelu-Yah.”
Jon: Hallelujah! 
Carissa:  Sounds familiar, right?! Now today, when people sing the 
word hallelujah, they usually use it as a way to praise God. 
Jon: (singing tune of Handel’s Messiah) Hallelujah!
Carissa:  But in Hebrew, hallelujah is not something you say 
to God. It’s something you say to other people 
when you invite them to praise God. 
Jon: So, hallelujah means, “Hey, you over there, you should praise the Lord.”  
Carissa:  Exactly. Psalm 148 is a call for all the creatures in two 
realms to praise Yahweh—the realm of the sky and the 
realm of the land and everything that fills them.
Jon: “The sky and the land.” That sounds like the opening line of the 
Bible. “In the beginning, God created the sky and the land.” 7
Carissa:  Exactly! This psalm is summoning the entire cosmos 
and everything in it to praise their Creator. 
A Call to the Sky
Carissa:  It begins with a call to the sky.
Jon: “Praise Yahweh from the skies;
praise him in the heights.” 8
Carissa:  And who is in the sky?
Jon: “Praise him all his messengers.” 9
Carissa:  That’s the word often translated “angels.”
Jon: “Praise him all his hosts. Praise him, the sun and the 
moon; praise him stars of light. Praise him skies of 
skies and the waters that are above the skies.” 1002:12-03:02

Jon: The skies above.
Carissa:  And they surround the inhabitants of the sky in the middle. 
Jon: Ah yes! The messengers and hosts—sun and moon and stars.
Carissa:  And then we’re told why the skies should praise Yahweh.
Jon: “Let them praise the name of Yahweh, for he commanded 
and they were created, and he established them forever 
and ever; a decree he gave and it will not pass.” 11
Carissa:  This is about the pathways of the stars, which don’t change. 
Every night they dance the same dance all by God’s command. 
A Call to the Land and Creatures
Carissa:  Now, after this, the second realm is called to praise 
Yahweh—everything below the skies.
Jon: “Praise Yahweh from the land.” 12
Carissa:  And we get a list of things on the land that, while 
terrifying, are ultimately under God’s authority.
Jon: “Sea monsters and deep, fire and hail, snow and smoke 
stormy wind, doing his word.” 13 So wait? These dangerous 
chaos creatures are following God’s command? 
Carissa:  Well, remember that in Genesis 1, the pre-creation state is depicted 
as a dark, stormy ocean.14 And as God creates light, he doesn’t 
get rid of the darkness. Rather, he contains it and separates 
it from the light.15 In the same way, God doesn’t eliminate the 
stormy ocean or the monsters in it, but he does confine them to 
the realm of the sea.16 In the Bible, chaos and disorder are limited 
and kept at bay by God’s powerful word. And because God is 
so much greater, even they are summoned to praise him. 
Jon: Got it. Now, the next things called to praise Yahwweh are: “Mountains 
and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars.” 17 But how does a tree praise God?
Carissa:  Yeah! God designed trees to stand tall and grow, to 
reproduce and bear fruit. When creation—even a tree—
fulfills its purpose, it’s an act of praise and worship. 12. Psalm 148:7

creeping things and winged birds.” 18
Carissa:  We should recognize this list from Genesis chapter one.19
Jon: And finally: “Kings of the land and all the peoples, 
princes and all the judges of the land, young men and 
also young woman, elders with children.” 20
A Call to Humanity
Carissa:  In other words, every kind of human—from the powerful to the 
weak, old and young, from every nation—everyone on the land is 
called to praise. And just like there was a reason given for the sky 
praise, now we get a reason for why the land should praise Yahweh.
Jon: “Let them praise the name of Yahweh, for exalted is his name alone, his 
majesty, above the land and the skies. He has lifted up the horn of his 
people, the praise of all his loyal ones, of Israel, a people near to him.” 21 
So we finally got here, the horn lifted up by God. What is this all about?
The Horn of Victory for Israel
Carissa:  This is an image of a bull lifting up its horns after winning 
a battle. The raised horn is a common biblical symbol of 
victory, especially of being rescued from oppression. Now, 
in this psalm, notice whose horn is being exalted. 
Jon: The people of Israel. But what victory is God bringing about for them? 
Carissa:  This is where we need to connect Psalm 148 to the larger 
biblical story. It begins in Genesis, with God giving royal 
power to all humanity.22 But humans mess that all up.23 
So God chooses one family, the Israelites, and promises 
that he’ll rescue all humanity through them.24
Jon: But the rest of the Torah and the Prophets show Israel 
surrounded by enemies on the outside, and on the inside, 
they’re corrupted by injustice and violence themselves.
Carissa:  And so to bring victory to the whole world, God 
promises to first bring victory for them.20. Psalm 148:11-12

05:04-06:16  5Jon: To “lift up their horn.”
Carissa:  Right. And remember, the Psalms tell the story of God’s promise to 
raise up a king who will bring victory to Israel and rescue the world. 
Jon: And that’s a great reason for praise. 
Carissa:  It is! Since all creation is going to be rescued by this 
king, it only makes sense that the land and the skies and 
everything in them are summoned to praise Yahweh. 
Jon: Hallelu-Yah!
