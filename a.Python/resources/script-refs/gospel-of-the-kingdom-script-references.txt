The Messenger of Good News in Isaiah
Jon: There’s this beautiful poem it’s in the book of Isaiah.1
Tim: The city of Jerusalem has just been destroyed by Babylon, a great 
kingdom in the north.2  And all these Jewish people, they’ve been sent 
away into exile.3  But a few remained in the city4 , and they’re left wondering 
what happened? Has our God abandoned us?
Jon: Right, because Jerusalem was supposed to be the city where God would 
reign over the world to bring peace and blessing to everyone.5
Tim: Now Isaiah had been saying that Jerusalem’s destruction was a mess 
of Israel’s own making. They had turned away from their God, become 
corrupt, and so their city and their temple were destroyed.6
Jon: Yeah. Everything seems lost.
Tim: But the poem goes on. There is a watchman on the city walls. And far out 
on the hills we see a messenger, and he’s running towards the city. He’s 
running and he’s shouting, “Good news!” And Isaiah says, “How beautiful 
on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news.”7
Jon: Beautiful feet?
Tim: Yes! The feet are beautiful because they’re carrying a beautiful message.
Jon: What’s the message?
Tim: That despite Jerusalem’s destruction, Israel’s God still reigns as king,8  and 
that God himself is going to one day return to this city, take up his throne, 
and bring peace.9
Jon: And the watchmen sing for joy because of the good news that their God 
still reigns.1000:00–01:22

10. Isaiah 52:10New Testament: Good News of a New King
Tim: Now, in the New Testament, we find this same phrase “the good news.” 11 It 
is the Greek word euangelion, and it’s also sometimes translated with the 
word “gospel.”12
Jon: So when Christians say, “Do you believe the Gospel?”, they mean, “Do you 
believe the news?”
Tim: But not just any news. In the Bible, this phrase is always about the 
announcement of the reign of a new king.13 And in the New Testament, the 
Gospels use this phrase to summarize all of Jesus’ teachings. They say he 
went about “proclaiming the good news of God’s Kingdom.”14
Jon: So Jesus saw himself as the messenger bringing the news that God reigns.15
Tim: Yes, but the way that he described God’s reign, it surprised everybody. I 
mean, think. A powerful, successful kingdom, it needs to be strong, able 
to impose its will, able to defeat its enemies. But Jesus said the greatest 
person in God’s Kingdom was the weakest, the one who loves and who 
serves the poor.16 And he said you live under God’s reign when you 
respond to evil by loving your enemies, and forgiving them, and seeking 
peace.17 This is an upside-down Kingdom.
Jon: Now, Jesus also said that this Kingdom was arriving with him.18
Tim: Yeah. So for example, there’s a really interesting story where there is a high 
ranking Roman officer, and he comes to Jesus begging him to heal his 
servant. And he even calls Jesus his “Lord,” acknowledging that Jesus is 
his authority.19  Jesus praises this man for recognizing what no one else yet 
had: that not only was Jesus announcing God’s Kingdom, he was  
the king.20
Jon: And so the word gets out that this Jewish man from Galilee is talking and 
acting like he’s the king of Israel21: He’s appointing twelve disciples, which 
are an image of Israel’s twelve tribes, he’s healing people, forgiving people 
their sins.22
Tim: And all of this so threatened Israel’s leaders that they finally decide to have 
him killed, and Jesus let them.23
A Different Kind of King and Kingdom
Jon: Yeah, which is a weird thing to do if you’re trying to become king.
Tim: That’s right, but for Jesus, this is what had to happen. Jesus saw the sin 
and devastation of his people Israel as just one small part of the entire 
human condition, how all humanity has rebelled against God, resulting in 
the tragedy and devastation of our whole world.24  So how is God going to 
bring his reign over such a world? Jesus believed it would be through an 01:23–03:20

crucifixion is depicted as his enthronement as the King of the Jews.26
Jon: Yeah. He receives a crown; he also receives a robe.
Tim: He’s exalted up, not onto a throne but onto the cross.27
Jon: How beautiful are the feet that bring good news.28
Tim: And the good news now is that Jesus has defeated death and that he 
reigns as King, that he has dealt with our sin and corruption himself, and 
that he’s conquered it with his life and with his love.29
Jon: And then Jesus sent his followers to go out and keep announcing the good 
news of this upside-down Kingdom...30
