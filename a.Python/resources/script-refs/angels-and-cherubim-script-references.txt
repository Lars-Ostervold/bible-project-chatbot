Angels and Cherubim
Script References
Who are the Cherubim? 
Jon: We’ve been talking about spiritual beings in the Bible. And we’ve looked at 
how God is in the heavenly realms but not by himself. There’s a whole staff 
team that the Bible calls the divine council.1  
Tim: But in the Bible, there are still more beings in the spiritual realm like the 
cherubim and also the angels. 
Jon: So let’s talk about them.
Jon: Okay. First, the cherubim. These are chubby little babies with wings, right?
Tim: No. You’ve got to get that image out of your head. Cherubim, or in 
Hebrew, keruvim, they are way more fascinating. They’re described as 
hybrid creatures, a collage of different animals. And every time they do 
appear, they look a little bit different.2   
Jon: That’s intense!
Tim: Yeah. They’re supposed to be intimidating! They stand guard at the 
boundary between Heaven and Earth. If you see them, you know you’re 
entering the presence of the one who is above all and truly other.   
Cherubim in the Bible 
Jon: The first time cherubim show up in the story of the Bible, they are standing 
outside of the garden of Eden.3  
Tim: Right, the garden is God’s temple residence, and so he places these 
spiritual bodyguards at the entrance so that the rebel humans can’t get 
back in and ruin everything.
Jon: But the biblical story is about how God wants us back in his presence. 00:00–00:49
1. Isaiah 6:1-4, 8, 14:11-15
2. Exodus 25; 25:20;
1 Kings 6:27; 8:6-7
Ezekiel 1:6; 10:14; 41:18 
00:50–02:20
3. Genesis 3:24Tim: Yes, exactly. So this is why he chose the people of Israel and gave them 
the gift of a symbolic miniature Eden called the tabernacle, and then later 
the Jerusalem temple. In both of these spaces, cherubim were painted 
and engraved all over, reminding the priests that they’re working in  
God’s presence.4  
Jon: Now, if a priest went into the holy of holies, he would see there a golden 
box called the ark of the covenant, and on it were two cherubim. What’s 
going on here?
Tim: Well, the biblical authors describe the ark as the footstool of God’s throne, 
which the cherubim are carrying. Like we read in Psalm 99, God sits 
enthroned above the cherubim.5  
Jon: But there was no actual throne above the box.
Tim: Right. The Israelites weren’t supposed to represent God with any physical 
image. But when the prophets had visions about this space, they saw 
Yahweh sitting on his throne. 
Jon: Okay, so cherubim guard the sacred space, carry God’s throne, but why 
do they look like animal mashups?
Tim: Well, they’re symbolic representations of all the creatures of the earth 
because they all belong to God. This is why in Isaiah’s vision, all of the 
creatures are singing, “Everything that fills the earth is God’s glory.”6  
Jon: Like a choir. 
Tim: Yeah! Through the cherubim, all creation offers praise to its maker. 
Who are the Angels? 
Jon: Great. That’s the cherubim. Now, let’s talk about angels. I’m way more 
familiar with them— human-like figures with feathery wings.
Tim: No. Wait. Stop. Angels in the Bible don’t have wings.
Jon: What? No wings?
Tim: No angel wings. In fact, angels are often mistaken for people because they 
look like us, just a bit more impressive.7  
Jon: But the cherubim have wings. 
The Purpose of Angels 
Tim: Yeah, and the angels are different because they have a different purpose.
Jon: Okay, which is?
Tim:  Well, humans can’t just march into God’s realm, so God will reach out to 
us, and he often does so through these spiritual ambassadors.4. Exodus 25:17-22; 
26:1,31; 1 Kings 6:23-
28, 29
5. Psalm 99:1; 88:1;
1 Samuel 4:4;
2 Samuel 6:2
6. Isaiah 6:3
02:21–02:41
7. Genesis 18:1-2, 22
02:42–04:05Jon: So angels are like spiritual messengers.
Tim: Yeah. In fact, that’s what the word angel means, a messenger.8  
Jon: Right. This happens a lot in the Bible, like the angel who tells Mary she’s 
pregnant with Jesus.9  
Tim: Yeah. And then the other main role of angels is to perform missions on 
God’s behalf.10   
Jon: Sometimes they rescue people from danger, like when Peter is released from 
prison. And there are some really cool angels, like Michael and Gabriel.11 
Tim: Yeah. The name Gabriel means “God is my power,” and Michael means 
“Who is like God?” But also notice these names point to God not to the 
angels. Like humans, the angels are images of God’s presence and power. 
Jon: But still, how cool would it be to meet an angel? 
Tim: Yeah, and maybe you will, and maybe you already have! But no one in the 
Bible is ever encouraged to go looking for angels. And when angels do 
show up, people are usually puzzled or freaked out. 
Jon: So angels are really awesome, but they play a supporting role in the Bible.
Tim: Yes, because God’s ultimate purpose is to bring humans back into his 
presence in a reunited Heaven and Earth. And in the meantime, he uses 
angels to guide and to serve his people.
