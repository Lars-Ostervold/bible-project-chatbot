Word Study: Euangelion / Gospel 
Script References
Introduction  
If you know any Christians, or if you happen to be one, you’ve probably 
heard the word "gospel" as a kind of summary of Christian belief, 
connected to phrases like “God loves you” or “Jesus died for your sins.” 
But over time, religious words like "gospel" can lose their power and 
meaning by becoming too familiar. So let’s take a moment to rediscover 
what this important word "gospel" meant to the people who wrote the 
Bible. 
“Gospel” translates the Old Testament Hebrew verb bisser  and the noun 
besorah . The Greek New Testament equivalent is euangelion , which is a 
compound word. Eu means "good," and angelion  means "announcement." 
All of these words mean “good news,” but what kind of news?
Gospel in the Old Testament  
Well in Hebrew, bisser  is what we might call national news or a royal 
announcement. Like when King David hears a messenger bisser  that 
his army was victorious in battle, 1 that means he still rules on his throne 
over the people of Israel. And after David dies, his throne is passed onto 
Solomon, his son. And when he was inaugurated as king in Jerusalem, 
a herald spreads the besorah  that a new ruler is in charge. 2 But after 
Solomon’s death came a bunch of “bad news” kings, whose corruption led 
their nation into self-destruction. 3
This is why the prophet Isaiah announced the good news that one day the 
God of Israel would come as the cosmic King to confront all corrupt and 
violent kingdoms and restore his rule over all nations. 400:00–00:41

4. Isaiah 52:7Jesus’ Gospel  
And so when Jesus of Nazareth hit the public stage, he continued Isaiah’s 
gospel when he went around announcing the euangelion  of God’s 
Kingdom. 5 Jesus claimed that God was restoring his reign over his people 
Israel and over all nations and he was the one bringing it all about. 
Now, the euangelion  about a new king in charge means a new way of life. 
Jesus said that living in God’s Kingdom meant following him by putting 
down the sword and seeking peace through radical forgiveness and 
generosity, even towards your enemies. 6 
His good news required people to make a decision. 7 This is why Jesus took 
his euangelion  to Jerusalem to confront the corrupt and violent kingdoms 
of his day. 8 But he challenged them in a surprising way—with the power of 
God’s generous love. 9 
As Jesus was being executed by his enemies, he received his crown and 
was mocked as a fake king, 10 but he displayed true royal authority by 
forgiving his tormentors. 11 Jesus was the one in charge that day, giving his 
life for the sins of others. 12 And then a few days later, everything changed. 13
Jesus rose from the dead as the true King, whose love is stronger than 
death. He appeared to hundreds of his followers 14 and told them to spread 
the euangelion  that all authority in Heaven and Earth now belongs to him. 15 
Jesus’ Followers Respond to the Gospel  
And they did share this good news all over the ancient world. They did it 
by writing the four accounts of Jesus’ life that are the Gospel. That is, they 
tell the story of how Jesus brought God’s Kingdom, how he lived for others 
and died for their sins, and then was raised from the dead. 16
Jesus’ followers also shared the good news by simply talking about it. This 
is why Peter and Paul, 17 or Priscilla and Aquila, 18 traveled all around sharing 
the royal announcement. While it might look like the rulers of our world 
are in charge and can do whatever they want, the good news is that the 
crucified and risen Jesus is the true Lord of the world, the real King of all 
creation. 19 
And in Jesus’ Kingdom, things are different. It’s where the real leaders 
are the servants because the last are first and the first go to the back of 
the line. 20 It’s where the hungry are fed and the homeless are welcomed 
because love is the most powerful reality of God’s Kingdom. 21
And this good news is not easy to believe. It actually sounds kind of crazy 
when you first hear it. But something happens when people tell the story 
of Jesus and start living like he really is the King of the world. That’s when 
this Gospel becomes the best news that you’ve ever heard.01:28–02:51
