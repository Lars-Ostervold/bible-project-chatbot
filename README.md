**Currently a work in progress, just updating the README as I go.**
Latest update - beta version is functional here https://bp-chatbot.streamlit.app/. But I'm switching to next.js for the frotend and will update the link when it's ready.

## Model Providers

This template ships with OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` as the default. However, thanks to the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), or using [LangChain](https://js.langchain.com) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-title=Next.js+Chat&demo-description=A+full-featured%2C+hackable+Next.js+AI+chatbot+built+by+Vercel+Labs&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai%2F&demo-image=%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fe5382hct74si%2F4aVPvWuTmBvzM5cEdRdqeW%2F4234f9baf160f68ffb385a43c3527645%2FCleanShot_2023-06-16_at_17.09.21.png&project-name=Next.js+Chat&repository-name=nextjs-chat&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fai-chatbot&from=templates&skippable-integrations=1&env=OPENAI_API_KEY%2CAUTH_SECRET&envDescription=How+to+get+these+env+vars&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&teamCreateStatus=hidden&stores=[{"type":"kv"}])

## Creating a KV Database Instance

Follow the steps outlined in the [quick start guide](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart#create-a-kv-database) provided by Vercel. This guide will assist you in creating and configuring your KV database instance on Vercel, enabling your application to interact with it.

Remember to update your environment variables (`KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) in the `.env` file with the appropriate credentials provided during the KV database setup.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

# bible-project-chatbot
A chatbot that will answer questions from Bible Project material. Augmented with all podcasts, videos, study notes, and blog posts from Bible Project.

# Instructions
Visit the link and enjoy 😊. I've still got a working list of features/improvements, but open to suggestions. There's a spending cap for the APIs so nobody abuses my bank account 👀.

# Folder Descriptions
## Data Scraping
Files for data scraping are found in ./data-scraping. Podcasts, videos, study notes, and blog posts each have their own scraping function.
Transcripts were generated from .mp3 files by uploading to Google Cloud (see ./data-scraping/upload-to-gcs.py), then using their speech-to-text feature. 
If a transcript existed in .pdf form, it was converted to .txt with ./data-scraping/pdf-to-txt.py.

## Resources
This is where I stored all the files from webscraping. They are in subfolders based on the source. I deleted the audio files from the local repo (stored in Google Cloud) since it was a massive amount of data. There's also an 'images' subfolder for the frontend. The rest of the folders contain .txt files from the data scraping. I'll likely play around with vectorization schemes, so I'm holding on to the text files for now 😊.

## Vectorization
The script in this folder used Langchain_pinecone to vectorize the txt files and upload them to the Pinecone database. It's a 'first thing I got to work' situation and there's likely some tweaking I need to do for the vectorization scheme.

## map-files-to-links
Probably a cleaner way to do this, but the .py files here generate
