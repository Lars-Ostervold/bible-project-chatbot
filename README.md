**Currently a work in progress, just updating the README as I go.**
Latest update - beta version is functional here https://bp-chatbot.streamlit.app/


# bible-project-chatbot
A chatbot that will answer questions from Bible Project material. Augmented with all podcasts, videos, study notes, and blog posts from Bible Project.

# Instructions
Visit the link and enjoy ðŸ˜Š. I've still got a working list of features/improvements, but open to suggestions. There's a spending cap for the APIs so nobody abuses my bank account ðŸ‘€.

# Folder Descriptions
## Data Scraping
Files for data scraping are found in ./data-scraping. Podcasts, videos, study notes, and blog posts each have their own scraping function.
Transcripts were generated from .mp3 files by uploading to Google Cloud (see ./data-scraping/upload-to-gcs.py), then using their speech-to-text feature. 
If a transcript existed in .pdf form, it was converted to .txt with ./data-scraping/pdf-to-txt.py.

## Resources
This is where I stored all the files from webscraping. They are in subfolders based on the source. I deleted the audio files from the local repo (stored in Google Cloud) since it was a massive amount of data. There's also an 'images' subfolder for the frontend. The rest of the folders contain .txt files from the data scraping. I'll likely play around with vectorization schemes, so I'm holding on to the text files for now ðŸ˜Š.

## Vectorization
The script in this folder used Langchain_pinecone to vectorize the txt files and upload them to the Pinecone database. It's a 'first thing I got to work' situation and there's likely some tweaking I need to do for the vectorization scheme.

## map-files-to-links
Probably a cleaner way to do this, but the .py files here generate a JSON file that maps the name of the .txt files I generated to the URL and Title of the content. This is what lets me print the 'further reading' bit in the chatbot. See readme in map-files-to-links folder for more details.
