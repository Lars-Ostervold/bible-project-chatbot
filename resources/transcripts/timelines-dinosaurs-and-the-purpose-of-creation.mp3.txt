Asian we are going to look at the questions from the cosmology series yes that just released now that just released in real time for those of you listening along the series of conversations has an interesting backstory and two and a half years ago over to a little over two I think so what happened we were going to do six or seven theme videos and put them all together in this creation theme video series and the very first video is going to be on Ancient cosmology and I don't remember what other ones were in there except to say that four of the six or seven midlife in the form of independent seen videos they only meant will you release those conversations so those were Tree of Life Tree of Life Water of Life
 which had no podcast series connected to it that's why there's water, so that's why it has a bunch of water stations with a bunch of stuff that is edited out so that y'all don't have to sit through it was when realize though we shouldn't make a 7-part series let's just make 4 themed videos who got the Water of Life second third one was the Sabbath Sabbath and then the 4th one was Temple those are all really great thing videos and they have really great podcast serial conversation serious conversations about the ancient cultural context of the cosmology of Genesis 1 and Babylonian Egyptian cosmology is have we thought we were going to try to make a video about that and then we just decided the Strategic thing for us to do and so those conversations sat on the digital shelf for a couple years and then we thought you know
 conversation and so we dusted him off at the room up and then realized some Water of Life stuff was in there what a pleasant surprise and it seems like people really enjoyed thinking about ancient cosmology I think for the video audience is a little off which is helping people dance the Bible as a unified story at least Jesus and you don't need to know about age of cosmology I don't have to but it's definitely a fascinating rabbit hole that can enrich one's understanding of the creation stories in the Bible you know what one other quick thing about the backstory to that Series so I think in the podcast series we in those conversations we referenced the theme of water in the Gospel of John and we never actually ever had a full podcast conversation about water in the Gospel of John. There you go so you might have been expecting another episode
 talk about water and gospel John Doe real quick sketch in John Chapter 2 when Jesus storms the temple and you know turns the tables over and the priest of Jerusalem L get in the face about it and he says destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up in three days same as exchange for a new princess
 talking about his body and soul that introduces this motif of Jesus will actually and that's developing from John chapter one that the word became flesh and dwelt too well as a tabernacle Among Us who Jesus is the temple which is an image of eating the place we're having dinner there one so in the Gospel of John going forward then you have this idea introduced the Jesus is the reality that Eden itself is narrative image of and so in John chapter 4 Jesus that the wind claims to be the source of Living Water. It gives eternal life oh yeah so Jesus offers the Samaritan woman Water of Life you know that will never run dry and John to the full story chapter 7 there's a famous line about the one who believes in me his belly will flow with Living Waters and there's a translation challenge there but the images of Jesus providing living water from his own self and we actually go corporate of that into the water
 daddy oh yeah that's right there's an image of Jesus have a larger-than-life Jesus as like a fountain the fountain has more but it's true that scene and then in Climax society as you know gashed open Dear John to text blood and water flowing down from the Temple Mount yeah they are from the mountains so John is very clearly understand the symbolism and the development of the waters from Genesis 1 and 2 and then he's mapping it onto his story about Jesus as the ultimate eating so that we could have talked about that over the course of an hour but it's the water to wine is that part of it to that's his first miracle and John are you sure it is related to a different part of the water imagery connected to purity of the water is in these jars used for ritual
 I need to turn that into a great feast of Eden the wedding Feast connected into some questions then yeah yeah you all set in as always really thoughtful questions that we are excited to interact with self shall we we shall this first question is from Josh Jacobs in Ark it's him and John my name is Josh and I'm a student at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville I've been studying Biblical Hebrew for about a year now and I was wondering how you're able to tease out the nuances and appropriate meanings for some of the words that appear in Genesis 1 like rashid's perrotta home tohu bohu these words that don't necessarily fit our modern concepts of the world especially when it seems like a lot of traditional English translations have chosen to 50s Concepts into a modern framework rather than allowing them to stay with the original authors meant thanks guys
 it is kind of so when you're studying a living language you like Spanish or French easier like what do people mean when somebody takes a living language and you'll pick up what are the living current ranges of meaning of the words and just start using them the trick is even though modern Hebrew is spoken today you know it's very very developed from a Biblical Hebrew talked about this because you lived in Israel and could speak Hebrew sound as my as our landlady often said I sounded like Shakespeare what would come to my mind is biblical theology Biblical Hebrew which sounded like the trick is when you are learning ancient Biblical Hebrew sign up you know I'm four classes you'll get vocabulary cards and the vocabulary car as you know the first ones with the edits and you flip it over and they'll say
 so what any language has to do if you're going to translate is find words that are roughly equivalent in the corresponding language so that's only step one. Is that language is an expression of culture and worldview and so the question about how do you tease out nuances and Biblical Hebrew of words that are really similar but also not similar to our English words you just have to study how the words are used in the meanings of words aren't like magical things that exist in its serial place do you like math it's not like that the meanings of words is determined by how people use the words we both are living with kids with growing vocabulary use words inappropriately but you still know what they mean right where do make up words the other day is strawberry season right now real X June sorry house is full of strawberries cuz we go strawberry picking and
 we made it strawberry waffles with strawberries all over the waffles and he walked over the table and he says those look so tempting that's right so you taking Temptations yes but making it a verb but I knew what he meant even though the word was incorrect meaning is about people using words in context so we just went to my nephew's High School graduation and they were having a hard time saying graduation and they kept saying graduation go to the graduation and I was like it's such a wonderful thing to say gratulations emerging emergent congratulations and graduation to create a new word with a mean thing that is separate from graduation or congratulations congratulations at the graduation words are malleable so you have to study how language users use the word to know it
 and so Joshua asking how do you tease out nuances you just have to study the language and I suppose why I think for some people this feels really fresh to be like oh to home it means something more than just Deepwater the way that a modern would think about it and why isn't our English translations into helping us do that necessary oh well I guess that's not really the purpose of a translation translation just is trying to give you you know an appropriate equivalent and then you got to keep on going but to understand that what is the meaning of you know the abysmal Waters in English and how that differs from the concept of a home in ancient Hebrew that's not what a translation for do you need a a teacher or a commentator for that invitations that are more and I interpretive side where they called it an example to translate the Hebrew word edits as Earth
 yes already put you at a disadvantage in the buy why do some why doesn't translate to do that but I think because in some traditions of English Earth still just means land that's true like we've got a fistful of Earth handful of Earth the meaning of Earth is Shifting that's right I hope that was weird to like talk about on the earth that case I think to translate in the beginning God created the skies and the land helps you Center in what they're actually thinking about yeah that's right so to get just really pointed to your question Josh to rebuild the concepts and meanings of ancient Biblical Hebrew words in this is true for New Testament Greek as well is just studying the words and how they are used in context and rebuilding the definition to word word study skills not just looking the word up in a Biblical Hebrew dictionary but actually learning how to to study all of the occurrences of word and building a metal portrait of its meaning in your mind it's a really important skill if you want to recover the
 play the biblical I first saw the world we're trying to set the table for in the series we have a class coming out on the classroom project on that come out this summer will know there's one out already called heaven on Earth no I'm sorry on what studies like studying the art of Biblical word art of the core class that will come out in July or August this year short class on how to study difficult to class it was super fun so Josh thanks for asking it to hear from Dan in Connecticut hey Tim and John my name is Dan I'm from Hartford Connecticut hey Tim on a recent podcast you mentioned that if someone had a Hebrew Bible and a Hebrew dictionary they can probably understand the text so my question is what is the purpose of studying history and textual interpretation how can the common person reconcile seemingly different hermeneutical ideas of
 people like John sailhamer or John Walton guys thanks so much you rock that was really kind no no Dan you rock a rock I hope he's in a rock band that would be pretty great Dan a great question and just to fill out that reference you're making at the end you referring to to Hebrew Bible scholars both named John both of whom have been hugely influential on me and I send my project was a luminary in Hebrew Bible studies he had a pointed and intentionally provocative way of raising this issue he really believed and he grew up in the era where his kind of circle in biblical studies had really been over influenced by the importance of ancient near Eastern studies and it had really overshadowed studying the literary Artistry and the biblical theological kind of developing ideas throughout the story that you provide want to use kind of offering a corrective and saying you actually don't need
 a lot of this ancient near Eastern historical context to read the Revival you'll have to make that point and that's the point I was trying to get rights because I was actually asking you in a very pointed way of like you know what if we didn't have this and I remember referencing there's a debate going on in undergrad that's right of whether or not you did need it that's right and the person in our college professor Bailey back who is offering a perspective saying you don't need as much as you might think this is related to the question just right before the meaning of words is determined by their usage so if you're reading the Hebrew Bible and you start a page one and if you reading in Hebrew you can build up an internal growing dictionary English to is a lot more work cuz you have to constantly go reference it but it's an English speaker
 this would be the case if you were speaking any other one in Spanish French whatever so you could just get Hebrew Bible Hebrew dictionary and start cranking and if you let the meanings of words Define themselves as the Hebrew Bible develops you would get a lot and if you let your imagination hyperlink things the way you're supposed to see goes through the story The Bible you would be able to track full here the problem that's impossible that I would ever happen because none of us are living speakers of ancient Biblical Hebrew saying is impossible if you went to a deserted island and you had just the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew dictionary why is that impossible it's impossible because anybody doing that is coming in sinking in another language than ancient biblical what is in the idea that he has something another language but I want to then explore these words to help me form a new way of thinking but as you do that
 you will unknowingly without even realizing it import your modern spoken language meanings into these words that you're reading yes but then you do it again and maybe it just continues how to reform itself until a lifetime of that you get closer and closer I think that's the question is what are some other additional tools that can help us get closer faster and faster and can expose the ways that I'm importing modern concept into the Hebrew Bible Old Testament strong well it's slow slow and it's inefficient okay you're right I guess I was being provocative but I'm just saying it's not possible that anybody could do that on the first try no yes on the first try no cuz language is an expression of culture no I didn't know I didn't buy it at the end of your life you may have gotten some more clothes for doing a community of people thousands of years yeah that's right you probably getting really really close
 scholar like John Walton I have found so helpful cuz what is able to say is that they look here's his Biblical Hebrew word here's how it's used notice that it's really different than how are English translation for ya what it means and lo and behold with the Hebrew word means is very similar to other concepts of Creation in Babylon and then Egypt the Fastpass and Fastpass and it's helping see that Biblical Hebrew and typical thought had lots of similarities and differences with the cultures and languages around them actually the chaos dragon is a good example and it's an example of where my thinking has developed since we had those conversations two years ago so when we talked about the chaos dragon and the defeat marduk's defeat Tiamat and then I brought up how Genesis 1 there's no battle the only see Dragon there is in God's ordered yet is it is a creature God makes Genesis 1:21 but then I brought up some 74 which talks about God's plan
 the heads of the sea dragon and it's connected in some way with creation cuz he's as yours is the night yours also is the day and it's about God establishing order and this is where I'm at currently I think it's intentional and important that Genesis one is starting the Hebrew Bible was no conflict narrative the darkness and the chaos waters are a neutral canvas they're not an enemy they're neutral canvas and the only dragging around is no threat in Genesis one after God makes the creatures there does turn out to be a rebel creature in the garden yeah reptile and it tries to usurp God's Authority and humans Authority and all that the seat in there Tiff until God says like a hostility between the seed of the woman and the snake and it's seed going on and you know who's going to come in ultimate showdown between the snake and chose the water will be a battle that will be about a dragon
 so is it goes throughout then the cane there is teaches you that humans by their moral choices can align themselves with the seed of the woman or the seat of snake can become sea snake he builds the first city ham becomes another snake lying through his choices and his descendant bills Babylon oh and then Egypt and pharaoh and Exodus chapter one becomes too shrewd snake who tries to stamp out and enslave God's chosen ones the Blessed Israelites there you get the portrait that the nation's in the empires that Israel suffered under Egypt Babylon Assyria we're taking over by the snake some 74 is about the response to the destruction of the temple by Babylon in the book of Isaiah Rahab we talked about is the Sea Dragon they're referring to Egypt in The Exodus and so what's interesting it's like the marduke battle against him out that thing's been reaper
 in the Hebrew Bible does it talk about God's Victory not over the forces creation but over the forces of rebellion within creation and it's about God's ultimate victory over the snake so it's a good example of how if you only look at ancient near Eastern parallels of the battle with Margaret and Tiamat you won't fully get with the Hebrew Bible is uniquely to do that you need to pull the Dodge on sale Hammer but the understand the broader context you need to pull a John Walton you need both perspectives yes and you both I love that and I but I think part of the thought experiment of can you just do it with a Bible dictionary translation is to say for a normal Christian do you have to become some sort of archaeologist or like historian right and what you're saying is what a great gift that you know it really does help but the other side of it is like actually you can do is just a lot of work to do it
 but even in your own first language just takes a lot of patient re-reading and trying to be self-critical that you aren't importing modern meetings and ideas into old new test which is really tricky you say you need help with the wonderful world of biblical studies and even with that you need help because it is so easy to let your own perspective then all sudden you've see the usage and another engineers in our culture it just becomes a mere real quick Christian swells hi my name is Christian and I'm in Granada Spain but I'm learning through this series is that the ancient Israelite creation narrative is much more about the Y than that it's the purpose of creation being told through the lens of an already-established ancient cosmology to my question is how could that ancient Israelites
 why that ancient purpose of creation be translated a retold now through our current and modern understanding of the cosmos with a cool question asked the question it's more about the Y then about the house I really resonate with that though I do want to also say it is giving an account of how because most was ordered and it's doing it in the categories of an ancient Israelite cosmology through God speaking separating and calling things out of the land plants come out of the land creatures come out of the land and so on so there is a house but that how is based off of a Nation cosmological understand that may be why you're saying that is to an ancient Israelite they would make that distinction but now I just looking back we could tease that out but to them that didn't matter how God separating
 begin calling think wow that was also the wisest also was also the how exactly what we need to do cuz we are in different cultural setting is we need to trade just a distinction between those two and what we can say is different cultures have different imaginative explanations of how the cosmos Works yes and we have one too and we're pretty sure it's right well but it's constantly being developed into a week and there's some things we do not know a lot we don't know this is stuff called Dark Energy yeah so there's where to the chronological snobbery thing because we inhabit a later and a developed view of a cosmos that is informed by really sophisticated tools tools for understanding we mistake it for like we know the how now will we mistake it for we know the how that's what I'm saying and our grandkids you know
 I'm still yeah a lot when I got there they have got it figured cosmology is are always a combination of how and why and that's interesting that now it's hard for us to split those two it's hard to explain why we're living in our own cosmology Generations it will be much easier for them to see that so the question is what are the worldview value claims being made by any cosmology cuz any cosmology when you give an account of how and why something came into existence you're not just talking about the mechanisms that you're talking about what it is and why it's here so these are worldview question does cosmology Zara vehicle for way bigger questions like where are we what kind of place is it the philosophy is the world we inhabit
 the Eternal is it finite and contingent or still arguing about this is it static or is it Dynamic is it a cyclical going it in Eternal Cycles or is it linear going in a sequence for that right there is an ancient debate that spans cultures and times and the Greeks that one thing and that developed and the Jews and the Christians developed a unique contribution based on the Hebrew Bible the history that has history has a trajectory that reality has a beginning point that reality cannot be the basis of its own existence is all reality as we know it contingent but still debating it is yeah but logically that there must be some cause as the famous about the first cause stuff like that and that's exactly right that's what I'm saying is the why Christian being communicated by Genesis one is very much a set of larger claims about the nature of reality so that there is
 personal being who is the ultimate ordering and the one bringing life the one guiding and that there is some sort of linear forward development that's going to culminate in something that's a major claims about the nature of reality that are communicated through this and that humans are Made In His Image yeah that humans are both emerged from the material order but then also have the ability to transcend their Origins and be a part of something that's much more Cosmic and much more Transcendent it's asking can we do this in a fresh way through a new cosmology and it seems like you totally could and it would be a really wonderful project and would be really fun to read so
 I want to watch someone's version of that and I'm sure stuff like that exist that actually really helpful book along these lines so John Waltons the Hebrew Bible scholars already come up he's done work on nothing is Lost World of Genesis 1 and lost world that Amanda is another popular level treatment that I thought was really fun and I came across this by a Biblical scholar Robin Perry called
 call the biblical cosmos A pilgrims Guide to the weird and wonderful world of the Bible and it's a really great introduction to the three tiered world of the Bible the concept of the waters above the waters below the dragon all these things the really fun and I his daughter if I'm remembering correctly his daughters a graphic designer so she did all the artwork in the book is really cool and put it one of his main whole point is that the view and the cosmology of the biblical authors was also developing as the biblical Cannon and collection was developing and so the way that the apostles in the New Testament there are also being informed by developments in Greek and Roman culture and conversations about this and so their language has those accents to it as well and Jewish and Christian views of cosmology developed throughout history and kept changing updating to the Aristotelian and Anakin Revolution and all those Generations were able to still find
 relevance in meaning in the ancient cosmology of the Bible right and translate between them and a bad translation after I think he's getting at exactly that's what it be cool if there was a Carl Sagan die poor and Neil deGrasse Tyson all soaked than translate both be the cosmologists give you a tour of the cosmos but then translating these ideas into it yeah that be awesome and Scholars David their people doing this worked great work if it's synthetic work of like science and cosmology The Works of Alister McGrath scientists and theologians excellent work on Jon polkinghorn who's the physicist and the priest and theologian an excellent work at the Forefront of scientific cosmology and Christian cosmology physical cosmology what's to great names to follow up with next question is from Kayla in Florida
 I really enjoyed the series on Ancient cosmology but it does bring up a certain level of tension for me as someone who grew up in Tradition where Genesis 1 through 3 was taught from a more literal perspective hearing about the Bible's influence from other ancient cosmology causes me to pause and wonder how much of it is quote-unquote true so how should this new understanding read just my approach to these chapters thank you guys so much for all that you do for me to even had a geology class from a professor who really wanted us to understand these as a literal really A New Perspective so the part of what we're trying to say is that there's actually nothing new here what's new is our synthesis of the biblical cosmology and translating it
 harmonizing it with modern cosmological ideas that's the new thing what we're trying to do is recover the ancient understanding of these narratives the way the biblical authors intended them yeah it feels new because it hasn't been the main way these notices have been read in the last couple hundred years in our cultural setting yes in the last couple hundred years there has been a large contingent of Christians who look at Genesis 1 and 2 and thought this must be like the cosmology books that are being written in our era which are like explaining literally this happened and buy literal like in space-time in this happened and then cause of this atom to form which then did this and then Sons form like that like literally happened in the cinema
 and cosmology yes I think we need even a bigger frame us to talk about it so before really the era I mean this has happened in major cosmology revolutions like in the copernican revolution the development of telescopes than Galileo and spinning rock around the Sun not vice-versa especially of the modern Sciences geology paleontology physics and so on and then certainly biology their begin to open this window of information coming in from these fields of a deep deep sense of time in history the reach Way Beyond what anyone had ever imagined up till that point in history Christians and Jews reading the Bible for them the literal meaning it was the way the world was imagined to be so the way the biblical story describe history what's the way it was and there was no other alternate narrative to challenge it but with the growing
 narrative coming out of the scientific disciplines their became this alternate narrative that was very difficult to square this deep sense of time of hundreds thousands and millions of this one does not take that 27 days in your there is backwards from Genesis and you kind of definitive math and so then you have the tension between which is real or what is the literacy rate which one's right and so the literal meaning came to be identified with a harmonization well what if we take the data from The Sciences and because it doesn't correspond to what the biblical chronology or whatever seems to be saying what the literal meaning is is Defuse The cosmology the material realities we are learning about our finances but diffuse it with a Biblical chronology and then that becomes the literal face value meaning
 and so I think the trick is is that the word literal tired of being disconnected from what the biblical authors meant cuz it has had no concept of like photons know where do you live and what if you were talk to her a Biblical author and you would say here's what I mean by literal what happened in space-time yesterday versus what did yesterday mean to you yeah sure send me the distinction between those two things really matter maybe they do as much to you and the way you can tell story but they mean so to me yeah that's fine and then in that case and they're like okay I get it I give it to me by later oh yeah yeah yeah and so I think the point is that the word literal a literal interpretation of the Bible came to be identified with a fusion or a harmonization between the biblical words and these more modern categories from geology and time and so on and so we create this new thing that's never been before that has been identified with the literal mean
 Janice wanted to but it's really rather novel to the last few centuries if you read Augustine is hippos the most influential Christian singers of all time living in the 300s in Northern Africa he wrote a book called the literal interpretation of Genesis 1 and 2 and if you do read it right now you will be like this is not literal and ever had was but for him it was and so it's helping us achieve the literal interpretation what we mean by that in our American context right now is itself a novel entity in the history of interpretation don't try to listen to size at all yeah just what does the Bible say about there's intend to mean and so once we do that we say well okay what words did they use to express what they mean what did they mean by those words and I were to the earlier questions of the meanings of words are always connected the worldview and bigger cultural Concepts and so I think the challenge here here
 at least I've experienced in pastoral settings is that well okay so if the cosmos being created in Genesis one has three levels and there's Waters up there and they're still up there like they were just up there before the flood lights on 104 in Psalms 148 they're up there right now this well I know that that's not how the universe is constructed we're on a sphere and so the Bible is wrong cuz it's not true and so that's where I think we were to the question of what do we even mean like just because a cookbook doesn't read like a New York Times editorial does that mean it's not true know what it means is that's not its purpose you so indifferent Hebrew the word true mean trustworthy or faithful meaning it does what is a different War than literal designed to do this but in our context something being literal and something being true have become interchangeable idea in The Sciences what do you mean oh and aren't we don't mean that exactly
 and Sciences we do and Genesis 12 and modern is the Bible doing science and I think that's the rub and in history and Sciences in history we want to make sure that the literal is also the true in other things we're okay with that not being the case but soon the Bible's doing history and if I was doing science to a modern those to take me to align correct and so if science is diverging from what I'm reading my Bible and what am I going to trust the problem is presented the language of the Bible which was originated from a different culture and time and from a people at a different vision of the construction of the cosmos and then we use those words and concepts for our modern concepts of what light is and the age of the universe its oranges and apples or we need to just let the Bible be an Apple so why do you think he was feeling tension
 because of what of what you described if those are leaner does a Genesis are offering us what I would see on a video camera if I was there or what a scientist would great they're not true where they're not trustworthy as we got a backup and say well but what was what were those narratives designed to communicate and designed to serve the way through the tension is the same instead of last question is this literal ask question is as trustworthy and then when you asked me a question of literal what do you mean by that and if your meaning doesn't align with the Bible's doing be comfortable with that I think will people get really itchy is okay but then Jesus was literally just literally lived after why did he literally rise from the dead and that's important it's super important right it's actually like the foundation of a pulsing to the station that is really important super important
 show at what point if you start to get a little fuzzy on my well certain parts of the Bible are trustworthy even though they might not be litter on the way that you were forcing it to be literal at what point does that break down yeah that's against this is why I thought I would be able to talk about this in a more clear concise way the word literal if we mean by the word literal what the author is designed this text to accomplish your Communicator Paul and the apostles people who wrote the four gospels designed those narratives very clearly to make a claim that this man who was Israel's Messiah God of Israel become human was murdered and buried and hundreds of people encountered him alive from the dead it's fairly obvious that's what they mean they're literally they mean exactly so what are Genesis 1 designed to do they are literally talking about the construction of the cosmos in The Seventh-Day Sabbath cycle the next narrative litter
 talks about the creation of the cosmos as a garden being grounds out of the land and the chronologies are not the same so they have to say what's the literal meaning of Genesis 1 and the Garden of Eden narrative next to each other what is an author's intent to communicate and if what they intended to communicate was a claim about the physical material processes and timelines through which reality came into existence you got some problems cuz it's different timelines it seems like what the author was more concerned about was some other things here and the literal meaning is those and that's what the question before we're about it I think then the way through the tension to is the point then isn't to try to convince someone about any modern cosmology you know whether or not you want to believe the Earth is 6,000 years old and appears older correct where you want to believe that the Earth is billions of your Earth the universe is billions of years old
 yes there we get today what is these two chapters trying to say like what's the point that they're trying to make it doesn't happen to be either of those things that's right it's something else altogether the literal meaning that is meaning intended by the ancient biblical authors stands independently of whatever you're the ones vision of the uniting perspective because you can go in and you can say like hey if you believe the Earth is 6,000 years old that's really important to you that is totally fine that's right but let's not miss some really cool stuff happening at the newest chapters that seemed really important the authors and so the tension almost feels like do we have to have an us-versus-them of like there's not there's like we all can come together regardless of your modern cosmology and see what the what the interview with Joshua's Mommy.
 was out of our normal conversations for me I appreciate it is booked cuz he was saying no matter what your perspectives or convictions are about historical Adam and Eve but we ought to be able to do is read the biblical texts on his sometimes and then lo and behold there is all of the scientific data that just hasn't been brought up yet because of the modern debates and when you integrate those to you get a hypothesis that emerges that could be at home in any of the views about historical their symbolic Adam either so that's why I really appreciated his contribution cuz it was very much in the spirit I think of what we're trying to do in this series 38 that middle ground where we can all come from different positions and just sit at the feet of the biblical authors and try and hear them on their own terms that is here the literal meaning of Genesis 1 do you have that conversation and you bring up all these other ancient near Eastern cosmology and show that it does kind of set it up in 02 someone to feel like what you're telling me I can't believe the Earth is Young you know almost
 feel that way potentially and you don't have to frame the conversation that way you can still get to all the really interesting stuff about the waters and we have Best Buy just looking at the Bible that's right and that in fact that they are next question is an interesting kind of real specific example of a similar question that we just responded to from Kayla this is from Leonardo in Ohio and Michigan are the parabola I'm from Puerto Rico I'm living in Cleveland Ohio I'm taking to Heaven and her class while you having a serious talking about this topic a chance do you guys talk about the different areas where we can see the place before the state of art equation now in the Hebrew Bible thank you for everything yeah that's really interesting question he's taking Heaven Earth class grade class
 you did a wonderful job and a lot of people are wondering like where the dinosaurs fit and the story of the Bible we have this idea of the Jurassic era or you know all these big eras of human history the human history history of the earth and so in the Bible you just get like there's the Wild and waste and then all the sudden there's animals and then humans so like where the dinosaurs cuz the great case study in the conversation we're having connected to Kayla's question earlier so just like the biblical authors had no awareness of quantum physics or photons the creation of light and a one has nothing to do with the creation their physical existence out of photons they've never seen him or heard of them and so it would be inappropriate for us to import our concept of photons into Genesis 1 and play low God's creating photons but without a coat on so similarly these Concepts and awareness that paleontology in geology
 love these Jurassic prehistoric period of these creatures and so on the biblical authors had no awareness they hadn't run into any of these bones and if they had they didn't know how to I wouldn't they didn't construct them and realize like all these things are from it is entirely possible even likely that they came across like dinosaur bones like that I mean the concepts of the Dragon came from somewhere yeah yeah who knows what kind of animals were around animals going extinct more that we have these concepts of dinosaurs that lived during this time and then we go to the Bible and say well the Bible is about the world I live in so where is it that every time that's right and so we take a modern concept of dinosaurs from Jurassic. And then we look within the Biblical timeline for place to swap them gifts and we're doing that apples and oranges things again where I need to let the biblical authors do their thing within their cultural context and cosmology and then we need to let our
 cultural narratives that are growing Dynamic speak their story and we need to bring them into dialogue on the level of those ultimate philosophical questions and so is my conviction right so I know people who love and follow Jesus passionately and they disagree and they think we really do need to integrate those timelines with each other I think the one thing I would just offer is to say but aren't we starting to make the Bible say and mean things that the biblical authors had no concept of and then that case we're not doing good local interpretation got a concept of it but that's about what we were talking about is about how God made these humans the vehicle and made their language and therefore their cultural category than the way their minds work and the way their minds work at the vehicle of what he wanted to say here tonight since I think it's a misguided quest in terms of interpretation of the literal meaning to look for dinosaurs in the Bible because wasn't a part of the concept or tradition of talking about the origins of the cup
 yeah but what you could say we know dinosaurs existed we've seen the remains and then they give all the indications of being unimaginably old to us like really really all the way before that you know people were ever around and so you do have to then go how does that fit into my understanding of God and the cosmos and what can you say yeah the emergence of Life on our planet is like nothing short of a miracle that it's here and that it has survived as long as it has been developed in all these fascinating ways isn't truly remarkable and that we can like no from fossils in the ground like amazing history of Life on our planet and God is apparently very patient very patient but when we're talking about these deep deep periods of time back into the prehistory and so on it's just a different
 example of like you know the origin of galaxies you know and nebula in space gases that gravity pulls together into stars and then Planet since it's very similar mystery it's interesting I know there are many Christians or just deeply suspicious of the Sciences because they think scientists have an agenda that are anti-god and and that has been and is true in some though not all wings of the science the Second Officer like saying sports are bad for the genders and piercings and destructive ways to just say it again soon as Extreme as like science is lying to us about the Earth being around for some people like that all the way to a less extreme
 maybe signs of lying to us about the age of the Earth or about how old is dinosaur bones are too like maybe science is lying to us about what's happening with the climate like there's a musical Troubadours and there's a way of like in one sense were sidestepping that we're saying we don't have to talk about that one another since the question here is saying when you do encounter those kind of things have been what are you do so let's say you encounter and you trust my science enough that you're like okay these animals roam the Earth but I also really trust the Bible so what am I supposed to think about dinosaurs they are part of God's creation for humans ever did in many ways that there's no difference and so here to wear or bigger concepts of what is the Bible in the first place this God is our conviction that's like the Beautiful Mind is reaching out to us
 through the story of the people and threw the authors of these texts but has chosen to accommodate and speak through the language and culture and concepts of the people who wrote these texts and if that's your foundation for understanding what the Bible is then it makes quasars or dinosaurs a very interesting question but they're not relevant to understanding the Bible Bible does it talk about those things last but not least we're going to listen to a question from Jessie and Albuquerque New Mexico this is Jesse Glasgow in Albuquerque New Mexico you have been an immense help to me here's my question about the ancient cosmology series is there any indication that later biblical authors are aware of the discontinuities between Genesis 1 and Genesis to do they see them as a unified whole what about ancient rabbis were early Christians would love to hear your thoughts thanks
 cool I thought we talked about is Genesis 11 Genesis 1:1 through 2:17 are the two out of the deep Abyss in a 7 Day 7 days and humans show up on the sixth day after the animals and then in the second story that starts in Genesis 24/5 the god creates out of the Wilderness and humans are actually created first first before the Anna for the animals and so those are kind of the big differences and it's easy to spot right so wouldn't have any of the other biblical authors been aware of these discrepancies and what did they do with the remaining but it's what we mean by literal is what these texts are designed to communicate so it's a purpose of the text was to give a unified linear sequence it's a very difficult reading experience
 the author and that's what we experienced we experience so then I think that should force us to go back or maybe it's the thing that I'm supposed to get here is not that but another set of ideas so if you begin to compare and contrast repeated words and categories what you get to something more like like think of two paintings of this goes back kind of similar to our conversation with Dan Walton is ministration that he's used before that I like to think of one as like a view of the night sky from a Hubble Space Telescope and then another view like Vincent Van Gogh's starry night to representations of the next of the same reality the night sky they're very different in their surface presentation and what is Genesis 1:1 more like that until they both are giving complimentary portraits of the nature of the cosmos the role of humans and human identity within God's purposes in the cosmos if you look at that
 they really are parallel so for example the role of the spirit the sex is great for an example and I just learned this at a class on a Zeki last week and just hit me like a ton of bricks so Genesis 1 God's spirit is present in the dark Waters in Genesis 1 verse 2 we talked about that and I got the in speaking and Genesis to God's breath is present in that he confuses it into the dirt to make the humans in general has his breath I Breathe Into the dust of the breadth of that was already been formed the dirt but the dirt is not yeah I was about to run the dirt is inert but there isn't until God breathed into it and turns it into in Genesis 1 humanity is male and female already in Genesis there's just a singular human who is split and then you have man and woman so you have these different concepts in Genesis when they're told to be fruitful and multiply that language is not used in Genesis
 it's about the two becoming one flesh. So in the Book of Ezekiel there's a sweet set of three essays or three paragraphs that are all right next to each other the second half a chapter 36 and then Ezekiel 37 has two parts to it and all three of them are meditations on the restoration of Israel from Exile back to a New Jerusalem and each one of them is missing off of different elements in Genesis 1 and 2 and it treats different ideas and words from Genesis 1 and 2 but unifies them so for example in Ezekiel chapter 36 God says he's going to recreate his New Covenant people by putting his room within them putting a spirit within them and then he says he's going to plant a new Garden where they'll be fruit trees multiplying and you like a sweet the trees multiplying so this is all just approved and they will be fruitful
 multiply but that's language not from the eating their two front of the one who is Ezekiel Genesis 1 and 2 as complimentary and he'll use the language of those two Christian stories and blend them together to talk about New Creation he does the same thing in the valley of dry bones he does the same thing and the story after the valley of dry bones 3 talks about he says get two trees and then he says right on them the names of Judah and then Joseph The Divided Brothers provided tribes and then he says I'm going to put them back into that new Eden planted back in 36 and the two will become one and then he says and one King will rain or rule over them so he's taking the two becoming one from the bottom but he's getting the image of God ruling and raining from Genesis one taking once again Concepts from Beau drooling and raining being the image of gods and it's the new David
 the point is this here's an example of later biblical author who sees these two first creation narratives as complimentary portraits referring to the same thing I had I was like wow that's good Ezekiel has brilliant and you can see it continuing on into the early Jewish literature of the second temple in the New Testament they don't seem to have a problem with this one and two having different timelines they just quote and interact with them as if they're complimentary and that was early clue you many years ago like maybe the problems that I have I'm bringing the wrong expectations. Thank you so much for sending in these questions for the cosmology series grey seriously I have to bring us through these are always wonderful questions increasingly increasingly wonderful and up next on the podcast actually is you know we've been doing this podcast for 5 or 6 years or 5 years
 got a new episode every week we haven't missed a week yep every single week and that's not just you and me that's a whole team of people working really hard and put the stuff out there and do you have our teams never really taking a break take a break of sorts and that we're going to for the next five weeks we're going to re-release some of the top podcast from the last five years they are generally are the first episode in the series and there's usually some of our older series because they've been out the longest so they got the most listened yeah they're also ones that we often recorded like on the porch at your house so that it somewhere that sound quality is really different than first audio booths was literally under a stairs so I can just hear people talking and put steps and stuff so we're going to remaster those Andre release those and

 as in the kind of pain that you camping
 did I do this is Chad and I'm from South Australia has heard about Bible project in 2018 when I was helping out Church read through the Bible in a year my favorite thing about Bible project is a commitment to presenting the Bible's big picture story in an approachable and meaningful math as a pasta I often recommend the Bible project to my church Community we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads people to do this with a crowdfunding project by people like me find free videos study notes podcast his classes and more as Bible project.
