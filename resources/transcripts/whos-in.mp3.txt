is John Collins the Bible project we have a few episodes left in this ongoing series exploring the theme of the family of God in the Bible how God created all of humanity as his children how we are all one human family and all of our wonderful diversity however we don't trust each other we don't believe value each other's unique contributions of being God's image and we find ourselves in violent opposition to each other yet division of the Bible is that every tribe tongue a nation will unite to bring their unique gifts together as the image of God it's easy to lose track of this theme in the Bible and one reason is because a large part of the story the Bible is how God shows one family the family of Israel to be called a part from the nation's another calling is to bring blessing to the nation's but they're giving practices to help them be set apart from the nation practices like circumcision kosher food laws and Sabbath observance
 now after Jesus came in to fill the Covenant of God in Israel he asked his disciples to go out and make disciples of all the nations answer the question on the table is
 do the nation's need to follow these Jewish practices being God's family and this wasn't an easy answer to figure out where a part of it over the Millennium old religious ethnic cultural group whose identity has been shaped by a certain set of markers and now I'm being told by the leaders of the new stuff group of our Messianic movement that those markers are not necessary for all of these new people who want to join the family today we're going to look at the dream Peter has and the debate that sprang up among the Disciples of Jesus about how the nation's get folded into the family. Thanks for joining us.
 we talked about the family of God theme in the Bible about I suppose who are God's children who belongs and in God's family who belongs and God's family quick recap God creates all Humanity videos image and I guess another way you can see that is to be his family thinks there's a little rabbit hole in Genesis 5 that answers that that equates being in the image of God is to be the child of God don't care if the call of all humanity and all of our diversity but it is human nature to become tribal to not trust each other too violent to each other and that's Genesis 1 through 11 just the fracturing of the fracturing of the family that God chooses one couple to form a family that will be a chosen family not better than any of those families but chosen for a task which is to bring the blessing back to
 the Nations and this is the story of Israel it's whole story of the Hebrew Bible and it's easy to forget that in a way in the subplot yes that's right big reply which is all of humanity being the image of God how is that going to happen will one family is going to do all sorts of things have a seed and it's a funny biblical term produce a lineage producing lineage in which there will be some rule or a king who will deal with evil who will rule with righteousness there's also going to be a place where God's presence is in all the nations can a stream up and learn from this is the temple is it true someone we have this hope if that's going to happen Jesus comes and we see Jesus saying right off the bat to spell Israelites this is our calling was supposed to be the city on the hill supposed to be the light in the darkness this is
 first thing we've got to we got to do this and here's the ethic and here's what it looks like and he goes and he's got this almost laser-focused on Israel are the people of Israel and making sure that Israel actually can stand up to their calling which is to be the nation that will hang the blessing ultimately Jesus does for Israel Israel couldn't do which is be the faithful Israelite and to be that ruler and the way that he did that is in this is not what the conversations about but the way that he did that was with this backwards just sacrificing himself his allowing his siblings to kill him so I can see how and that was his enthronement of provoking them to kill him outright the whole other thing but after his death and Resurrection was proven to truly be that that King the Messiah seed coming from Israel
 so now in I guess in a sense the vocation of Israel has been solved because Jesus is done it or at least stage 1 of solving the problem which was that Israel's not being obedient and is this fracture he's on his fractured Jesus and saying this is what it looks like and we didn't talk at all about yeah he starts the nucleus of a restored family of Abraham yeah that relates to God according to the New Covenant that Ezekiel in Jeremiah and Isaiah anticipated a new way of relating to their God and the gospels are trying to say that the family of Abraham has been restored the nucleus of it in in the group that Jesus started his focus and the end of the Gospel of Matthew Jesus tell his disciples go out now to all the nations he told them before not to only go to Israel when he had encounters with like at Buckhannon
 women he kind of like give her a hard time I came here for Israel now it's just almost about face where he's going to tell these hounds disciples now go out to all the nations so it's like the fact that it the Israel chapter has been solidify that he's coming done that yet we can now bless the nation's ya shouldn't be a surprise in fact in the gospel of Matthew we saw Candace C bads of like the fact that Jesus is Mission was with leaking out to the nation's even though he was focusing on Israel to know where the part of the story where Israel gets to be the blessing to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs this restored Israel the nucleus is going to expand to include people of all the tribes of Israel from all these different nations and welcome to the book of Acts so the main theme what are the main themes of the book of Acts is the holy spirit is expanding the family of Abraham which is the family of God family of the Messiah and is inviting
 all these different nations in and it create tensions creates challenges that the leaders of this movement have to overcome so let's just focus in will do the same as we did in last episode of Matthew card just touch down at key points here in Acts chapter 1 the Risen Jesus gives instructions what they ask is at this the disciples asked him that hey are you going to restore the Kingdom of Israel now meaning well exactly you just spent 40 days with them we're told speaking about the kingdom of God and so what they're asking is like Okay so we've got a little nucleus thing going here so when does your kingdom launch out to everybody else and what he says is Hey listen don't worry about the time once it's not your responsibility
 but you're about to receive the power of the spirit and you will become my Witnesses famous lines but noticed a three-tiered typography your geography hear you're going to be my Witnesses starting here in Jerusalem Jerusalem becomes especially at the holidays for pilgrimage epicenter for all of the divers tribes of Israel but is the city of David at the center so here in Jerusalem but then going out to Judea and Samaria and hear Jesus is addressing the fractured tribes of Israel because the northern kingdom in the northern Hill Country I mean they split after the time of Solomon so the family divided goes back almost a millennium from Jesus Christ. Yes a crazy so just the fact that he says both of them said something and then from The Divided family of Israel out to all the nations to the Ramones part of the Earth
 so there's this map so he's got both the Jews around Jerusalem The Divided family of Israel and All Nations on the brain 7 times 7 Days Later Dead cast which is mean what is made us stay at the Passover weekend is the celebration of Pentecost which is the holiday where people would bring in the first fruits of their offerings in the Temple and so what Luke tells us is that there are Jews Caesar juice or maybe it's some converted Gentiles but he tells us let's do 15 different nations in language groups of these people come from their programming from February programming out there until committee blog pilgrimage from all parts of the Matthews our previous conversation how Matthew presented the why the wise men the Christmas story is wise men
 hanging their gifts to Jesus and he tells the story in such a way as to hyperlink it to that poem and Isaiah about the New Jerusalem exalted on hill with the nation's coming to it so Jesus becomes the exalted New Jerusalem there's something similar here where the people of Jesus filled with the spirit of Jesus become the place of pilgrimage for all of the restored people of God so this is the famous story Pentecost we want explore everything going on here but they're up having a prayer meeting the disciples power and wind comes in fire appears which is Temple imagery the fire is running the fire wind is just more but what's interesting is that what they find is when they start telling the story of Jesus
 the phrase that they use is telling of the mighty Deeds of God which means to retell the story of what God has done which is Peterson we going to do in a moment to tell the story of Jesus and what they find is whenever they're telling the story of Jesus under the power of the spirit the Nations unite into one language one speeds are going to use it in their own language people have longed to concerned here A reversal of Babylon event for sure that's on the brain on the brand also he names 15 places where people are there from he's using the ethnographic map of Genesis 10-year he's naming places that are all located on the 8th no map the map of S&S s nations from Genesis 10 me the elamites Mesopotamia Egypt
 Jews and Prophets proselytes cretans and Arabs so now these are all Jews on pilgrimage right from the Brits they become the first of the nucleus of the next the archaeologists of ancient Jerusalem tell us that anywhere from half a million up to close to a million people would come to Jerusalem while I mean wow and there's already a couple hundred thousand people there but it's like the place would just be able to just crazy yeah and this is bringing Harvest so that's nice like with all the animals that must have been even there so when people ask what all this means Peter gets up and he retells the story of Jesus and it culminates with Peter saying you his siblings
 build your brother you killed the anointed one in front of our family that got any he's talking about the leaders of Israel that represent the people so we killed her own brother but God Vindicated him by raising him from the dead and then goes on to talk about and he exalted Jesus as Lord and King that was a question when are you restoring the Kingdom of Israel and Peter's answer is happening here it is and the family of Abraham is being unified on the next outer tear of all these different tribes of the diaspora coming together and then Luke starts adding up numbers thousands were added to their number three thousand that day thousand many were at it and so the portrait in the next following chapters of Acts is about this growing reunified restored family of Abraham Messianic family favorite a real juice wrld juice and then what Luke will note is in
 Acts chapter 8 and following some of those disciples are going to go out to Samaria and these are a strand of Millenium 1000 year-long estranged family of Abraham and the Samaritan many Samaritans receive the news and I brought into the family and he's just he's working it out at the biggest divide overcome is because of Samaritan they still have some of the legacy of being tore observers maybe things would sometimes that's even more severe Outsiders pretty vicious in the parable of the Samaritan would be somebody was fiercely paid it makes them the hero of that story they have their own yet the Samaritans had develop their own offshoot of the observances and so there was a lot
 but there was a lot different to to calendar it's on and Luke doesn't Focus their he tells the story that the story of Jesus goes north to the Samaritans and people join the family but where he spends the majority of his time is the moment that the family of Abraham crosses the Israelite non-israelite divide and it's a story about a Roman centurions is becomes the representative story are the store so cool
Cornelius Cornelius accesoria assessoria when I was at the north on the coast to coast jet like that yeah beautiful Barber really cool yeah archaeology sites that's right anyway so there was a guy there a Roman centurions so he's not just an honest relied he's like a Roman military he honors the god of Israel is God for your fears the god of Israel in fact he even donates money to support the poor among the Jewish people around him was pretty rare.
 Greeks and Romans were attracted to the beliefs and way of life to do with people but how many Romans in positions of power were I don't know the answer to who is his either probably didn't grow up this area was probably put there as a job assignment is that seems to be what so you can I get a picture of him while they're converting correct yeah that's right there was a family station to there so he has the daytime dream and told to send send a messenger to go look for this guy you've never met name is Shimon called Peter Pan called Peter meanwhile Simon called Peter is up and I noticed Cornelius were told pray to God continually and now here's Peter Up on the Roof flat roofs praying with our prayer and Manny was hungry cuz it seems like the day and he
 how to eat something so they're making foods like the smell of you know the homeless in the tabbouleh and he fell into an altered state of consciousness just from the smell really good tasty and I'll sign man giving you like cuz it's not as good here I just don't speak Russian, say yeah you have to go this will Palestine I have a Palestinian grandmother make you a plate of her meth oh my gosh it's just amazing anyway I don't know if that's why I fell into a trance sky opening he sees this great sheet big blanket lowered by four corners of the four corners of the land or four corners of the Earth
 and a common image for a universality and he sees all these images of creatures of Genesis 1 a four-footed animals and birds and he's told to go eat one you're hungry go eat one and what he sees is there some ritual in pure animals in their own non-kosher thing is this whole story is about the inclusion of not Israelites his dream is about an old to eat Sunday for animal them clean and just to be clear this is part of the Torah threat is real Israel's Covenant agreement was it there was a strict type of diet yes what they can and cannot eat certain animals were considered ritually in pure lots of theories is in Leviticus chapter 11 and Deuteronomy 14 I think and lots of theories about the different reputations as to why the most common one
 that these are creatures who mix categories of creatures who are amphibians since they are on land and sea don't even creatures that are live in the air but they eat land creatures Birds of Prey so that explains a lot of them but not all probably because I love pigs and add that word. Just wanted to be better but by the time Peter is on the scene this is centuries centuries old custom birthday party to some sort of ritual worship what is clear is there pig bones everywhere at Philistine archaeological sites in and almost no pig bones the ancient Israelites so Peter is why I know I'm not going to eat anything that's not Kosher in the voice says what God has made pure don't consider Unholy and this happened three times and then the dream is over now what we know is that Peter didn't stop eating
 kosher he kept reading culture and other places in the New Testament does dream is clearly symbolic the animals animals are an analogy that illuminates what's about to happen between Israelites and not as well that makes sense yeah I think so so that because if you are an Israelite you consider not as relay unclean well that's interesting different opinions on this so more the thing about being Emperor is when you come into contact with forces of things that symbolize death and actually be coming in pure is not sinful we have a whole series on this from a long time ago and Holiness may be reaching back there is reaching back but there is a difference between
 impurity and then putting a dead body isn't sinful but makes you a a what was wrong was Waltzing into the temple precincts the holy space when you're in a ritual eat a steak correct take a bath do the whole thing correct now the kosher animals were a little bit different because of these animals are in pure you we're just not supposed to eat them and it's been a few did people debated what exactly the consequences should be anywhere from the lenient to severe what I want to know here. And stop being kosher this is not in abolishing of the kosher food loss this dream about God undoing the impurity of non-kosher foods is a symbol of what God is doing in the narrative which is reversing Peters perception reversing the Jews perceptions of these
 Israelites so you're saying in the same way in the dream God saying you saw these animals is unclean but now I want you to see him is clean and the same way what's happening on the ground in this area and all over is that people who were not in the club. Saying can be in the club correct and one is an image of the other with that said one of the reasons why there wasn't a Congeniality was because of the kosher law that was one of the things that set them apart that's right that's why I do would not go to eat with a gentile correct partly have been one one of the reasons I guess what I'm saying is I could have said he could have said hey changes extrication but anything on the sheet is circumcision Sabbath observance
 in the Century theater Century the things that in Greco-Roman culture set Israelites apart purposefully I mean that was their purpose right exactly their purpose that's why God gave these parts of the Covenant was for them to be set apart correct yeah that's right so another words and again to say it again this dream because I've heard this so many times I think I probably said in the past in this dream is not a polishing the kosher food Customs for Jewish people to observe and we know that Peter didn't take it this way and neither did the Apostle Paul later on cuz he still commands that if there are observant Jews or Gentiles who want to follow the kosher food laws like in the Book of Romans he says go for it but he also says don't feel obliged to what he says is they are no longer the criteria for determining who's in the family or not and that's what God is trying to undo here so then but then what would be the purpose of adhering to food Lawson
 if that's one of the ways that you express your honour and Devotion to God with many Jewish people and not Israelites did and still do so the point is not that kosher food lie was good for a time but now it's bad it's you have a custom get that's god-given to set is real part that custom is no longer the means of distinguishing who's apart of the family of God. I think that's what the dream is found and so Peter is really flipped right is just as my mind is totally flipped inside out by this is perplexed and you goes to this guy's house and I'm abbreviating here but he goes into the house and he sees the like oh my gosh it's just like you know God fearing non-israelite and what he says is I understand that God is not one to show partiality but in every nation the person who fears him and
 what is right is welcome to be invited into his family and so Peter starts telling the story of Jesus and Cornelius is my sign me up and while Peter still speaking Pentecost that happened in Jerusalem on all those Jews now happens here the gifts of the holy spirit, they start speaking in tongues and telling the the same thing that happened in Jerusalem so you can see at Luke's planted this story as the symbolic story of now the thing that happens for the family this rail is now going out to the nation's supplies by Cornelius and his head of household and so they're baptized the sign up in 3 gal
 hooray it's done everything is right well it's begun next day just begun until the problems until the culture-clash yes let's try and sympathetically imagine ourselves into the scenario where a part of a over a millennium old religious ethnic cultural group whose identity has been shaped by a certain set of markers and there's the Shakedown of events concerning this agitator Jesus and then his followers are telling the story amazing things are happening there Gathering thousands and thousands of followers and then you hear like the Unspeakable that they are inviting non Israelites into calling them like members of our people inviting them into become a part of our family
 just right there severe on its face you would you might say that's the purpose and there's all sorts of people being grafted into the visual I guess good on them I think where the rub really happens is when they don't require them that's rent to act Jewish and their food in the diadem in the circumcision stabbath particularly well then what are you guys doing your watering this down then there may be something in the way that Luke tells the story is that this is something that the leaders of the Jesus movement discovered another was it wasn't this one wasn't it wasn't all clear to them how this was all going to work out they discovered it through another one of these new people coming into the family force them to reconsider their conceptions of the family of God
 and his all comes to culmination and Acts chapter 15
so Paul's been introduced into the story here or Saul Saul of Tarsus but the ant the city of Antioch becomes the home base for all these Gentiles leaders being sent out to share the message of Jesus with non-israelite but some of the beginning of X-15 some men came down from Judea and begin teaching the siblings now listen you can't be rescued by Jesus unless you're circumcised according to custom of Moses Smite our first Jewish Messiah read your Bible family babraham email Moses Moses was almost killed because within the app that's right yeah it just within the Hebrew Bible it's a big deal it's a big deal and within recent memory for these people The Maccabees I mean think of the mother who
 lay down her life with her seven sons in the story of The Maccabees because they wouldn't eat on Kosher foods and break the Sabbath and reverse their circumcision important the blood of the martyrs in this soil has taken place over circumcision and you're going to make this optional yeah if you want to be a part of the family of Abraham do what we've always done their argument and if they have the Bible on their side has a history reason history and charged culture boy yeah so great Division and debate with them and the siblings all determined that they should all go to Jerusalem and have a Bible study in council meeting not small small change here writes like it is at the heart of what it means to be in the family till they totally so what they do is they
 I'll go back and there's all kinds of people there there's some Pharisees some very strict politically religiously conservative Jews who get up and they give their point of view and what they say is the Bible tradition custom then all of these Israelites who have been out seeing on this ra Lights by Kanye come into the family and they start telling their stories to Peter tells the story of Cornelius and we're told that Paul and Barnabas start saying like did we went to the all these other places and it's crazy man these non Israelites love Jesus and are following him living by The Sermon on the Mount it's amazing and the Holy Spirit did stuff in their mates just like you did with us on Pentecost so Jacob
 get up please call translated James here this is the brother of Jesus half-brother Jesus Jacob and Sophie says brothers so Simeon just related how God first concern himself about taking from among the Gentiles of people for his name and you know I was just reading the book of the 12 this morning my pair of 12 prophets in the words of the prophets and he quotes from the poem at the end of The Book of Amos Old Testament Prophet is quoting from a speech of God that says after these things and this is after the destruction of Israel in the Exile God says I'm going to rebuild the tent of David that has collapsed
 I'll restore its ruins rebuild it so that the remainder of humanity May seek the Lord and all the nations that are called by my name is the Lord who made these things now I'm from long ago therefore it's my judgment that you know we should not trouble these Gentiles is not Israelites who are turning to God we should write to them that you know they should stay away from food sacrificed to idols and they shouldn't sleep with somebody that married to and they shouldn't eat blood of animals that have been strangled that I've been dealt with and proper kosher way because Moses from timepass has in every city where he's preached been read aloud and he's red and synagogues thermostat with a compromise it is a compromise yeah you know we talked about this at some point and we didn't really get to the bottom of it the compromise strikes me as
 suspicious about circumcision so it's like okay we're not going to have him do this and I can do circumcision that which is significant but we still would like them to do this kosher thing yeah yeah which is what's the Pacific kosher practice which is to make sure that the blood is not is drained correct and you know you can maybe understand like life's in the blood and this is really important symbol and what's interesting is when you get a window back on this with Paul's letter to find out what he's been teaching the non Israelites in Corinth and he what he tells them is food that's been sacrificed to the idols is totally fine to eat it don't go into the temples and eat it as part of a warship ritual but it's totally fine to eat it even this compromise call the following so what's interesting is it showing about them making a concession but even then it's not a full full Dil
 yeah that other of the of the Apostles are where they're going to take it that interests us is interested in this portrait of the challenge of this is happening in real time yes how is this going to happen if they wrestle through this Peter gets a vision they got to get together and talk about it to come up with the compromise it's a compromise that Paul the Apostle Paul is going to even backpedal on a bit his conviction is that there should be no cultural boundary lines yeah an honest relax from coming into the family hits by trusting and following Jesus alone that's what constitutes membership in the family of Abraham with will get to in our next step for a conversation but what I'm interested in what we're focusing on the present this is a neat foregone conclusion yeah right to the inclusion of and it doesn't have some neat story that just kind of like he has it all up really nice
so let's look at the pattern the pattern in Acts is the Holy Spirit who sent by Jesus and Jeff he said in chapter 1 and father is going to come in your midst and surprising things start to happen that's Pentecost that's the Samaritans that's Cornelius and so on and what the surprising things are as they challenge people's conceptions about who's included in God's family and it keeps getting wider and wider not so wide or ambiguous that there's no like called actually follow Jesus there is but the point is is that the amount of barriers in addition to just trusting and following Jesus the Holy Spirit keeps just over writing them and it's very uncomfortable for these people is turning up the volume on on that this company has to be a pathetic you've grown up
 and for Generations upon Generations this is been how you show your allegiance to the god of to your gut and to into that your people and now there's a skink which is the family has gotten bigger how did these guys show their allegiance and then how do we live together if we're not doing it the same one that's enough to another family when you're the same yep whatever so let me so let me just add one more week he remember this multiple conversations ago remember the story where circumcision was introduced yeah I was going to ask you about that because cuz they Abraham yep after God renews the Covenant with him right well so Abraham and Sarah of Oak creste their Egyptian slave
 yeah he had sex with her and produce this child of their own plan and What God Says is going to bless that sun make him it'll make him Twelve Tribes will be like a pre Israel Israel here tribes but he's not the chosen line but what God does is both judge and deliver the future of Abraham's family member the sign of super circumcision is both a Divine judgment on the part of Abraham's body that he just use to oppress their Egyptian slave you cutting it off but then also it's marking it as the part of Abraham's body contains the future of the family the future of this family belongs to God and what God tells Abraham is too then circumcised Ishmael to show that he's a part of your family so circumcision was initially created for the inclusion of the nachos and mind into the family baby
 and ironically what's circumcision became by this point was a way of keeping right of showing the clear boundary line between Israelites and on as red as well as it always did both well that's a good point getting circumcised didn't make Ishmael a part of the line of Isaac Jacob and so on but it was a way of including just showing that I'm with Abraham yes I'm a part of the Abraham came so if your not circumcised you're not a part of a Dream Team correct so kind of does both things it shows who's in and out Chris about your line but it also you're saying in the story itself it shows how that sign is used to include correct it the origin of the scientist include a non chosen lineage within the family of Abraham and by the time that they're having this debate in Jerusalem in Acts chapter 15 circumcision has come to symbolize
 the isolation of Abraham's family among the nation's the difference essentially how to become a boundary line until the question is do we still have to do that thing yeah and very easily You could argue yeah why wouldn't you he had Ishmael do it he was an Israelite well he wasn't sorry yeah it is real name is not born yet so they smell so signature but he was a son of Abraham and I thought he wasn't in the line of the seed and it wasn't required of him to get circumcised but he was allowed to do it so here's more people for now identifying their allegiance with was Abraham's family and the Seed of Abraham and so yeah get circumcised that's the sign that's what you do you could see that logic in fact that seems the most logical
 yeah but the holy spirit is pushing in a different direction that's surprising and I guess that's just the thing I just as the years go by at this just the thing that keeps enduring sticks with me or else it's like poke send to me the book of Acts is saying there are moments when the Holy Spirit wants to challenge the preconceptions of God's people that a preconception what do you mean by preconception circumcision is the marker of identification with Abraham's family the pre-conception that they have the based based off of the scriptures yes that's exactly my point was exactly my point so so you could say the holy spirit is making me rethink what was previously scripture the Apostle Paul is going to show how this was actually anticipated
 by the logic of the story of Genesis but we're not there yet so just Luke's argument in the book of Acts is the holy spirit does work in the lives of these non Israelites surprise thing I didn't think God would work among these people and they want to follow Jesus as much as we do it's happening and so then it just it forces this culture clash and I'm not trying to infer anything here I'm just trying to just say this is the portrait in the Book of Luke and it's been sitting there for two thousand years and it's not comfortable it was comfortable for them and so I'm just trying to think of what does it mean to respond Faithfully to this portrait of the work of the spirit I think that the different traditions of the church have had a very difficult time keeping this this kind of openness to the spirit and a challenging because on the flip side it's that well look at the scriptures isn't it fairly clear but it was not clear
 you're saying here is even though it's clear in the scriptures there was stuff happening on the ground where the Same Spirit animating them showing that they're part of the family correct is now that is right now happening it's rented to not Israelites and so they have to deal with that they're like will God's spirit is in them working and and they are following Jesus with us so so what gives if got Spirits in them but they're not circumcised what gives and so they decide I guess it doesn't matter you don't have to get circumsized what they decide is it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us that's what he says that's what James said he goes back and he goes to his Bible and he says you know there's this part of the Book of Amos that stuck out to me and that part of the Book of Amos doesn't mention circumcision right but it would have mentions has all these Gentiles who are seeking the Lord and who are called
 go by the name and included in the tent the family your household David Wright the anointed one and he says you know what this is what the story's been all about this is what's happening we should be glad this is happening that's not make it more difficult as highlighting there's a part of the scriptures that he wouldn't have thought about this way earlier but now he says he's like oh yes this is this is what it's been all about and it's this is the dynamic of this is the dynamic but you could still read the famous passage and then say great and now go get circumcised now they all need to get circumcised that's correct something happened are they putting this all together and they go well it seems like what the spirit is doing is letting us know that our competition is not on the table anymore and that leap how they got there I don't fully understand oh I see it's the disease non circumcised
 followers people are giving their allegiance to Jesus and the Holy Spirit is it doing in them and through them the same thing he did with all of us who are circumcised at the Holy Spirit and so he says it seemed they write a letter is what they doing I got 15 they write a letter and in this letter they said we've heard that some of our number to whom we gave Noah instruction we didn't go tell them they go tell those not as wise to get circumcised but that's what they did and so they have Disturbed you an unsettled you saying you're not really on the Jesus team and so it seemed good to us we've come of one mind he says to select people to send with you with Barnabas and Paul it seemed good I'm going down a few verses to the Holy Spirit and us to lay it upon you no greater burden than these Essentials and then the name of those things that's the conclusion that they dropped us what they hear the spirit saying to them while they're allowed their apostles
 yeah I'm trying to push myself to not give the easy solution here I want to sit with the same discomfort that they sat with this way there are moments when what is circumcision represent the cultural custom that tethers identity identity of God's family to a one particular cultural custom that of a people group called the Israelites who live in this place in this time and that's what the holy spirit is bridging over it in the story and so what what are we being taught here we're being taught there will be moments when God's people are tempted to identify the family of God with my particular National or ethnic family and the moment that happens we need to be very careful that we're not mistake Our Kingdom for God's or My Tribe
 College Drive and to be open to the fact when the Holy Spirit wants to blow the doors on that and often that'll happen by God doing surprising things among people that I would have thought that he would show up and do work in new seems to me this is very extremely relevant principal about how was the spirit Works cuz man that temptation to take how do my particular Community or family or tradition has practice the way of Jesus we've developed these traditions and that's how you're supposed to do it this is like the stuff with church splits in here anyway right will then become what's the guard rails but seriously hear that that God is actively working that's right. In a way that made them have to What's The Phrase you used the second guess their preconceptions
 for rooted in ya in there and then they're in a custom and so this this whole set of complexities is going to be thrust upon Paul the Apostle and Paul the Apostle is going to establish some guardrail so to speak represent you know what spirit is saying through him and his co-workers to those churches cuz it's not just a free-for-all allegiance to Jesus really translates into certain practices and a way of life but that way of life on this trajectory doesn't involve circumcision that culture practice anymore and so we're going to do next is dive into some passages in the letters of Paul cuz he was commissioned as the Apostle to the Nations and what he has to say about the identity of the family of God has incredible relevance for Monday
 are you listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast we are coming into the final stretches of this theme study on the family of God next week we are going to look at the book of Romans and what the Apostle Paul has to say about being in the family of God Paul was writing this letter to bring Ashley to bring Unity to a set of fractured house churches in from and so in the early chapters of the letter but he's trying to show is that all along.
