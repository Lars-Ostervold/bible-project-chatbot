the book of the Revelation it's the last role in the Bible it's an apocalyptic Vision about the reordering and Recreation that the entire Cosmos fashion it brings to resolution all the themes of the Bible the theme we've been tracing in this series is what we called the chaos dragon and ancient symbol of death and disorder a power that the Stayton wields to deceive and Destroy and is returned to the Revelation we're going to see if the same players if they are called the Satan is putting on a dragon power as it were and inspiring even more monsters at work in the world we've got some mighty dragons here in the Revelation and there's not just one in the normous red dragon the seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on the Ted's its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky flung them to the Earth
 do a beast that comes up out of the sea it also has seven heads and ten horns and crowns and this Dragon gives power to this monster it's like a doppelganger but then it's all so clearly a first creature and surprise still one more beasts they had two horns like a lamb but he spoke like a dragon why so many dragons what John is done it is actually split out the dragon the spiritual being and then the Beast which is its Earthly Imperial institutional and John has created one altogether death and Chaos are horrible and we God's creatures wield them it's horrifying but in Revelation 12 John said something remarkable he says that the followers of Jesus can have Victory when they choose to not love their lives so much that they shrink back from Death what does it mean to not shrink back from fear of death
 and to gain victory over the dragon in our own wise personally in our neighborhoods in our communities that's going to look so different in different seasons but there's a common theme in trusting that the power of the Dragon truly was taken away on Easter morning in the empty tomb and through the Risen Jesus and that all creation is headed for an empty tomb Resurrection Destiny today and I complete our conversations on the theme of the dragon by looking at John's Revelation I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 ATM by John hello hello hey this is to be our final conversation in a very long series of conversations about the dragon to Dragon Sea Dragon the cast Dragon the monster death itself only Lions scorpions in the Bible and the Bible and how it's a reality death is a reality that is set in motion from the very beginning of the Bible Unleashed by Spiritual Beings and humans as we use death as a power get what we want and come in Alliance with death and will we looked at in the last few episodes was how Jesus through his resurrection sure that he had ultimate power over death and that he is giving us that power as well
 and wants us to live in such a way that we believe that power is real and that we confront the dragon not five playing by its own terms but by realizing that it has been disarmed and doesn't have to control the way we think can live in the world which means we can actually love people and we can actually like let go of things that we thought we had to fight for yeah and we can buy four things that we thought were maybe not possible to win since you're staying the overlap that we've discovered in these last few conversations this just occurred to me it is with the theme of generosity abundance and scarcity is the view that there's not enough
 and so that motivates all of us to do what it takes to make sure there's enough and there's an analogy here where if death so rules your imagination that avoiding the death of my body in the form that it now exists like that's the ultimate and most important value then all of a sudden death becomes a very powerful persuasive tool with the threat of it in my choices and I can use that influence other choices or just the reality of it can influence what I choose to do and can rule me and there you go another important distinction in our conversations has been that the chaos dragon in the sea represents the reality of death and non-existence as something that can happen in God's world at this stage of its Journey the reality
 and the possibility of sinking back into the cast Waters but what the story of Jesus represents is someone of God come among us to disempower for the dragon and particularly disempower the spiritual powers that have captured and melded with human power to use death as weapon putting it on this a costume in the Jesus confronted those powers and let them take the life of his body but not the life of who he acts yes it is. And so in his resurrection from the dead he is holds the keys to death in the grave as he says and has power over the dragon-heir Paul calls at the final enemy death being final Enemy enemy he doesn't describe as a spiritual being who has rebelled against God write the final enemy is death itself because what is that spear
 what power is he trying to wield against God exactly against the power of death the power of the Dragon of the Dragon so that concept right there is also being drawn upon developed and explored by another biblical author who's using a totally different mode of communication but it's the same basic ideas at work and that is John the Visionary X-Files on pop most
 who wrote the last book of the Christian Bible called the Revelation singular or the apocalypse and we're going to see if the same players figure called the Satan who's putting on a dragon power as it were and inspiring even more monsters at work in the world but that figure and its power of death at least the followers of Jesus that are being written to in this letter apocalypse prophecy just trying to convince them that it doesn't actually have real power over you in fact it's defeat is already
 has already begun its written in the stars in more ways than one The Apocalypse of John and look at the use of dragon imagery indecision
so it was funny to review just kind of upload the Revelation in preparation for this conversation I found these really helpful videos part 1 and 2 that I wrote seven years ago and it was like relearning I haven't read Revelation in a while and it was like relearning really helpful you're saying you did yourself a favor 7 years ago I did yeah and that's why I meant why we mixed all the stuff that stuff that you can draw upon when you need to do the things like we're doing right now so the apocalypse is an example the second temple Jewish apocalyptic literature there are many other Jewish apocalypse is from the same. That helped us get a idea of the genre genre they were written by extreme be Revival nerds like superhero Bible nerds who knew how to read pray and meditate on the storyline and symbols of the Hebrew Bible and in their own
 experiences of prayer and meditation and Altered States Of Consciousness they made all kinds of connections had encounters with God's presence and the spirit of God showed them new ways to mold all the symbols together to give new insight and wisdom for the future generations of God's people nuts we have a Messianic Christian example of a Jewish follower of Jesus who was this super Hebrew Bible married crazy Hebrew Bible noted he begins by Framing the book as a message that Jesus wants to give to seven churches and even the fact that the number seven is being used means that he knew it would have a wider readership but he was connected to the seven churches on the Eastern end of the Roman Empire and when he describes what many of them are facing is persecution and difficulties that are being thrown at them by wealth to the church
 in Smyrna he says that there are a whole bunch of people in there Jewish Community who are actually now turning on them because they follow Jesus as Messiah they haven't stopped being Jewish they've just embraced Jesus as their Jewish Messiah but some of their family and people in their synagogue really really vehement Lee disagree and Jesus describes how they have fallen under the power of the Satan when they persecute and exclude them their brothers and sisters for following Jesus Messiah but he brings in the Phaeton so when he talks about to the church in pergamum he says you dwell where Satan's Throne is what most likely he's referring to people debate these things but maybe a shrine and you know what Greek or Roman god or goddess is he referring to the local Shrine and because they
 follower of Jesus Antipas who got killed for following Jesus is there in that City so was it a Roman sponsored persecution was it a mob you know that murdered him we don't you know the story is not told the point is that these churches communities of Jesus are facing the forces of the Satan the devil and he's trying to inspire them with a vision of reality where Jesus is the real Victor in Cosmic King and that brings us to the next part of the book was in chapters four and five which is all about the vision of the Heavenly Temple inspired by all of the same Visions from the Hebrew Bible but the god figure on the throne has a scroll that unlocks all the mysteries of history and got the purpose and no one can open it like who can understand what God has in-store where's it got taken the show
 and then the slam shows up with his throat slit but it's called the lion from the tribe of Judah and the symbol of the Risen Jesus than the lamp can take the scroll and open it up and so it's a vision that the real Cosmic King is the crucified risen Jesus on the Divine Throne that he's the one directing history towards his purpose not the Satan has hijacked human history with its with the power of the Dragon so what happens from here in Revelation chapter six through 16 is four series of seven things around and there's Seven Seals of the scroll then they're seven trumpets to get blasted then there are seven signs symbols that John sees and then there are seven balls to get poured out and what I want to focus on is that third set of four that are in chapter 12 to 4
 the seven signs and every one of them will people debate if it's one big long sequins the seven signs all of the sets of 7 off all sets or is it passed through the seven a different way of thinking about the same sequence of events just exploring it with different symbols and so on so anyway the video goes into more detail all of that but it's the seven signs and really just chapter 12 is where we want to focus because For the First Time John introduces does the figure of the Dragon here in chapter 12 in the dragons going to play a role and be on the scene until he's escorted off the stage in chapter 20 e-notes whether or not he's a new character cuz he's already introduced to Satan Satan in the letters to the seven churches so yeah I think we maybe we should just read it
 yeah I'm sure it'll be all crystal clear and Ivy
 a great sign appeared in the heavens a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head she was pregnant she cried out in pain when she was about to give birth then another sign appeared in heaven and enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads
 its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky flung them to the Earth okay to the one thing that really stood out to me was the seven heads and ten horns that's the exact image Daniels Beast right yeah Daniel is for Monsters then crawled up out of the dark chaotic ocean if you add up all the heads and horns of all the for a whole day together to get 7 + 10 that's what it was okay so this is the super beast the mega monster monster as one monster a red dragon so and Daniel it's like hey how do we imagine death and Chaos it's gotten so out of hand it's so entwined with spiritual forces and with human evil everything together like to imagine that we have to imagine these
 four beasts that are like combine the mega beasts in here where was ripping on that because in the sequence of seven things that he sees he's going to actually see two more monsters of book of Exodus it'll be the first of these is a big red dragon seven heads and ten horns and seven crown on its heads with pause this thing when we turn to chapter 13 we meet and sees us and the dragon stood on the sand of the sea shore as his domain so he's at the border the border and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea another Beast having ten horns and seven heads and on its horns Were Ten crowns and it on his heads were Blasphemous names the Beast I saw was like a leopard but with feet like a bear and his mouth like a lion
 and the dragon gave him his power and thrown in the authority so we're dealing with multiple Beast like Daniel so know that there's only one dragon and this Dragon gives power to this monster doppelganger the dragon was in the heavens and now here's an Earthly mirror the corresponding Earthly Beast so to speak and this thing gets its power from the dragon and it's like the dragon it also has seven heads and ten horns and crowns
 but then it's all so clearly a earth creature and it's like he alludes to the animals of Daniels dreams left there. It's like a bear is like a lion so he's almost certainly referring here to the actual like human realm or Jerusalem or something else depending on your Meadow View of how to interpret the Revelation in Earthly Kingdom Earthly Kingdom it's an Earthly human manifestation and so is Daniel exactly the Beast of Daniels dreams were called human Kings and kingdoms has done is he's actually split out the dragon from head of a spiritual being and then the Beast which is its Earthly Imperial institutional yeah because it's Daniel's vision of the four beasts none were a dragon actually correct that's exactly right because they came out of the sea we were saying okay this is
 imagine the dragon and I started to think of like okay we're matching the dragon but we're like turning up and just like mixing and making even up my monster more chaotic than a dragon to display up like this thing is I've gotten real out of hands right yeah and what you're saying is Okay so we've got that but now let's imagine that there is a dragon but he's not coming out to see like he is so in League with season that being he's in the heavens and he's giving the Sea Dragon its power trying to create get metaframe here we've got the dragon in the beginning in the sea it is represents death and Daniel we got the Beast coming out of the chaotic ocean what you think oh here's the dragon but actually they're human kingdoms that are beastly young them straight monster like and what gives those things their power yeah well it's the dragon it's the snake that is
 spiritual being that has put on the dragon eye drawing a dragon okay so this crystal clear but it kind of is
 another words John he's a Bible married so he can see that there's a snake that puts on and using the guise of the dragon and its power of death to deceive the humans into forfeiting their rule over the land and giving their imaginations and their future to the snake and now the snake Ruston outside beaten and that's what Daniel is drawing on then remember the Cain and Abel narrative which was about how the snake then works in the imagination of Kain God exalt my brother let me know I'll never be exalted and then uses the power of the Dragon to kill his brother to get what he wants
 so now humans are ruled by the power of the Dragons persuasion so to speak and then goes on to tell to city and becomes the founder of the city of man than Their Kingdoms and so now we have human kingdoms inspired by the power of the snake when Daniel's monsters come up later out of the ocean he's mostly thinking about the cane like human monster hotel which is why they're identified as kings I see in Daniel 7 Daniel doesn't really highlight the spiritual of mirror of the ruler in heaven that's you wait till I get to Isaiah you think you'll develop set and John has created One account where there are now all together got it so there's a dragon and Evans yeah and then there's monsters on the earth and they are each other and strange way of yeah yeah but the ones on the Earth are not dragons they're just Beast and the ones in the heavens is not a beast it's a dragon Heather so and it is surprisingly clear
 once you get the symbol of the woman is that has seven heads and ten horns like the dragon John goes on to say the whole earth was amazed and followed after that Beast they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the Beast and they worship the Beast saying who is like the Beast he's poking fun at the depending on which bad guy let's go with the Roman Empire interpretation but it could apply to whatever the other thing you think the Revelation is referring to but he's referring to people getting their allegiance to human power structures
 and then who is able to wage war like him so we go to the Roman Empire the Roman Empire actually conceived and described itself as a manifestation of the Goddess Roma's tower on the land and it was deified which is why you swear allegiance to it why you died for it it's why you worship, and therefore the Roman Empire and so what John sees it's just a huge death Beast that just turns to zap humans it's not yeah and it's inspired by the dragon and if you would give your allegiance to the Beast you're actually giving your relations to the dragon above yeah that's how we see that the mirror yeah we're not done cuz that's just one aspect of the earth be so there's verse 11 another Beast coming up out of the earth so the first one came out of the sea
 part too yeah this is coming up out of the underworld and he had two horns like a lamb and I do like a little lamb growing horns yeah that's kind of like the typical way we think of Satan's oh yeah that's right but he spoke like a dragon and he exercises for 12 he uses all the authority of the first beast in his presence and he makes everybody worship the first Beast he does signs and wonders and tell on what many people think is what John is doing is he's splitting out the military power of this whatever Empire he's describing the animated by the dragon and then also the economic and propaganda machine this is the piece that makes everybody take the mark of the beast the second piece of the earth 66 on their hands and foreheads
 so one interpretation is this is the same Beast depicted as two different Beasts of the graves are out of the underworld both two ways to think about human power structures that have gone awry and both animated by the Dragon one is giving it Power by the dragon the name of Three Monsters but they're all connected as this Unholy Trinity and that's another truly part of the reason why he has broken into three it says anti Trinity Morrow from father-son Spirit wild wild is a great
so when I want to go back to is check 12 and then we first met the dragon yet but I just wanted to show how the dragon also has the counterparts Earthly counterparts and why is broken into two because of the Unholy Trinity here now Tweedledee and Tweedledum something like that is fantastic that much more horrendous version of that okay so what we had was a pregnant woman clothed with a woman 12 stars in her head about to give birth in the sky and the woman clothed with the sun in the moon so I'm thinking spiritual being here because the moon and the sun represents the rulers of the sky so she's close with that feels like we're talkin yes like a spiritual being of some sort of so important here is this little line right here a woman clothed with the sun moon and stars is take
 right from Joseph stream the Genesis scroll the first dream that Joseph had that he tells his brothers and then his dad was that I had a dream and the sun moon and stars were bowing down to me so this is the Heavenly Host bowing down to exalted human ruler that's the first time you have this idea of a human up in the heavens, so what's interesting here is this is not the sun moon and stars down down to the woman but rather the woman herself is closed with the Heavenly lights and 12 Stars around her head so there's a Sadie prabal hear about the 12 signs of the zodiac and stars symbolism in how much of that John is drying up on here I saw what I want to highlight primarily is this that goes to the Hebrew Bible that John is working with her so what this woman
 to do is give birth to the Messiah but then have a whole bunch of other children that are persecuted by the dragon dragon wants to kill them all so it's hard not to see some kind of ease and 12 tribes of Israel being echoed here when I say it's hard not to see what I mean that's what you said it seems to be but then also the fact that she gives birth to the Messiah makes one think of Mary right and then of The Twelve Apostles who are the icon of the new or the renewed Messianic people of God and we know that the 12 tribes of the tribes of Israel and the apostles we'll both get drawn upon numerically the sets of 12 later on in the book
 people debate whether it's one of the other or perhaps is symbolized both but it's written in the stars so she's pregnant and about to give birth and then there's another Dragon up there so where do we learn that she gives birth to other kids later later but she's going to become the mother of both the Messiah and of a bunch of other kids so it's swept its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the Earth
 this popular interpretation the least of my experience gets turned into an image of the devil falling from heaven with a third of the angels to that it's almost certainly not with it no perfect retract ya hear this line sweeping a third of the stars out of the sky flinging them to the land comes right from Daniel chapter 8 describing one of the monsters in particular that arrogant horn and then Daniel 8 or 10. Is that horn to this the Horn of one of them monsters 4th monster well accident Daniel 80 4th monster becomes just it's own it but it's of a random and he got out and he didn't read this one we never met but it's another monstrous creature with a huge horn do not doing the same stuff as the fourth be stuck
 and what that horn the one horn that came up out of the fourth beast in Daniel 7 now that horn grows up out of another monster in chapter of Daniel 8 and Daniel 8 or 10 it grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the Stars to fall to the Earth new trampled them down and what you learn is that this is referring to human King that identified as a human King that exalts itself as a deity and makes War and persecutes the people of the Holy ones of the most high
 which are actual Israelites like living in Jerusalem but there's this mirror and Daniel of the war on Earth between the human monsters and God's people is mirrored by a Heavenly battle so to take out people on earth is taking out Stars that's right yeah so another words John is referring to this line right here so by sweeping a third of the stars out of the sky and flinging them to the Earth is a reference to a Heavenly War I haven't Lee War had a conflict yes that is mirroring an Earthly conflict correct. This is why there's actually three panels to Revelation 12 whether we finish reading them will see probably not at the speed but there's three panels and each one of them is actually retelling a story three times over high point is this is a battle scene not the dragon bringing Stars down to the Earth with itself
 so the dragon was standing in front of the woman who was about to give birth because it wanted to Devour the child the moment it was born and she gave birth to a son a male child who will rule the nations with an iron scepter home to write out of town too
 her child however with snaps up to God and to his throne and the woman fled Into the Wilderness to a place prepared for a by God where she was taken care of for three and a half years with 1260 face so feels like stories over and the dragon didn't get him he was exalted up to heaven to a throne and then that leaves the woman down on the land where God's going to take care of her and protect her from the Dragon for three and a half years next next panel and a war broke out in heaven so the question is is this follows or is this whole panel going up and giving more development of that the starts being flowers being back up and double click on
 stars and there's a war in heaven in mihaya whose name means who is like L who's my God so you've got a lead and jealousy and his angels fighting against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fighting back with the dragon wasn't strong enough they lost their place in the skies the dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the Diablos the satin who leads the whole world Estrella he was hurled to the Earth with his angels with him
 then I heard a loud voice and Evan say now have come the salvation and power and Kingdom of our God the authority of his Messiah the accuser of our brothers and sisters the one accusing them before God day and night has been hurled down there that is our brothers and sisters triumph over him by the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony they didn't love their lives even to shrink back from Death okay here we go the dragon has been using its firing those on the land to use death has this tool to sway them you love your life you need to protect yes you love what you have you love what you think you deserve yeah like my for it fight for it the dragon will help you the dragon will inspire you
 the fight for what and most valuable that is your life and your family and Empower you and you triumph over the dragon by the blood of the Lamb right to the blood meaning his death sacrifice but primarily to the death of Jesus and of the Lamb that it was a death for others yeah but if you try and buy the blood what it means is that you've added your blood next to his really cuz Meredith will be referred to back the beginning you overcome the Satan's by
 even if it means letting them kill you or just words how much rain from Death like you stood up to death and he said bring it up so this is you know the Roman Arenas the Lions all that stuff so that double click of the Heavenly War resulted in the Satan and then you know he's got a crew you have Michael and his angels and then you have the Satan and his crew and so here John is for sure read or heard other Jewish apocalypses that took all the stuff we've been sessioning in the Hebrew Bible and then second temple Jewish literature really developed especially the Heavenly players is where you get Michael was like a character in the Hebrew Bible or twice so here in another second temple apocalypses I mean there's so many about the Enoch literature
 please The Apocalypse of Abraham for Deseret second group there's all these works and John was at least a million with the traditions in them and they really filled out using the Hebrew Bible and then following the rabbit hole since I were to fill out the players so there's some Earthly battle that has a Heavenly counterpart and Michael and his angels when and their counterparts on earth wind to the blood of the lamb and not loving their lives so as to shrink back from Death so the battle in heaven that Michael and his angels are winning you're saying is mirrored by a battle on Earth which is depicted not as Christian that his followers of Jesus defeating their enemies but actually being defeated letting their enemies kill them
 because they believe in the resurrection from the dead yeah that's my little additions yeah to the watching it here but that's it so actually dying as a follower of Jesus 12 should bring paradoxically in this apocalyptic reversal it's a reason to Rejoice to victory in the skies yeah Rejoice you haven't seen you who dwell in them but woe to the earth and the Sea because the devil has gone down to you he is furious and he knows that this time is short
let's read the third panel think we're going to do it if you read the whole chapter
 so when the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the Earth he chased a woman remember she was out in the wilderness yeah so then he pursued her the one who had given birth to the male child however was given the two wings of a great eagle
 wait so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness where she be taken care of for a time two times at halftime of the three and a half out of the Serpent's reach check this the serpent out of his mouth Feud Waters like a river to overtake the woman to sweep her away with the torrent took a new C like a new chaos Waters yeah the dragon comes out of the water the water is out but now I can use the flood decreation waters of Micah as a weapon will kill but the land helped the woman it opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragonspeed out of his mouth
 the flood story in Genesis began by the Earth opening up in the floodwaters coming out and now here's the dragon releasing a flood and Earth opens it up but then to take the waters back in like a Rivers flood then the dragon was mad at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her Offspring the rest of recede those who keep God's commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus so the who's the woman the woman the mother of the Messiah and the mother of the rest of her Offspring so I'm going to weigh to think about like all Humanity so let's pause for this whole chapter is dramatizing Genesis 3 15 which is God said to the snake there will be hostility between you and the woman
 consider snack in between your seed and her seed but he let us a seat of the woman will crush your head and you but it's the snake will strike across his heel so this is like a this is the woman and her seed but her seed has to reference the singular ya see doves like the Messiah Crusher and then to the rest of the seed who follow in the way of the Messianic seed right and when we looked at in the last episode was when Paul thinks of that promise of crushing the head of the snake he refers to you all will cross yeah me the God who brings peace cross the Satan under y'all's feet tapping into the same idea that Jesus did it as of the seed but then the people of Jesus do it to ya
 it seems like one so the woman is at Eve and then the children of Eve which in the Hebrew Bible gets Focus down to the Seed of Abraham that his family this room but then there's also this woman burst the Messiah which is true of Israel Jesus is in this realignment was also hard not to see some kind of way of Imagining the cosmic significance of a Jewish teenage girl named Mary and then she was a crucial part of the leadership and founding circle of Jesus followers that are the followers of Jesus and so some Scholars want to nail down the symbol the woman is the church or the woman is Israel and I think the image of more fluid but I'm also not a revelation expert so if I sat with it for a lot more time I might have more clarity personally
 but either way you get it say Eve is real Mary and Messianic and the woman who birthed them versus the dragon vs. dragon his crew which began as Heavenly Sky rulers but we're exiled after introducing conflict in The Heavenly realm and now working wreaking havoc through their weapon and fear of death on the land and man bad time to be an Earthling if you're in the realm of the snake cuz they'll trick you into embracing death as life in life is death and then the time line here is that we're in this in-between. Where the Messianic male child has been exalted and it's round in the heavens
 the dragon and his crew or or we can have it down below
 and the woman and her children find themselves in this conflict with the dragon and his forces and the way that you gain victory over the dragon is to through the blood of the Lamb to not love your life so as rink back from death and again back to that's the kind of the key line for the steam We are following which
 which feels so in some ways cut right just tell like you're just don't drink back from death
 when you wanted their imaginations to be changed in such that your death is a victory in the sky and if you start to flee from Death you're actually just getting power over the dragon what would it mean to flee from Death means to make decisions based on my fear of death to avoid it or to avoid the reality that I'm going to die and death is a symbol has all these other things attached to it lost pain anxiety all sorts of death scarcity yeah there's like the ultimate death which it's talking about here and I think for most of the history of the world
 that was like motivator you thought about that every day but if you don't like it but I think it most human history like at any moment plague or famine is around the corner literally was swept us out and sober aware human being
 no is that even in times of stability and peace that is a reality and it's out there and all of it's like kind of technically arms that's associated with it which is security. Can you have enough it can be as simple as like do I have enough margin today to take do what I think I need to get done are people treating me with enough respect to I have enough honor like it's all associated with our fear of death even though it isn't specifically a fear of dying yeah that's interesting we live in the west coast city in America and the Haida a friend I was a pastor who was I forgot to be read a book or if this was his phrase but he was talking about how the church Community wants to begin conversations about the American Cult of self-care and it's kind of a wave on a half-truth cuz it is really true
 human we have limits and you can begin to structure and live your life in patterns and ways that just are emotionally unhealthy yeah goes against the grain if you whatever you need just a glass of water and a nap here is that a very important truths about knowing your limits and drawing boundaries yeah about what you do can get preyed upon by the market in a lot of self-care for the desire of self-care and now they're I don't need no you need a cream there more
 where is gladwater cream and you need to stop saying it's just saying like now all of a sudden we were in this environment where I can spend so much money and so much probably more time that I need on self-care but feel like I'm just doing what's the right healthy thing to do and it might be that true but I might also be doing it in huge excess of like what I need and really all I'm doing is insulting selfishness and the wisdom it takes to discern the difference between self-care and Indulgence is going to be different for every person but ultimately what I'm trying to Stave off his death which is the ultimate limiter of my existence like the ultimate boundary of extending my energy and so I find that for myself even in little things a little whatever you call them a little phrase
 Creature Comforts Creature Comforts yes and those are little ways that we shrink back from Death right I'm just trying to say it's not just about whether you're in a culture where it's illegal to be a follower of Jesus in your life at stake their brothers and sisters all over the planet who are in that situation which is much more like what John Visionary is addressing but it's also true that in any cultural setting we are all shrinking back out of fear of death in a million small medium and large Waze
 and what does it mean to resist that we are not saying is don't take care of yourself no no it's not what I'm saying I find Portland coffee I'm not saying that great but it is the wisdom of knowing at what point am I am I using wisdom so that I am I have you know I am a body it so I need to take care of my body so that I can then be a good human in this world but you're talking about how you know the power of death is the Satan when he comes to wield at what he does is he distorts truth yes and he says I'm a show you how to be wise but it's not by listening to God it's going to be taking on your own terms and so there's the subtle deception that leads to death which is yes I need to take care of myself but back and then all sudden turned into
 a way of being in the world which is now all about me and all about taking care of me and suddenly I'm like coming to Dragon yeah all kinds of things down that road you know what I think I'm helping myself where in fact I'm just hooking myself on these Comforts that I all the sudden they tighten your school by and it's like I need the stuff and that's the power of the Dragon I think I'm doing good but I need to always be wise because I might actually be doing long-term harm to myself and others were feeding the dragon what was Paul's line be wise about what is good in Independence about evil. Evil in Romans 16 at how he's going to fight the dragon why is about what is good and innocent about what is he
 yeah so what does it mean to not shrink back from fear of death and to gain victory over the dragon in our own wise person in our neighborhoods in our communities of following Jesus is going to look so different in different seasons but there's a common theme in trusting that the power of the Dragon truly was taken away on Easter morning in the empty tomb and through the Risen Jesus and that all creation is headed for an empty tomb Resurrection Destiny and it's at a loss vitelli yeah and if that's reality
 then what it can do is Inspire imaginations to truly live as if the dragon is powerless powerless over me and over the people I care about and overall world it's a hard thing to believe yeah but that's the journey
 there's this one little Nuance I wanted to address and it's about the death and resurrection of Jesus and we talked about Jesus going into the belly of death and that's the belly of the Sea Dragon the Beast the beast in the monster and so Jesus rising from the dead Paul called it the first fruits he's defeated death in that he's come out of the belly yeah yeah but is it that I should be is the Nuance here while Jesus has defeated death like death is still around and I too will go through into the valley of death and so there when Paul says death where is your Victory where you're staying I mean that's going to still hurt yep but that but when he says what the victory is like death won't be able to keep me and its belly that's right yeah so well Paul locates the victory in the resurrection
 the Visionary is done is he's taking the Victory and import it back even into the deaf the act of dying as a it's the way a follower of Jesus yeah but that's the part I think part of his pastoral goal in writing what he did to a group of churches where people are dying for following Jesus and so he's trying to say that if you died as a follower of Messiah it's your Victory your death is your Victory and Paul would say yes and the resurrection is the Victory and that's paused and then you know but they're just two sides of the same coin but you're right like death is both an enemy it's not like death is your friend like it's going to be fun but it is ultimately powerless over me and over where the whole Cosmos is headed what does have a hold on is what Paula called the scammer of this world the current form
 current mode of existence that it has but it's ultimate real self and my real self is destined for New Creation or the dragon has no power in the prophecy is crushing the head but then the reality is going through the belly and I feel like there's something interesting there about and it's like you want to crush the head but the way that he's going to defeat is through the belly and yeah it's going through death Victor's through that the victory is through death and Resurrection in the reserve yeah that's kind of joining Paul and and John sympathies there it's interesting this may be back for our last conversation on Paul the Paul does acknowledge there will be some small number
 out of all of the followers of Jesus Through History who are alive when the Messiah comes when he Jesus comes a new creation like crashes into Earth and so they'll be like Enoch or Elijah like his Ville they have to go through death they'll be called at the twinkling of an eye followers at some point but for most of us more than likely we're going to have to go through the belly of the Beast that has no ultimate power over our destiny well
 shouldn't but it has power over the thing I called my body and that makes me really Fred and that's I guess that's the Journey of disciplining AKA discipling my imagination into the Christian story well may the God of Peace Christian okay we did it we just finished a long journey through the theme of the chaos dragon in the story of the Bible I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you watch the video that we made on the cash Dragon you can find it on our website projects.com and on our YouTube channel youtube.com Bible project but the chaos is not over which they have a special guest next week to talk more about the cash dragon from a very unique angle we have Tracy Caldwell Dyson a NASA astronaut who has already served a six-month Tour on the International Space Station and Blasting
