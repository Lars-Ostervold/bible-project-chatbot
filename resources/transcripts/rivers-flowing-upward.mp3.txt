hey this is John the Bible project this is our fifth and last stop in our conversation on Ancient cosmology in the ancient imagination water brings both destruction like the chaos Waters of the sea flooding the Earth but also bring life like the spring waters flowing out of the earth to water a garden in Genesis 1. The chaos Waters of the sea with his word with the spirit and in Genesis 2 we see God use the subdued chaos Waters that are now under the land to water the dryer with the idea is that once the chaos water is underneath the land are tamed and subdued when they pop up through the spraying they've been made fresh they've been sweetened with the Sweet Waters God created guard it for Humanity to live in and enjoy this is Eden in Genesis to we get along description of a river flowing out of it which turns into four rivers and goes out to bring the Water of Life.
 all the nations when people come across life-giving Springs Orwell's in stories and Old Testament Were Meant to see this as a new little Eden spring popping up here the life of Heaven breaking into the dead Wilderness took the Earthly realm the people of Israel are meant to inhabit a new type of Ethan and they're meant to extend God blessing to the nation but instead they find themselves Exile in Babylon and it finds itself exactly where One of the rivers that flowed long ago and the prophets of Israel tell them not to fight Babylon but to remain true to their calling to seek the well-being of the Nations become the Waters of life for Babylon that's so cool so today we talked about Israel's continued calling to be the Waters of life for the nation's we look at ezekiel's vision of a river flowing out of the temple bringing life to the Dead Sea and we look at how God and visions of time when all the nations stream back to Jerusalem it's as one
 depiction of a reverse Ethan instead of one River going out splitting in becoming many the many rivers that are Humanity so divided Rivers will all become one and return to the new Dido thanks for joining us here we go
in my mind there's two types of waters the saltwater and freshwater distinction important because if the abyss I always imagined is like saltwater Yaks ocean that might be part of what gives it its disordered character it looks like I can give you life but Alexa kill you right now with the lands on top of which can come up and that's fresh water is very clear that in this conception of the land supported by pillars suspended above the waters below and that you can call the waters down there at the river's there cuz that's the source of all the rivers the ideas that once the chaos water is underneath the land are tamed and subdued when they pop up through the spring they've been made fresh they've been sweetened not drinkable water in the term potable water potable I never actually said
 that gives you the
 are we go potable potable we talked about this in the first part of this conversation we're through the rest of the Old Testament especially when people come across life-giving Springs Orwell's in stories in the Old Testament that were meant to see this as a new little Eden spring popping up here so I could have been breaking into the dead Wilderness of the Earthly realm so to speak so there's a story right after the Exodus where they pass through the waters the next 15 the next story like they finish the closing Hymn of the song the next to the 15 and the next line is and they journeyed on from there 3 days in the wilderness and they didn't find my mm the water in find washers cuz they're in the desert which is the neutral term yet so they went to bitterness which is Mara but the place name but the place name is bitterness and they couldn't drink the water that is there because of its mom
 miss it when Tamara and they found water but we can't go out are so bitter water that's saltwater drinkable water is bitter Waters I think it's related to just non-potable okay yeah something about it I'm sure people have done research on this so they grumbled is the first time they Grumble and so Moses cried out to Yahweh and Yahweh instructed him about a tree and he cast the tree into the waters and the waters became sweet Sweetwater's a healed the Waters of bitterness or transformed by a tree into the Sweet Waters and then they drink through a tree in there there's so many things going on and that's all right we can't talk about but the point is is that the word for undrinkable water is Mara which isn't too to home the chaos of best but it is Waters that prevent flourishing of life
 they have to be changed in some way and they're changing when they're changed here they become the word his sweet Lewis the word for sweet like honey the same for a set of honey so is there another way that Hebrew you talk about salt vs. freshwater that's why this came to my mind I think the more fundamental is is it drinkable and the rest of life or is it not drinkable and not a source of life I think that's the section who can be bitter Waters that prevent life horta home salt water for the idea is that when God gives fresh water coming up out of the ground that's a Eaton gift because he's tamed the to home to make it into my paint water is the neutral Waters that are drinkable so the two home is transformed into my M thought you were saying it's just my mind is that high is bozards the agent of transformation of the waters is the spirit is here in this story it's a treat I always I think maybe is it translated
 remind me translated dick yes I never pictured a tree house. Is that it's just the word well that's good or as the trees in the Garden of Eden it's just the tree and that's what you find in all of these Wellspring narratives is the vocabulary of Eden that piece of wood does how it gets translated easier to throw a piece of wood water and apple tree tree might be kind of scrawny when I was introduced to the history of allegorical or symbolic interpretation in church history it was an example of Augustine St Augustine of Hippo but yeah the sermon where he use this sermon and then use the word tree as a symbol for Calvary the cross and then he blinked these two stories together and not how our business becomes sweetness through the death and resurrection of Jesus
 long time and you know it just seems like it's a great sermon illustration can I say that that's connected to what an author might have meant but now I can see in a way it actually is not to connect the tree to the Cross as such but rather backwards that this is connecting to tree imagery from Eden and and so is across Heaven the cross is also developing tree imagery from Eden and Savannah wear August and was reading the Bible as a unified story but sometimes I lose control and become more arbitrary so they got you ask a question about salt versus Sweetwater I think it's meaningful in terms of his a drinkable or not because we talked about you know the two side in this of water in that destroy life and I can bring life and so that the home is destructive Waters or just chaotic unruly Waters were life can't develop and then it's the Miami who is the Mayan which
 the neutral Waters and in Genesis one we have the two home this Darkness over it and you're supposed to just get this picture of I guess we're out of luck irony is that the beginning of the story a story but if the beginning was the end but then spirit of God shows up and did the home becomes mine and so then we talked about Genesis to the spring in the flow that comes up out of the desert and Waters all the way around and it makes the mud makes the mud which makes the humans write write the Ed for the Adam to form the other and I remember as a younger person reading Genesis to getting to the rivers and like why is this here and the only thing that made sense of it was you know this must be here because it's trying to describe an actual place that existed so some
 a map of where Deaton was maybe so we talked about these four rivers that all come from the one river which is the spring that comes from eating and how you had so paragraph and you follow these rivers and one goes to Egypt one goes towards Egypt kind of cimmeria kush the name of the spring in Jerusalem what is the name of the spring in the Recon Vicky home yeah and then the Euphrates and Tigris which are associated with Siri and Babylon seeing that one so you got the Garden of Eden from which God is paintin the town and then he makes life giving water come up out of the land and now also his all his life and all this goodness but it doesn't just stop there and stay in the land of delight it continues to water all the Earth including some pretty epic places that we're going to run into later in the biblical narrative Egypt Babylon Syria
 and that this gift of life is supposed to go out to all the Earth and it kind of set you up for for the biblical story it's about the waters to go out from Eden out into the biblical narrative World becomes a foundational image of God's desire to spread goodness of eating out to the nation's
 it was really interesting we talked about how when Joseph and his brothers show up to Egypt is described as a garden total I was kind of tripping up on that because it would be weird for the little cloth has described Egypt as a garden because it's going to turn into a place of captivity but your point was that the River of Life is supposed to water everywhere and they said and God wanted this family to be his you called them the River of Life yeah he wanted them to be the blessing to the nation's it and they show up and when it's done right Egypt become this beautiful place and the same thing happens in Babylon when the nation's recognize that God has chosen the seed of the woman the Seed of Abraham as the source of blessing to the nation's when the nation's see that and then they bless this family they find the blessing of Eden Unleashed in their land to and that's exactly the portrait of the good Farah at the end of Genesis that recognizes and elevates
 suffering Seed of Abraham Joseph elevates into a place a rule and all of a sudden they're safe from the famine and it's through Joseph's wise Royal leadership that he saves them returned to Egypt into Eden in the middle of a famine it's so rich as we're together but that's right it's a long bald eating becomes a little mini Eden and you like this is like genesis to prepare me for this that the life of Eden would reach out even the Egyptians or the Pichon the have a lot which is now why would in Genesis 2 I wouldn't just say Egypt then if it's the point is Egypt I think we're here to The elusive nature of biblical narrative where they feed you bread crumbs to keep you reading to keep you reading and rereading cuz the next time hablas mentioned in the story it's somebody going on the way to Egypt who was a heck are you male or go through find the spring in the land of shoes
 which is on the way to Hobby Lobby which is where this family eventually settled or take it back to her how to read the Bible series places in the Bible aren't just listed for archival notice they are listed to accumulate meaning and symbolism as you go throughout the story so that you can connect the threads of the overall potline so you've got eaten in which water flows that blesses the year and then as you move forward in the narrative you've got Israel going into the promised land which is described as a new Eden and they're supposed to be the blessing that flows out to the nation's so you get there and it doesn't go well it goes the way it typically goes sometimes good but I'm thinking about the story of Solomon who's the son of David David establishes Jerusalem brings the Tabernacle there to Claire's it's going to be the site of the future Temple
 helping you see Jerusalem as the garden and eaten within the land promised to Abraham and so by the time you get to stall him and he's presented as an atom is Adam what 5.0 or something by that point and he's described himself as a child asking for divine wisdom about Good and Evil that he can rule and he loves animals we didn't talk about this there's that little line about super interested in animals and would study them and built up huge list of notes and observations about them and he knew all about animals but then he blows it or wives why is that connects the political marriages that are connected to honoring other deities of the Gods it just screams Genesis 3
 that does in terms of a wife points of connected to or somehow becomes connected to another evil Divine figured that will leak out the people astray so they're back and eat in your supposed to see it as like kind of a plant of the supposed to say eat in that's kind of this mini little packed story of what Israel has which is a full-on symbolic Eden cherubim and gold and jewels the whole bit and then his downfall which leads the nation on inevitable past fact about one next to know which is exactly what happens to humanity when they leave the garden they end up in Babylon definitely supposed to see this is Duel Stories so we left off with Israel now in Exile in Babylon and now going well isn't the point that were supposed to be in God's presents and eat in as his chosen people to like bring
 blessing to the world and now we're about an hour and Babylon and we're back to that letter of Jeremiah that Jeremiah wrote to the people that's some guards here yeah come now so this is the letter is what the god of Israel says to the Exile in Babylon build houses plant Gardens eat fruit Mary be fruitful and multiply but come father's the Sons & Daughters take wives for your son's give your daughters for husbands did they make X have the city where I sent you into Exile speaking Shalom is kind of like ruling yeah that's right yeah remember we talked about this this is the wisdom lawyer this is choosing not to revolt against you our captors but the upside down kingdom it's the life of Eden so now all of a sudden here's a little family that's been cast out of Eden or the river that flowed out of Eden Ironically in Exile
 and it finds itself exactly where One of the rivers of Eden flow Advanced ago and I still cool become the Waters of life for Babylon can make Babylon a beautiful place yeah yeah and it's very counterintuitive you would think Babylon you know hunkered down make the best of it that's right you know don't get corrupted into it and maybe even planned Rebellion but instead it's get in there and plant garden yeah and speak the Shalom feel when I think of seeking the Shalom I think of you know Daniel and his buddies they're in the king's court yeah and they're helping rule yes we're using right now the Hebrew Bible symbolism which is good that's what we should do but let's just pause and extend this forward this is exactly the effect of the Apostles and Jesus when they talk about the kingdom of God being here now even though all nations don't recognize it it's here and with the resurrection of Jesus and the coming of the spirit and the spirit is often depicted with image
 water poured out filled up with it that's eaten water imagery and so in the same way the life of a community living by the spirit will become a little Eden in the midst of the many babylon's where it finds itself in the same Paradigm just Jesus in spirit imagery in the New Testament where is the vegan are mentioned here for the idea of Avalon family of Abraham being in Babylon and experiencing the blessing of Eden here in Babylon that idea's been anticipated by the water's flowing from me. Till about 1 however God's people in Babylon isn't the ideal cuz that one screwed up even if you are blessing to it not everybody will appreciate that blessing like Nebuchadnezzar didn't always I had a son belisar definitely didn't understand the sense of Eden needs to be recreated yeah so there's two
 is this imagery works one is we've already talked about and the metaphor Series where Isaiah and Isaiah chapter 2 begins with saying it will come about at the end of days is in Hebrew at the end of days the mountain of the House of Yahweh which the mountain is Jerusalem and then the house the new Temple sew in the New Jerusalem in the salvation of the new Temple it will be the head of all mountains we made this observation the other day I was thinking of the time we were standing we were standing there looking up and this is so I'll be at the Mount of Olives is taller the idea is it will be elevated in Cosmic significance of speak raised above the hills you know if you have water and you have a mountain or if you have water
 Hillside obviously water is going to flow we're gravity pulls it I'll be here Gravity will be reversed so to speak and there will be streams going up to the new Temple of the New Jerusalem but what are the streams they are the nation's the Nations will stream to it into it so this is wonderful depiction of a reverse eaten One River going out and splitting in the coming mini the many rivers that are Humanity humans are rivers in this metaphor subdivided Rivers will all become one and return to the new Eden and you've sorted out of this word is actually the same what river does the word river is a verb is streaming an IV and ESV it's the Nations will flow and Ivy is a Nations will stream yeah and Hebrew the same three letters as the noun River the hot so in the heart
 River a noun and then what a river does is an r in the horse cross the river flows the river Rivers the nation's River back into the new Eden assumes that the poet here has reflected a lot on that River in the Genesis narrative and sees that there's more than just somebody trying to tell me ancient geography this is a Biblical author reflecting back on that River of Eden and he sees it in terms of its symbolic significance as an image of the blessing of Eden to the Nations and you're sure of that because it would be clear that Eden is a temple and the way that on a mountain in the way that the temple is on the Mount Zion flows to areas of Egypt Assyria Babylon and then one of the rivers is also the name of the spring in Jerusalem which is where everybody's coming back and who are the
 major Imperial powers in the Bible it was just only three and they're the three that are going to feature hi big in the book of Isaiah Egypt and Syria and Babylon are like the most significant bad guys in the book of Isaiah this one this is the river metaphorically returning in the people Ezekiel famously in chapter 47 like Daniel he's also in Babylon the prophet Ezekiel he had a vision of the Divine Eden thrown the Garden of Eden Glory mobile appearing to him in the first page has all these animals are the cherubim at the end of the book he sees a vision of a New Jerusalem actually hear it begins in chapter 40 so he says in the 25th year of our Exile exactly halfway through a 50-year jubilee cycle at the beginning of the year on the 10th of the month in the 14th year after the city was taken Jerusalem mistaken
 the mention of Jerusalem halfway through Jubilee cycle after the capture of Jerusalem the hand of Yahweh is on me and he brought me there where is there was like a vision in other places it's the spirit of the Lord sees me or to me he's having a dream vision and he's being taken it clearly to Jerusalem in visions of Elohim he brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a really high mountain okay why would you suppose a fire Witch Mountain if this is supposed to be the Jerusalem Mountain oh I think he's intentionally not using the name Jerusalem because he's trying to paint this portrait on top of the Eden Mountain do you think the language that the prophets used to talk about Eden and the new Eden which is the New Jerusalem and there was a Structure like lo and behold a city
 it's a city on a very high mountain that's connected to Jerusalem since the Southside Cent interview says that the south side and on it to the South yes that's important but I forgot why I had so many details as he's brought up to a New Jerusalem Mountain View and then I see well I guess what it says south side but side is not in Hebrew it's just to the South End. From the south I'm not sure why that significant I know that it is but I don't never mind but yes up there is a structure of a city then what does he's going to get a tour in verse five and behold there was a wall outside of a house which is the temple he gets a tour of a new Temple in a New Jerusalem on a high exalted Mountain that so that is a framework this is actually one of the most boring sections as he killed to read
 straight up reads like an architectural tour is all these measurements he's going in the gates and looking at windows and altars and so on so once the tour finishes and is he can 47 oh wow is that long 7 chapter tour of a Visionary Temple of the house Temple and behold water was flowing from under the threshold of the House of the temple to the east because the entrance of the house face the East like the temple and like I really when they were expelled from Eden they've been released to the East and the water was flowing down from under from the right that is the east side of the house from the south of the altar know from the right that is from the south of the house that is from south of the Elder so he let me out by way of the north gate and let me around on the outside to the outer gay
 the faces East and look water was trickling out from the South Side trickling out from the south side but it was heading east out from under the threshold of the south gate but then as it trickles out it starts to her how do you store in which means it's heading down the hill towards the dead see if this is correct well whatever it is so then there's the man who is named Angel but he's never called my angels just called him and went out and he measured the water thousand cubits and he led me up to my ankles he led me another thousand cubits up to my knees another thousand cubits he led me in up to my waist another thousand and I can't cross this thing just like flooding the point is is within a short distance it becomes a wide wide deep
 I do that the emphasis of all these steps is I see a thousand cubits a cubits and a half something like that so when is this from a trickle within a few thousand super-deep wide river and then he goes back to the bank of the river and there's all these trees on one side and the other and they said look these trees are going to go down into the RV and then Into the Dead Sea and guess what the most desolate place on planet Earth is going to become
 killed yes it will be healed water becomes fraction the word fresh is paraphrase literally says it will be healed yet here we go so salty water there becomes fresh Hebrew healed me luck and I went down and went down to the Sea and the waters which were found and the waters were healed the Mayim I mean down to the city this is one of the saltiest body of water
we can like drive a car from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea now takes 45 minutes to an hour okay did you go down steep hills I mean that a dynamite through mountains to make this road yeah Desert Hills to make this road but before that Highway it was days to go down down down to this desolate hot place where nothing virtually nothing lives there was like a place of death down there that's the Dead Sea region and that place is turned into the Eden the abyss the best yeah it's the Dead Sea yeah just cuz it's landlocked what does the Jordan River go through it the Jordan River yet finally goes into the into Dead Sea region do you know what
 the new discovery from the last year archaeological discovery
 yeah this isn't like wacko conspiracy Siri this is like I'm looking at Forbes Magazine New York Times Atlantic The Times of Israel the all reporting on the series of geologist and archaeologists were conducting this massive survey of the Dead Sea region which is where I used to be there was a network of cities that we used to live down there and you didn't remember when lot chose to go lift down there it said mostly because it was like the garden of God so the Dead Sea what number was dead within human memory it wasn't always dead yeah this is crazy dude that used to be like at Lake used to be a lake and a flourishing Garden land down there new research has found I'm reading from the Forbes Magazine
 a summary that a powerful air burst from a meteor colliding with the atmosphere is the most likely explanation for the destruction of the Bronze Age civilization that lived on the north of the Dead Sea thirty seven hundred years ago
 findings come from the excavation of tell el-hammam archaeological site in Jordan many believe his place once known as Sodom archaeologist Phillip silver Trinity Southwest university has been working at the site for 13 years and presented the report at the annual meeting of the American schools of Oriental research I just learned about this in December an airburst some samples from the site show that an extremely hot explosive event leveled the area of almost two hundred square miles of the circular plane wiping out a hundred percent of the middle Bronze Age sites in there is another word for the saying is a survey has a destruction date of burned remains all the time at the same time so these researchers also theorize that the intense shock waves of an exploding meteorite blast shockwaves of a
 exploding meteorite by the meteorite hit the atmosphere but then is a Shockwave from the atmosphere that hits that region I think what I understand from it is that a big meteor splits apart in the atmosphere and now it's like a shotgun meteor headed towards the localized area and then it struck this place in many places but all at once and researchers theorize that the shock waves from this kind of blast that mean the shockwaves of the blast which operates from the explosion that I I don't know the answer but it would have covered the area with a superheated brine similar to the end hydride salt found in the Dead Sea salty team also says archaeological evidence shows that it took 600 years for the region to recover its plant life
 because of the contamination of the soil is evidence painted pictures similar to the tunguska incident in 1908 are the two gusta where a fireball in the Sky by many explosions and a large swath of the Siberian forest was level and decimated flying space rocks
 I just to clarify I think within a robust theistic worldview this isn't saying I see God really didn't destroy Sodom and Gomorrah it was meteors correct but that either a meteor or like that's a false dichotomy of this makes perfect sense because Simon Gomorrah in the biblical narrative there's salt in the narrative right make some turns into a pillar of salt from a threat yeah that's right the idea is there's a memory preserved throughout the region and has memory of it in the Bible that there was a flourishing civilization down there were locked wanted to go that's where Lots settled and that it was destroyed and that God spared some of the family of Abraham from that event the memory preserved in these stories and then that story is given place within the theological drama
 that that was an anticipation of God's justice on the whole region for it for Ezekiel that was Injustice towards the poor that's what he'd pins on Sodom and Gomorrah it's a city where people coming looking for shelter or gangraped that's Genesis 19 I just thought you'd find that interesting what's interesting is your all these archaeologists and stuff finding this and then they're figuring it must be a meteor because what else could it be ya like it's super detective case you have all these destruction layers you have certain chemicals here in the salt in the water you have the destruction record of plant life and their piecing together this looks like the result of other events that have happened namely meteor showers of the worst kind so that's the reason that becomes a new Eden and ezekiel's vision this Divine Life of the New Jerusalem Eden
 and restore
 the bridge of Sodom and Gomorrah a place that in their memory was the results of God judging him and evil are in the lead in their God salty Abyss life will reach out and transform it into a new pc over Waters yet so powerful
two other Old Testament prophets that we don't have to focus on in terms of talking about them for a long time but the prophet Joel and chapter 3 also has a whole set of images where he says it's framed in the opening sentence of Joel 3 in those days and at that time when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem that's the setting of the van and then there's a whole line in that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine here Hills will flow with milk the Brooks of Jude overflow with water and a spring a fountain will go out from the house of Yahweh to water the valley of shittim so similar images bring coming from a place that we recognize is indeed a place watering what's the value of a team
 anger Bible dictionary the encampment site of Israel in the plains of Moab on the northeast of the dead sea level is the same as this vehicle goes out to the Dead Sea region is right and she team is the place where the Israelites fell into the idolatrous and sexually immoral practices that Valpo her to really start worshipping Baal and having ritual sex with MB women that place is healed by the River of Life before when was that was that during their before they enter the land right before the interval and yet they're kind of stage before they can correct yet Zakaria chapter 14 this is awesome
 Zechariah 12 through 14 are a bunch of oracle's depicting the day of the Lord has a lot of judgement imagery like the nation's and Israelites who have been violent in the faithless they're going to be excluded or judge or destroyed but verse 6
 in that day there will be no light there will be no light
 so like it's like to be really bad so they will not need sunlight or darkness in that day that I will not be light as if that's what it says the precious Ones Will quack you late
 yeah I got the word from the the Dead Sea Walling up there will be a man yeah I forgot this is a difficult passage the Hebrews really difficult here I can see our English translations are gone all over the map here yes I was just looking at him switching it used to be that's right that's right I remember okay here we got us a good note says it had to translate on that day there will be no light no cold and no Frost and then have a footnote saying this is based on the Septuagint Greek translation the Syriac the Latin Vulgate and the Aramaic targums the meaning of the Hebrew text is uncertain so yes that's right I actually think no light cold and frost make sense here
 day one for sale in Hebrew is the same phrase in Genesis 12 and it will be on the card it's that day is alone nuns Yahweh or Jesus is asked when this is for sure the sentence in his mind there won't be day or night and of course it's there's no night there's no sequence of day or night yeah but it will come about that ride at the evening time you when you think it's going to be Eternal Darkness
 light there will be like two little lines here that are all riffing off of Genesis 1 1 2 3 there will be no light will where there's no light there's nothing we're just back today one free day one and it will be at the time of evening which is weird which is weird I guess it's saying within our frame of reference when is the end of the day the end of the day or night there will be light I think we're calling the imagery of the light coming into the darkness becomes a one and it will be on that day that Waters of life will go out from Jerusalem half to the Eastern Sea the Dead Sea and half to the Western sea what's the Mediterranean
 in summer and in Winter year-round a lot of the streams out there it's a water fed they dry up during the summer in the summer this is eternal Water of Life and going out from Jerusalem not just to the Dead Sea but also now both ways both west and then here and Yahweh will be king over all the land and in that day Yahweh will be one and his name one the smile so good and the whole land will be changed into a plane that goes on the imagery gets a lot more bizarre but this is enough to make the client you can see what he's doing here he full-on he's reading Genesis 1 and 2 together as symbols of cosmic dissolution Andre
 creation and the Waters of Life over there again giving life to the new creation it's all of these all of these are Israel's prop bets who are seeing that here we are we're not in Eden we're not in the middle and the temple is gone something needs to change and the way they think of that is the day of the Lord God coming and and the human history and the flood reducing handing the world over to it's chaos
 because of human violence and then flood it's a decreation like the flood was and then a new creation new emerging out of the old one and one of the ways we talked about that new creation is water's flowing from the Crypt I think she has the image we get in Texas to take out and then Zacharia he's even use in Genesis 1 yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks for listening to the series on Ancient cosmology in the Bible we're going to have to scholar interviews and then we're going to finish up with a question and response episode so if you'd like to submit a question for that upcoming queuing are we love to hear from you the deadline for submissions is June 18th you can record yourself asking a question try to keep it around 20 or 30 second I just know your name or your from send us your questions by June 18th email that to info at bible project.
