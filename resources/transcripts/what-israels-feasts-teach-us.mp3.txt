Israel were slaves in Egypt God confronts their slave driver the Pharaoh with ten plagues the 10th of which is called Passover and celebrating Passover is the first Feast that is realistic. Passover is celebrated every year and it marks the beginning of a new year so let's imagine ourselves into a culture of escaped Israelite slaves for many generations we were there but then on the night of our deliverance our leader Moses LED our calendar resets too today first day of a whole new creation for us and then on this new calendar that gives them a new Rhythm every week a weekly Sabbath you go turning out into the Wilderness where you're wondering where your food and water is going to come from and what you're told is take every seventh day don't go gather any food do no work don't do what you need
 do to survive in the ritual of Sabbath becomes the center of an entire calendar year going to become a guideline not just for a weekly rest and station for my work but it's going to turn into a seven times over network of annual Rhythm by which we rest and do not work seven sacred beasts at the first of which is Passover in each one of these is called a moped a meeting time as we read about these meeting times in Leviticus were struck by how important our calendars are none of us are born into the world with a neutral calendar our calendars are structured by values in the story how we structure our time structures are values now we see the world and John Collins this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I read the third movement of Leviticus and we take a deeper look at the seven sacred feast day
 we imagine being there celebrating them and we discussed the meaning beneath them thanks for joining us here we go
blue Tim Energon hello we are in Leviticus and we are going around the corner here getting towards the end of our conversations in Leviticus of a case has three literary movements and we are in the third we are such movements yeah but we would call Leviticus chapter 17 227 are set apart as a coherent meaningful section within the book through all kinds of literary cues for how the books organized through repetition and patterns and throw on some random ancient Israelite lock code that you've heard and thought that's funny the real good chance it's in this section and it's because this is all about ways that Israel
 were slaves in Egypt rescued by got out of that Empire are now moving through the Wilderness and they're going to get into a new land where there's other people around with their kind of rituals and Customs it's all about how this people can form an identity which shows that they are they are uniquely set apart for one God which the Bible claims is the Creator and sustainer of all life I am I am the name of the spiritual being as I am or he is depending on how you say and this section begins with Yahweh thing to Moses to then say to everyone look the Egyptians have their way of kind of doing things and appeasing their gods and living and Community the Canaanites where you're heading towards they have there
 way and we also can I get these hints of like this Wilderness stuff going on give me another Spiritual Beings Are Spiritual Beings that they could like worship and get sacrifices to but you all are going to live dedicated to me and so I'm going to give you rules that are going to establish how you live in community with each other that sets you apart from these other nations but then also will embody you always wisdom for what it means to live in right relationship with each other that's right in the context of a ancient near Eastern tribal network of families living at the transition of Ron's Tire changes the reason why that's important is just the rules given to them very much assumed that cultural context which doesn't mean that nobody else can learn for them but what it means is to hear the Divine wisdom that God's giving to the Israelites knowing that ancient context is really
 important because some of them you just want to copy and paste like we were going through I think was a chapter 19 and you didn't read it but the edge of the screen or your reading maybe was verse 33 When a Stranger resides in your land you shall not do him wrong it's the Immigrant and Emigrant with respect the Immigrant who lives with you shall be treated like the native born among you you shall love the Immigrant as you love yourself you all were immigrants in the land of Egypt I am Yahweh implied the one who brought you out of slavery so that you could become your own people
 and there's actually a raging debate in our country about what we should do with immigration and so you can go and just like what does copy and paste this but this wisdom here in men's wisdom wisdom here and stuff in here to like don't get tattoos and what's the wisdom there likely it was something that the Canaanites are gypsies were doing as some sort of ritual to another God so it's like hey like don't do that tattoos is along with the prohibition of don't make any Cuts along your body and don't round off the side growth of your hair or cut off the edges of your beard and those things that particular meaning and significance in their cultural setting so we won't go down the rabbit hole but the point is we're not approaching these rules with Integrity if we just kind of cherry-pick some copy and paste them
 without reading all of them to see the wisdom that integrates them all together into one statement for Israel so we can do the wisdom of God that you would speak through scripture do us part of my last conversation we also noted at the beginning and ending of Leviticus 19 which is at the center of little Triad of laws setting Israel apart from the nation's was that honoring the Sabbath resting on every seventh day was just as important a way of marking their identity of reshaping their loyalties as all of these other commands weekend kind of I mean not really though cuz my social location a weekend is two days so what I want to shift our attention to is how the rest of this last section of Leviticus picks up that Sabbath rest seemed and magnifies it there's something about carving out the way we think of
 I'm it's so important for the means to be able to be in proximity with God and be a god service what we do with our time you could say is one of the most fundamental categories that tells the story of where our loyalties lie time and money Jesus named money you know where your treasure is, there your heart is also said he could do the same thing yeah at least the wisdom of the Sabbath this about is about how our loyalties are revealed by what we dedicate our time for words and so the role of the Sabbath the reason why it is what it is so we did a whole podcast series a couple years ago on the CMAs Sabbath in the seventh day and we spent some time in these chapters of Leviticus so we're going to come back here again couple years later but within the context of where we've been
 now I think we'll be able to notice some things so we're focused here on Leviticus chapter 23 through 27 so it's last was that last five chapters of the book so there's a block of three literary units that begins the section in what we call chapter 23 and then the first 9 verses of chapter 24 30 units and it's all about Israel's sacred times then you get a a short and very dense one of these riddle in the Torah about a guy who's half a Gyptian his dad's and Egyptian his mom's in this really gets into a fist fight with an Israelite and he ends up bringing up the name of Yahweh and cursing it and people are so shocked that they take him before Moses and Moses asked Yahweh what to do
 now it says execute him outside the camp for you so that's that story let me go back to three more chapters chapter 25 26 27 that talk about the Sabbath year the Jubilee year and then forecast is real time in the land of the time of blessing that will likely result in Exile seven times over and that's the last litter a unit of the book so it's a big Triad like the outer pieces of bread as you stay on east side of the sandwich are about a hyper dedication of Israel time on large and small scales everywhere in between to Yahweh so that what they do with their time tells the story of who they are in the world and those are sandwiched around a little little story about somebody who curses the name of Yahweh
 and finds that by cursing the name of their creator lead someone to death so what do I do is that story I think kind of the latter half of this conversation but I want to just kind of take you to these units and turn cuz there's so many little kitties here
so let's start with Leviticus 23 and
 these are our three sections here in Leviticus 23 1 through 24 93 literary units that are all about the marking of sacred time in Sabbath so chapter 23 is the chapter in the Torah want us to that list all of the main feasts of Israel so here I'll just read a standard English translation are the American Standard yeah we spoke to Moses saying speak to the sons of Israel and say to them you always appointed times which you shall Proclaim as holy convocations my appointed times are these and then what follows are a list of seven legalese it's a list via the speech of y'all way to Moses that is a list and this was the introduction to it last year the appointed times oh yeah
 stars are set in place to Genesis 1 Mark these appointed times yeah so the Hebrew word for appointed time mode means very much. Hebrews coming in Moab Moab so this word appears for the first time in Hebrew Bible yeah in the 7-Day Christian story but you notice and meaningful and just one verse 14
 God said let there be lamps Tuesday translated lights but it's the word for lamp like the lamps that are on the menorah called the same word not war Let There Be lamps up in the dome of Disguise two separate day from night and let them be as symbols signs
 and for Monett Mo Adam weighed 14 * x + 4 days and 4 years so that was so interesting is depending on the Khan sexy lyrics translated in English translations of Genesis 1 has Seasons with make us think of the winter fall spring it does make sense or has been certain places it during certain Seasons I think I don't know so it comes from the verb yard which means those do not sound alike at all well you put a m m m on the front and then the yeah turns into it all then you have mow it yacht and the reason why well anyway who cares his neck language awesomeness the standard meaning of amyloid is a time or a place for a meeting the time or place you mean
 time and place to meet up yeah this is like when you are so great the reason why I know this Hebrew word is because actively with our chief operating officer working through what's a good like annual Rhythm I like how we work together and we start calling about product mode yeah it's spelled well not spelled like this but every but influence from this word but Wade yeah how do you meet the time or place for which we come together at the appointed times is a translation that speaks more to the activity that you do to arrange a time to appoint it that's not quite what it means it's a Time disappointed for something that is for people to meet together
 and it's the meeting together that's what the core meaning of the word is a time for meeting and it can be a place so this is the name of the temp the tent of meeting ohjelma Wade this is one of the standard words to refer to the Tabernacle tent of meeting the tent is a heaven on Earth place where God and human meet together and then what's going to be here listed in Leviticus 23 are times that are amyloid for Godin pterodactyl place the feast times since the time so they're just two ways of thinking about the same thing
 how do we come together and SpaceTime so if the Tabernacle represents an actual piece of real estate this belongs to you, and in this space he will take up residence and still it with his presents and I can go there and meet with them in the same way they're set times that are appointed to meet with your way because you always still was that time in the unique way and I can find got there in that time in a special way I think we still have within us a sense that spaces can do this for us so yeah translating culturally for myself here we're walking into an Art Exhibit
 play that metaphor out where you going oh well I mean I just recently went to the Rembrandt or no I'm sorry the nurses and use walking in this big room and they're just projecting his paintings that have been like kind of animated at all over but it's on the walls around you and on the floor on the floor and then on the pillars in the middle of the room to stall mat danh everywhere the most beautiful music is this Vibe and your swimming through his art basically it's a space but like you're transported it's a meeting with Vincent van Gogh in a way
 I had so many emotions I was really surprised by that we're just like a mile from the convention center and Jessica and I went I didn't know what to expect and so you walk in the sun with the trim in the whole experience is on a half hour loop and we stood there for almost three Loops overly I was transfixed the well you did have kids with you we had our kids with us this is like a day date when the boys were at school and yeah I felt like I was going to cry but then like just in awe but then sad are there was a whole section of portraits depicted scenes of people who were in poverty or hunger from the European Countryside I think it was a potato famine something use anyway that was a Sacred Space and you feel like you missed the mind of the person who painted all these paintings
 thank you for that it's a good analogy
 I was going to go more blonde and I'm just like when I go for a hike up on Mount Hood in the summer is see the whole Pacific Northwest do you do that for me as a kind of place the sacred and we also understand this was time in terms of like there's just something so magical about Christmas Eve you know it's just like another winter night but just something about it filled with meaning and expectations you smell the Christmas tree like there's just all the things and it just creates this moment in time but yeah that's it okay so let's imagine ourselves into a culture of escaped Israelite slaves and for many generations we were there but then on the night of our deliverance our leader Moses said he's met with the God who wants to deliver us saying our calendar resets to today this night first day
 a whole new creation for us first day of the new year and so you hold calendars reset by the night of your deliverance is super cool and then as you go running out into the Wilderness where you're wondering where your food and water is going to come from your Gods providing food for you and what you're told is pay 37 Stay Don't Go gather any food do no work don't do what you need to do to survive the weekly Sabbath that's right now they're traveling in the two months into the Wilderness after they left and so now we're camped out of the mountain and we're coming up on a year of being here and that practice that y'all were invited us into as a whole people is now being turned into a guideline
 going to become a guideline not just for a weekly rest and cessation for my work but it's going to turn into a seven times over network of annual rhythms by which we Reston do not work and each one of these is called a Moet a meeting time and a meeting place so he was here the first one is the weekly Sabbath for 6 days work may be done but on the seventh day there is to be a Shabbat Shabbat on a Sabbath Sabbath in Ultimate Sabbath total Sabbath and that is a holy convocation what is this what translation is this where that mean American Standard what is a convocation wonderful see what other
 C&I visas assembly assembly assembly for Gathering is the word to call out to or summon summoning summoning you get everybody together and it's a holy assembly together throughout the week for all kinds of reasons we're going to go for a hike we're going to go take the herd to graze up on that hill so a group will assemble but this is an assembly that is set apart set apart for the present and loyalty to Yahweh in what sense are you assembling during the Sabbath yeah I kind of met him just go to their homes and just chilling out the Sabbath meal white Sabbath candles or stumbling into helps you symbol in your homes and then the tradition develops of people assembled in synagogue you know when later Jewish tradition
 you guys do the Sabbath meal that Sun's going down and then people go to the synagogue which is the equivalent of followers of Jesus going to church on Saturday night or Sunday do you think I'm
 do you think the Hebrew version of The Avengers movie do you think they they said Captain America goes Avengers McGraw over in the modern Hebrew or are Hebrew assemble assemble is that the word they use well across the noun OK Google if you are doing at a plural command would be cuter cuter cuter but I don't know the answer to that probably think I shouldn't take it out on my head
 that's the only way I know the word assemble right now use the word assemble symbol assembly that's what that is the first thing about the first one is Sabbath it's mentioned cuz that's happening weekly and saw all of these others are going to be based off of that basic calendar structure of every 7 but what remains are six annual modem and the first three happened within the first 6 months of the year of the first half of the year so first is named Passover and that starts in the first month that kicks off the air kicks off the air happens on the 14th day. The first day of the year on the two-time seventh day of the first month do you pick the lamb that you going to have for Passover slaughtered on the 15th
 Passover proper and it kicks off a 7-Day mohead meeting time and place where you eating though bread that has yeast in it and on the 15th first of that day it's the Sabbath you do not work and then on the 21st 7 Days Later you do not work which is normal being almost but I just like Christmas or Easter fluff so some here's the first day of Passover would coincide with us at my house it would be like super Sabbath or of the times it would float in between and so you would have the 15th do no work and then maybe on the 18th would be the Sabbath do not work there and then on the 21st you do got it so that's how it kicks off with the 7 Day feast and this is the fees that we already learned about and actually this because after Moses and the Israelites to take off we get all the rules for this video
 so here it's a holy assembly where we retell the story of a recreation at the people so that's the first of six the next two are linked together we're just says after the Passover the day after the Sabbath and what's a bus that refers to both be profitable in the first day after the Sabbath after unleavened bread do you offer your first fruits so Passover is always in the spring March or April because the new year begins begins in the spring has been celebrated which is like well over 3000 years so what you do is this is about the first fruits of the early summer or late spring Harvest so you know my wife Garden
 this would be like some early lettuce maybe some early strawberries something like that just so you bring a token offering of the first fruits and you don't eat your first pic you bring it to the 10 and you dedicate it to you, so it's first fruits then 7 times 7 days after the first fruits there is another Feast called the Feast of Shavuot is 49 days later than 49 days later then on the 50th Day from the plus one you have a day Feast Scout shop about and I guess it doesn't say everything of what you were to do but
 yeah this is like a 23-15 you show count for yourselves from the day after the Sabbath that is the first fruit stay from the day when you brought the sheath of your wave offering but his first fruits offering 7 complete Sabbath 7 times 7 days to the day after the seventh Sabbath then bring a new grain offering to the Lord whatever is the this is like the culminating the grain are they having that week so this is going to be your Midsummer 7 weeks after the first fruits which was a week or two after Passover Theory like in the gym is like a summer Harvest and its grain wheat barley something like that and so then there are instructions for taking some of that Harvest and bringing it along with some animals offerings and bringing them to the tent and offering it up
 so that all happens within the first half of the year you kick it off Passover not last 7 days then you are the first fruits and then you have 7 x 7 then you have Feast of Weeks It's also called Pentecost
 does the first three of the annual modem the next three all happened in the seventh month noticed 7 to just let everything sit out the first month 7 days then you have the one after the Sabbath on the 7th day and you have the Feast of Weeks which is 7 times 77 Savas then the next big culmination is the seventh month and the last three all happen in the seventh month so the first day of the seventh month you mark by blowing trumpets total Sabbath rest extra Sabbath day exercise Day first day of the seventh month then on the 10th day of the seventh month the day of atonement every year that's when that happens okay is there a key numbers back from Genesis 10 10 words of creation 7 Days of ordering on the first day and on the tenth day and then
 from the 15th to the 21st of that seven months is the Feast of Tabernacles Feast of booths Sukkot Sukkot it's a seven-day moment you do no work on the first day and on the 8th day it was another floating one so in terms of the Sabbath could happen on any of those days right for the cycle of seven who was interesting is Passover which kicks off at seven day feast in the first month on the 15th to the 21st is matched by Tabernacles which is celebrated in the seventh month on the 15th to the 21st year they're both Seven Day festivals were you do no work on the 1st and on the last day of the feast and then sandwiched in between those are to Paris
 the first fruits and then the Feast of Weeks and then in the seventh month you have the trumpet blowing kick off the seventh month and then you have the day of atonement in there and then you add those to the weekly Sabbath and you get the seven muad'dib of Leviticus 23 so each one of them tells a story you have the story of The Liberation From Slavery you have the story of God blessing us with abundance produce and so you get back to God what he's given to you and then you mark the 7th month especially if this culminating month and this is usually what October mid-october somewhere in there yep and then on the 10th day of the seventh month is the day that God liberates us and save us from ourselves our sins and impurities that our all the Death we introduce into the world intentionally and unintentionally
 taking care of taking care of and then it all culminates in the 7-Day retelling of our journey through the Wilderness to matching The Liberation story with the 7 Day Feast is not how God liberated us from death in the wilderness and carried us through on the way to the promised land and so we live in a tent yeah that's the Tabernacle Festival that's right so you have a moment by living in a tent and what's at the center of the camp is yahweh's 10th and so it's his image of encouraging their little meeting place with God at the end this little description of how you were to make the tent has been chapter
 23 verse 40 now on the on the first day of Feast of Tabernacles take for yourselves the fruit of a beautiful tree take the fruit the fruit of a tree the tree that looks good Noel take palm branches and take branches of leafy trees you know maybe some willow trees that aren't by nice dream and you still have joy before y'all are your God for 7 days I love this so take the fruit of a tree that looks good to your eyes make sure it has a lot of lease on it and especially one that's planted by a nice flowing stream that's ideal and make sure you make your boobs out of stuff from a tree like that
 well what's the current year seems like you're joining us towards the people treated Eden but then also there's trees that we desire will there was desirable trees and Eden Eden yeah but this is the material for the tent material for the heads up so we're going outside of like we've got a got a pretty nice tent probably set up for a family we worked on it we're spending every other night in there so we're setting up this like makeshift one but it's a symbol towards being in a better place even though like your kind of glamping at this point Richard you got a nice bad in your tank
 yeah I like I totally butt but it's to help you imagine that were called to be king of priests the priests me cotton pads we're going to meet God in this tent we're going to have a celebrate for 7 days that God is with us and it's going to feel like eatin this is the moed for 7 days you celebrate your journey through the Wilderness which means it's the unfinished moed cuz it's all about where we're going so we're going to the promised land which is Flowing with milk and honey you're going to celebrate your say that again so the Feast of Tabernacles is about retelling the story of your Wilderness Church of your Wilderness Journey for this generation they're actually in the wilderness for all the later generations so that they can
 reenact and relive the foundation story because I've actually been around someone when they were doing this and that was the thing that could talk about was like this is not our home we're journeying through on our way to our final resting place like that was the meditation for them so another words the making of this little beautiful garden tent is your own family's replica of the Eden tent in the middle of the camp if your mystery light beer and says if God wants to give each of us for a cyclist 7 days a little Eden in our own home for our own family to inhabit and it's a formative it's about training our imaginations to see that God gives us many eating gifts along the journey there truly good in and of themselves but we should not mistake them
 for the destination they are gifts along the way and that's what ya all these sacred times are meant to do to us this is maybe a chapter of the Bible where certain people who've grown up maybe in some Protestant Traditions get a little uncomfortable cuz this can sound like rules you know or ritual and depending on your background you know the idea of symbolic ritual may be filled with meaning and really positive associations for others it may not be but that is what a chapter like this is it was a ritual calendar for Israelites to structure their lives so that big chunks of their time we're dedicated
 to set aside space and time to meet with y'all way and to relive our story as a people thing you know growing up in America inheriting a structure of time has like this residue of a Christian calendar with the seventh day rest then there's two days of the weekend as the residue of Advent in Resurrection Sunday with Christmas and Easter the pretty much the rest of it has all been kind of transformed a lot of like American Horror yeah and fully nationalized the very particular cultures way of telling the story of the world so there's a Liberation day of July 4th Thanksgiving Day which you know as good and also complicated or tents right in their cities federal holidays and so every culture has its own way of structure
 time so that it tells a story maybe it's just as I've been in adult living here for enough years and it's true it's structures your imagination how you see the world sure and living by this calendar for example would seem like such a disruption like you just said for a year what I'm going to do with my family is none of this American holiday stuff I'm just going to do like live and I have one of those who are not Jewish who have their like I feel like this is a hard reset yeah that's do the Jewish Festival to be a follower of Jesus to be a Christian is to be a part of An ancestry of a Messianic Jewish movement so all the first followers of Jesus they were doing this live by this calendar for generations and many still do today there are many culturally and ethnically Jewish followers of Jesus who
 honor this calendar in detail still today and it's the way they express their discipleship to Jesus the Messiah of Israel so I guess my point is none of us are born into the world with a neutral calendar our calendars are structured by values in a story and for me that's become the wisdom of a chapter like this is wanting to challenge some of those structures in to disrupt them with some of these patterns from the biblical story how we structure our time structures are values that we see the world it's just certainly my experience
 okay so that's the biggest 3:23
 come to the biggest 24 imagine Begins the Lord said to Moses tell sons of Israel command the sons of Israel to bring pure oil from beaten olives for the lamp to make the lamp go up perpetually is the lamp in the Tabernacle the seven lamp Menorah you know the lamp that's outside the veil of the testimony in the tent of meeting an errand shall arrange it from evening to morning before the face of Yahweh perpetually continuing this is eternal statute or a Perpetual ongoing statute for all generations on that pure lampstand he will arrange the lamps before y'all way continually
 so this lamp clearly supposed to be burning all the time definitely get that five come and clear it is a lamp stand that exists right in front of the screen that's in front of the holy of holies Yeah you mentioned before that you can imagine if the screen of the Holy Holy like the sky separating the got spayed at the Caribbean Caribbean yep and then you've got the lights seven lights right in front of it and you can almost imagine the sun moon and stars in the sky it said they are to burn continually be lit continually Aaron arranges it continually then there's the sulfates added from evening to morning which is copied and pasted right out of drinks this one of the days of Genesis 1 so these lights signal the shift from evening to morning in front of the sky Vale
 yeah where the reflecting here on a light a Perpetual light that's shining what did shining on where the shining in this dark 10 room before the skies are this is the only light in there so here's the next paragraph then you should take fine flour and bake 12 cakes with it two tenths of an ephah in each cake and use of set them in orders so Aaron was to order the lamp arrange it and make sure the Wicks are nice and straight keep morning then he turns around 180 and goes to the other wall of the tent and there's this golden table and he's to order 12 cakes of bread sticks in a row on that pure table before the face of Yahweh
 and you shall put on each order this frankincense a memorial portion for the bread and offering by fire and on the day of Shabbat and on the day Shabbat which is the Hebrew way of saying every single Sabbath frankincense is incense incense on the bread for Yahweh continually as a Perpetual Covenant for the sons of Israel and that bread it will be for Aaron and his sons so every time you change it out every seven days then the bread that you take out of the tent you eat is the breath that the priests of Baal from frankincense flavored bread at its Most Holy Most Holy bread so we're focusing in on we just went through the seven moedim meeting places and now we get this little picture of what's going on inside the holy place that you have
 and there's something that happens every evening and morning and there's something that happens every single Sabbath so we're working Genesis one seems here and there's the daily marking of evening and morning by the seven lights that sit right in front of the Blue Sky fail but then also in front of the sky Val and opposite the light lights are like shining down on the 12th and the 12 or the loaves so you could take that as these are offerings of the priests before y'all petrol gift of food at the light but there's 12 which is interesting so does it represent their gifts the food to our way or do the loves represent 12 tribes of Israel
 sitting perpetually in the presence of Yahweh but then you put these two paragraphs together with the light shining on them so remember back to Leviticus in this is the inside from out of the scholar Michael Morales remember all the way back to Leviticus chapter 9 when Moses and Aaron did the ordination of the priesthood the inaugurating the tent and now I showed up you he appeared and he was seen and Aaron and Moses went into the tent and when they came out they Bless the people and the glory of Yahweh became visible what do we know that looks like by cloud looks like fire and light and that's called Glory
 so that's what comes and take up residence over in the tents that's chapter 9 in Leviticus 16 was on the day of atonement the one day when Aaron the high priest can go in through the veil he is to put incense on the altar of incense so that the cloud feels to tempt and all three incenses of the other side of the room from the showbread things inside the 10 there's that golden tables bread there's the golden seven lamp Menorah in front of the curtain the right there and then it's right by the veil of the doorway where he would separate is this golden incensed and fills it was smoke when you walk in that's first thing she has is golden incensed and on the day of atonement high priest goes in and he lights incense and so it fills with smoke
 just like Mount Sinai was covered with smoke just like the cloud to send it over the tent so then you have high priests are in these in there and you got the bread here is filling with smoke and you got the lights burning over here you always liked and it's a ritual Recreation of the day y'all were graced us with his presence of the word with cloud and fire and glory and then he goes through the sky Val and into it and now here for the third time in the book we have a ritual Recreation of the glory of Yahweh shining on his people but now in the tent
 that makes sense of the words The Narrative of Yahweh in happening the tent has happened three times now in the book the first time it was just straight-up gloryfire I'm in it is coming down super intense the second time is when the high priest goes in and he fills the room with Cloud everyone's pretty stoked about this yeah but no one can see him he's doing it himself I thought you met with the first one asked the first time he comes down in the Tabernacle at the end of excess with in Leviticus in Leviticus the first time you see God's presence is okay yeah that's 9 Leviticus chapter 9 okay and the people fall down and Shout for joy and his Blessing and you always dwelling and I meant then everything goes wrong so the day of atonement is the fixed everything that went wrong and on the day of atonement Aaron goes in and he fills the room was smoke and just you can picture the scene
 liturgically are symbolically and then the lamps of the menorah would be shining in there and the smoke it would be like recreating the thing that happened back in Leviticus chapter 9 and then here we are now in the third final movement of the butt and we talked about the seven times where Yahweh will meet with his people and then here we get this little picture here of every day there is the cloud and there is the light shining upon Israel this little paragraph in Leviticus 24 it's like a little liturgical play the symbolic Lee re-enacting what is happening on a grander scale by the presence of this tent among the people something like that just at the interesting paragraph but it's happening through the Liturgy so this is where are Catholic and Orthodox brothers and sisters are looking at you and I
 we're like well this is so cool and they're just like you guys we've been doing this for a couple thousand years but has power here something powerful here that I wasn't taught to value or see us so important at least in the tradition I was raised in
 it's actually by sitting in the Hebrew Bible for so many years that it's made me from my Protestant background really come to Value what these other parts of the Christian tradition care about so much in the liturgies
 yeah I mean that profits will talk later about how liturgies can become meaningless and not a silver bullet practicing a faithful existed in engage these liturgies an ancient Israelite could engage these liturgies like Isaiah chapter one says you can you bring your offerings but you neglect the poor people sitting out by The City Gate is like stop bringing your offerings I'm not listening to your prayers right go love your neighbor. That's one way to forget the meaning of the Liturgy another way to forget them and not do it so that your imagination just simply isn't formed by it and anyway it's helpful to realize that it's not like hey either have a liturgy you don't have a liturgy your life will have a liturgy by litter do you mean repeated habits that are shaped by your deep values and a story and then in return shape of you
 and that will end in return shape yeah yeah yeah that's exactly right so the Sabbath principle marked the people of Israel apart from their neighbors and there were other nations that did sings in the seventh month but no people group has done as many on this type of Sevenfold cycle for so many centuries and Millennia this feeling unique to the story of the people okay so this is where you got back out for the Hebrew Bible as Messianic literature this is one screw in the Hebrew Bible that's also alongside Exodus and Genesis and so if you follow the stuff about the leafy trees for Tabernacles so what that means is that for me the reader of this collection of Scrolls this narrative about these liturgies for the ancient Israelites fits into a bigger pattern of a story arc
 it's about God's desire to bring his people into the ultimate Eden of new creation and on the way they can prepare themselves for New Creation by participating in every Sabbath I think that's what it means to sit in a little Eden Tree tent for 7 days a year that is one way that you could prepare yourself for the new creation and there are other ways you could do that but this was a way that God has the ancient Israelites to do it and we would I think before us not to pay attention to the wisdom it's in there though in the early Jesus movement it became clear that is the Jesus movement became more and more Multicultural that the spirit was leading different followers of Jesus from different cultural backgrounds to begin to adapt all this to their own home culture and so these are the debates about Sabbath
 great and holy days and holidays come up in Paul's letter to the Romans Roman Christians were struggling with this relation Christians or the Christians and cloths and kind of their own ways but this was a wise to pay it but what they're not debating is we shouldn't structure time and some attention away the debate was which day is and how exactly and that was the debate cuz we just by Nature are going to structure our time accrued to a store
 and for the apostles there's Freedom so we're here you saying is the freedom isn't to just then say oh well then I don't need a structure my time the freedom is in you might come from a culture that does this do it you might come from a culture that doesn't do this and by trying to like put all these systems in place it might actually just kind of miss the point and you don't need to force everyone to do this but that doesn't mean your time isn't sacred and needs to be set apart this is your talking Paul's guidance in his letter to the Romans comes into play here this is Romans chapter 14 and he's talking about had some of you want to live by a Kosher diet that's based on the guidelines of Leviticus and so some people are going to eat vegetarian only just to
 honor those guidelines other people will be okay eating certain kinds of meat and what he says is less than the one who eats one way I shouldn't regarded with contempt shouldn't shame publicly shame somebody who chooses not to eat that way and the person who chooses not to eat shouldn't condemn the person who does heat for God has accepted everybody clearly the holy spirit is bringing people from all backgrounds into the family of Jesus who are you to stand in judgment over somebody else's servant so if that person is a servant of Jesus and not your servant a servant and so he stands or Falls before Jesus not before you so he says so one person regards one day super important another word for example the Passover yeah I feel each person should be fully convinced in their own mind the person who observes today observes it for the Lord listen to the language
 but I can hear it's a day dedicated for the Lord the person who chooses to eat the certain way just do for the Lord for he gets thanks to God think of the gift offering Leviticus to the one who doesn't eat its for the Lord that he doesn't and he give thanks to God none of us lives for ourselves none of us dies for ourselves waxing eloquent their lives we live it's for the Lord if we die it's for the Lord listen whether we live or die
 we belong to the Lord are all of us all of our time over being yeah yeah you can watch Paul taking Leviticus 23 here which is part of the subtext and he's deriving wisdom from it to give guidance to these house churches in room full of cultural ethnic Jewish followers of Jesus and people who have a different background and interesting Paul valued chapters of the Bible like the one picture I mean he followed it religiously yeah it was guidance of his life but also it was adaptable based on what the spirit was doing and expanding the family of Messiah
 that's the wisdom of the Sabbath in those chapters of Leviticus it leaves the final part of the spinal movement that centerpiece well we have to get to that this is about one-half Egyptian the execution of the blasphemer and then that pivots into the final final part which is about the Year of Jubilee and then the prediction of it all Israel will become like that blasphemer of the name and find themselves exiled outside okay and what is God going to do with the people that perpetually blaspheme his name that are his own people don't attempt on 26 and you'll find the answer so thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we finished the scroll of Leviticus we end by tracing One More theme
 in the third movement of Leviticus the theme of bearing God's name or more specifically not defiling God's name the seven meeting times the daily lights shining on the Sabbath bread that's renewed every seventh day ideal symbolic ritual image of the way is real is recreated as a bask in the glory of yahweh's light and strength is resting eating throughout the meeting times of the year I mean we're not back in he then but we've got a little eating a post among the people if they live this way right what could go wrong it started like Pavlov's dogs right around the time that you're hearing the bells of The Seventh-Day rest and food and speed sting and you're like this is great by this point the Hebrew Bible you know something's about to go terribly terribly wrong and something is going to go wrong Today Show is produced by Cooper Peltz
