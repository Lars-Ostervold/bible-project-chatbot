improve the Bible cities have their origin in human fear and violence it stain who built the first city as a means of preserving his own life instead of trusting. I do promise to protect him one of Cain's descendants Nimrod is the man who builds the Second City in the Bible famously known as Babylon Nimrod has to pick it up as a guy who might be part human part spiritual being a bad guy of cosmic proportions sometimes the bad guys in Marvel movies are just like somebody who got hurt and they're good with electronics and that sometimes the bad guys of these Cosmic demigods gilgamesh's like that and then ride like that and the fact that Nimrod and the City of Babylon are full of language all linking back to the Nephilim and lamech and Cain providing and presuming take God's name and protection and make it for themselves it's all
 that stuff with the volume turned up to 11 Babylon becomes one city that represents the height of both human and spiritual Rebellion the people of Babylon are unified but they're unified around making their own name great humans who defined good and bad by their own wisdom is parallel here to Babylon compass in that unit even in a way that Sandra's all Humanity around one language one culture that claims for itself that what Babylon does is what God wants for The World God wants Unity for the people of the world but not Unity that resembles homogeneity and not Unity that comes at the expense of other people not everything about blondes part 2 is bad it was just the way that they would go about it was going to be for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many and God says
 something that project down
 today Tim Mackie and I discussed the origins of the great city of Babylon I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 it's a John hi hi we got really kind of philosophical matter last episode of The City the nature of human society and ourselves and so would it be just better just to end it all. It's just not the natural kind of way to think about human life as a very dark kind of existentialism of just like this is worth less let's just end it is we spent all of last episode thinking about the narrative sequence in Genesis chapters 4 to 8 where the story of Cain and Abel Cain's murder
 in Cannes violence scales up with his descendant lamech and he became builds the city and then Lemak whose name is King backwards start scaling that violence but also good thing scale and his City and it is day like animal husbandry and art and creative arts and music and Metallurgy and so on but also violence scales and then with the story of the sons of God in the origins of the Nephilim in the violent Warriors it's just like God's like game over yeah you see the potential is what you're saying the potential is there of like how wonderful it is for us to scale in a beautiful way but instead of the potential realizing it's the the evil takes over it seems like the tendency of humans toward violence and self ruin overpowers anything good yeah we tend to do and the portrait of the city in the spiraling of violence through the line of Cain
 leading to the flood is a key part of that can I put it this way we're talking about the predictability of the city or I don't know if it's a better word but that the inevitability of the city is what it feels like when God says man I just know that human everything in the human heart is evil from youth at the conclusion of the flood story yeah God's reflection is man humans are going to this is just what they do we're jumping around I'm so sorry like things get so bad God says he is going to destroy itself I'm going to take this sound like what's a shut it down well I feel like I'm being you right now and I'm trying to think of an audience and explain it bring them August so the story of the fight begins with God saying the end of all humans has come up before me they're going to destroy themselves so call Accelerated but
 he chooses one which means God's not done with you man for it he's just going to let this generation cyclist self out and start a new one just like generation in the wilderness it later and then when Noah surrenders everything got looks and he says well you know humans are going to keep doing this cuz it's just what humans do the inevitability of human civilization if human scaling the efforts multiplying and subduing the Earth it's going to result in horrific setting and situations the city is going to be bad but is there is one among the Human family of righteous intercessor who like Noah will surrender what's the most valuable and precious thank God says I'll work with all of humanity because of the one and then that's where we don't how I'll carve out and I'll find the good the good will overcome somehow.
 stop and the story doesn't say how abusive keep reading and things are going to continue to get a lot more depressing before we ever see the bright Ray of Sunrise if it's the first time it was any of these conversations you might be jumping in and really confused like what the fourth conversation in a theme of the city city and so we just try to summarize a very happy either way this is one through eight of human civilization undoing itself and God rebooting it with Noah at the center of that is the setting of the city has introduced is a symptom of a problem that is humans can't trust God and each other and we've got to try to protect ourselves two cities in the Bible are defined by an enclosure of dwellings surrounded by a wall protective wall to protect you from animals and humans that want to kill you and take your stuff
 some we've followed that cycle through what's going to happen is now just like Adam and Eve at three sons and Kane had three sons that led to the whole thing we just went through now the new human Noah and his wife cuz we're never told her name they have three sons as well and the story of those three sons is also going to lead to the building another city but it's all going to replay all over again so what we are following now is from the story from Noah to Babylon with the biggest baddest City like ever so far in the story of the Bible and it becomes the like the narrative beginning of the biggest fattest City in the Bible that last all the way to the final pages of the Christian Bible in Revelation so I have three sons Shem
 come and sit by you stay the material and then when they're introduced this is Genesis 9 verse 18 ham is singled out and you're just old is the dad of a guy named Canaan just took that away reader you'll need that cuz we'll know a lot about came in later and from these three sons of Noah all the land was scattered and that's where this story is going already pointing forward to the scattering of Babylon to begin to be a man of the ground and he planted a Vineyard like an Adam Gardner member of the word ground is the word rhymes with Adam and then also he's planting a little garden which is what God did it in Genesis chapter 2 and he drank of the
 so he consumed the fruit of his garden and enjoy all the food. And mine is a tree so he drank of the wine of a Vine and he became drunk and he uncovered himself in the middle of its 10 so they can send the fruit of his garden and at least two nakedness so instead of consuming the fruit of the garden leading to life which was the point of Eden somehow this led to something else yeah this is all very cryptic and riddle like and it's assuming that you're going to compare these two this four lines in the story
 that is recounting in parallelism the whole spectacle chapter in Genesis 3 Genesis 2 and 3 but the planting of a garden the enjoyment of the food but something foolish related that food that weighs 2 nakedness is very condensed version of that near the pattern of Adam and Eve story so then we're told that ham and then I'll start again remember he's the dad of Canaan super super important to keep that and looked upon the nakedness of his father that's the first if that's making this looking on the nakedness of his father I think we'll just say we have a whole episode we really dive deep into the scene where the slanted for me was when they're the law and one of the Medicus chapters 18 and 20 this was a very specific phrase talked about sexual intercourse with your father's wife the nakedness of a father
 is a Hebrew idiom for a man's wife should not have sex with the nakedness of his father that is with his father's wife and that is what the phrase means here oh and in Leviticus 18 doing that is called the custom of the land of Canaan what he's him and use him the father of Kane and yes and what you're saying we'll just jump to the case there's this rivalry happening yeah Between Brothers Between sun and dad who gets to be in charge here comes the youngest son and ham takes advantage of his father's vulnerability by pulling an alpha male move I move to become the family patriarch if you want to go to that more we talk about that in the first born serious so that's going to be relevant for a future conversation we have about the Sodom and Gomorrah story
 but this illicit Crossing of proper boundary lines is a motif related to the city as it goes forward so what happens is Noah wakes up and he announces blessings and curses on different Sons the one thing we didn't address is the goodness of the father is an old is a metaphor but then as the narrative continues like it's literally he's naked in there covering him for like I think that it's most likely it in intended double-meaning okay so I see cuz they cut her is drunk so like there's something shameful about being passed out drunk in your tent but then there's also something shameful about him wanting to take advantage of his father and then yeah so the two brothers sham and japheth they get a blanket and they cover their dad Emily mom who's there
 don't look you know so funny cuz we ended the last episode of black man but he's if you have one blameless guy in the first story is like he's drunk in his tent and his kids are taking advantage of the situation really hands the bad guy here but no it's just a fool he's a fool and that's kind of like Adam and Eve there more depicted us foolish making a poor decision of the Snake Here used to sneak a guy yeah I noticed that it's about him seeing which is the woman saw that the tree was good and then she at she gave me her husband was a foolish saying in the fullest taking and then they saw they were naked now here's a guy who's like this don't happen in Eden because of the snake now here's a guy Who's acting snake-like and he's the one who sees the nakedness taking the vocabulary of the Eden story but where it's always twist sew Noah wakes up
 he pronounces a series of blessings and curses and what he says it's a cursed be Canaan and you like the one who did this thing come from a perspective much later cuz much later perspective where we know that one of the biggest complex is going to be between Israel and these people group called the Canaanites also we were told multiple times hams was the father of Canaan so yeah it's cursed be Canaan is both in Israel's historical experience the Canaanites were kind of their arch-rivals right but this wasn't even written during that time this was written then well beyond that reflecting on that indicated is no longer there's no longer like the Canaanites that Israel's to deal with Israel's in like a stop in the Babylon right I feel like that's the thing to deal with so just just wait for okay. Just wait for it so we'll all were told is that the lineage through ham this guy named Cain
 I think likely is the implied offspring of this Union between Harrow and stats wife didn't say that but I think the narrative design implies it that lineage will become a servant to his brothers
 blessed be our window him of sham a sham that mean you always can be Associated that's where Abraham comes from and let Cain and be his servant May Elohim and large and let him dwell in the tents of Shem and what can be a servant so Three Sons shamen yaphet are Associated Bank's could go great for them because they learn how to do well in one tent and unity and they will rule Canaan Canaan will be underneath those and Canaan is this literary like character that represents the seed of the snake and what we're going to find another genealogy with a couple narratives
Genesis chapter 10% called the table of Nations and Begins by saying these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem ham chase us who were born and there were born to them Sons After the flood and then it's a list of all these different descendants from these three times so we get a list of the sons of japheth is 14 less than two sets of 7 suggesting
 then at the end are the sons of Shem
 and in the middle are the sons of ham and it's out of birth order but when you get to ham I want to just do some of the list for him cuz we'll just buy the middle these are the sons of ham ham had four Sons fish and put and not on a Canon support the genealogy is going to go follow three of those Sons Kush and then mitzrayim and then Canin food who knows he just
 who invented golf
 he headed to Scotland so you get the list of songs from kuch there's eight of them and then in verse of Genesis 10 verses 8 to 12 is all a little narrative crammed into the genealogy it's just a list of suns from mitzrayim and then verse 15 list of songs from cancel this narrative is just thing and it's about how could she had one more sun
 coach became the father of nimrod it's all like the next generation of phones or is this like son after sin after sin so Kush we're seba and have a la it's not. Yeah yeah yeah he's like all coaches like they're the brothers or is this like the sons of kush were and then it was five sons and their brothers they're all brother. Yep and then it singles out one brother, and then it talks about his two sons okay and then all the sudden told 5 and we will now the nerves just really wants to focus on certain things yes so the father of nimrod so Nimrod in Hebrew means we will reveal it's also the Semitic name of a city
 nemrud that was way out in the Mesopotamian Plains keep reading he began to become a mighty warrior in the land and well you're saying this is the same word used to describe the Nephilim are described his Nephilim reminder Warriors men of the name that are there described in Genesis 6 and they were created from this you know The Offspring of Sons of their associated in the land at that same time when they have interesting OK same time
 Sandra Haynes Bridge are clearly this is the son of kush who is the son of a son of these aren't sons of Elohim I'm just wait for it he was a mighty warrior before y'all like and I think before y'all way doesn't mean like he had a really happy happy like you always tell him yeah yeah we saw him or before can actually mean quite a lot of things that can even mean if you were to compare or in the presence of Yahweh this guy is a big deal he's a mighty warrior to contrast and be all the way in and innocence yeah what you always powerful he's actually called a boar in the poem The Mighty Warrior about his overthrow Farrah okay so you know you always in my
 an animal Slayer there for people say like Nimrod a mighty warrior Hunter before y'all are people love he's a man of the name people out to celebrate his name like you know maybe you're like an Archer and you win with Mike the contest in your city and people say I like you're like Nimrod would you like to celebrate our athletic Heroes heroes in the modern West are modernized versions of What in medieval Europe in in Rome where the Gladiators minus the death like if you'd like the jousting like yeah that's right the guy who can who can take you out that's right yeah yeah cultures of the Arena right your battle prowess on the battlefield or in the arena is how you
 gain a great name for yourself nuts this guy he's a mighty warrior Hunter
 so it's all very elusive but we're describing somebody who's a pretty violent dude and people love to celebrate his name then we're told the short few details the beginning of his kingdom. Kingdom has gotten quite large is the first Kingdom hearing about is all the cities plural that make up his kingdom but the beginning the chief of his kingdom was Babylon and Eric and a card and call now all these in the land of shinar and seen our and Babylon or actual their Hebrew words but they're based on some routes that go back to the Semitic language on the other side of the Eastern desert which is called the akkadian the Gate of the Gods
 portal between the humans and the gods Babylon babylon.com there's one that work and then from that land he went forth into Assyria and he built Nineveh and rehovot ear and Carla and also resin between minivan, that is the great City residents of the greasy it's either resin or it could be that all of this together is a network of days this just called the Great city of Nineveh called the Great City in the Book of Jonah the phrase this is the great city is used twice and he put yeah right here and then go call out against Nineveh decree City. Great City Jonah
 start all of these city-states and Empires is that Nimrod is version of a name of an actual region out in ancient Mesopotamia and pinning down to what Mesopotamian King that was one of the Holy Grail wants the Hebrew Bible study is going to be an Indiana Jones & Beyond this yet totally so there was that Israeli scholar you got Lovin on important time to research essay on this and his conclusion I think is pretty persuasive he says the biblical Nimrod is not a total counterpart of anyone historical character he is a composite Hebrew equivalent of the kings of the Sargon Dynasty that is in Mesopotamia was a late 2000's
 the first mighty king to rule After the flood so there's a common shared cultural narrative between the biblical story and Babylonian ways of telling their their history and a great flood and the pre-flood and great flood and post replies are in the region is a marker that's why there's all these Babylonian versions of the floods atrahasis and the tail of the fish team in Batavia to have a great flood areas as they live in a flood zone correct they live in like a like where it's great like it's fertile Valley we could build a city here the big problem is it can kind of makes sense that in there like in their history they've experienced it and the way that they process the creation and like the cataclysmic events
 happen is a flood that's right so that's one piece also the origin of the great kingdoms and networks of Kingdoms that made up the Mesopotamian play who built them and how they were built this was the stuff of Babylonian historical Legend and so on this is like Gilgamesh and yes at Gilgamesh has one of them because I look at that that's the point is what you call the saying is if you take all those cities that were just named there in Genesis 10 like they didn't all they weren't all built at one time and buy one person right it's as if Nimrod is like Adam and Eve representative characters remember their names means human advice for it and then run to my house and here's this character who's the origin of these all these Eastern kingdoms and Empires that are going to become the big
 is bad guys in the biblical story and so it's not fiction cuz these are actual places right but it is a stylized history that rapping all of the origin of these kingdoms into one time and place with a representative Royal figure whose like Cain or like Lemak remember the name is King backwards and this guy builds the first kingdom is the first king of the Kingdom so that's interesting was clear though is in the same way that Lemak was like representative of the seed of the like Nikki line of Cain Nimrod is this ultimate King from the snaky line of ham yes exactly right so again of the historical legends about these 1st Kings After the flood
 in ancient Greece to that built the cities that are named hear one of them in particular is a key figure Gilgamesh you brought him out he was a Sumerian king and both in the narrative and in the art depicting Gilgamesh he's depicted as a giant I'm showing you a picture right now of a really sculpture of Gilgamesh and he's holding a lion like the way you hold a house cat so he's a mighty warrior Hunter and he's a giant he's a bore one of the Giant Warrior Kings so the point is that Nimrod is within himself the parallel to Cain and telemachus and to the sons of God and the Deathly way you like all of them wrapped in the one dude yeah well not really did that's the point got it so you know how many Marvel movies with these like Cosmic
 sometimes the bad guys in Marvel movies are just like you know somebody who got hurt by their parents when they're growing up and they're good with electronics and so they can buy something and then sometimes like the bad guys are these Cosmic demigod coming down from another reality and so that's the kind of cosmic bad Cosmic bad now if you're Babylonian or Sumerian you're celebrating these guys is your hero this is a version of the origin of Babylon told by the people who got smashed by Babylon I will keep in mind all of these stories the final had craftsmanship of these stories were by the people who were taken out of their land by battle on correct and then
 buy battle on so there are two versions of the building of Babylon in the Hebrew Bible we just read one of them kind of like there's two narratives about creation it's ringing again about the city of anti creation please read the first one you get another version of it and Genesis 11 and how the two go together a whole rabbit hole clips on we go down in the classroom class from areas from now but here's the other version this is the more well-known story in Genesis chapter 11
 all of the land was one language and unified words and it came about as they journeyed East they found the plane in the land of shinar and they settled their nimrods nowhere to be found. It's just all the land had one language well I guess that's how it would have been getting off the boat at one point I remember what we were Jammin on the one point we were looking at this and you pointed out of this kind of met like one way of thinking to one unified words yeah exactly one language it's literally the word one lip could be a metaphor for language but unified words
 sounds a strange in Hebrews that does an English cuz it could mean the same or it could mean unified in the sense of well you know there's a shared cultural language everyone's talking and thinking so they want to go to the plain of shinar so a plane is a low place to go to a low place but they want to turn it into a high place
 so they said each to his neighbor come let us break bricks and burn them is burnt
 and for them brick was like Stone and thar was for them like mortar what is that it's relatively well first of all They're Gonna Bake bricks bricks Bricks by baking them and they're going to make structures instead of stacking Stones cuz you can build something by stacking Stones has more primitive technology stone and mortar Brig in thar now is like no more precise structurally sound you do a lot more than you can mass-produce them making them and you can stack them if it's sufficiently unified thoughts and language unified structure structure is in town and to the development of Technology just like back in our previous conversation about the streams outside of out of Kansas City
 this development of technology and metal in art so here we have a development of Technology that's going to lead to City so they use tar to join the bricks together and you can make structures that are bigger you can make more of them and you can make them faster and they said come let us build for ourselves a city and a tower whose head is in the skies and let us make for ourselves a name
 so that we are not scattered upon the face of all the land where they worry about being scattered well they want to be unified and they want to remain married and they want to name a man of the name people say his name like the Warriors the men of the names of made a reputation this means honor yep that's right and their name is going to be connected to their unified way of thinking and speaking and it's all centralized or embodied in the city with a tower the top of which is in the heavens
 which surely Cigna didn't do they go to a low place a plan but they want to build something for their name that sends up into the heavens that's the idea here so you might see that and think about humans are getting creative thing to build stuff taller since so just like Nimrod there's a whole back story going on here culturally about the origins of the city Babylon and what Babylon claimed for itself so it's kind of similar this is another Trash Talk story that we talked about some of the past and by that you mean Babylon to known quantity in the context of Sea Stories yes and to say hey here's the origin of the story of Babylon but it was made from these people wanting to be great and watch what's going to happen like you're saying that's like a trash talk so this whole region where there are the plains of shinar it's the floodplains of the Euphrates River
 it means with the Tigress ride around the place and Babylon in the Semitic language that it came from Acadian Bob is the Gate of the Gods the Earthly gate of the Heavenly got I see the little place if you're looking for a place where I haven't heard that unites they're saying we're at not eating not a Babylon so there were many rulers who invested in the architecture of Babylon for thousands of years even many centuries before Abraham or any of that so in particular the huge structure The Babylon was known for was called at 10 and donkey witch in Sumerian means the Tower of the foundation of Heaven and Earth
 a little presumptuous this is a Tower of Babylon yes yeah it was a huge was called ziggurat stairsteps structure but instead of the stairs only being on one side every side it's actually the forerunners of the pyramids and it's the Mesopotamian parallel to what the Egyptians were doing down in Egypt that stair step pyramids so I think that's him and Naki yeah its Origins around the 14th century and there's Babylonian Legend Anthology all surrounding a fourteenth-century 6013 yep that's right this would have been around actually buy an hour around the time of the Israelites in Egypt to that's right in terms of but the way that this this narrative is telling us before they realized existed in the city existed long before that okay
 our particular Tower this one particular Tower was like the most famous Tower of Babylon was known for which comes from that later. So one of the most famous Babylonian creation story is called in Umatilla shoot there's a whole part of the tale of the founding of this Temple structure and it's really remarkable you can just call it a temple it's not merely a tower well the temple is a tough thing is it's a high place you're okay cuz it's the foundation of Heaven in Earth or having dinner with me so if you read the account of the founding of the structure in an Ooma at least it's really remarkable cuz literally the language of Genesis 11 to sleeps out at you so I'm just a linear this from the English translation provided in the volume called the context of scripture is a multi-volume resource of ancient near Eastern text in English translation edited by William Powell and Kayla
 younger so you can read the account and the builders talked about making a shrine that will make the name of Babylon famous it's talked about how they made it with bricks Innovative in brick construction is a high ziggurat they've built it as a dwelling for their gods and so that the gods can do well on Earth with asphalt and bitumen and mud bricks with the summit like the heavens that is in the skies raised it stopped as high as a mountain so the point is this is all this is in the air just like the pop music sure I write let the kids are all into and so the biblical out there comes
 and he's what he's trying to say is yeah you know Babylon is inspired by the principalities and Powers did the stuff that went down with cane and Lemak and the sons of God and Nephilim it's like that but even grander scale and so much so that its founder is one of these mutant humans write the Nephilim the Nephilim but instead of celebrating and we call him Rebel the rebel which is a compliment in our culture I guess it was a bad wreck and then retelling the founding story is instead of celebrating it is actually like part of the problem so this is the second City built in the story The Bible and in the classroom class we go through you can show and the account in Genesis 11 here and the story of nimrod building Babylon is all hyperlinks who repeated words
 specifically wanting to create a name the name yes remember Cain built his City and then there's a focus on he calls it by the name of his son
 and the fact that Nimrod and the City of Babylon are full of language all linking back to the Nephilim and lamech and Cain the humans providing and presuming to take God's name in protection and make it for themselves it's all of that stuff but just with the volume turned up to 11
 so y'all wake came down that's for sure it did. They're not quiet High about you always still up above that's great you know when the skies at which point you would think of you like Jack and the Beanstalk like the Beanstalk pops up in the cloud I always like what you guys doing here but I had to go down to see the city came down in that house that the sons of Adam built and you always said look at this one people and one language for all of them and this is what they have begun to do
 now nothing will be inaccessible for them anything the day device to do this little sentence right here is think I have a charge the full sentence look they are one people and now nothing they purpose will be impossible so come let us go down and let us make Babble of their language there so that each one will not hear the language of his neighbor so you said Babble means gate of the Gods and this is how I always understood the word Babble meaning Fusion of languages so the Hebrew verb hear his bottle all which is the play on the way on Hebrew word Bothell which means Babylon but what's so great is that the word play Works in English too and maybe the it's the word play
 based on the story must be liable than Babylon comes from scrabbling babies so I don't understand what's going on so what God sees is these humans are about to get cosmic
 these humans are about to do something with Cosmic implication and they could pull this off or pull this off meaning what if this is what they've begun to do this is just the beginning of the human project man they could do some really Cosmic stuff so it got something like they could like some people to the Moon. It doesn't say leave it to your imagination and this isn't just about technology this is about humans joining Heaven on Earth but not in colonial terms and yeah let us go down so that they can understand each other so partially it's cryptic and rid of life because you're supposed to know the hyperlink when Adam and Eve taking it from the tree here's what God says behold
 the human has become like one of us knowing good and bad and now so that he doesn't stretch out his hand and take from the Tree of Life and eat and live forever
 and God sent him out of the garden yeah that's always been confusing to but I've try to make sense of that in Genesis 3
 I've liked this severe mercy of saying they could access eternal life like this Abundant Life but in the state they're in if they do that it's going to be yeah I did Eternal misery and it's going to create too many problems so I got to Exile him away and so he doesn't want them to have access to the tree of life and that's on Parallel you're saying here to all this hyperlinking of language Let Us confuse their language cuz if they look at what they can do yeah we don't want them to know if it's not out tree of life it's a great City that in a tower that rejoining heaven on Earth but I'm like really distorted terms and joining heaven and on Earth is the idea of eternal life yeah yeah you know what I think
 we're back to is this scaling of good and bad the human city is we're both good and bad or scaled RC but if its foundation is Twisted human desire to redefine good and bad and to rule over the universe but with our redefined knowledge of good and bad if this is the beginning of what they begin to do a man
 they could do anything and that would not be good in the state I know there's the fact that these two speeches are parallel to each other designed parallel is saying what God is doing in one is related to what God's doing in the other thing we got to do in the one is saying you don't have access to the tree of life so that you can't live forever he prevents them from living forever in a state of defining good and bad by limited distorted human wisdom because of us because it'll scale bad it'll scale bad and spiral out of control yeah yeah the break back yeah yeah and so then in the story of the Tower of Babel that instead of tree of life it's a unified link which yeah so and parallel to the idea of being connected to a source of all life is a parallel idea of being unified in such a way where you can accomplish
 and multiply rapidly yeah which is not in and of itself bad right just like it's not of itself bad that humans live forever actually that's a good thing right it's good to humans live forever and it's good to grow and multiply and subdue the Earth rapidly and be and be unified and innovate in technology but it's going to be bad and so that God wants to disrupt it to find good and bad by their own wisdom is parallel here to Babylon, pushing that Unity been in a way that centers all Humanity around one language one culture
 the claims for itself that it is the place where God and humans are whining that what Babylon does is what God wants for the world okay so you just reminded me where the conversation of the one language came from and I was the family of God it was the idea of 1 people groups saying we have the perspective an answer and everyone is going to become subordinate to us this city and the way it's arranged is the will of God for every other study and we will establish that link and it will imagine of a politician really thought that meditation that the birth of an Empire and its Divine aspirations to make everyone subordinate to the way they think make every other city and its own image is
 likened to the failure of humans to the fall yeah it's the silver market or meditate on the parallel to fall of Adam and Eve God puts them out of the garden they don't have access to the Tree of Life what's interesting about Babylon and scattering is like now you're going to have more groups of people and unify around their thoughts and just create City Mini babylon's yeah so like I didn't say like I'm going to take away your ability Tri-Cities like he could have gotten that far but instead it's just like I'm almost seems like he's slowing it down to slow down and eat any kind of shut it down and out of here in interesting though he did continue to supply them with wife and the gift of be fruitful and multiply and will happen so Ethan is just slow down he's what you're saying I'm just saying what happened the failure in the garden there at
 took away the opportunity for eternal life but the possibility of on-going life was a gift of Eden the continued so hear the desire to unify is not taken away it's just what he said fractalize decision to divide the Dallas Goddard scattered but I am enjoying this theme throughout the conversations of scaling of good and bad brakes and leaving this portrait here is of a good aspiration to unify to innovate to find Solutions let's do brick instead of stone yeah right man thanks so much better but then I'll let's use that technology while the shelters we could build think of all the things we could do but instead Whoa We Could Be the gods we can make yes we can make this happen on Earth this is the city of God the bog tree at The City Gate of the Gods
 name of the city Meats
 which in the end we should say I guess I would want to say is that this impulse to want to create a city of God in heaven and earth together as one United with all of those like the life the cosmic life out there that is a good impulse thank you so why doesn't it why is it bad here because they want to make their name great because or just because they don't know y'all way the true Elam of Elohim like if they were to say let's build a tower for Yahweh yeah well I think in terms of the biblical out there today would say now we're talking cuz that's what true slim will be at least for a little while until it turns into Babylon in the Next Generation the under Solomon so what you're saying is let's create Christian Babylon on the portraits the Cycles going to be every time
 humans take it upon themselves to do this if it ends up in Babylon what if we call in the name of Yahweh and do and build the city like David and it works great until for a moment he sees Bathsheba and desires her and takes her for himself and so we just need that greater than David it's exactly what we need is a city of God not built with human hands. So Daniel will put it in one sense and how the author's to the Hebrews will put it doesn't God want to rule the world through humans how does he ever get a crate city without humans building it I think God have to figure out a way to
 become one with humans so they can be built by his spirit with them by their own definition of good and bad it usually is a mixed and when it's scale degree of Babylon the good is really good and the bad is really really bad and we haven't got a portrait of the good being good know this is just the bad becoming bad becoming bad yeah breaking Babylon and so let us remember even though this is about the origins of Babylon we are being told this narrative within the final shape of the Hebrew Bible that was passed down meditated upon shaped and created by the people who were stumped by Babylon yeah I've ruined yes many generation almost obliterated by Babylon so the Babylon bee comes in the Hebrew Bible this origin story is setting you up
 to conceive of Babylon as as the worst so this is going to wear this is going to watch us as far as where we're going here is on into the biblical story throughout the tour on the prophets and we don't have time to cover every single City that we come across I want to cover one more cycle of the really bad city after Sodom Gomorrah Sodom and Gomorrah another icon city which is depicted us a new herb localized version of Babylon. Not Universal but local I'm so God brings a local flood speak up on it but not have water but fire and then counter to the city of Kane Babylon Sodom and Gomorrah I want to meditate on the origins of Truth in the story of David that's what we're we'll go and then it becomes Babylon
 but that golden age where the Ark of the Covenant was there in Jerusalem there was a small little window of time that fueled Israelite imagination for what it could look like if the city of God took up residence here among the city of man and that's where the Poets of the Psalms in the profits but their meditations go when they think about the Heavenly City becoming one with us and that is the dream that Feel Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament. But for the moment that is the story of the origin of Babylon to mix of good and bad
 cut up the scale of an Empire with a bad as hyper destructive and did prove to be destructive throughout history and I think that's why this narrative is the way that it is there are moments when God comes down and says this can't continue and he'll shut down an Empire the scattering of Babylon becomes the body style kind of like the template for the fall of many cities to come in the story The Bible but also forms the opposite of what a city of God could be which is also a heaven on Earth that brings all the languages together like at the end of the story The Bible in the New Jerusalem is like the reversal of Babylon so not everything about a blonde spider to is bad it was just the way that they would go about it was going to be for the benefit of a few at the expense of the many and God says
 something that project down
wife so is the name of the podcast
 because whatever you're still around here so I'm Juliet from Toronto Canada so tell me what about how you guys first part about our project to our schooling for me to me so much my mom I very very dear friend and Pastor introduced us to the read scripture app and it's been a consistent stable in my life since then what were some of your favorite things on top of my cake chocolate cake out of the podcast Bible project provides like a safe place for me it's like a safe space where I can learn about this Creator God and I can understand without the pressure
 I guess just an open space for me to like you know and I feel like I'm not pressured to be on board with one Viewpoint or another play the word studies and upsetting Hebrew in seminary and some of those were cities were only phone right and then hearing those themes across all the Old Testament and the New Testament a unified whole aisle of the podcast and I feel like even though I know I don't know Tim and John but I feel like over years and years and years of kind of these weekly conversations it's kind of like having Bible nerd conversations with our friends back home and but with these disembodied Voice who are broadcast but I appreciate when they actually do bring people with different points of view in terms of Evangelical scholarship
 so I am teaching myself to animate right now so the video is obviously are like Steve creative inspiration for me but I think the podcast
 the Parenthood series in particular very much saved my face I really really like a whole lot really really tough time so I go back to it I send people back to it it is giving me a way to communicate with people that aren't familiar with Jesus or have been really really hurt I feel like I have a way to talk about it is it feels like I'm talking about something beautiful so if you just want say it like we believe the Bible is unify story have to do with $30
