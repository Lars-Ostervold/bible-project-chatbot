Debbie Rowland on the United series yes as always I am very liberal and handing out gold stars which is a teacher's form of saying awesome work we learn from the last question response that we did on what was the first born that you have very fond memories getting a gold star as a child in class cuz I got them so really it's so you like to head out gold stars I do and so you think there's a lot of Goldstar Goldstar candidates hear about the anointed podcast conversations great questions I've always try to select like the top most repeated ones
 and there was some Runway winners on that front and but also sprinkled in are lots of great observations that you all are making as we're learning to read the Bible together and see design patterns and hyperlinks and so there's a lot of that good stuff in fact let's just let's just start with the crate observation and a question comes from John in Arkansas about anointing in Genesis chapter 2 hey this is John from North Little Rock Arkansas y'all talked about how in Genesis to the two elements required to create Humanity was water and spirit that remind me of when Jesus told Nicodemus that you must be born again of the water and the spirit and John 3 is there any connection between these thanks for all y'all doing
 yeah great question excellent and he's referring to the classic passage and John 3:4 we get the classic Bible verse that football players put on their face over the time yeah you know like I know I don't know 3:16 like 3:16 p.m. to buy paint it on things like it's the burst it's it's a great line from a conversation that Jesus had with a Bible nerds ancient Jewish Bible nerd named Nicodemus or nicodemo Nikki as we say in the gospel John chapter 3 and acknowledges that like he's coming down Jesus he says like you don't really think you'd come from God and you're teaching the good
 and Jesus kills instantly end of like a riddle mode and it's perfect and truly I say to you unless someone is Born To Remember the Greek or again again unless someone is born on a sin which could mean again or from above he cannot experience receive the kingdom of God Nicodemus takes him to mean born again and then Jesus quickly makes clear that's not what he meant which is funny because that's the translation that gets rendered most of our English translations is Nicodemus is misunderstanding Jesus. Jesus is said to say truly I say to you unless one is born again yeah but there's a cutie with that word
 the word has very clearly two distinct possible meanings born from above a second time look there's no way to be born a second time that's physically impossible I'm going to go climb into my mother's that's right that's right and Jesus says okay let's start this over again unless someone is born of water and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God you should know you know whatever is born from a fleshy human
 squishy human man I'm telling you what's born of the spirit of God that's just more Spirit you know you shouldn't be amazed Nicodemus when I say that you must be born on Earth then from above and of course I assumed is that God's Heavenly presence is up on high so if he sends a spirit he sends it from above from above does the wind blows where it wishes you hear the sound but man you can't predict that you don't know mysterious how the spirit works and Nicodemus is like what are you talkin about how the possible Jesus goes on to say listen to start talking about Earthly things flushy things
 and you don't believe me how will you believe me if I start talking to you about things from above Heavenly things and then he starts talking about how he's from above coming down to bring God's truth than eternal life and God so loved the world that he sent his son from above this whole conversation is about how God provides his Heavenly life and spirit to rebirth Humanity from above the sun comes down from above Spirit comes from above and when the spirit is sent from above that is linked with his first little line of to be born of water and spirit yeah because as it goes on he just focus on Spirit yes but if you set it up he says born of water and water it there exactly so what Jesus is doing is he's drawing on a deep deep Association in Jewish tradition that comes from the Hebrew Bible
 we're God's Heavenly spirit that is poured out onto the land to bring about life is a kormoti serbians that we studied in the Garden of Eden story where God's the role of that spirit in the 7-Day creation narrative and then the role of God's spirit linked with the water in the Garden of Eden storage with the birth of the human is really key image and with interesting is that link between the water and the spirit that that's associated there it's implicit in Genesis 2 it starts to get drawn upon throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible so Jesus isn't just riffing off of Genesis to he's also got
 passages like Isaiah 44 3 on the brain when God promises to the Exiles in Babylon he's going to restore them and that restoration is described in this way I will pour out water on the Thirsty land and streams on the dry ground and you act like you did parallel lines I will pour out my spirit on your Offspring and my blessing on your seat or your descendants
 so the pouring out of water is parallel to the pouring out of spirit to bring new seed new descendants New Birth time and then this happens a lot in the teachings of Jesus and then the apostles is often have a whole network of Hyperbaric techs from the Hebrew Bible pulled together in the tradition and they've become one thing one collection in one idea in the minds of Jesus the apostles and so sometimes the only quote from one Link in the chain or sometimes they'll blend wording from two links in the chain together but actually there's like seven links fire links you mean passages different passages in the Hebrew Bible that are themselves in touch with a hyperlink to you so this is a good example of Isaiah drawing on the water spirit sociation from the David story
 and from the Genesis story and other places too so great job John I think that's wonderful I think the med of thought is it's true that there's lots of cryptic stuff in the gospels and in the New Testament letters and it's easy to just take them anywhere you want to take them and how cool is it that you can use the Bible is meditation literature where it it does kind of interpreted self to what you're calling hyperlinks in and that's cool that it's just weird doing it in community here it is so awesome Waco John and way to go Stephanie from Colorado who made it just an awesome observation about the flood story in a pretty cool badass sir definitely let's hear from you hi my name is Stephanie Hunter and I'm from Denver Colorado I have a question about the anointed series and the thing
 if against of olive oil as a means to Mark anointed ones in the story of Noah when God cleanse the world through the flood the First new growth on the Earth was Olive Branch brought back to the ark this signify that the new world is ready to be populated again under God's New Covenant with Noah the Olive Branch reminds me of the significance of olive oil in anointing and the New Testament when Jesus was baptized the death of the spirit of lights on him when he comes up out of the water as well do you think that the significance of the spirit appearing like a dove on Jesus what's your point back to the promise given to Noah have a new Earth and a new covenant and two points God's Divine anointing of his son in this moment thanks for everything you do
 so good nice so good well the Olive Branch Davidian a story yeah the reason why I put John and Stephanie's questions, but the front is big are great examples of how you reading something in the gospels and you have that feeling like I've been here before we're at the sounds familiar and often times what will come up is one main passage so Stephanie for you these little details of the flood story where is the dry land is emerging out of the water you have a dove and why the Olive Branch out so this is another example where the flood story is participating is one of many links in a chain
 where Birds Waters olives are oil are linked together in anointing or purification stories so I want to high-five Stephanie and then show how bad actually the flood story is itself riffing off of something that came before the flood and then where it goes after that so I think you probably know the first one where I'm going to go when it comes to birds and water the spirit of God hovering over the cosmic abysmal Waters this one core image of God's invisible energizing personal presence over which you know I suppose spirit of God are yea and in Hebrew hovers metafit it specifically it's only ever use the birds and what else hovers in the Asian World they didn't have aircraft
 I'm at somehow when I was a kid hovercraft were cool in my in my curly hair have a grass I just remembered whenever I thought maybe they were newer they knew that I don't know when they finally like got that technology to work but it's amazing have you ever seen a plane just like land with hover technology it's unbelievable things that can go from water on the land remember those that's what I'm on the car if it's in the guy with the alarms that are like the Jets oh yes when they're not covering it
 has brings up a lot of things in my mental encyclopedia that are not part of what we're in the biblical authors the words that is specifically used to birds and so right there the image of the spirit in the waters in a bird like hovering and so what God does his he summoned out of the waters for dry land to emerge the Amish are the dry land and what comes up out of the land is fruit fruit in plants with seeds in them so isn't it interesting that after God purify Cindy creates through the flood the moment the flood waters reach up to the mountains God remembers his Covenant with Noah and he sends out a Spirit Wind Over The Waters is it rendered wind in most translations you entered wind cuz he got sense of sense of a man wind but decreation flips
 in the sentence of the flood with God sending spirits and then right through the paragraphs that follows with the water is receding and all I know is sending out the doves all of this vocabulary from Days 1 through 6 of Genesis days and he sends out a dove and it flies over the waters and it can't find any dry land and then finds a little bit and it brings the olive branch and the sequences of day and night song Recreation motifs that are all over and that's also connected to what you're noticing Stephanie The Rebirth of creation is connected to God's spirit hovering but now an actual bird of hovering over the waters to get the olive branch and it's the Olive Branch that's the specifically
 Olive Branch so cool here's what's fascinating is that in Leviticus this pattern goes off the charts and purification rituals so whenever anybody has a skin disease or as gotten reproductive fluids on them male or female or has a touch that dead body you have to go through purification rituals to read before you can re-enter for your rebirth into the worshiping community and the purification ritual that we have a whole season conversations on Holiness about that's right back in our conversation for the year of the Torah that we did remember any of it back to talking about calling the whole thing about all of this. Acacian rituals this is in Leviticus like 12:00 3 of 15
 is its people doing as individuals what Noah did that the flood they're really fascinating if you're in pure you wait a. Of 7 days or if not then you go to the priest and the priests it specifically its dumps that are the stock specialized Langster purification and then they will often be either water mixed with blood or olive oil mixed with blood that becomes part of purifying and then I could sprinkle to Port over the one to be rebirth or purified and then they pronounce clean another words the author of Leviticus is portraying the purification of Israelites an analogy of parallel to the purification of the land that's interested after the After the flood he said that a number of times at the the flood is a purification of the land and I got it always been like okay
 but as you bring it back up here like I just as the land was defiled innocent blood if I went to Donna and the blood defiled made it virtually and pure and so the flood is you do the washing and then what you should be hearing once you've read through the whole Torah when you go back to those details in the flood narrative is oh my goodness it's a cosmic purification ritual of getting the Olive Branch all described in the language of the purification rituals you'll come across later in the Vatican okay so when Jesus say baptism now we have a frame of a cosmic purification ritual happening as well it's fully loaded with all kinds of other layers in the from the prophets okay specially Ezekiel Ezekiel was the one who talked about how God would renew his Spirit by pouring out water
 it's also connected to John 3 really are to renew his people and plant a new Garden of Eden in the land where people would obey the laws of the Covenant lietzke also in this so when Jesus gets baptized this activating New Creation Recreation but also the reason they're getting baptized is because Israel now needs to turn away from all of the ways that has been unfaithful to the Covenant and has brought in Purity or sin and ruin into the land so John's baptism is a purification for the Forgiveness of sins what you call a new addition to this than the winter theme that we didn't talk about an aspect of it because it seems all about selecting a human at first it was a human whole human race but then tracing a line of the human who will Chris snake and using this anointing ritual with all of these symbol
 so it seems like it's about election and selection not about purification oil immersion in water purification of wind and spirit is about purification and Recreation and I think maybe this is just a part of the challenge of the fact that the biblical authors primarily communicate through poetic and narrative symbolism that the symbols can come to have different shades of nuance depending on contacts you do for annoying thing for the Kings it's the liquid of Heaven life in the spirit poured out to select and anoint got the partner but also in God's partner has blown up yeah they need a purification need a vacation that's NADA anointing with oil that's like a a mini flood wash away and purifying to rebirth and that's I think with g
 in fact John chapter 3 and what the best in the baptism of Jesus brings like them all together the Richmond multi-layered meaning of anointing which is why it's such a dense dense little scene it's probably more there but the flood story is actually really key in a way they hadn't ever talked about and so I wanted to thank you thank you Stephanie
 great what's up let's go we're going to continue in this line with an observation or question from Lizzie you're not Texas taxes I love how you in visayas with an oil is liquid life of the fruit or seed such as with olive oil do you think we were supposed to draw a connection between the liquid life of the fruit and the life in the blood that's mentioned in Leviticus for the oil and blood are used to anoint people or objects such as to alter the Tabernacle and the priest thank you so much for your awesome podcast thank you for an awesome question yeah yeah yes yeah yeah
 we talked around this maybe we didn't talk about it in this series we talked a lot about the lights in the blood and it leaves a lot of questions for me and you said one day we should do a blood can study yeah yep I've been accumulating interesting observations about blood throughout the biblical story for years yeah and it's kind of I had a red slapping my was actually at the church and we are singing a song about the blood I was just reflecting thinking about anybody who brought a friend that they seem like I'm walking into a building a fellow portlanders strange set of symbols that maybe that person would reflect these people really are finding meaning in the symbol what
 crying out and then the blood of the Lamb Revelation then you're like covered cover man oh you got a thing video and you got the ages ago during that Holiness conversation, conversation about how strange it is for modern thinker to purify something with blood like if you splatter blood somewhere like that's unsanitary to clean that up. Here if I hated being a mess but in this ancient mindset taking blood and sprinkling it on an object is setting it apart and purifying it and so there's something there in the ancient psyche that I don't fully appreciate ya in a way it's kind of like Nicodemus saying how can these things be and Jesus is not a question you don't get the symbol symbol
 the Bible doesn't just mean it's just a symbol symbols are
 physical visual events are objects that are themselves a little taste of incarnation that are embodiment of something much more Cosmic in Rio so in Leviticus 17 there's a little summary of an idea that's been at work since the Cain and Abel narrative that the blood is the life blood is life in my life you mean
 the blood is the life the biggest 17:11 what is life the life is the animated life essence of a creature whose being an existence has the gift of and sustained by God
 the blood is the life it's the it's the life is too liquid essence of the living energy at the creature because when you said the way you just to find life sounded like a definition raw oh well okay so yeah exactly so the spirit is the invisible animating energy that you know we inhale the moment we came out of the womb and that we exhale yeah but they're still blood in the body
 when the spirit goes but that blood belongs in the body here so when you have a living creature and it gives its blood the blood is the life here but their blood and spirit closely connected so the idea that the blood is the life of a human and the oil is the life of a plant there's a deep connection there between the plants and humans and I guess that it's just something I've been thinking about 2 and I need to meditate a lot more on these texts but what's interesting is that coil members in the Genesis narrative the water is provided by God and then that's what plants the gardens in the garden plants with your iPod to high heaven on Earth mountain and so oil comes to represent the liquid Life Of Heaven
 poured out from above the births Gardens bring the guards about where as blood symbolizes the life of an Earthly creature and then blood is not meant to go into the ground like wow that's before it out I meant to be poured out on the ground cuz that represents the loss of life of a creature what it is actually meant to happen is that blood if it's truly going to represent another life needs to go up to heaven
 the Simplex what the priest do when they take the blood that is the life and then they go past the first curtain into the holy place and they passed the cherubim and they go back into eating and then they pass the second set of Caribbean may take it into the bring the life worse and its pee or into heaven and so does life Essence from God that comes from having an earth okay but then the blood to represent before God needs to go up to heaven and there's a big theme of this in Hebrews especially about Jesus presenting his blood in the Heavenly Temple the Ascension of the blood up to heaven so that's one connection there's some relationship between blood and oil that I think is really rich there's like an inversion relationship or similar on that front yes but where will is the life of the garden
 that we can celebrate and pour out on each other in a way that's actually beautiful comes from eating bread from Heaven on Heaven from eating out to spread Garden life to the nation's and then there's the blood of a creature which is not supposed to be poured out and when it is that's violence and that actually is a hornet and makes things richly in pure but you're saying that he's picking up a load and bring it back up into heaven to take this is where it belongs to belongs like life belongs were having an earther United coming to take the life that was spilled and bring it to where it belongs and that's a ritual a sacrament
 that is speaking to some Cosmic beautiful like reunions of life in Heaven and her specifically the life of a blameless substitute that can cover for an appeal to God's mercy on behalf of the life of the one standing outside the tent so the blood is a life that returns to Heaven Sent appeal to those outside or down below where as the oil is Heavenly life from above that brings God's life to those who are below one goes up windows down one goes out one goes in so that's where your observations sent me Lizzie had to go to a lot more to ponder their about blood and oil and really in the Priestly
 rituals in the in Torah will be the place to go for the meditate on those connections so let me know how that goes Missy
 okay moving on yeah we got a great question from Joseph we brought up something we don't normally talk about my phrase phrase of the Antichrist the anti anointed this came up in regards to Saul because he was against David and you and David the anointed which is the Christ in Greek it's so you said it look at solve the first Muslim Brothers and Sisters in Christ at the Bible project this is Joseph from Comfort Texas my question is regarding Antichrist this is a term with which I am familiar due to my Christian upbringing however you're going to Series has caused me to ponder it I knew since Christ means anointed Antichrist means against anointed or even an anointed so my question is does the e or an antichrist have to
 Wikipedia Christ one of the ones whom God anointed for example Saul thank you for your consideration and response God bless your work 100-fold
 thanks Joseph that blessing really yeah so maybe it just a name I don't remember the moment the phrase entered my mind but a while ago it did occur to me that's all really is this kind of first portrait of an anointed one who then becomes the Santa anointed because he becomes the mirror opposite and opposes God's true anointed wanted to stay but that weird also that phrase has a particular history Antichrist popular forms of well in a form of
 American protestantism that was really prominent in the 20th century and still listed in the Book of Revelation in the apocalypse and I'm trying to back up and say where did such an idea even come from if it appears in the Revelation has the whole point is has a long prehistory in the biblical story and we're getting to the roots of the hear the phrase anti anointed Monte Cristo's Greek entrees yeah it's actually the compound of a preposition in Greek Auntie which we get anti which means the opposite in something in the place of or against like over against and a kind of a kind of means Saul is all of those
 so anointed are core image in the video is anointing to be anointed is to be a Heavenly person who's marked out as a bridge between Heaven and Earth because Scott's Heavenly life has been poured out on you through the spirit and that symbolized by the owner when you come out so the core idea is that a heaven on Earth spot or place or person
 SOL SOL in a case of saw he is given opportunity to be an anointed I need functions as he noted the first part of his story but then once he goes through his failure at the tree of decision a few of them then he his wife against the fall apart and God raises up another annoying voice
 and the twist of the Saul story is the rest of his life gets spent thinking that you still the anointed one opposing and threatening trying to kill the actual anointed one would you get to anointed ones then you get one who's real and the other one is anti so your question Joseph is does somebody need to be an anointed to become an answer and I'll be coming and I anointed and it seems like that's kind of the logic of the story in other words the anti anointed is a term to describe somebody who looks like sounds like thinks they are
 and anointed were part of the anointed but in fact they are working in opposition to the real purposes of God and what's interesting is that is it is how the term is used again in the New Testament but outside the the Revelation this phrase appears in the letter of First John
 and it really interesting way so the setting of First John is a network of house churches that John the Elder oversaw a male plant we don't know maybe around the region of Ephesus people debate these things but you know the letter says that there's a group of followers of Jesus who split the church and left because they don't acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah Son of God
 become human come in the flesh is what he says and so a group broke off and now this hostility between the two groups and he describes that group well he says in Chapter 2 is a chilled 2:18 he says children it is the last hour just as you have heard the anti Messiah is coming
 even now many anti Messiahs have already appeared and by this we know it's the final hour because they went out from us but they were not really from for yesterday had been from us they would have remained with us but the fact that they went out was to show us that they are not from us
 so in this case it's clearly a we thought they were out of the Messiah but in reality they don't confess Jesus as the Son of God become human so they are actually at auntie auntie anointed but then there's this category of so you know that there's been no people like Pinnacle one coming it seems like what is being said here what's that category the Antichrist is coming it's a way of referring to the two roads for Humanity outside the garden cuz humanity is collectively the anointed one so to speak
 yeah coming out of the garden I got to help the former anointed and so God's going to raise up a seed from the woman who's going to crush the snake and be the true human then out of any given and he's failed to be this kind of alternate portraits of the humanity anointed from the beginning but then the real Anointed The God will raise up to cross the snake and so there's just the inversion or mirror opposites of the true versus the ante anointed and so in a way that's kind of what kind of table represent or what Joseph and his brothers represent or what Moses and his brother represent smoke never Moses is the one really interesting for Israel up on the mountain where this is Brother the anointed one high priest tell making Idols in the right there's this pattern of that it's difficult to tell
 true anointed one from the ante anointed where that there's always these opposite forces and representative humans working throughout history and so in the same way in the Revelation 6 up on motifs from Daniel and the prophets about human systems like the city of Kane north of Empires of nimrod coming together in the new Mega Babylon to oppose the purposes of God nuts the driven by the spirit of the anti anointed but in reality there's the real anointed
 who are the people of the Lamb who are willing to exercise their power like David does he know which ones by suffering and surrendering their lives so that the kingdom of God can be built through suffering love and that's how you know the difference between that no I didn't anti-noise it and then different Christian Traditions try to nail down well maybe this will be focused on a particular person in a time and protect the dates and what government that come from nuts the popular American Forum will because yeah because you said when I think of the Antichrist is coming and picking up a person and so then you start to think of a ruler yeah some sort of Empire or something but then you also just said well if the original
 anointed are all Humanity then the ultimate anti anointed is is Humanity that is against against humanity and are against this idea of humanity being called into the heaven on Earth Place New Life new spirit and then it's more of a collective better person and you also just use the phrase the spirit of the Antichrist and so it just makes the whole idea a lot more ambiguous and maybe that's a purpose cuz it is kind of an ambiguous idea but I think in that tradition of the Protestant you know and X let's figure it out tradition it's a person
 what John says here is he thinks of it both as an embodied form of something that's coming and even now many antichrists have a beer and what he's describing his people used to be a part of their Church you so it's it's not either one future end times ruler or just a collective symbol and it's it's both the one and the many and their forces at work in history from the moment we all left the Garden of Eden and I guess that's the I think the Inn with in the Bible image of the ante Messiah doesn't just play one role in some groups and end time scenario had heard you have her the Antichrist is coming what did they hear what was that conversation about so it seems like this is what Paul is appealing to
 where he would teach churches about the man of lawlessness and it died in their contacts it was very involved in the Roman emperors what you're very mean I'm not just being targeted in these figures of the Antichrist or the beast in the Revelation is a lotta lotta Illusions 24 Century Roman persecution in the role of Nero happening in the Revelation people the babies things but I think there's a very good case to be made there till like a Roman Emperor was never an anointed person or a person in the Christian Club decided I'm out they are a ruler Foods in that place cuz they've been pointed out to Providence pick up as a ruler yeah that's why I pray for them all talking about how in the Providence of God those rulers are there
 yeah just to feel God's purpose whether they recognize it or not they're God's servant as it regards yeah because it's easy to think of the Antichrist as like okay someone's going to come I got to watch out for this person okay maybe even it's like a general type of person but the question in particular was does an antichrist have to once have been in anointed one and then I guess the question behind the next question is what does it mean to have been annoyed one is any elected official or like our King to get a kingdom in some way like you were just saying God gave them that Authority so they were muddying the waters and I'm not being clear I think I could be wrong about this but I think the way this pattern works is that end in one sense every human being is an anointed one
 cuz we come from the earth and are a combination of we're giving God's Divine breath and God's Heavenly life poured out on us that we never asked for but just received your $0.01 and every human is called be that image of God partner the recognize they have some kind of agency and calling in the world some of those human image of God's Partners find themselves for certain Seasons their lives in places of great influence and there is a extra responsibilities there
 a man for those who are really in tune with the generous love of the god who's in the image and some really cool stuff in having life of Heaven can get poured out on her but the opposite can happen in the end they can become an embodiment of anti anointed and I think those are images they're developed in the early Genesis stories to get Express throughout the storyline is so in a way it's like a set of clothes or a set of roles in the all of us are playing out and run and they don't get played out in the drama of human history in the oven the rise and fall of Institutions and governments and cities in Empires and the Antichrist in Christ categories can be fruitful ways like a set of glasses to put on to think about all of those different parts of the human story
 a video on Daniel are overview video the way this works out and Daniel and the view of the Beast and what to do or what is the Beast and that's horned that grows out of the Beast and a lot of it is about does it refer to just one person than one is it in the future or is it part of a pattern that plays itself out over and over again in human history or maybe it's both of those at that video talks about that Wildomar
 great thank you Joseph the next question is the runaway winner like the most repeat a question that points out a story in the gossip that we didn't talk about and you know the more I thought about it the more I thought I was a genuine oversight on my part where we can we talk about Jesus baptism has anything but there is actually a story where Jesus gets Royal oil poured on his head and we should have talked about it but that's so we'll talk about it now so we got two questions of two people ask something about that story how many many many people have actually had some friends reach out to me tonight what's the deal Tim so we'll listen to questions from demetric in Maryland and Joshua in Nebraska they have a great way of kind of getting
 hello my name is demetric I'm currently in Hanover Maryland this question is for the anointed Bible podcast series
 can you speak about the anointing of Jesus the gospel tells us that Mary anointed Jesus before his death with some type of perfume or perfume or what is the significance of Jesus being anointed at that time and was it just as feet or his head and his feet with any of it matter since it seems to be a departure from the old testament's anointing
 hey Tim John and vital project team Joshua here in Omaha Nebraska my question is about the story where Jesus is Anointed at Bethany with expensive perfume and not the Eden juice recipe we get in the Torah a Jesus mentions that this anointing was for his burial preparation and not priesthood or kingship like you've explored before I was wondering if this adds a new category new depth or insights to the theme or if it's just running along the same tracks we've been talking about I'd love to hear your Reflections on what point the gospel authors may be making with the story thanks appreciate you all the evening juice recipe I love that I'll be in the running Eden's you yes okay so there are this is a fascinating little rabbit hole we don't have time to go down all the rifles associated
 there's a story of Jesus getting Anointed with some kind of perfume me expensive oil by a woman in each of the four gospels however their split into two categories in the Gospel of Luke chapter 7 and in the Gospel of John chapter 12 what we hear of is of Jesus's feet being anointed Luke it's a woman who just called a sinful woman and she wipes Jesus feet with her hair and then and John 12 is Mary in Bethany has his feet then you get to stories one in Mark chapter
 14 and 1 and Matthew chapter 26 and it's Jesus's head being anointed by someone called Mary at Bethany and Jesus Connexus coming burial so therefore stories to about feet anointing
 to about head anointing and deep different details from the stories to swap between the two that's a whole Rabbit Hole really happens in Bethany all the stories know some of them and so there's a whole history of discussion about did Jesus get oil put on him two times or did it just happen one time and the memory is reflected in different ways he Tales are told and you know slide between the stories in a way that there's something that happened but it's kind of refracted through for prisms that the whole thing we do have time to go down but what I want to focus on this is the mark 14 in the Matthew 26 version because in those versions Jesus is Anointed honest head which is how you I know it's a king or exactly versions Passover
 Passover in Jerusalem final showdown and Jesus had been seems like going in or stage nearby some friend's house in Bethany which is a town just east of Jerusalem obey Thani means House Of The Afflicted one or House of the first one and then Mark's version it says it's the home of Simon the leper most likely referring to one of the people that Jesus healed of skin disease and then the guy was like Jesus anytime you want to come by my house you're welcome to stay the same the leper and universally having dinner and
 there's a woman that comes with a vial of costly perfume of pure nard which is you know some Eastern Asian plant but it's point of perfumed oil base water base
 anyway she breaks it open and pours it over his head and the disciples are really shocked because this is like some premium premium thousand two thousand dollars some like that really really fancy and this and like that this could have been sold and given to the poor which is a great Point yeah you know but Jesus says leave her alone she's done something really beautiful
 and then he says you will have the poor with you after this weekend you can sell some stuff and you'll have a chance to serve the poor in my name but I'm here right now and something's about to go down she has anointed my body for burial so I say to you wherever the good news is announced around the world what this woman did will be spoken of in memory of her so what's interesting is anointing corpses with oil and perfumes they do that after your dad though yes so that was because cuz they're going to start stinking exactly the Egyptians have their own version of dealing with that with embalming and then doing the oils and fragrances
 so there's multiple things coming together here cuz usually anointing is a sign of God's Heavenly Life coming on the head of a electric chosen leader and we know as a reader that's already happened to Jesus not with the symbol of the oil that was the reality of what the symbol pointed to it which is water and spirit so not sense that was pointing
 but now here we have an anointing on his head but all of the what you think the symbol with me and is all being like inverted and I think very intentional way that the anointing for a king is to celebrate their Rule and so it's celebrating their life and hear the anointing is to prepare for Jesus death that's right the gospel authors are going to make very clear implicitly through Jesus's crucifixion narrative that this is how he becomes king through death he's inaugurated you know pilot famously says behold the man which is like kind of the parody of a presentation of a new ruler you know the hold your king and they put the sign up sign up King of the Jews get the crown to get the scepter he gets his robe yeah
 so the gospel out those are all leading up to the fact that Jesus actually becomes the anointed king they're mocking it by but it's actually happened to his execution outfitting is it that he gets anointed for his desk but his death is also his wife and coordination yesterday like for sure that's part of what they're doing it's cool and so it's sort of like an inverted anointing story Jesus style yeah where
 his arrival into a seat of power and influence is his death anointing in the same time I also have wondered then if cuz anointing for burial it's connected to what you would do in a grave that there's something about Jesus's you know he's going to descend to the grave and so the anointing Barrett for burial is like that but that decent to the Grave is inverted by his Ascent into Cosmic rule you know in his resurrection and Ascension so I think the point maybe the answer both the metric and Joshua question is this is a creative Twist on the Hebrew Bible patterns of anointing but not in a way that dismisses them it's a creative inversion to make a powerful point that it's through Jesus death that he becomes the king that the true anointed one
 who unites Heaven and Earth but by giving his life instead of taking receipt and seizing it through violent power
 powerful stuff so there you go now we officially talked about that store. That seems par for the course for the Bible to do twists and turns with the theme you know and then it seems par for the course for the gospel authors to say the way that you're the way that power comes and true rule comes is upside down and so what a beautiful moment with the anointing theme
 gets this little twist
 yeah yeah it is totally awesome
well there you go we received so many great questions more than we can respond to thank you for these great ones that were sent him yeah thank you for how powerful the questions are that you spend time thinking about them and sending them in and we wish we could share all of them and give everyone called Stars you all deserve them okay so that wraps up I know he said we'll have a video on anointed coming out soon and I realized I never sighted this in our conversations but if anyone is interested in anointing and the ancient world or in the history of the church the number of questions came up that we didn't have time to get to about how the anointing ritual lived on and Christian Church History where we started that I learned a lot from in
 researching for this is an edited essay collection called the oil of gladness anointing in the Christian tradition edited by a church historian Martin Dudley will put a link I think in the show notes for the podcast but it's like everything from anointing an ancient Mesopotamia to the Roman Greek and Roman world to Israel early church and then like in the history of Catholicism or in the Orthodoxy or in eastern Orthodoxy in the Catholic church and anglicanism in different products that is everything all in one the topic of Interest check out that volume that's really helpful resource they only one like it that I know of on that team cool okay you know this podcast is a whole team of people amazing and
 from memory of see if I could do this I'll help you okay if I can so producer for Peltz Cooper he does a lot around here and one thing is in pretty soon the entire body and really it's a whole team people it's right to her on the ground but then there is a lot of editors involved or lead editor has been has been around from really the beginning and then we've got Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza doing at is Tyler Bailey also does an audio mix special shout-out for that how do you mix and great taste in children's books this podcast is on all the podcasts out there but it's also on our app and if you go to a rap there's an annotated feature where if you said hey you should check out the oil of gladness
 it'll show you a link to that book and you know who does that and I will and I will thank you Hannah at the annotations any cash all right if our project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist expansive I was going to pass with at least Jesus able to do all this and then have it be free because I just put 1,000 people just like you thank you for being a part of this with us hi this is James and Glenn I'm from Auburn Washington I first heard about the Bible project through finding the videos on YouTube I join Bible project because just created a soft spot in my heart for scripture and giving me a totally new love for it I use the Bible project to support my daily reading scripture everything about the Bible project is how I've been able to find a nuanced view of all the stories that we see through the Old Testament and the new we believe the Bible is a unified so
