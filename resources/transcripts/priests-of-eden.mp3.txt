this is John Collins from Bible project and today we're starting a brand new series now if you were to go to the ancient world you would run across temples he's a sacred spaces where the god that your people worshipped lives at the place where the realm of your God meets the realm of human and these temples were buildings but interest in the Bible begins with the temple that is in a building the conception of the cosmos in Genesis 1 is out of a cosmic Sacred Space we're having dinner there one in temples you would have priests who work there they take care of the temple they received the sacrifices and gifts from people and they give the blessings of the gods to the people also in the temple you would find inanimate icon these are idle images that represent the rule and authority of the God but the cosmic Temple and Genesee
 merges these two rolls into one statue at the center is not statue of it's an anime icon in here we're we're very close to the Priestly dimension of the end. The representation of God and human as one in the Sacred Space and that's essentially what is the biblical priesthood is not to be all about we're beginning a brand new series on this podcast on the role of priests in the Bible now I would ask you about priests in the Bible you might think of Aaron use the brother of Moses the very first priest of Israel we might think of all the other priests that came after him that work in Israel Temple but in this episode we want to explore how the very first priests in the Bible were none other than Adam and Eve in the cosmic Temple thanks for joining us here we go
 this is exciting we get to start a new game video conversation and it's on Kris Nest priority number one figure out what to call this video what does it mean when you have the word Hood
 all my examples of rock from the Middle Ages Knighthood monkhood priesthood something good I'm Googling it what does it mean when you have food at the end of the word native English suffix denoting State condition character nature neighborhood neighborhood That's a classic Hood the hood the hood priesthood so the state conditioner character nature being a priest like that basically yeah that's right which this is a major theme throughout the Bible the first person who's called the priest appears in Genesis 14 in Astoria that will ponder and then priests appear pretty much right throughout the whole rest of the Hebrew Bible and then play a big role in the story of Jesus there's Rivals and the apostles use a lot of language about priesthood to describe the followers of Jesus and then right on the end of the Revelation where the followers of the lammer call the kingdom of
 so it's a thing starts at the beginning so I can go to the yeah that's right but an interesting puzzle for this video is that the word priest doesn't appear in the earliest narrative Bible not to get to Genesis 14 however the concept on which the very Roland Office of the priest is built is all baked into what's going on page one into the chances but this is our our task so first let's back up and just think meta real quick here because priests the idea of priests and even the word pre means all kinds of things different people on where and how you grew up Catholic priest you got the Pope get your local Parish Parish priests same for in some streams of the Anglican Church use the word priest more or less in Sumter
 inspect of the word father or priest is often used for the leader of an Anglican Parish to they are however to look like an American Baptist the word priest means something different or I should say it has different association's do for somebody who grew up Catholic or Anglican and had a great experience in those Traditions priest refers to the revered figure of a special holy Figure Set Apart they represent God for you to wear special clothes and they're marked by wearing special clothes yeah suit in the color are you get the whole town down sometimes turbine crown on there and yeah that's right it's a symbolic kind of role all the symbolism of telling different stories and they do a lot of symbolic acts Sacramento lacks correct or not just merely symbolic that's a priest what else would
 don't be thinking about okay well I'm not supposed to talk about what the word refers to the association's with it important revered roll the tightly regarded for somebody in those Traditions but that's not the case and all all the spectrums of the Christian tradition are some traditions don't have priests are not in the liturgical kind of tradition and so but still have rolls that are similar fish professional ministers and pastors and style at denominations ordered Traditions that have a different kind of leadership structure steel often have a particular figure who represents God to the people
 the people as a whole the deceased Envision dramatic the role is imagined a different way in the role of a pastor at Shepherd roll but not in a oven in the priest roll Moerlein will the word that used in the Pomp and Circumstances and there but but there's a lot of similarities with you when I first start following Jesus my early twenties and was learning how to go to church Archer our family have attended church earlier with that but I had a long break through like all my teens or early twenties start going back to church I perceived the pastor as somebody's so other than me mainly because this the church that I was going to ask her always wore a suit yeah and I had just never liked skateboard Punk like I never even imagined
 bring a suit he wears a suit is a different species of what I was growing up I had to dress up for church and I remember the line was cut what would you wear if you were going to meet the present United States would you dress up cuz you're going to go meet with Jesus all right I guess that makes sense but yeah the pasta is always in a suit well at the answer depends on if the whole thing the whole thing turns the person who gets up there and I experienced this I was like I think I should I'm in my early twenties when I was working at a church I was quote unquote Pastor I mean young and I would get up on stage and I would try to explain the Bible and there was just something about that Dynamic that just elevates you
 do you like I'm no longer just one of you and I am something else a person becomes the role of this role in office that's it we're so yeah let's pay attention that even though in different expressions of the Christian tradition there different titles different roles imagined for what leadership of Representative figure is priest or pastor but functionally it's very some more similar than different cultures even people who would categorize as the what's what a religious sociologists and statistic take the nuns generation of the nuns they Mark nun ya agent on religious affiliation or the spiritual but not religious spiritual not religious or a religious Universal human phenomenon
 where communities have unique people or rolls who when you encounter this person you feel like your encountering something special something from above or Beyond or ultimate this is Guru culture just in some religious Traditions that there's a special person who kind of stands at this boundary of the normal day-to-day life and then ultimate yeah babe they know how to take out a vantage point you don't have the damn thing special about them yet so and tribal cultures in these are the shaman or the the person who's in touch with the Divine realm most cultures have a version of this so we live in Portland which has a very lives spiritual scene with not necessarily alliance with any organized religion
 Traditions are the gurus I think whether it's did in different forms of Americanized Eastern meditative Traditions or spiritual Traditions so I'm just saying this is across this kind of a human thing a human thing is that we looked at towards someone to fill in this kind of role which is help me guide me to the Divine connect me connect me to that thing that I'm looking for that however you would describe it whatever whatever spiritual tradition you're coming from how you described it even if it's not religious at all that's right so for some people in some cultures and some parts of the Christian tradition the fact that my connection to the Divine realm order what's ultimate and true and real. That's all comes through a person exercising one particular office that's not seeing as
 matter we are as good if that's the way and it's awesome there are other parts of the Christian tradition and especially Western culture that see the fact that it comes through one person as an equal or non-democratic American way of putting it for the whole point would be to democratize that to everyone but actually have an Impulse that comes in the Christian tradition through the Reformation right and there's some Churches you said congregational I think that's a term right where like they actually they vote as a car gation and they even though there are people with positions of paid professional ministers that they tried me what democratic and important history since the Reformation has been the theme of the priesthood of all believers Church traditions in the reformed Protestant side
 who are actually kind of hostile to the concept of there being a priest stepping on the Prague is at the whole body of the priesthood of Believers to elevate one person I don't want to get into that but it's just that these are all like little surface skirmishes and even though those traditions in people in the might disagree about whether there should be one particular person and all believers what they have both agree on is that this concept that Heavenly Divine realm is meant to be and wants to be made accessible and to be connected to us and the that happens in and threw a person or people who play this role and the word priest is it standard Biblical word to talk about this role that stands at the interface of having to nurse a person who connects you to
 due to Heaven essentially his most basic level and using the biblical Jewish and Christian imagery it would be priests are people who are connecting points of Heaven on Earth in my neighbor wouldn't say it that way but my neighbor would say let's talk about the Divine or the Ultimate Energy do you know when she goes to do whatever she does to connect to the Divine it's often led by it you know a studio or meditation Studio she goes to so the underneath it is the scent very deep in most humans that there's something bigger going on and I need access via someone else and I want to connect to it but to learn how to where to find those little channels between my rauman the ultimate Divine realm I need a Gateway person and what we're talking about my neighbor wouldn't use the word is the role of priests or you wouldn't go.
 yoga studio and say can I meet with priests but at the same time we talking about priests were talking about the way the biblical story is addressing that pretty Universal human impulse to connect to the Transcendent in the Divine and the story that the Bible has to tell about the role of the priesthood and the faith of the priesthood throughout the history of Israel and in the story of Jesus it's all super interesting dramatic but that's the basic role of to be a priestess to stand at the meeting point of Heaven and Earth to represent people to the Divine realm that the person that's representing others but then also to represent the Divine to the people so this is a normal human impulse that transcends any specific religious religious expression
 however in the Bible there is a very specific way that this is expressed that will enter when I get into and of how priests worked in ancient Israel around the Tabernacle in the temple and such correct yeah that's the that's the core idea however as it always is with the Bible things are not what they seem priests play Big role in the Bible verse high priest of Israel is an important biblical figure named Eli is another important priest in the spotlight Samuel plays the role of a priest to when Solomon build his Temple he installs or reinstalls kind of a new line of the priesthood through a guy named righteousness. And then of course there's lots of priests and the high priest Caiaphas in the story of Jesus play a major major role so the high priest in the story of Israel
 play is this really important and significant role but the introduction of the priesthood into the life and story of Israel is fraught with problems and interesting complications and the Israelite priests are not the first priests that appear in the Bible which is also interesting so the first place we meet is just the 14th is in Genesis 14 that is called at me he fits into the category of people groups called amorites one of the people of Canaan which means my king is a righteous one and he's a he's a non-israelite priest of ancient Jerusalem the rabbit hole goes deep with this man right that's the first priest we meet in the Bible but the concept of priesthood does a common theme in that comes up in our theme video discussion you can't just look for the word that's important but you got to look
 for where the ideas appear that that word is trying to connect to well and we've been doing this long enough I think I know where it is we talked we talked about Genesis to Adam and Eve well I don't know if it's Adam and Eve at this point but yeah forms out of the dirt makes the split them in half make sieve you're the image of God he plants them in the garden and says to work and keep into know you were doing the right thing I just want to register that there's a unique problem and trying to talk about the priesthood and actually recently just talked to her class on this at Western seminary in Portland like work this all out cuz priests when they first appear in the Bible Melchizedek the priest king and he's just introduced like you're supposed to know who he is and what he does
 he's just called the priest and the narrator doesn't say now here's where the priest is cuz he's the first one your meeting it just assumed so the Bible leaves ambiguous what the word priest refers to release the temperature at if you haven't picked up all of the clues that are happening on pages 1 and 2 as to what kind of character is the ideal humans are in Genesis 1 and the role that Adam and Eve were invited to sell in Genesis 2 for the role that the priests play is not technically a unique to the priests for there to be a figure in the Bible that stands at the intersection of the Divine and human there are other important biblical roles that also do the same thing but in a slightly different way
so this is kind of a new way of putting it so I'm going to try it out on you if you go through the Hebrew Bible you'll notice the almost all the characters in the main Spotlight fit into one of three main categories either profit royal king or queen or priests modes and what all of those rolls involved is somebody representing another group before God and then represent in God to that group to it's been talked about this with priests and what is unique about priests is where they do it if you were to meet Aaron is real high priest like out at the at the well on like Wednesday getting your Wednesday water you wouldn't have the experience of a meeting with God's presents right now the point is is when he steps into the Tabernacle and puts on those clothes here then he turns into something it turns into that kind of it it's about the office in an in
 Sacred Space wearing those symbolic clothes he becomes that Gateway Between Heaven and Earth but not when you go meet him out there but the king if you can't then why where is there multiple people this happens in the story of David multiple times where it's somebody who be talking to him and I'll say seeing your face is like seeing the face of God and more than what I say this to David and he no matter where he is he is embodying God's rule at least ideally when the king is representing the Covenant god well he's representing God's ordering Authority and generous power and Order there and so what the king does can affect all the people and he represents the people forgot the people in the king does that anywhere but then you also have the prophet in the prophet is also somebody who encounters the Divine usually in Visions or dreams in a way that they find themselves like
 in God's presence and it freaks them out above then they go out from that encounter and then they mediate God's message his word and purpose to the people so prophets priests and Kings all have something in common even though they kind of do it in unique ways and different audiences and Realms they have something in common underneath them and that thing that's underneath them I think the way the biblical story works is that thing at the core is what Genesis 1 and 2 is trying to tell us about what all humans are capable of and made 4 but in the story of the Bible these roles get split apart into these a different offices so that some people only embody some of that Divine representation that make any sense the last part again as we're going to see I'm Pages 1 and 2 all Humanity male and female artist
 tribes in this highly elevated terms here going to revisit just to remind ourselves of but then as you go throughout the story the Bible what you mean are individuals who often still part of that ideal vision of Genesis 1 and 2 so you made a profit and you know he he represents the word of God to the people he doesn't rule anything called to is not supposed to impact what he often does his confront the rulers and then you get rulers who embody God's Authority but did they like you know they multiply and love to have lots of sex and then murder people and abused their power and then you get priest who in the Sacred Space and body Yahweh well except when they build idols and leave the people into a Dollar Tree in worship it's as if the ideal role that's a unified whole it's fractured and split apart the prophet priest king role which would be a shorthand
 to describe that roll the thing underneath all of them I'm going to propose we just call it being the image of God yeah yeah that's the thing underneath as you get from the garden was stupid selfish humans will you find our stories about humans who win their at their best reflect part that reflect an aspect of that image of God in a Royals player in the Priestly way or in a prophetic way Never Lie they always fail and blow it and then you're on to the next Generation to see who might arise as the image of God but this is the perspective that help me make sense of why all the characters in The Bible 10 to fill one of these three roles and why when they're at their best that you do one of these three things Prophet priest and king or combination of what sometimes a combination yeah but Moses the prophet antifreeze David is a priest and a King David more than any other character
 turn off 3 until Wednesday kind of a prophetic when he's when he's running for his life the little poems that he writes that the end of his life he talks about how the spirit of Yahweh speaking through him and the others this parable about the meaning of kingship but David would become the closest of any character and Moses coming in hot second the other than that most people are one of those tooth and then when Jesus comes onto the scene he is painted in as clear colors as anybody can see if you know how to follow the hyperlinks in the gospels and the design patterns Jesus is presented as a prophet priest king with all three now that is something I definitely learned early on this Prophet priest king yes terminology the new business vocabulary the image of God underneath of it is a cool texture but yeah this idea of these offices profit
 King have uses his spells them that he is the ultimate version of those there's a small town poets song I know if it's called Prophet priest king will play during the break I think we're allowed to do that they were like a late 90s 2000 2018 school early college earlier with that that that those rules almost as one thought of his kind of like one thing the prophet priest king separated but that what's meant we are all kind of together talking about how to mediate God to us if it's rent each of those three is a different way of mediating heaven in Earth God and people they'll do it and the priest in particular does it in these symbolic Eden spaces we're having an Earth are one or at least you're supposed to be one that's the unique kind of
 contribution of the Priestly office to embody God to people and embody people before God in sixth place in the in the heaven on Earth base yeah that's the thing that I have an Earth space being the Tabernacle or the temple which is Eden and then yeah the Tabernacle and Temple yeah it is you know it's making me think this video I think video on priest though but the way you're starting it I know it's almost like I just it only seems like this is three videos I know I'd actually as I was putting these notes together and occurred to me the image of God silagy that may be the case for where to start this way and then follow the threads through I wonder if we could revisit the image of God video and then just build off of it I do like
 Trilogy that profit takes the same style but then drills down into the first three rolls of videos what would we call it we already have a video called him in June I mean it could just be profit priest-king Spiritual Beings are words that have a common intro maybe I could be like the first 30 seconds are identical and you could unpack this thing about the image of God and the three but then we'll go and Trace priest in the or going crazy cuz it would all start with Adam and Eve and then at some point it would kind of break off and become unique so I don't know if it is a macro work on that in terms of season structure
 the big picture I thought now we could just revisit Genesis 1 and 2 pretty quickly cuz we're covering ground we've done in previous podcast but just to point out and remind ourselves of a couple things before We're Off to the Races with Abraham and Melchizedek
 why is Michael Jackson
 got some time ago
 lost in the mail but I knew who I was missed when they kissed me through their nose
 maybe there's one way to think about it there's these three off offices or types of people are roles in the Bible Prophet priest king but there's something they all have in common that they all embody a represent in other words you can't talk about one of them without also touching on the other cuz prophets often overlap with what priests are and do you often overlap with what kings are kings and queens are in Dune someone they have unique uniqueness has but they are all share something in common, dallatee being that they're connecting you to yep. Took one way to think about it is we live in a world filled with cars filled with cars thousands of lots of millions that there's at least a thousand cars out there I stopped counting after that however the way especially in August the last night I think this is true car manufacturers very clearly from
 people's earliest memories through advertising want to make it clear in your mind that not all cars of the same very clear identities sure you know means something special here in the Pacific Northwest Honda you know so if my imagination is only shaped by Modern Advertising I think of them as totally different totally different cuz yeah I don't know if this thing works when you see a Tesla what comes into your mind that's different than when you see a Supra well Tesla is is different than almost every kind of car right it's kind of doubt and Subaru also the one I think of like the difference between a Honda and a Toyota a Ford and a Chevy yeah maybe you could have got a car guy
 I'm like I don't know I think it's just one of the other my dad he's a big block Chevy fuel anyway but when I think of like a Volkswagen versus a Subaru versus a Tesla versus a Ford yeah totally they have their own identities yeah yeah yeah that's right however they all have something in common that's more important than their different brand identities and that's the thing they are automobiles by we have a very clear vocabulary word to talk about what kind of thing they are cars the cars well the cars automobiles automobiles so there's something similar going on here that when you're reading the Bible it seems like prophets priests and kings are all they're often at odds with each other in different things they seem like they're all very different
 each other but they actually are all more similar than they are different ones electric powered one has a pickup bed the king where is like a crowned with gems and the priest wears a turban crown with a gold plate you know in profits where I love camo iron eat locusts and honey but the point is it's that in the biblical story line there's more connecting them then there is differentiating them and that is what the big part of a Genesis 1 and 2 or trying to say to us every humans are going to meet in the story is an image of God with this particular kind of vocation to stand at the intersection of Heaven on Earth and so when you meet these different figures that's what's supposed to come to mine so the image of God is to the prophet priest king what concept of automobile is to the Tesla on the Superdome
 it's helpful for me and I was entertaining link up the illustration
 okay on page 1 of Genesis humans are introduced as the climactic element in the sticks days of God splitting in ordering and filling Cosmos with inhabitants there's a short poem that goes along with God's speech about these humans the poem is in Genesis 1 verse 27 and then it's surrounded on both sides by the statements about what God has once the humans to do what they're here for more time so then God said let us make human Adam he rewarded them in our image according to our likeness and let them rule or more precisely let us make human in our image according to our likeness in order that they may rule the weather ebru senses put together their that last let them rule is most likely like a purpose Claus have to take your word for it
 we'll look at my butt let them rule over the fish of the sea water swimmers in the sky flyers in the waters above and below which was created in the previous parts of the Sunday 5 and then over the cattle over all the land and the creepers creeping on the land that was the first part of 26 and then here's a little three-line poem God created human In His Image in the image of God he created it or him that is the Cleveland Humanity Humanity as a species and of what does that Humanity human consist male and female he created them and God bless them and said the land and we're back to the ruling subdue it rule over the fish of the sea birds Sky than creature so one, sitting and we Trace us out in our image of God video and podcast series is that part of what's happening is God installing a royal rep
 sensitive kind of all the creatures he just made on the land and in the air and then see he appoints the bear responsibility and to represent them and to represent gods own Rule and Authority in stewardship of creation and the word subdue is that connected to what God was doing was he subduing chaos and such or is it what it was getting at was that what about in terms of there was a dark chaotic ocean as an image of the disorder when I guess mortex clean on the order existed the skews me it didn't exist cuz to be in and out or just a it is to not exist in and I'm here has subdued the darkness and the disorder and so humans are to imitate that as they look out and see more
 uninhabited Realms to imitate what God did on days days one through six I think that's the one I also think there's a hint that there will be elements of creation that are resistant to them that will require a little more aggression thorns and thistles thorns and thistles or in this case creatures do not subdue the snake they end up being subdued and ruled by it so speak so I think it's also foreshadowing there's something in creation that might need a little more aggressive treatment yeah it's an aggressive word subdue subdue that's right if I was hiring someone to be a gardener and I came and said hey come and take care of my garden that's very different than hey can you come subdue my lawn maybe but men at least in our part of Portland the squirrels aggressively attacked the plants that Jessica plants they find the seeds and eat them before
 plant even have it at all or some flowers before they even had a chance to sprout so he's he's all over here live near Park but still have never seen bunnies know I never see bunnies in Portland like it's trying to get trapped them wild little bunnies very interesting because of the quarantines but so used to doing okay so humans as representing God's royal power and authority and this connects to a pretty well-known thought world in Ancient near east of Kings appointing their statues in distant lands that they've come to have authority over and it's an image of the ruler so they're lost colors to connect what's going on here in Genesis 12 that was living statues toilet so that's definitely a part of what's going on there is another layer to it the word used to describe the image
 to sell him the word image of statue and then the mood is something that's physically similar with the likeness correct a search on these words especially its Elam image it's one of the standard Biblical Hebrew words used to describe Idol statues of other gods throughout the rest so these are the things that this relaxer to avoid when they go into the land and the weather it's images of you know the Canaanite god Baal Baal and so on so this is another part of it to them and where do those statues always go they go and shrines and sacred places or in temples so this is a layer of the image of God the kind of came more on my radar after I really became clear on the Royal representation but this idea of humans as the idle statue of God in the Sacred Space that's what he buried her
 pick up here cuz it's the word idle so here's a couple Scholars Sean Bean McBride here has a great way of putting up he says this unifying image in humankind he's referring to the fact that all humans are said to be the image of God male and female who used to call it unifying the unifying image and humankind is a sacramental as well as a Corporal function unlike some people talk you just realize like you just your beauty on a different intellectual plane cuz that makes perfect sense to you you framed it's such a beautiful way that overlapping of Heaven and Earth it's a place where the Divine and human meat Together Sacramento is from Corpus or quartz body
 turn it so the image of God has a couple Dimensions to it won their place where God and human are one but it's not just that they represent people before God it's that they are a physical embodiment of the divine presence that's what he means by kapural he goes on to say Adam being or beings human beings are animated icons like that statue in the peculiar purpose for their creation is it spells it uses just a Greek word Co Sonic which is a compound Greek word meaning revealing the God God revealing to represent or mediate The Sovereign presence of the deity within the central Nave of the cosmic Temple just as Colt images were supposed to do in conventional sanctuaries this means that humanity is an inherently and
 I want species whose existence blurs by Design the otherwise sharp distinction between Creator and creation of such an interesting way of putting it before the distinction between Creator and creation part of the prohibition against idolatry in the Bible is don't mistake anything in creation for the Creator but there's one thing that it's okay to blur that line yes which means it can go well and when you have a human who truly is an embodiment of the Divine will purpose and presents you get eaten but when a human misrepresents God that's bad or when that human misrepresents humans before God like high priests and Kings often do in the Bible then that goes bad to those are like the stakes are high for great good or for
 great great evil will let you know I've heard that sentiment before thinks he is Louis talked about that where you know you have an evil cow I can't do this much damage wolf could do more damage that makes sense here I'm hearing something even more which it is well that was talking about like a progression of your autonomy or right now and then to this degree of the spectrum of agency where I feel like what he's saying is there's a spectrum he's talking about two different domains there is to create it and there's the Creator and it's very clear domains and also there's two demands in the this Spiritual Beings let us make humans in
 our image of a heinous and host of the sky Hostess guys there's this that realm and then there's the land the land Rail and it would I see here with McBride is he saying humans exist in this blurry middle that while we live in the land realm were meant to be in the likeness of this of the Elohim and that hasn't so much to do necessarily with our agency it just has to do with our purpose let them rule as images of the Divine that would happen to have a lot of agency yeah that's right you can say in the words of soulmate it's just how remarkable species of dirt creature has such a sense of elevated purpose and identity among all the other creatures too and so I may just saying in Genesis 12 saying that's not just our imaginations that's something above and beyond that speaking to us
 by the way that is a big critique of religion especially nowadays where that's been a fault line for religious people is to like be so anthropocentric what's the word yeah yeah human humanistic yeah we're like where the center of the universe and then we will Isaac know we're we're actually floating around a star and just like some random corner of the universe yeah she were like yeah those kind of Sentiments of Donna's off track when it comes to certain scientific Revelations however I know there are philosophers of science who are coming back to a way of envisioning the development of the human species as an important culminating moment would not be possible even if somebody doesn't think it's purposeful statement suggests the existence of Consciousness and self-consciousness here is something that wouldn't be possible unless those quasars were doing
 they're doing you know millions of light years away the whole Cosmic package is in a way that makes Consciousness possible and so whether or not that Consciousness is the center of the universe were Central to the drama and wear them for the purpose of the universe people debate that is interesting way to think that the way the biblical authors are trying to get to the heart of something that we still. I think about today I guess my question would be would it be normal for an ancient person during this time with this was written to think of humans as the center because he was like other ancient myths and stuff humans were sometimes not do it kind of afterthought or they were that's right just tell him to be put up with us or is there the blood of a god whose throat was slit to make mud so that the gods could have slaves to give them food that's not very uniquely elevated view of the
 the human species in the ancient world image of God. It's a it's a landmark moment in the history of human thought and what I want to bring out here and what it is specifically putting his finger on is the fact that the word used elsewhere in Biblical Hebrew is the word for the statue that goes in the Sacred Space of the of a shrine or Temple that's what you meant by the central Nave it's the thing that you would see when you go into the equivalent of a Canaanite neighbors holy of holies of their Temple to the bail would go in and see the tell him in the hot spot of the divine presence and so he tried saying is that the conception of the cosmos in Genesis one is that of a cosmic Sacred Space we're having dinner there one and those statue at the center is not statue it's an anime icon and hear words were very close to the Priestly dimension of the image of God the representation of God and human as one in
 Sacred Space and that's essentially a priest as well at least the biblical priesthood is meant to be all about in there you're saying this is also the foundation for an idea being a prophet and a king as well as all of it all of it but the statue element yes pretty direct line to to the Sacred Space Sacred Space free Salinas is there any other direct lines too well the royal king is let them rule the fact that it's a word used to describe the statue that goes in the temple space that's kind of crazy the Priestly and then the prophet humans as a vehicle back and forth of the Divine word is more comes out in the Eden narrative the next narrative so just wanting to touch on that real quick before we launch off in the rest of the Bible
so you need a narrative gardavita narrative chapter 2 there's just a few important love segment I want to stay focus on its verses 15 through 17 of chapter 2 all I'll let you read it and yeah we got took the human and arrested him in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it and yellow God commanded the human saying from every from every tree of the garden you make sure you leave but from the Tree of knowledge of good and bad you shall not eat from it for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die so lots of we could focus on its own in on this to work and keep this is Genesis 1 the job is to rule rule and some do is to put in a garden to work and keep this is a great example of what Scholars will called a double entendre where you use the word that
 has multiple different meanings depending on the context that you actually are intentionally meaning do you want the reader to talk about all the more than one more than one yeah so to work what is the Hebrew word of odd it's the one of the standard words to work cuz it's actually just like an English I'm going to work you can refer to any gardening typing on a computer driving to driving truck so I can check that to work driving driving cars around that's what that's a lot of work of the word however is also the word you use in Hebrew when you talk about showing your allegiance to someone by serving them and often gets translated either to serve God or to worship God so in Exodus chapter 3 the God tell Moses that when you bring the people out of Egypt bring them all back here to this mountain where they will avadh. Where they will worship God but it's the same word for work
 on top of that when you have the priests being described doing their work in the temple of offering incense and praying and singing an offering sacrifices their work in the book of numbers and Beyond is called by the same word of odd or the now novel. And will if it's a priest in the temple doing their work or Leading the People in prayer it's their work but it is worship and that's where we have different English words work and worship and serve and Hebrew of odd depending on context can activate all those the same word in Hebrew yes for work and worship yes why didn't I know this but you talked a lot about work now I got it yeah you got it so when he says to the human he rests him in the garden to a bot on one level you read what the garden is there
 and if you work there to some pruning yeah but but the garden is a place where Heaven and Earth are one and it's the reality to which the later Temple and Tabernacle point and so to do work in that space is worship now it says to work it wouldn't mean to worship yeah yeah there's a rabbit hole it refers to is there a what is an eighth in grams or well is that the way the nouns work it doesn't agree and it comes back up a number of versus ago that the whole other thing but a reference it's referring to the gardening work in the level of this narrative but once you see it in terms of the design patterns of what the garden represents the worship aspect of this word meaning will pop out to you on your second and third read cuz I just because it's the same word has the same
 and what you're going to later see priest doing in the Tabernacle will use the same word yeah which is a sacred kind of work yeah that's right so the priests of odd in the temple and Adam and Eve David in garden with the word keep us the word Shamar and standard words for just keep you know I keep my key is where I keep my whatever sanity to keep the Avo. To keep the work or to keep the practices of the sanctuary this is a standard all through the Book of Numbers Chapter 3 chapter 8 chapter 18 this is the word used to describe what the priests are doing as they do their work in the temple so they have odd in Isham are they working to keep us a good meditation literature point where once you read through the Torah and then you come back to the Eden there a Tiffany or like I get it it would be
 the analogy is using language that's appropriate the one thing to describe another thing The Graduate School library at the University of Wisconsin was designed in the 50s massive massive research Library I would get lost in there for days and often did but it is like a fortress is designed as a fortress and there are many many floors that just have no windows on the 10th floor and there's like no windows in the whole belt on that whole floor you never was never know so you feel like you're in the dungeon exactly what time of day is it yes yes just all sense of time has gone so yeah you could refer to in a day at the research libraries going to the mall in the miner in the dungeon to work into keep
 it's using Priestly loaded vocabulary to describe what they're doing and the Bible it's designed to to pick that up here brings Clarity on this points on the bottom of page eight he puts it this way in this book called The Lost World of Adam and Eve he says the tasks given to Adam are of a Priestly nature caring for Sacred Space in agent thinking caring for Sacred Space was a way of upholding creation by preserving order non order is held at Bay if the Priestly vocabulary of Genesis 2 verse 15 which was red indicates the same kind of thinking the point of caring for Sacred Space should be seen as much more than just landscaping or even the Priestly duties you must have to think bigger picture he says maintaining order made one a participant with God in the ongoing task of sustaining the equilibrium God established in the cosmos
 it's going to be brought this up a little earlier in Egyptian thinking they attach this not only to the role of priests as they maintained Sacred Space in the temple but also to the king whose task was to complete what was unfinished to preserve the existent not as its status quo but in a continuing Dynamic revolutionary process of remodeling an improvement this combines the subdued and ruling of Genesis one with the working and keeping of Genesis to complete the robots picture in this ancient context from this here so the fact that there's Cherry being stationed at the borders of the garden of the garden that at the very center or all of these sacred trees the gift of eternal life humans and divine priest-kings the fact that God commanded the human here and that everything depends on humans hearing the Divine command
 and what Adam and Eve's don't do to each other is relay the word of God to each other in the garden where the prophetic part comes in where Adam and Eve were supposed to ideally the partners together and in that moment with the snake that one could tell the other know this is what God said it's all about the word of God what did God say and it's about the word of God getting twisted by a deceptive figure and so instead of representing God's word to each other which is the prophetic roll the Priestly kings and queen are exiled from the Eton space and from then on what you're going to meet is these Royal Prophet priest rolls all fragmented and broken out now and you will almost never meet anybody where all of them overlap in the image of God again Moses get the clothes David gets really close but ultimately it's the portrait of Jesus in the Gulf
 that they're painting him as the first character in the story of the Bible that recaptures this ideal vision of humanity from Genesis 1 and 2 Prophet priest and King a picture of Amir fracturing into pieces and then being introduced to these all fragments of the mirror and some of them are just charred some of them are little bit more put together and yeah that's kind of what I want to try some here then it's kind of how the unique role of the priests the one who represents God the human and humans to God in the Sacred Space how does that seem uniquely developed and more specifically how does it illuminates the Bible's unified story leading to Jesus that means there's a whole Priestly layer to Jesus's identity and who he thought he was and what he was doing and there's a Priestly layer to the identity of the
 followers and how we think about ourselves and talk about ourselves using this Priestly Concepts that's, that's what we're after is we go from you think you listening to this episode of Bible project podcast we're going to be creating a whole series of videos on this thing that are going to be releasing throughout the summer of 2021 we're just getting started in this series on the podcast but if you're hungry for a little bit more right now I'd recommend a sermon that Tim Mackie did call Jesus is your priest you can find that on exploring my strange Bible as Companion podcast of some of Kim's prior sermons that he's done during his past life as a pastor again that's exploring my strange Bible look for the sermon Jesus is our priests Today Show is produced by then, or show notes are from Lyndsay Ponder and the theme music from the band pet Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofits
