hey John, this is a great day for us we have the pleasure of sitting in a room right now with someone that you all get to meet yes Tracy Caldwell Dyson hi Tracy thanks for being here my pleasure to introduce us to see little man and Tracy can fill in the gaps DS yeah this is a unique kind of interview we're doing on the podcast here today with the unique backstory I'll just do a short introduction which is Tracy you are a NASA astronaut yes which means that your adult job and career has been in involved in spaceflight space missions living on the International Space Station for long periods of time yes yes and supporting the missions that are going on right now in the ones in the future so it's such an honor to have you here we are sitting here having
 conversation because you reached out to John and I in February of 2023 with the really amazing letter that you wrote and we received that letter during the month while John and I were having the cast dragon-themed conversations the thing that you talked about in the letter that I'm going to let you read part of in a moment overlap with one of the main things that John and I were working through ideas chaos and creation disorder and order the image of the chaos Waters in The Dragon in those Waters so you wrote a letter and she'll be going to share and my response to you with this is so cool thank you for reaching out would you want to come talk to us on our podcast about the stuff that you wrote about and so here you are sitting now months later when I wrote that letter I had no idea it was going to result in me sitting here with both of you let alone just starting up a conversation
 it's been a blessing and a thrill for me as I'm preparing for my mission which is to the International Space Station iLauncher going up again off of it and I will be launching in March of 2024 and in preparation for that there's several things that we we have to coordinate and I have an opportunity to have Outreach while I'm on an orbit and I thought that it would be really cool to reach out to all of you and the Bible project to give you a little bit of a gift to say thank you for all that you have done for me and others is through the work here teaching us the more about the Bible and and how it leads to Christ so I was also at the same time doing the classroom study on Adam to Noah and Tim you had made a comment during that time that inspired the thoughts that I had shared with
 in a letter so the letter was to fold one to introduce myself and ask you all for your thoughts on maybe connecting from orbit but then I said these words that regardless I feel compelled to share with you these thoughts I've had for my previous missions and the view of Earth I've seen from space it's much like an infant placed in a hostile environment the Earth is so plump tender Exquisite in detail yet soft and color it seems so fragile hanging there amid such intense darkness swaddled in a thin blue blanket of atmosphere it's so delicate so vulnerable and yet so protected from the harshness of space I could go on and on about it but suffice it to say Thames discussion on the cyclic pattern of biblical narrative in the Adam to Noah series Session 5 video at 23 minutes
 it from the vantage point of space Tim said in biblical theology God's creative power is the power he exerts every single moment to keep creation from collapsing on itself and I thought that's exactly the visual I get when I see his creation through the portal of the International Space Station I've shared this observation publicly before but I am never sure people really understand me I'd love to share this view with you this experience with you and your team perhaps you can convey it better than me
 so thank you for writing that letter thank you for receiving that it's been fun passing it around the office like you have to read this paragraph so beautiful and beautiful and then to try to imagine what you experienced it's actually really hard to imagine it
 my whole vision of reality has been from a relatively small geographical area on this orb floating hurling through space and to have the experience of being other than it looking at it that's the place we are right now having this conversation it's red it's almost it's defying our programming and some way to try and do it other than just having the experience I bet they're really I'm guessing can't be a replacement for it exactly a question I get asked is an astronaut is what is it like to be in space and it used to grieve me to try to answer that because I can't give a 30-second answer to that it starts to grieve me to think of how in the world do I explain to you what it's like to be in space and when I learned the word ineffable ineffable because it really is hard to explain
 the way that you feel what I feel when I look out the window at the Earth so yeah it's it's hard so we would like to have a more kind of focused conversation about this is conversation going to fit into the chaos Dragon series because it occurred to me especially after you wrote the letter that there really is this important analogy that in our imaginations that minor med Nations the role that the vacuum of space plays as the the disordered uninhabitable realm to tell who was analogous to what the dark ocean where the Wilderness represented to the biblical authors and so I thought it would just be fun to have a creative exploratory conversation thinking about what space is in our imaginations you've been in it and if it is in what ways is it a really good analogy between the chaos Waters
 and space and then in what ways maybe is it not a good analogy but before we explore that just real quick like Tracy from Southern California originally how does the young woman in Southern California and up on a trajectory to living in Houston and being an astronaut astronaut God's path because I didn't start out knowing exactly how to get to NASA and become an astronaut but I just followed the followed the things that I was most interested in and it led me there and only by the grace of God can I say that I actually made it but I started out in high school not knowing exactly what I wanted to study in college and what I wanted to be later on in my life and I shared that that concern with my parents and they tried to hold back their laughter at the the sea
 I asked that question cuz it you know 16 years old you don't have to have it all figured out and I feel like I did and they gave me some great advice of the time to write down a list of all the things that I enjoyed doing and what that led to was me just with a list of things that when you take the collection of no occupation jumps out of the page and so again I was back in that that moment of Despair I still haven't figured it out but they said to put it away add to it take away from it but it's yours and you get the exercise and so then I did and then later on maybe a couple months later the world started getting really excited about NASA and this mission to be conducted in space involved in a teacher Christa McAuliffe and it was before the tragic accident but nevertheless I got my attention because at that point in my life I've never really met us fighter pilot a test pilot but I sure do a lot of teachers and it really inspired
 to look more into the astronaut program to see what were astronauts doing who were they would a date with skills did they need what was NASA doing they were right then building the space station freedom is becoming International Space Station and all the things that I read made me go back to that original list and when I looked at all the things that I had put on it it just said this is what you want to do and so from that point forward I started pursuing higher education doing all these other things and I went to Cal State Fullerton got my degree in chemistry went on to UC Davis to get my doctorate my peach seed in chemistry but the only reason I did that was because I could defer my student loans and why advisor said you don't have to be brilliant you just have to work hard as I can do that and it just led to just greater growth and in the fun I was having with chemistry I still didn't know how I was going to get to NASA but I filled out an application
 for the handful of chemistry nerds that probably listen to the podcast what sub sealed of chemistry is a jock Mass spectrometry wrist and anybody that uses a laser knows exactly what I'm talking about. I said I use a variety of different types of lasers to study the fundamental aspects of molecular and atomic interactions and I'm a better person for it every day was it was a really fun time of my life I spent more time with a wrench in my hand and I did beakers with liquids and making potions I was really happy chemist and then usually that involves turbo Thompson I'll drive vacuum Chambers and special Optics and I got to play with all sorts of stuff like that
 yeah that's kind of really good point I am like totally fixing things all the time on Space Station if you don't have a hardware store just down the street so you got it make do with what you have and then you have these specialized pieces of equipment that either produce science or they produce you know are free to breathe to help maintain the speed yes that's that's a good way to wrap it or are you allowed to tell us like one of the experiments going on up there is at all like yeah it's hard to pick just one but one of the kind of filled a physical chemistry physical science is we look at combustion of various either liquids gases solids and the reason we're looking at that is not just so that we can understand the flames in microgravity which helped us in the space business learn how to work with materials who as we develop
 vehicles in space stations in missions and things like that but it also helps us understand how fire response here dressed really so we're doing some fundamental work in the absence of gravity basically to help understand the wastelands behave and it's fascinating to watch the videos that are produced from that but also the science behind it and the temperature gradient from the center all the way out to the edges the fact that instead of a one of those that the classic view of a flame that looks ball beset them at the bottom and well of a flame in space is a sphere and orb the gravity gravity the 1G flame in the convection that
 I'm not but then also it is we also have a whole series of biological experiments where we are the human subjects and go through either certain nutrition diets to to understand aspects of of how Francis protein can a from Plant vs. animal can affect your your bone growth as well as bone loss great big study on the eyes because we're finding that there's some phenomenon in microgravity that changes the eyesight of some of our astronauts and so and it's not every astronaut so we've only got so much brainpower I'm focused on trying to understand that practical aspects to just understanding would it look like for humans to live in zero gravity for longer periods of time permanently it's that's ever possible right away what would be the
 that humans yeah and it's really important question to figure out before we do it yeah and it's not just going to to the moon and to Mars and if you think about the trip tomorrow as it's going to take a little while to get there you want to spend some time there on the surface to make the trip worthwhile and then he got the same length of time to come back home and that's going to that's going to be significantly longer than the missions that we can do today that are 6 months to a year long so is this planned for six months later we just had a recent Mission with her NASA astronaut Frank Rubio who ended up being up there a year just because of the issue that we had with some of our Russian Vehicles okay yeah and it's hard on your body but we are again learning a lot about countermeasures to our bodies like what do we do to keep from losing bone
 muscle mass losing flexibility those kinds of things and so we've got a fantastic compliment not just of equipment on board the space station by some really fantastic people who are doing research in that in that realm as well as those who are operationally keeping us fit and so we are probably in the best shape of Our Lives while we're up there but you also have to prepare for coming home and your body experiencing Micah gravity for 6 months coming back to 1G as we say it's an experience of the German just fatigued I would see truthfully 30 days before you're feeling like like your old self again but 10 days is probably the amount of time you need for for your system vestibular looking to recover from being in microgravity not to mention your muscles in your bones and you don't like that
suck this is a wonderful Segway cuz what we're talking about is the cast of space is about the fact of what that our bodies right are designed and have developed to live in a particular environment to live on the land and very neurobiological we can actually survive and be healthy within and so what you have been able to experience is a group of humans over the last many decades pioneering what's it like to carve out a space of ordered human habitation in a chaos around and around that is literally hostile and will take take you apart exactly okay so here's a way to start the conversation then about how we bring it to the chaos oh
 you have been able to go live in this chaos around this disorder ground what are ways from your experience as you have learned about the biblical symbolism in the context of the dark chaos Waters surrounding the dry land and constantly threatening it if except for the line I guess in the biblical imagination the coastline spray marking off the dry land would be the equivalent of what you call the thin blue blanket around the keeps the vacuum that bay insulates our plan it so I think the experience that you have had I think would be analogous to how ancient people thought about climbing mountains
 which we do recreational in now but I don't think anybody would have ever thought of doing that just for fun I know you're going into a very dangerous space and I'm sure the effects of altitude you know that would be solved by anybody like ancient or modern who comes up there or living in the desert I haven't had this experience going even to Eastern Oregon which is a high desert region a my skin freaks out after a few days so there's experience we have there's a habit of around and then there's the chaos around so Tracy what has been helpful to you learning about the symbolism of the waters and Cass Waters as you think about the experience of space and maybe what is space really like what's the vacuum like is it empty or what's the full of anyway I hardly know where to start because I think I started thinking about this on my first mission
 which was on the shuttle and it was a relatively short mission where we were up there docked to the station for about 10 days but if you give or take a day or two on both sides to get there but the first time I had a chance to actually look out the window and gaze at you space was maybe close to the end of our doctor Mission and my commander just cut out time and he said I want you brookies to be in that window for a whole orbit is about 90 minutes and what a gift and he also requested that the ground team turn off all the external lights on the space station or not there's so much light on board the external lights outside the station that that it's just the same thing is I like pollution here where you can't you cannot see all the stars all the stars because of it so it requires a lot of Darkness even on the Space Station's behalf but once he did that and we could see out I was just us.
 at the view I was seeing a mean you you can you can literally spend in orbit just looking at the the Earth especially when you're going over a populated area with lights but then when your he's got your full fill of that you've got to remember there's a whole universe out there I mean the other side and I'll never forget when it popped out at me you know from from here in some of the most remote places you've been looking up at the stars you you're looking through the atmosphere and all the stars with some look bigger than others and brighter than others you still see them all basically on the same plane but when you're above the atmosphere which is where we orbit you are looking directly at the stars and you start your eyes start to sense the depth between the stars of the movie start
 are you getting I think you were talking about that on a podcast what I was a kid they were very popular in the mall try to get the image pop out of seeing stars are just like that where all the sudden I really like the light years by the difference between you can tell that this star even though it's fainter is actually closer serious I died I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't forget about that part I was I just remembered being mesmerized by that time 3D and that's probably not something that can never be reproducible
 three 2D image on the screen of a picture of you looking at how would you rather I don't know how my mom gave me like black paper and the neon colors that when I went for my space station Mission at 6 months I could still couldn't recreate that sounds like nevermind cuz only only your naked eye and plus you're in the environment where you're like this is real real and so I think that also computes in your mind like this is astounding and I remember I was so moved by that that all the sudden as I'm staring at it the image becomes Super Bowl Lori and I was like what's going on
 and then I rubbed my eye and I realize I was crying like tears were welling up in my eyes but because I'm in microgravity they don't drip so it's like Peppa Pig the water bubble coming off my eyeballs and it was like in and smearing it that's what happens with water in space like if you have it on your skin it just migrates it doesn't unless you unless you want to go down there is no doubt there's no down there during up it's like this this water bubble is growing on your face and it was like I had to move the water out of my way so I can read looking so that's how much it moved me and I'm not answer your question about dog since I was in a shirtsleeve environment cuz the inside of the shuttle very ordered environment is specifically crafted for us to Tabriz and and be comfortable and I have to wear a
 a suit or helmet I don't have to have an oxygen hose connected I'm just in my element just watching this has just moved me so much but it wasn't until my second mission when I was throwing up and a soyuz rocket and then coming home and so he's capsule just those two events alone where I was sitting very close to a window where I could see the chaos outside through that Dynamic event where I realized just how which is what chaos really really manifested itself as and in my business and when you've got a capsule going through our atmosphere that beautiful blue hue that you know it looks so peaceful when you're looking at it through a window but when you're in a capsule
 coming back home at the speeds that were traveling and we didn't even then we're going Mach 25 17500 mph that's that's the speed we have to go to stay in orbit and you don't get a sense for the except for the fact that the Earth is moving underneath you but you don't have any wind rushing in by and you just don't get any other sense of that speed until you are going home and threw it yeah and your capsule there's parts of the castle that are meant to oblate because it's taking on the energy to keep you safe but out your window you're like looking at Red flames and pieces of your capsule you know flying off like they're supposed to but Sedalia like I'm glad I'm here and not out there a window between you and thousands of miles per hour in the friction in the heat like not that is not a spacer an experience where human body belongs exactly
 while I was on my mission we had to do a series of contingency spacewalks this we had a failure on board that required us to go out in short order to fix else we'd have either been bigger problems so we had to go out there and in our space suits and I was one of the spacewalkers and just that experience in itself where your door is ordered it's possible but you are entering the realm of the uninhabitable and it's only by virtue of your space suit that you are safe and able to work in that environment and I'll never forget the time when I was working on something in the it would call it that the front face before the face of the space station is the trust segment that's basically facing the velocity Vector the direction that we're traveling and you're unprotected in the sense that once that great big Fireball comes up over the horizon and that shines his light on you you're going to feel it and it's it's pretty warm
 take the hottest place here on on Earth and you might have a sense for what that feels like but when you're in your own space suit and at that sun comes up even if you're not looking at it you know because parts of the space station light up in pretty amazing ways but you can feel the heat even through your space and then if you don't have certain Shields are visors down on your on your helmet. It fits into this also piercing like you can feel it kind of trouble you're like I I remember my temple I would like the temple skin that's exposed when I'm in the spacesuit it's pretty much just your face and so I just remember that feeling alone in a sec thank goodness I've got all the metal and fabric that I can turn around and not have that you know directly pointed at me speaking of lasers speaking of lasers
 Evelynn yeah and let me just add that my tooth is the space station looking out the window or if I'm in my space suit out in the actual environment it is not lost on me the kind of chaos that surrounds the most kind of what I was trying to describe in the letter to you guys that in those moments where I would reflect some looking out the window at the Earth from from night pass to a day pass and I'm just looking at this
 it just almost unfathomable how this beautiful planet that that is his it's so complex and beautiful and here it is in the middle of Blackness in an environment that has so much more to be uncovered in in and discovered that we don't even know about so he wouldn't even I feel like the chaos lies and even uncertainty there of what it really is I mean we've got some smart mindset that are studying you know what goes on in space but space is pretty big and it just just the enormity of it is enough to it was said. Is what chaos really mean
so the umbilical imagination that one way to describe as the sea and then is a boundary of the coastline where we're kind of spared from this from the sea coming and Destroy what I hear you saying is if you think of space like a different type of see a different type of chaos the bean chips didn't have a way to really appreciate the way we do that boundary the coastline is that atmosphere and you know it is probably all inspiring to be it is on track to be on Coastline and to see the waves crashing on and it kind of feel the violence of the ocean but the way you described going through the atmosphere into space sounds like another level of entering into a chaos realm that's just yeah pretty and yeah it when I think about all the nearest specially with that the soyuz and all of it it has to go through in order to make it safely from orbit through the atmosphere
 and then to land all of these events have to happen at just the right moment at just the right intensity or level in order for us to make it all the way back safely and it's it it's like the amount of order that has to be applied to oppose the chaos that we are entering its impressive you know just what you asked what is space that was the lack of you had a string of question I did the last one was what really is face I know if you know I know what the ocean is right I think but yeah what is it this is a different way to think of a casserole I think we're saying that's appropriate what is it what is space
 oh I don't know if I'm the right person to die on the way a lot of nothing is nothing to be afraid of it cuz it's harsh and it's surprising sometimes we learn learning as much as we can about how to live and work in space but there's still a lot of things we we don't know and as we try to not to sound cliche but to push the boundaries and we sometimes are very surprised that what that boundary really looks like and also that we're talking about the space in the environment but the operational realities of trying to live and work in space that have their own layers of chaos and it makes me think about my my yard at home that's you know we have to tend the garden right and if we don't weeds grow up and and undesirable things take over the garden and trying
 live and work in space with a huge Global partnership like we have its trying to apply order everyday to something that wants to be chaotic from from just vehicle traffic coming up and going down from space station to the amount of storage that we have on board to take care of our needs for a remote Outpost like we have a mean just when I think about just the operational constraints that we're under as we conduct our day-to-day Mission that's that's like trying to make order out of chaos the land in roulette that we are to rule over is the tunning the symbol of chaos itself do you see yourself as an astronaut been connected to that image of God vacation then
 I think you've got uses all of us here in pretty neat ways and I and I think I get the most Joy from what I do thinking about it in those terms and and I'm from even the mundane things that will that we would we consider mundane in orbit even though the spectacular environment we're in but from those to the spectacular things like doing a spacewalk is kind of a big deal in our careers and having the blessing to do that kind of work is that I really feel like God had his hand in that so I'm curious just continuing to explore the desert symbolism of the cosmos the biblical Cosmos the order drown cuz it away what you've been able to do is participate in these extensions of Eden order into a new realm just outside the planet and so it's like pushing out but it's an extreme example of I think at Universal
 an experience that really is the biblical authors are trying to invite us into is that humans I mean the reason you guys are up there is because of ideas in your minds about designing this habitable you know outpatient Outpost up there it's just first of all it's so remarkable that they moving 12,000 miles an hour what did you say 17 * 9500 mph and so in that environment like when I go outside my house and ride my bike to work here everyday like I am in a way of going up against the dragon yeah there's a car is out there I have to watch for your skin to dry out here any time you wake up and go into the world to bring order and love your neighbor and do stuff in a way you're facing resistance and so that the biblical symbols of resistance are primarily the the darkness the waters in the and then
 the danger in those Waters is symbolized by the dragon so a scholar who has helped me a lot. Robin Perry and this fun book called the biblical Cosmos I think that in the introduction of the weird Wonderful World Bible he has a great love paragraphs but want to read and then see how this plans with you cuz he's unpacking again the the meaning of the symbols in the meaning of Robin says in the Bible water and sea beasts function as evocative symbols of overwhelming and Powerful chaos and doing forces
 they remind us the God's creation is good but not tame there are forces Beyond human control that should be treated with respect because when they exceed their bounds they are destructive its paws sunlight experience sunlight as a really wonderful Pleasant thing here in Portland weird if you were experiencing sunlight something very very different in some salt with in the atmosphere it's like it's ordered and it brings life and then outside of that order the sun is a deadly laser death Robin continues at a metaphorical level dragons and wild oceans remain helpful symbols of chaos that can invade communal and individual human worlds threatening order in life itself within the Bible the symbol is used to describe political oppression or the collapse of order in the last communities and people we've been exploring that ancient Kings or
 dragons Violet Kings at a metaphysical level Genesis one depicts a creation that left to itself with collapse back into chaos the world doesn't sustain or order itself
 it is God who ordered and continues to order reality but the tendency towards disorder is inherent within the world in the sea represents therefore non-being or literally no thing that is so bang on I thought I read this true but are you talking about the weeds in your garden or like when when yet another cargo ship comes up to the space station of limited size and space and we have to figure out what to do with everything and then yeah when something breaks on board the space station and we have to go fix it and it's not just the start your free breathe and get your suit on and go it's the probation that goes throughout the entire space station all the way down to our ground teams across the world who have to muster together to bring order back to the situation that you do you wonder how it all gets done I was it any of us and all of this was here
 yes yes and you can't just say well it just all worked out but when you're up there and you see you see it for yourself though through your own eyes just how miraculous it is that not only are you there and you're safe and you're being productive thanks to the hundreds of thousands of people on the ground who whose job it is to to see to it that you do have meaningful work and then you look outside and and and then you you're inside of a space station that was completely assembled in space here on the ground and then we'll get all in and check to make sure electrons from over there for over there no it all went up into space and that was where the final assembly took place sobre biggest most complex Lego set ever feel like going back to the view out the window when you're done looking at the Earth and just completely like you need a couple or B
 take it all in and then you look at it space in your like this amazing I can't believe you're here and then you look at the space station and you look all around and you see solar rays going around and and thermal radiators rotating and you know what's going on with those and control moment Gyros that are spinning it thousands and thousands of RPMs to keep the space station oriented the right weight of the real visible aspect that there's a lot going on behind the scenes of the keep that machine running then once you're done being like completely in awe of that you think about all the people who are on the ground in the control centers in the background so it at that very moment sending commands and monitoring parameters and it takes it takes a world to run the space station and which then raises like the fascinating analogy which is like what what is currently happening behind the scenes that like that of the cosmos so I can bring theirs forever
 complex operation to keep that thing up in space to there's an almost infinite number of operations happening in the universe to make our conscious awareness of even just this conversation right now but just the scale of that we're so habituated into our life rhythms the scale in the immensity of the chaos that is being resisted at this very moment like we just can't really even take it in but is that kind of what hit home when you were sitting there looking at the blanket like that the blue blanket like there's a sense of
 there's my sense of how ordered things are it's now a little different I can see how close to chaos things really are you sure it's not it's never far from my mind when I'm looking out at the few about the harsh conditions out there that seems to always be for friend to me I mean from the vacuum of space to the extremes in temperature from + 200 degrees Fahrenheit that minus 200 degrees Fahrenheit when Sons up if it's at its extreme when the sun's on the other side it's that it's 100 degrees Fahrenheit to -100 and your own body but just in the middle of the space station and just knowing from all the training of being in a pressurized suit to do space walks and knowing all the emergency procedures that we have to train
 in order to overcome a problem that exposes us to that so it seems It's always on my mind so then when I get those Crescent moments where I'm just looking at the the Earth and all its beauty and Grandeur and I see this and then you see that that's Thin Blue Line or what and you're like that's all there is Pfizer's I got multiple layers on me I got are pumping into my suit I got a CO2 removal system I got a battery here battery their radio transmitter mean I'm decked out to the hill in order to not only be safe at function out there and do the work and then there's a thin blue atmosphere that protects everybody from other of us from the radiation and ultraviolet rays and when the when the sun comes up over the horizon and the Beautiful transformation of the Horizon as that sun to like you get hints of it it's not quite up yet but you can see things
 where to change in any of the kids coming to get super excited to see this the same size as there's a lot of the things that you see here you see up there with a slightly different perspective Laura stars for 10 that made me realize I've only ever seen to destarch I've only ever looked at the sky and sea in the sky in 2D and I'm a little sad and then you know that beautiful kind of sunset that you see especially if you're in Southern California smog Bend in the orange and the yeah you seeing a whole sphere of the Earth are up high enough that you can see the curvature of the Earth
 you get to see over three thousand miles of land mass as you're going over at one time because I'm sorry your how high up are you you're not that high or not we're like 250 miles so like if I'm in Houston in your in Austin that's about the distance if you went altitude you know that's that's how far away we are but you're really believe it or not it's eight and a half minutes to get to orbit and then they are in the in the Airways are clear for us to get there no traffic but yeah that the distance isn't too far but you're just well above the atmosphere that you see you see things without the filter of of our atmosphere but this sun glint you know when you're when you see from an airplane just the way that the Sun as its Moving Castle
 the shadow on the earth is your truck driver looking out the window and you we see that as well we're mountains look completely different because of the shade that is created by their peaks and depend on where the sun is too I love looking at bodies of water where the sun glint is changing it from from Blue to like a pearlescent coral color to this kind of opalescence this is just like it blows my mind away to see that when you you just looking at the Earth and all of its beauty and its just it doesn't look chaotic anymore
 something that you said I said earlier about the chaos Waters made me think about this time that the fact that the Earth is 71% covered by water is never so obvious as when you're in space and it's interesting that you can be on several orbits where you don't see any land so you just seem water and sometimes you don't see him because the clouds are covering over but you like yeah this is what 71% and when I think about the chaos you know the chaos Waters and the Dryland appearing it's like it's an oasis to me and then just have you from spaces trying to think about this and set it to words said when I would look out and just see ocean ocean ocean ocean I'm thinking I'm glad I'm not there like that's in the middle of what seems like nowhere
 and I'd never get that sense anywhere but from the vantage point of the AC while flying through space I'm glad I'm not in the ocean
 Delaware to say okay all right so that makes me think of another question I want to ask you so that feeling of waking up to a new awareness that the world that I thought I lived in has just become a lot more wondrous and strange and dangerous that has to have an effect and I think one of the effects the biblical story is trying to have on our imaginations is to recover that sense of wonder in the fridge ility. This whole thing and so the experience that you've been able to have there actually has been a lot of very interesting people who have documented the psychological experience of astronauts named Frank White I know you've met but he's done a lot of research interviewing astronauts and he came up with the term to talk about that mental impact you called it the overview effect that there's a deep transformation
 an astronaut's view of the world and reality and other people that happens from getting these experiences that you've had so you had your own version of this experience what does that do like when you come back
 do you encounter what do you say differently how is it impacted I'm probably effects everything so I'm asking you to quantify something that's like quantifiable ineffable but you know what when you think about the political challenges of humans getting along or think about a difficult coworker how is this experience has shaped how you leave other people and how humans do we don't get along down here what happens there I think that the those thoughts happen while you're there they start there and travel home with you but I remember while I was there gazing at the Earth
 and not seeing if you don't see any borders other than those between you know land masses and and the waters and you don't see the conflict it looks so peaceful from from our vantage point plus the only audio that you get is you know the ambient noise of the space station so you don't even hear what's happening on the surface of the Earth and all you see is that beauty and the honest of of Jensen if a boy just is hard to put it into succinct terms with that view and the privilege that you have that only a fraction of the human race has ever experienced you start thinking about I wonder if more people could see this Believers are non-believers people who care about the Earth to people who think the Earth is there for them how this would change them be start thinking of. I think those are the first thoughts that that I have
 but then it's also for me emotional to think about what am I doing here why do I get to see this why why is it mean it's getting this opportunity
 to look at this and if that's not one of the most humbling moments of my life that then brings me back home and has me view myself in light of others that's where that began I mean I think I went to a bit of a transformation after that flight in that alone just you know searching my own heart and what was important to me because before I took that flight in particular I was you know pursuing a career and I was newly married but not I was geographically some single because my husband was serving in our military and foreign location and so every space likely living for myself and coming back home from that played in particular where I spent six months this being captivated by what I saw at the window not to mention living life and working where I lived and loved where worked and you know just the the chaos has living with people that you didn't necessarily true
 to live with us but because of circumstances you were there together as a as a crew and a team all of that just forced me when I got home from that mission to kind of look deep into my heart at some what it meant for me to be there to be one of the ones to do all of that and just as far as you looking out at the the planet and how that looks just from just the physical sense it's both it does terrifying to look out the window as it is delightful just from the Terminator where the sun sets and there's a shadow cast on the surface of the Earth and it moves along the Earth just like you know this is called The Terminator.
 Dennis has been using the shadow line is this like a true the Shadow and wits to me and I've asked other colleagues the same question how that looks to them and and many feel the same way that it's kind of eerie when you see the Terminator coming especially if you're over water because as you see the shadow coming and it's coming your like always it's almost when the shadow comes it unless her over a highly populated area with lights and it's almost time for the lack of stars you would think that you were just looking at the universe cuz it is black like that the Earth disappears and it's it's it's
 Siri cuz you're like we're didn't go but you know what's right there so it's like him and you can't help but look at it cuz you're like I want to see what what it does but it's going away it's a weird weird thought that it's that kind of thing I do know I just paid attention to this this feeling I had have of the Terminator coming then get this when you're basically just picture our continent and it's what is it like 5,000 miles across is not more than that and let's see this blanket of cloud covers the majority of it you watch lightning go from one end to the other and Split Second right in and you think to yourself I mean it's amazing the Maze of lions wear if you're here on the earth you're looking at you see a lightning bolt it's like he just he leaves the system but if they are you see watch electrons flow in no time at all and it's like it blows your mind and soul
 these things just keep having Aurora's for a chemist a p chemist in particular and Roars when you're looking at him from the northern you know latitudes in and you see them as against retd you just watching this swirl of color but when you have to be looking down and it is actually how tight to it and it's Dennis dancing it and it's almost like in a glass bottom boat looking at the Aurora and green and yellow and sometimes it's red and blue but it's mostly green and yellow and you go over that you just depends on how the Earth is spinning and how you're in our orbit to session so you are the same clinician of 51° in that NS Earth's rotation as we travel you go over the same area, like every other two weeks and and so I'm just going to
 a rough estimate about every two weeks you see that every run over a video capture two of its and my goodness you just you're just fascinated by the dancing ionization of you know how the sphere and incoming particles why I'm going on about this is because Debbie thought I had is how complex this is just those things alone that as the Earth turns everything that's happening on the surface of the Earth to to weather systems that to us on the ground we see the fraction of it but in from space you see you see how large it is in to see the I think we make our world too small sometimes in with internet and Communications being as rapid as they are and how we can hop on a jet be halfway around the world and you know 15 hours makes the world seem small
 but it's really big it is really big when you think about how complex it is and when we start thinking about that the world is so small and that we are in control of it then I think we weep that's where we start to step into that worldly worldly mindset but keep the world big get the planet cuz it's it's the God's glory that it is as Grand as it is and when you realize that God seems to lot bigger then then we make him sometimes and what you saying is a wider realization of the chaos surrounding scale of that I didn't even wider your living room you are a large of God's Own wisdom and generosity and Tower is really scaled to your view of the universe isn't it
 wow that's a fascinating I was counting on you guys to wrap that up you know what you're talkin about the Aurora's or a storm that loss of its speaking to the unified right integrated nature of the Oasis the order the way says that it's like it really is more like an organism a big floating organism in the middle of the universe cuz it's all so integrated but at the same time it's just being held there against these forces and lasers that are constantly bombarding it to reduce it back to the nothingness from which it came
 it's really a Marvel that there is anything at all much less this particular set of things we have to do and have it I feel like my vision of the universe has been able to expand a little story is also trying to expand it for us as well to help us appreciate both how beautiful
 and what a gift that is also a fragile and on the precipice and it somehow holding all of that together in one moment is something the biblical authors want to instill in us through the story of the cows water is in the garden I can't wait to put this next mission to armed with the the the deeper understanding I have of Genesis Malone and 2 to see it without lens applied I'm looking forward to to that experience cuz I didn't have it when I went before me. Of course lever is a read my Bible but I wouldn't say that I understood it as a unified story that it is and so I'm really looking forward to this next mission armed with that information or were thankful that you're going to let us be men and the talk with you and then you can tell us what that experience is like with that on the mind
 forward to that for sure Tracy thank you for writing a letter and reaching out to us it's been really fun to get to know you and just to share with our audience is listening.

 Bible project is crap for the nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you so thank you so much for being a part of this hi this is Chandler Wagner and I'm from Asheville North Carolina and I use Bible project as a supplement in my personal devotion and I also use the read scripture app for my daily Bible reading I first heard about Bible project Through the Bible recap a chronological reading plan and accompanying podcast I use Bible project to help set the stage for the book of the Bible that I'm about to read in the plan and to help reorient myself to the overarching narrative while I'm reading
 Bible project Easter
 Christ centered and fully saturated in the word my favorite thing about Bible project is it in this world of distractions froehling and multitasking it captures my full attention and it provides me with phrases and Frameworks to share with others as I learn more about God we believe the Bible is a unified story at least did Jesus videos that he knows podcast classes and more at Medical Practice that's called
