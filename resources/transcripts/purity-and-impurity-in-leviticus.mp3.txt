hey we're reading Leviticus Israel has created the Tabernacle the place where God and humans can live together out in the Wilderness at new Eden spots but in the very last story we read the priests failed to follow God's commands they do what is good in their own eyes bringing their alternative liturgy and they're struck down dead in the most holy place to place where there should be Life Is No Death you always living room has been vandalized was deaf and so what are we going to do well we always says is I need some priests who will learn the importance of Holiness versus communist Purity versus him. And this is why the next part of Leviticus that will read her a bunch of Purity laws that Purity laws are going to seem kind of strange to us modern Western laws about bodily fluids touching dead bodies skin disease that feels like a random list of icky things before the ancient thinker these were Simba
 life and death I'm constantly living at the border of life and death I'm a mortal creature becoming a is not morally wrong but what it reminds me is that I live outside of Eden and Ally live in a world that is not the way it's supposed to be you or that it could be in your translations you might find the words pure and impure can also be translated clean and unclean what is common versus what is uncommon their Origins are in what is common we come from the dirt but humans are invited to transcend those dirty Origins and in some way participate in the life and presents and relational communion with the Holy One the source of all life this is Bible project podcast from John Collins along with Tim Mackie and let's talk about sex food childbirth and skin disease when you see how they're deeply woven into the vocabulary and themes
 or I would have been on Recycle over and over and over again all of a sudden all these features of these chapters just be in the pop with significant thanks for joining us here we go
Tim hey John hey there we are rocking the Book of Leviticus yes as one does The Book of Leviticus it's the third book in the Bible it's the third book in a five-part collection of books called the Torah and we've been walking through the whole Torah this year and here we are we're actually in the middle of the Torah we are where the middle of Leviticus 5 skull collection but it really is a digtriad Genesis first goal which matches in many unique ways to the other end of the Torah the to drown me scroll and then in the center are the three Scrolls Exodus Leviticus Numbers which are bound together in a tight Unity that makes it one big unit of three parts that most Leviticus in the center and then Leviticus has three parts and the center of the center of Leviticus is the section that went right now has three parts which were three movements the first movement was
 chapters 1 through 7 looking at 5 offerings as a problem and this is all part of the Tabernacle ritual and the second movement is been the Centre of Leviticus and there's three kind of sections of the sensor movement begins with a narrative what we call Leviticus chapters 8 through 10 which is about the inauguration of the tent Tabernacle at the center of Israel's camp and the ordination of the priesthood that will serve in and around that sacred 10-minute happens over a period of seven days and hear the priests are set apart chosen to be the representatives of all of this for life before God serving in the heaven in earth spot which is the Tabernacle so they were ordained instead of part and on the 8th day so that's first day on the job is that a today and they start their work of me to offering sacrifices
 which symbolize you always gift of a substitute life that will cover for the sins in the impurity of the people that's atonement they begin to surrender themselves and all his real to God through sacrifice is not rings but then the two sons of Aaron decide with poor judgement that they want to rewrite the Liturgy that they were just told to go back exactly and so they take the place of their dad by offering unauthorized fire inside the tent which is only for their dad to do right now and they do it and the same Divine fire that showed up to bless the people into like signify the union of God and the resulting in blessing enjoy that same Divine fire now consumes the to Reveille sons of Erin if I could sue them you mean killed them it kills them yeah but at the fire eats them and that's a par
 love the way to the store is links back to Genesis 3 which is all about the eating that leads to death it's a the fire eats them and leads to death and the reason why this is so intense and the reason why this is at the center of the center of the center is because this is God for the first time since the Garden of Eden yeah yeah creating a space where humans and God can do all together and can work together in order to bring blessing to the world that's the story The Garden of Eden it was lost and now here's the story being represented to Israel God is doing it though within the customs of this ancient world of sacrifices priest skip rituals he's using all of that
 in order to help them understand a reality that he is making happen which is to use them to then bring blessing to the world's right and even A step above that the biblical authors are using this material from their family history as a part of a much bigger Mosaic that makes up the Hebrew Bible that leads to the need for an anointed representative who will do for Israel and for all Humanity what nobody has yet been able to do and the name of that noise representative in the Torah and Prophets goes by a variety of titles and images one of them is the Michelle the anointed one and the first anointed one in the Bible is having her here happened in this section of the book errands today as the high priest be the true human who then can enter into God's present and in this case because they're still a rat
 creates purification and atonement for all the people to the all the people can then be encamped around God's presence and Aaron Sons were invited to go along with that mess so these are two uniquely anointed ones that apart to give their lives holy in obedience to God's instruction and commands to live by you always order all as the image of one on behalf of Israel but then as the image of Future Hope Of A Renewed Humanity that lives by the wisdom and Order of God and so these it's not just an average Israelite you know who like forgets not to light a fire on the Sabbath or something and he lights a fire Hoops I forgot you know it's like these are two of the high priests sent on the first day on the job yeah and so that severe neglect of you always word warrants the rest of your response
 and so they die yeah the sons die by Got Talent and what they're doing is also fitting in with a pattern of humans choosing to discern between good and bad holy a Fein on their own terms instead of letting God give that to them they have the story of Adam and Eve eating from the Tree of knowing good and bad and then it's also a hyperlink to the story of Noah and his sons yes and Noah getting drunk and them trying to do something younger son's inappropriately trying to usurp his father's Authority or honor in the tent and so what's interesting is both Adam and Eve's failure story and that story of what ham to do his dad in the tent are both being hyperlink to in the story
 are we clear this story is where Aaron's two sons go in to begin the vocation of the priests iPhone 4 is real and they go Rogue Strange Fire when we learned that they were drinking on the job they were eating the fruit well they go into the tent and do something there that they were not authorized to tell your only their dad was and then after they die their dad does not protest which is a narrative signal that he recognizes that they did something they did something wrong and they got what was coming to them and then God says to their dad all right new role new rule never get drunk before you come to do your Priestly service just don't do it as I put this one in writing so one so that you can do your job but then second because you need as a priest to have all of your intellect on
 the highest level of alert so that you can make separations between what is Holy and dedicated Yahweh and what is common in between what is pure and between what is Empire end so that you can become a teacher to Israel of all these things and so that opens up into this next section of the book that we can talk about right now
 easy to just think of this as ancient rituals that you need to try to understand and there's just things that they did that because of that time in human history is what they're doing but all of this is meditation on the bigger the biggest story in its Torah with me instruction this is instruction for us to sit with and to realize what does it mean to be the image of God what does it mean for God to partner with us and in what sense do we need to prepare ourselves and in what sense do we actually need a representative to go before us when you read the section of the book you shouldn't walk away thinking okay where do I need to go black put up a sacred tent do I find some goats and ridiculous is reading the flood narrative and where God says to know okay
 building about make it the size and none of us would say how do I respond to the story as scripture right how do I respond to what God might want to say to me through this story and none of us would walk away thinking okay I will I need to go build a boat to get some gopher wood it's a narrative that instructs me about how to respond to Godwin in my on my circumstances it becomes clear there's something God wants me to do and so all of these stories give me case studies positive and negative and everything in between and no it was one but this story is the sons of Aaron is another one in the story of God offering these commands about purity and impurity laws are a part of the story about today yep the Purity and impurity laws become after Aaron's sons died in the Holy place and have to be exiled and now it's like this is the ultimate crisis
 solution that God put in place is just completely falling apart it's as if they've been invited into always house and they just threw rebellion and neglect and dead bodies into his living room so now the relationship is damaged and you always living room has been you know vandalized with death and so what are we going to do well will you always says is I guess I need I need some priests who will first will not get drunk and second of all who will learn the importance of Holiness versus, this impurity versus impurity and then this chapter is the 11 through 15 of Leviticus are a long speeches from God to Moses to give to Israel about Holiness and communist in Purity and impurity these are chapters that there's some weird ancient laws in here these for me still today even though I
 really think there's an amazing wisdom here these are the most difficult chapters of the Bible for me to read while they're long that complicated and say they are full of things that are so distant and culture and time from me it's hard to read them sympathetically still for me and there's a lot of discussion around cringey stuff totally in the section whose quick flyover chapter 11 is about distinctions between pure and impure animals and this chapter along with Deuteronomy 14 are the foundation of the kosher food law kosher food laws that's what does foundation of a Kosher diet that some people still follows real Jewish people and Jews all over the world still today kosher salt the particular way out of the wisdom based on these chapters there became developed in history of Judaism all kinds of wisdom and guidelines about every type of food while you can't have cheeseburgers
 well yeah cuz you're mixing milk and meat for example so that's all begins life in chapter 11 chapter 12 is a chapter about how the reproductive fluid for a woman that come out of her body during childbirth those reproductive fluids render her ritually in pure talk about that and so there need to be a period of waiting and washing and sacrifices to purify her from that impurity chapter 13 14 or all about how people homes and clothing garments can be rendered virtually a through skin disease or mold or fungus around comes around and it now talks about reproductive fluid again about for men and women in the course of sexual intercourse or in the case of a woman's monthly. Or for a man
 in the course of a nocturnal emission but it again about how badly reproductive fluids and we'll talk about this and what follows render a person ritually in pure Sol Food childbirth sex and skin disease this is the subject matter of Leviticus 11 through 15th so what that's why I said cringy yeah so here's what I have found if you just read them at the surface level you'd really you'll get nothing out of it and I got nothing out of these chapter 3 years when you see how they're deeply woven into the vocabulary and themes of the tour as it has been on Recycle over and over and over again all of a sudden all these pictures of these chapters just be in the pop with significance that's one level another level The Game's new inside is to
 do some sympathetic cross-cultural imagining on our part so what we need to do is Imagine ourselves into an ancient Israelites setting for how the biblical authors viewed concepts of Holiness and commonest Purity and impurity and how they specifically how they viewed bodily fluids of blood and reproductive fluids and so I think that's where we should start actually cuz me this has been a huge area of learning and inside and also made these chapters really profound but they're saying so it should we go there across cultural analysis of bodily fluids or started by fluids should we start with we're going to start with Holiness and commonest about ready in a day
 what does it mean for something to be wholly versus common and what does it even mean to be wholly talk about that so start their you've Define Holiness as being set apart to be in the presence of an in the service of God so it's proximity and its connection and Trent yes let's start there then we went to her already earlier in our conversation a little bit of gas but we need to do to get it word holy in Hebrew Scottish it refers to a person place or thing yeah that has been brought into proximity or dedicated to the service of the god of Israel who's the creator of Heaven on Earth who is called throughout the Revival as the Holy One where in the book of Isaiah the Holy Holy Holy One triple holiday
 so holiness refers to the unique one-of-a-kind status of the one God of Israel who is claimed is the source of all life being goodness Beauty liar source of the I am the I am exactly so they're holding this refers to the unique one-of-a-kind wholly other above and beyond status of I am about this portrait of the god of the Bible is that this is a God who is so generous that wants to share being in existence and light and goodness and Beauty with one who is other than God's Own Self and this is the concept of Creation in the biblical story and so God creates and other who can exist in limited autonomy and freedom to just be
 but that being is an invitation to become connected to the source in the relationship and so is this the beginning of the idea of being common that humans are made of the dirtiest exactly yeah so in the biblical story creation and then humans began as one who is other than the Holy One that is, nor the Hebrew word his whole whole whole for your throat called so these are two fundamental categories you could haul them a status something in the biblical imagination something is either wholly or it's cool it is a car dash or hole or common is not bad something can be beautiful and good and be coming in fact almost all the craziness but in this words often translate is profane makes it sound bad because it's not kind of nations in Modern English that was the King James like that's right deal
 threats of Kurdish and whole sow a flower tree table do you know his whole cumin and a human humans are coming however humans are unique in the biblical story because they are invited their Origins are in what is common we come from the dirt but humans are invited to transcend those dirty Origins and in some way participate in the life and presents and relational communion with the Holy One the source of all life and so go through a process of what Biblical Arthur's will call Kadesh the real word for Holy and then to Kadesh means to become wholly what is another word that translated their right often times to make only does that signify we have other English words yeah yeah we have make holy commonly in our English translations is the word
 if I cut or to consecrate right or two Hollow to how low how low is it all fancy words we don't use in common English not a means to take something that is common and transform it to become wholly bring it in the presence of God at the service of God and that's the destiny of all Humanity the calling of all humanity is to come from our material, material origins in the biblical magic nation has to come from the dirt but to be raised up and elevated to the status as an image of God to be creatures in him having a nurse God's presence in our material dirty Origins become fused as one and that is the process of Kadesh being Sanctified, and then would you say it's also the destiny of all of creation to undergo that as well Genesis 1 frames that The Seventh-Day points forward
 to the crowning of all creation as a place we're having a nurse in God's face in human space are one in the seventh step in common is not bad not today but it's not the idea either yeah it's a beginning point to beginning Point everything begins is common so maybe we can maybe think it's a boss you know here so he's really be good ones interesting ones so my boys are a young 8 and 10 and we have in our house our house isn't huge but on the main floor the kitchen living room dining room for all kind of one extended big space and then off to the side or a couple of bedrooms and bathrooms on right now they're bedroom is in the upstairs attic they have like an old finished attic crouch in the southern Point by the downstairs bedroom we've converted for years all the years they've been growing up is there playroom with musicians to constant mass of Legos and star
 doctor figures this thing started about three years ago or when they go in there to play they close the door has our space and particularly with the closet door and we can hear them through the door or acting out stories and they're in their in their imaginative World here and the meanest hilarious off and I'll stick my little black phone camera underneath the door trying to see it and just a record them cuz they're like literally they're acting out movies than the worries and anyway but what we've noticed is when I open the door to like tell them hey like dinners going to be ready in 10 minutes they both fries or just look at me. Like we were caught and then I closed the door and then they start acting him in so the doors like a portal it is and when the door is closed it's like a holy space it's dedicated to their imagination there play acting and it becomes another word for them but the moment that door is opened it's like reality breaks in
 and once they hear and see you know Jessica and I out you know making dinner or something and they can see us you don't from the ankle and it just breaks the illusion and it's no longer holy so there's something about that space is uniquely dedicated to their imaginative story world and when it's sealed off it's like protected and closing the door. Five of space and it separates it as a dedicated to a separate for that will get the Purity in a second but I'll just once I close the door is separated as a holy space and they don't act that way out in the kitchen they don't act that way out in the living room for the moment that's what it is now if I were to consecrate the living room and to say boys I want you to see this as a part of your imaginative world now you can take over the living room that would be a consecration or a sanctification of the living room because the space is known as you have to bring the Legos out
 yeah you have to like make sure it could be closed off but here's the thing let's say Jessica and I were to get like a little camp stove and decide we're going to set up kitchen and dinner in the playground tonight and then we just like a lost in there and started making pancakes on a little you know little camp cooking frying pan something that would be defiling the word would be defiling or profane in their holy space and it's a verb connected to member hole is the word for common a hole hole and to defile or profane is Kal-El the same big coloring letters to make to treat us coming when you see the word defile or profane in the Bible what it means is you're taking something that's dedicated to the space for one in the Bible for Yahweh
 we're treating it like it's an everyday common space that belongs to you for the beat comment isn't this really bad it's a starting place but to take something that has been set apart yes as holy and treated at treated as common at spot that's not good 0.0 so the existence of the categories establishes an order and where the value or like an ethical issue was a play is not whether or not you're Holier common is how you cross the boundaries between holding in common so Aaron's sons were set apart as holy but then they just introduced their own ideas and how to do the Liturgy and they just dropped into the holy space and so they made what was dedicated for Yahweh their own it's so defiled or treated it as if it were their own and so made a common so that's all this language of to sanctify consecrate the hollow is to take something, to make it holy
 and then the reverse process to take holy entreat his comment is to profane it or defile it so these are fundamental categories to the biblical authors in other words there's no book of the Bible that explains it the way we're trying to clean it right now it just is taken for granted. Which is how you know it's one is cultural assumptions
search for step Salinas, this is something is coming it can exist in one of two conditions Pure or impure
 so and my chart might help here no one else gets to see this but so holiness of Holiness is being this category off to the right and then when something is in a state of being hold a common it can exist in one of two states and think of this is like a condition way we might think of like a health condition only one way to be wholly there's two different states of being common common yep. A yeah and so is very analogous to our concepts of sickness and health which is why the biblical authors use sickness or help is very common metaphors to describe Purity and impurity so the word pure pure has become the word that I prefer in almost all of our English translations it's the word clean alright clean an alien versus unclaimed which I understand why it's a venerable Tradition Way of translating these Hebrew words but I think it
 doesn't quite get us all the way there. A also have their own baggage that are not helpful it in English too so the word pure or cleans the word to hair to make pure and then to be Emperor or the unclean is Tom a tire is to exist in an ideal State as a common object person place or thing in ideal State healthy whole do not consecrated yet you're not like in the presence of God being the priest being being being in the Holy space this is just like if your life in the world at the common man you're a dirt creature but things are good you're not sick your body is working that's correct pure you exist in state hair exist in a tire State enter that's right
 but to exist in the Empire State means that you have come into contact with a force or a substance or an experience that has brought you to the boundary between life and death and when you touch things associated with death you go from being pure to becoming Contracting impurity impurity is a lot like a contagion something you contract by touching it or eating it or experiencing it but as we can see in these chapters the things and Nation Israel's culture the were associated with death and mortality were certain animals reproductive bodily fluids skin diseases fungus and mold when you come in contact with those things yeah it makes you think you are in pure I started thinking of Purity as a sense of just wholeness of like nobody is working or not sick that makes sense but then you threw in like I could be in pure
 cuz you're such an animal that's trying this category have its so it's not just like how my body is but it's also like what I've come in contact with something Purity is status, that's a lot Life Health and if you see I mean we're living in the middle or tail end Lord have mercy categories are really familiar to us here where I'm healthy I might feel great but maybe I've been around somebody who has the virus and so for a. Of time I have to seal off and I treat myself and act and the others treat me as if I have the virus to this is very similar to these Concepts here yeah it's not just about you being healthy to be pure is didn't exist in a state where you are healthy and enough I dealed State and you haven't come into contact with anything so in some way
 think of this as ancient sanitary practices would appear to us it appears that way like who cares if that's right like touching reproductive fluids like that's not going to Harmony what's right so this is a good example to save all cultures have these what we might call them like to write taboos and there's a lot of overlap in fact there's a Hebrew Bible scholar Mary Douglas who most of her scholarly career was dedicated to trying to do cross comparisons in anthropology across cultures present and ancient as a background for Illuminating the Purity and then. Laws of Leviticus and I never stopped books on that topic would be interesting to read but she's such a good writer that our first most important work was called Purity and danger which just makes my pick it up
 so we talked about this years ago would be the only this video you brought up this really wonderful taboo that we have that doesn't make any sense yet important to say some of them make intuitive sense in different ways to different people but usually some of them seem irrational if you don't inhabit the home culture of the taboo right because a lot of our taboos around sanitation make sense wash your hands after you go to the bathroom makes sense eating a meal in the bathroom would feel weird to us if it is what I was going to bring up is that you said look like it's a taboo you don't go and eat in the bathroom at that place is dirty when you're done with that you wash a load of washing with school yes so you can bring food in there and you brought up but it's an interesting we brush our teeth in the bathroom and then leave the toothbrush sometimes out on the counter
 just hanging out hanging out in the unclean today's and you're telling me that if you flush the toilet with the seat little water particles aren't floating up Eco matter on your toothbrush floating in and coming on you tooth brush but we don't care that is happening happening and we don't think nothing of it you know and now like hundreds of people are like my toothbrush and you know we got we have very laissez-faire when it comes to germs and I think because also it's irrational to think that somehow we would need in the bathroom that's irrational because somehow we think the kitchen is more clean than the bathroom and make sense of all the stuff I'm just saying like my kitchen sink and the way my kids treat
 is no more clean than my bathroom they'll spit in it they'll bring in the be digging the backyard and they'll come rinse mud off Eric's some nail they found and left really think about it like we can protect ourselves from all the germs but we have rituals to help us think that we are answered and also help us correct but the point here is that every culture has its own taboos around cleanliness and some of them are usually grounded in what we would my call physical realities but often there are irrational elements too often they're just pissed about the actions that at the end of the day or symbolic symbolic yeah because you wash your hands after you like use a toilet but you know what the dirtier than a toilet seat public keyboard yes of course oh yeah people pick their nose pick their ears rubbed their eyes and let someone go to the library and Mike use the internet
 yeah that's right or up public door knob
 totally so I mean like that's right has many of us to B ramp it up more aware of these things never before so that same irrationality inherently rationality it should humble us when we read the chapters of Leviticus we still can't I get the thing about not touching corpses of dead animals that would render somebody in the reproductive fluid like what that about that's normal to us that's easy to get to I suppose I mean it's kind of icky yeah but I think what we have to get underneath we have to stay the way every culture slices the pies going to be different yeah I think the animal thing is probably the hardest to sympathize with yeah yeah but even their does intuition unlike some animals are icky gross unsanitary yeah that's right but underneath all of this this is an opportunity for let's jump to the conclusion before we just get into the Yeah Yeah Yeahs this is an opportunity for that
 Israel on a daily basis and everyday life like have their imaginations shaped by this idea of life and death that they're kind of on the boundary like life is on the boundary between life and death and at any given moment you are in one of these states and why is that important why is that a significant thing to stress over it so yeah yeah another testing now that's right so move the sick of it this way within the biblical story all the way back to Genesis 1 and 2 specially for the Garden of Eden Genesis 1 Yahweh is the source of all life all life order Beauty goodness we have late so anything that is existing in a state of death mortality or dying of in here I'm trying to inhabit the imagination of these lost you out here having some sort of physical malformation
 a body that sits in the state of disorder decaying Rotting Flesh assigns that I am a mortal being that is dying this is all a state of being that is not the way that it's supposed to be if I'm in proximity to Yahweh if I'm in proximity to Yahweh Holiness and his goodness and his Beauty and his life or should meet health and yes it will mean eternal life yeah so on one side of the spectrum is yahweh's life and Holiness and state of order and on the opposite end of the spectrum is death chaos impurity Etc and so every Israelite saw themselves as somewhere on that Spectrum never static always moving towards one end or the other by what they ate but it's binary whether you're pure n pure yeah that's right
 oh I understand okay yeah I got I got is binary and you're either yeah. I thrust into an interstate it's right and then those rituals to get you back so there's this constant like day today you're like okay I'm in I'm in a state and a boom all the sudden I have to like deal with a dead body that's right this is so important in this is crucial friend staying the whole thing this was a Jewish scholar Jonathan Club on his books in in in Purity in ancient Israel this is where I first learned the concept and you know it's not his concept it's right there in Leviticus be ritually Emperor is not sinful it's not bad not a moral failure not a moral failure you enter a state of ritual impurity when you bury your uncle yeah what you should do is totally you become ritually in pure every time my husband and wife have sex which is a blessing
 in the song of songs and it's a place where three always mercy and generosity new life can be whenever a child is brought into the world is a lot of bodily fluids that render the mother in in the Midwife and anybody else involved ritually a when you hold a baby newborn and the fluids on it renders somebody ritual a when you have a skin disease in a boil the breaks out and begins to spread a trench with you richly a so nobody's done anything wrong here these are all fluids substances or experiences that bring us to the border of life and death and what's the strange one might be childbirth cuz you like it's life but that's just life via but childbirth is an Experian fraud with the danger of death it's a life event that brings both mother and child death's doorstep in a way that's successful childbirth and a healthy mom and
 dialed you know after Labor is a miracle it's a deliverance from Death think of how they would have imagined it and it still is today a deliverance from Death in many ways so we're talking and reproductive fluids think of it this way these are fluids that in ancient imagination these are the fluids if they mix together male reproductive fluids and female reproductive fluid they mix together the male reproductive fluid in Hebrews called Sarah which seed is the Greek word for seed is 7 oz which is where we get our English word Stephen and then on the flip side so that's the seed and then in English we have all of these words for like the egg you know that the egg producing ovaries but the word ovary comes from the Greek word ovum which is egg is the egg maker about this is agricultural imagery about seed and
 eggs but it's all about the Genesis of life and so if you're leaking these fluids that showing that there's a problem so this is why I'm a man who likes these fluids from his body outside of sexual intercourse or a woman in the course of a monthly. Leaks these fluids it's viewed as a sign of dying it's like you're dying your leaking your life substance and so it makes you rich really in pure and it's not wrong but it is a sign that I'm a dirt creature that my body is strong with us it's not a moral failure not a moral points to a sense that there's a corruption it what it shows is that I'm leaving outside of Eden there's something wrong and which I've been happening within the biblical story cuz we're reading this within a scrawled in the story that begin with Genesis 1:1
 what I was told was that humans are capable if somehow our way of existing could be transformed that we are creatures capable of becoming one with the life and presence of God and living forever but that's clearly not the state that we're in we are right now outside of Eden in the state of death and dying and anything that's associated with death and dying reproductive fluids out of place childbirth even though it's a new life coming into the world that brings both mother and child close to death skin disease and then certain animals those are all signs of the disorder and decay in the mortality of our wives
 if it's so important to come to terms with that reality it is so important that there's a whole ritual around it yeah there's a whole categories and making sure you understand when you're in you're out I'll just kind of like shape our imagination towards Reckoning with the state correct yep the threat so all of these rituals and taboos were a daily reminder and for us they function is Torah instruction and wisdom because they become narrative images that give insight into what it means to live outside of Eden to all of our Lives is permeated with reminders that we are not in Eden
 and in biblical imagination you know and it's ancient cultural context it's all these things that this loss is so it will be cool to jump in and look at some of them but tell me about that what's the wisdom what's the Torah what am I supposed to take about these things into my life am I supposed to be hyper-aware of the Frailty of creation like in the Miss was to create some sort of Rhythm that allows me to do so to go from it a state you're in a state it's important I was not morally wrong it's temporary it's as long as the condition last and then when you want to go from a state of impura back to Pure these are called purification rituals for cleansing rituals it may involve taking a bath waiting a period of seven days and then offering a offering in the 10th which is a purification offering so so funny
 lyrics to the pandemic because we have all three of those we like wash our hands we like quarantine and then we like provide the like the test that says it's exactly it and then the reverse process to go from a state of Purity to Imperial tea is the verb pollute or to make something in Peoria so what's the wisdom here so the wisdom here is that I am constantly living at the border of life and death I'm a mortal creature and becoming a warrior is not morally wrong but what it reminds me is that I live outside of Eden and I live in a world that is not the way it's supposed to be you or that it could be so to come out of a stay into a state means that I am ready to go enter the holy place
 it's not wrong to be empty or what is morally wrong in Israel's culture is to enter into the holy space when I'm in a state when you're in a state you're cut off from the holy don't go into the outer courts to do sacrifices can't come near that's right there's a law in the book of numbers that says before Israel set out and it's Wilderness Journeys they made sure to get anybody with the skin disease or a touch the dead body or a fluids in the last 7 days and they have to go to the border of the camp they couldn't travel inside the camp itself have to go behind and that was their way of honoring this that when y'all way is in our midst we remove whatever is associated with death to be far away from the hot spot of the source of all life to be in a state is not morally wrong but it is a sign that I'm cut off from the storyline far as far from life as you can be and so to enter into a
 birthday it is to go one step closer to being tipped to be in the Holy presence and it means that I'm restored to a status of health and life but to be pure doesn't mean you're in the Holy place means that you can now go into the holy place if you want to and then that to go from a state to entering into the holy place that becomes sanctification or consecration so it's the here's our Spectrum you go from being in pure to becoming pure and then what's your pure you're eligible to become wholly the Holiness Purity or not the same thing to become wholly you need to be in a Shiite that's not the question that you asked me though I'm just realizing know but that's important to get at the question which is yeah what is the wisdom here when I'm reading these Purity laws am I thinking about what are ways for me to mark some sort of boundary of like there's one thing that came to mind I've been noticing
 and a lot of people notice this and we don't know what to do with it is at social media is toxic if it's so great it's so fun to like Noah people are up to and share ideas and and the social media that I find myself drawn to specifically his Twitter because Twitter's verify Social Media site give me your ideas give me all your hot takes apart from any relational commitment there's no energy required to be nice to somebody else just like here is my kids my thought scares the doctors thought he was perfect for any grandpas but you spend any time in there and there's just this toxicity of people just not being nice and taking sides and being grumpy and
 fingers and kind of starting to mean and anyways it actually changes my mood it like I faxed me you notice it like I like it I'm drawn to it but then I like to see crumpy and so it's almost be interesting for me to think about that as one of those boundaries I go into their like it's in a way I'm now entering into a state that's like broken and it's going to affect me and I might need some sort of ritual kind of cleanse myself of that away like to get some separation and buy a having a ritual or having that mentality that helps me really respect what I'm actually after because it's another type of analogy that more closely tied to like a physical food or body and this is so relative to your social location but in my relational network of families in the culture of my home
 sugar become something that the real subject of like critical reflection refined sugars refined sugars and so has my wife been on a mission over the last decade to really make refined sugars unpalatable To Us by not having them around and not using them and so I've come to the strange place where starts to feel kind of unclean he is start yeah like I used to love whenever is doing a house project like on the weekend you know to last project and I will go to the hardware store and we just love to get a Snickers and just like power up on a Snickers bar come back in like whatever fix the locks on the doors and yeah that's happened to me last year at some point where I had the Snickers on my way home from the hardware store and I just felt sick and I almost didn't enjoy the last half I was just like and I would not tell
 when I do this yeah it's so I told her about the Snickers experience then she was like yeah your body is actually becoming unaccustomed to this thing that's not good for it but it takes a while anyway I was such an interesting experience where I was like I grew up on this I love these and now it makes me sick and I don't want it now so anyway each person could tell their own stories and I'm not trying to throw any judgment on Snickers bars for refined sugars have become a category in your mind that now when you have them yeah I kind of feel like you're in another state I do have entered into a new seal yes exactly and I'm like this is not the version of myself that's going to bring my best to the world and I think that's the category here that's an experience that maybe we can relate to yeah I think it's interesting to think about you know there's a connection between obsessing about being in that state when you go into the location to do things that a quote-unquote holy connected to
 In God's Presence it seems like there is real wisdom there which is if you're going to like go preach on Sunday morning would be good that you're in the right kind of mind frame one hopes this out of their spiritual leaders if you're a part of it you know Church community and that they weren't eating sugar per se but like things that like that they're like healthy well-adjusted expecting it I suppose in a way which is dangerous people within the biblical story and within the melody there's this desire that God has to share his own life and creative power
 and possibilities that come with it and the responsibilities that come what else is the theme of the image of God except God wanting to share divine power and life with the one of his creatures but it's going to call that creature to a level of responsibility and wisdom about what are the conditions that lead to true life and flourishing for human and so these a d laws were again it's not morally bad right it's not morally bad to check like you no touch reproductive fluids if you're a midwife you know giving birth it's not like the Snickers bar at all actually cuz it's it's not bad for you touch a newborn baby covered with bodily fluids back in your blood sugar and no it's not it's not so but it is a fluid that reminds you that this life came out of a moment
 an experience where this all could have died all this beautiful life of the mother and the child could have died and so for a. Of 7 days or the biggest 12 is 33 or 66 days this was such a holy moment I was such at the border of like a critical moment of life and death that I am going to sit apart for big chunks of time to mark this moment as a moment where I came near to death than by sitting apart that's just means you're not doing the sacrifices and uses I'm going to abstain from going near to the holy place for a. Of time to what's the wisdom there though because we wouldn't say like hey don't go to hang out with your community but it is a unique experience got the power actually in the Christian liturgical tradition this is essentially what the practice of Lent is about and it just so happens.
 in the year 2022 yeah but it's a way of withholding yourself from certain Pleasures not because they're bad but because the immediate satisfaction of a pleasure is a part of a larger problem with the Human Condition which is meeting our desires and Pleasures in our own wisdom and around timing in ways that are destructive to ourselves most people not every desire and not all the time but often and so I'm going to choose one pleasure dressing fasting innocence is wisdom from these and fasting it is associated with grieving and mourning and death in fact you would often dress up like you're dead shave your head put dust on yourself where's that cloth fasting is a way of existing in a state of impurity for a chosen. Of time and what it does is it forms me to one regard is so precious when I get to be in a state of purity
 also it increases my appreciation for the time or place of holding us so for Christian lent its the days weeks leading up to Resurrection Sunday does the ultimate Holi event of God's life invading Earth so can I guess in a way that it's what I meant to say about it shaped you into a kind of people who are hyper aware of my own mortality but also makes you more appreciative of the Holy time and space when is Grace's you thanks for asking that question I appreciate that yeah that's cool that makes me want to do that actually I never do it I mean I thought it was a choice but yeah it's cool yeah I know that for some people the liturgical calendar the experiences may be something from the family of origin or whatever but the intention of these liturgical Traditions is to retell the biblical story with your body and your time
 calendar your whole self the purpose of Lent is 2 annually have a season of time where you mind yourself that you're dying and a part of the reason that we're dying this was constantly meet our desires in our own way and in our on time it's going us so we withhold our desires for myself there's even actually separating from the community where here is a separation there's a like you're in pure go to the outside of the camp is a little different in that way here's the thing we need to bring different parts of our experience based on your social location and merge them all together to try and imagine ourselves into this ancient Israelite context but for them these are all one thing to exist in state of impurity cuz their skin disease more cuz I was touched by my own reproductive fluids or whatever but it was right now I'm going to set up part I've been in touch with something that brought me close to the force of death I'm going to sit aside for 7 days
 and this could have been the attitude you bring to quarantine in yourself then the pandemic yes okay right like it makes it a anticipatory you mean just at the category of his bike so I'm not going to just go quarantine because I'm supposed to health reasons like I'm actually going to allow this to be a Sacrament it's time of morning being or time of recognizing my own mortality I'm actually separated from everyone I'm going to recognize mortality and frailness this is the world that live in this is clearly marking that more let's write one last thing
 being Emperor is contagious if you're around somebody who's in the ritual a state you can make them in pure by touching them and so being ritually in pure is contagious Holiness which is the opposite end of the spectrum is contagious so when people come into contact with the Holy foods of the temple that hole in it get transferred to them but you know could be dangerous for example but being in a state is not contagious when you're in a state you could either get leveled up to Holiness by contacting it or you can get leveled away from Holiness towards impurity by touching it and so in Purity and Holiness for the two contagious States so what is fascinating and here just this is a good luck getting your friends together on Friday night and read the Gospel of Luke out loud and you just watch Luke has an intentionally placed in all of his healing narratives
 the people who would be populating the list of Leviticus 11 through 15 uniquely Jesus touch his dead bodies he touches people a woman leaking menstrual blood touches people with skin diseases he goes into the homes of non Israelites who would not be eating kosher it's truly remarkable Luke has intentionally showing Jesus as the Holy One Of God which is called it Luke axe is called the Holy One of God and he is God's contagious Holiness moving out one-by-one just checking off the list of people from Leviticus 11 to go to things that would make someone in pure yes when Jesus comes in contact with Luke and then look always highlighting matches them which would render a normal pure Israelite in pure but in the case of Jesus his contagious Holiness actually transfer
 turns the NPR thing into pure which makes them step for the presence of God so this is a cool way how these chapters might seem so extreme and desire but they actually Illumina how Jesus all the world and why he moved towards the kinds of people that he did it's because he knew these trapped as well and they informed his view of the world and he didn't think they were bad Jesus didn't overturn the systems but what he did was use his holy power to bring people into a state of Purity to bring them into proximity to Holiness that's a cool way the disconnect to Jesus this chapter in Leviticus are a part of the unified story that leads to Jesus at school and that's a part of town and it makes me realize that if I am going to start to imagine my own modern Purity rituals that has to be grounded in this reality that to be in relationship with Jesus is be made pure yeah cuz once a year leading up to his death
 imagine like what if I didn't have that yeah he's going to die yes and I'm so Resurrection Sunday do you celebrate nope that's not the reality but we don't have to live in that day in and day out we get to live in this reality of being connected to Purity that's contagious and Holiness of contagious contagious Holiness even the parts of my life that I've been touched by mortality or suffering or death can transform them make them whole and pure branches, which is common yeah okay all right there you go that's no way to tie that up in a bow but we didn't read any of them actually read any of these passages well listen to the podcast you have some helpful categories now that can help you go read them with greater understanding
