hey this is John the Bible project and this is our final conversation in our series on the family of God how God created all of humanity and all of our diversity to be one family but the impulse of humanity isn't to be unified through our diversity is rather to mistrust each other rule over each other and cream violence and oppression we see this mystery Babylon we also see this in the story of Israel as slaves in Egypt and Babylon and story of The Exodus and Deuteronomy 32 there's this developing theme that the many nations that have don't want to live under the allegiance of the Creator God think they're they're giving their allegiance to the ultimate Divine being but in reality they're giving their allegiance to Idols which are wood or stone and nothing or even worse they are actually being deceived by dark spiritual powers that manifest themselves
 through social structures dark spiritual powers that enslave us according to the Bible this is the reality of the world who live in so who will stand up to be spiritual Powers who will display a power that is greater than violence and Injustice in the book of Ephesians the Apostle Paul believe that that job is for us and they'll see our power through our diverse Unity does Multiverse wisdom is demonstrated through a multi diverse community of people to whom to whom is that wisdom made known through multi First Community people to the principalities and powers do today on the show we're going to see how passionately the Apostle Paul cares about the unity of God's family he doesn't care about Unity just for Unity sake Paul believes the church is bringing back our calling of being God's image and showing that to all of creation
 thanks for joining us here we go
all right let's continue we've got this discussion we look at the book of Ephesians and Lil Bit of Galatians this will be the last one then we'll do a question response and then there's going to be some interviews come after the series about a books or articles from some theologians I read recently that really tight end in a powerful way to the seems we've been talking about in the family got serious yes, Coley yep and that one was already done and then there's one more and I am not even in the New Testament scholar Andrew Rivera has done some really important work on Jew Gentile identity and unity in the letter to the Ephesians that I learned a lot from them so we're going to talk to him about that the theme of the family of God to me is actually been a little bit surprising I think overall and I mentioned in the outro to last week's are the start of the intro to last week's episode
 I think this team can get kind of buried and hidden in the Bible because a lot of the story is about God electing one real family and he actually gives them a lot of laws to keep them separate and favor and then even though this is all for the for the purpose of being a blessing to the nation's and bringing the blessing of Eden into the world the story is actually that they become really insular and become you know violent to other nations like it is about as much trouble and curse on the non Abraham mites around him as he does blessing but when it comes to his descendants they bring mostly bad news to their neighbors and then sometimes their neighbors and so Israelites also become God's agent of
 bringing Justice upon their neighbors as much as being agents of God's blessing really gets complicated it's complicated especially estranged family members and the most complicated relationships usually theme in the idea of every human is represented in all these different nations and tribes and tongs are part of the image of God We're All In The Family Of God but if someone were to say John put together some thoughts on the family of God the thing I would immediately be thinking about is the very select few I think I get to be in the family of God and not starting with the sense of he looked God's God's desires for every every nation. Yeah so the biblical story begins with this really expanded unified view of the Human family is God's image when that fractures laser focus in on one particular family
 and you think oh I just got favors just one family just like God Favored one brother Abel instead of Cain but then you know God comes in addresses can if I can come over between you and me you're struggling here and things will go great there will be good that's what he says there will be good if you do what is right for you to do if you do get there will be exaltation for you to gain and so is a similar Dynamic at work the family of Abraham has chosen not just to go to heaven when they die what their chosen is to be the vehicle of God's blessing to all the other non chosen families and then they'd do worse or better job from generation to generation at that what you also see is that the chosen family is not morally Superior in any way to the non Chosen and the flip side is that is often among the non chosen families that God raises up Heroes and delivers for the chosen family is it really
 messes with your sense of its us a story was good people and bad people in phatic Lee know the story about humans yeah but that doesn't erase the fact that God does choose one and commit himself to working through that one family even though they don't deserve it and even though there's a lot better people outside that family but it's really amazing. I think another thing that has surprised me a little bit you know I grew up with the Bible and so I grew up understanding this idea of every tongue trap nation schedule culture where you know going out like at missionary yeah right and then making sure that everyone from all these different nations can hear about Jesus but for me I think I just thought of it is just like this it's some sort of finish line where then Jesus can come back and everything can be restored and he'll do that yeah but he'll bring Unity to the nation and didn't click was
 the unity between the Nations that the reason why every nation needs to be included as for Unity they were just some other arbitrary Finish Line I think alike then we get there then he's come back and be good and maybe it was like so everyone has a chance or something like that but but this idea of the unity of the nation being so important and so this idea of unity among the nation's yeah being so important to the Bible and even and we end there and then the revolution bit more for Paul it's not just of this is a implication or a consequence that follows from what Jesus did it's actually basic to the message of the gospel group all this Unity of humans across the boundary lines outside the community of Jesus is all these boundary lines he's going to name some gender definition of d your Nash
 identity your socioeconomic identity most communities are stratified and divided up along those lines and for Paul it's basic not just it's not just a consequence of the good news about Jesus that those boundary lines should be transcended for him it's it's basic to the message the message doesn't mean what it means if there isn't a community of people doing this alongside their message of the gospel and what is the gospel it's the Jesus is the crucified and Risen King of all Nations and if these people are as divided as everywhere else that they're not actually demonstrating their allegiance to the universal King I think that's what I'll get so riled up when these issues are on the line like in the letter to equations equations you're going to start there. Plus there's a lot going on but there's just a couple of touchdown points for the really make this point very quickly and why it matters so much to fall and then after that
 that we could take a quick tour of the steam which is the unifying theme in his letter to the Ephesians from the first paragraph to the final paragraph
so Papa letter to the Galatians he's riding somewhere early in his missionary career Scholars of Paul's letters debate about the dates of the letters and so on but there's a significant number of New Testament Scholars who think that Galatians is actually his earliest the earliest of his letters so I put us in the early fifties I think my so bad it really specific chronology things are you bad at that what would it comes to Paul I've tried to memorize the chronologies so many times I always forget cuz it's complicated anyway how did they even try to discern it's it's difficult what they have to do is locate an event in Paul's life in relation to some other publicly dated event that you can use other sources to corroborate and so it's a big jigsaw puzzle being made of not all the pieces with no picture on the lid it's a different Scholars you know a little bit differently
 but everybody agrees on is that Paul plant has a bunch of churches Jesus community's opinion with today would be like Northern turkey has called in the Empire and who was majority non Israelites Gentiles and this letter is written to them sometime after how many years after people debate these things but the thing that's happened that makes ball write the letter is what for him is a crisis there been some leaders Messianic Jewish to Jewish leaders in the Jesus movement who have been trailing Paul like when Paul leaves town after planting some Churches some people are following up and kind of giving their take on the Jesus story and that apparently they were affected cuz they show up in Corinth maybe but and apparently they were somewhere around Phillipi
 cuz he talks about in Phillipi so anyway what is people have convinced the Galatians to do or the some of them is to be circumcised Jewish people than trailing Paul okay Paul spreading these Jewish Messianic communities but they don't need to be circumcised and let's let him know you do you do you need to be to be a member of the community of Jesus the Messiah who is an Israelite Messiah of the family of Abraham you need to join the family of Abraham the way people who is doing the family they Ram including Israelites which is to be circumcised it was the Forefront issue now there's kosher laws and established but circumcision is the main the main point in Galatians in English and and so Paul usually starts his letters by like hey Grace and peace to you I pray this for you I got this report and he doesn't
 done with any prayer of thanks or kind hellos is just after introducing himself and who's riding to work I'm astonished at your behavior is just for him this is a this is not a minor issue he calls it a different good news the message that these other questions have brought that you need to be circumcised to become a part of the family of the Messiah I mean it's kind of like they're adding something or I guess it's subtracting something technically I could see myself in that position being a peacemaker wanting just to like things to be chill okay guys you did the saying yeah all right it's not that important they told you was a point it's not but he's like he's
 in his mind if they get this wrong that the Jesus movement won't actually viably spread to the Nations and the Jesus who loved him and gave himself for him as well stay in Chapter 2 won't be acknowledged as the true king of all Nations will simply Remain the the king of king of one particular subgroup of humanity but not the whole family and for Paul Jesus is and how he reads his Bible is that the exalted Messiah of Israel is the true image of God the truly human one who can put the Human family back on track with its location and to put this cultural barrier back on to all of these non-israelite is fine if it's July 21st and follow Jesus that's great but to make non Israelites do that for him it's an unneeded hindrance it's towards the purposes of God in his mind it's standing up
 most of the purposes of God and to the promise he gave to Abraham that he would become the father of many nations and it has been convinced that the purpose of God is to create a family that is brings in all the families and he see his demanding circumcision as opposing the will of God this is why he's so so worked up and write her I'm just trying to sympathetically enter his imagination and for him this this is another good news it's a news about an Israelite Messiah for Israelites and that's not to Jesus's football so he tries to make this point in multiple ways so it says listen I'm the most Jewish Jewish man you could ever meet he goes to his credentials and he's telling this to people who are. I've been circumcised
 there is no way anyone can accuse Paul of not being faithful to the Jewish Traditions but he's that guy you've always been like this Paul you've always kind of not cared enough about the Jewish faith so no one can make that accusation against him then he goes and then he start telling the story about something happens it at Antioch and whether a very recent past or sometime the past again this is all debated chronology who talks about how when he and Barnabas were at Antioch which was the first really multi-ethnic Jesus Community the launched the mission of the nation's when do we talk about Antioch RX series of school I learned a lot
 see we both like. Why does he do you bring you bring all the learning the first time I really kind of boarded this idea that there was this multinational Hub Court in Antioch at like I didn't really think Eliza Peter who here uses is Aramaic name refer to him and he wanted to check out to represent the Jerusalem Apostles like check out this new Hub of the Jesus movement and they're all these none Israelites and they'd given their allegiance to Jesus and Peter was up there for a while sleeping eating hanging out just in the community is awesome and he highlights that he had no problem eating and majority non-jewish Rim but at some point a representative group came from Jerusalem who was apart of the spa calls them the circumcision and there are part of this listen if you really want to follow Jesus you'll be coming
 and so when that group came like a pressure group he recounts the Peter stopped eating with non-jewish people and you we can infer their well there's likely to be non-kosher food at the table even if he does not eating it it's at the table and there's a bunch of people at the table to learn circumcised yes they convinced Peter to tighten up on this this thing that he allowed to do in Antioch which was while I'm here I'm going to be fine eating at the same table as people eating not Kosher all the Peter would have still been so sure there's no reason why he would have had to violate kosher laws himself if but the point is that he's sharing a table with somebody having ham sandwich over there even if Peter doesn't have one and so what's this pressure group comes from Jerusalem and these people are Christians they're Jewish Christians to come but they are all of the you got to be circumcised group and so Peter who we don't know it's so much until Baxter
 I didn't know them they had some influence over Peter where he says that he stopped eating separated himself from non-jewish Christians and a whole bunch of Jewish Christians Paul says acted hypocritically along with him and even Barnabas my coworker was influenced by these so I get this one I get the idea of being kicked off you're not going to eat at the same table cuz that's that's going to destroy Community totally that's it I got it at some point I'll catch a fine it's like an elective surgery I see well it's not going to destroy Community I see I mean it will B becomes an unneeded barrier I get that yeah but sorry to hear that so we have to imagine ourselves into a setting where if it becomes known that so-and-so got circumcised you're in the same House Church
 so until got circumcised. So now they're a real follower means that they probably think I'm not a real Christian if I'm not circumsized and then that wrist begins and now they won't even come over to my house and eat with me anymore cuz they say that there a real Christian Josh you know when you just said that yeah I was going current I was transporting Paul into the 20% sure let me keep us in the first century just for a few more minutes 14 what Paul says is when I saw that their conduct was not in step toward the truth of the goodness of the Gospel I confronted k-phos Peter before everybody and it goes into a speech where the Texas one of the most complicated paragraphs and all the pulse letting her wealth to translate and TripIt I actually don't want to get into that protect what I wanted to just name was that this isn't
 a theological debate as such this isn't like a debate between God have ecology debate but it's actually what is the good news what's at stake is what is the good news and what kind of community constitutes a community that created by the message of the goodness that's what's at stake here so he calls it actually says what I saw their conduct wasn't in step with its the Greek word verb or sepah. How do we get Orthopedic yeah so it to walk to that with a walk and then ortha to straight so the good news marks out of path that leads to a certain type of street-walking practice and way of life and there are steps you can take that go along that path and their steps you can take the beer you off the path
 towards the truth of the good news and letting a ethnic cultural practice create a division within the family of Jesus for Paw then you've compromised the gospel and this is where the classic quote if anyone preaches the gospel of the other gospel other than that that's a big problem the context is a one-wheel how did you just raise it we're here it's one ethnic group and not just any I think it's an Israelite ethnic groups and Jesus is the Messiah but they're saying You must take on and Israelite ethnic cultural identity to be a part of the family of Jesus in the family favorite ham that's a different good news Paul says it's not the goodness it's not God's good news that somebody else is good news is he just doesn't mince any words in this really hit me that what's that debate isn't just lie is your salvation
 a gift of God's grace or do you have to work for it and if it's a very common theological debate in our time and it's an important one but that's not the core of what's what's at stake here what's at stake here is is Jesus the king of the Nations and if he is then his family is made up of people of all Nations and even though he's an Israelite Messiah non-israelite scan come to him as they are it's they trust in him and his death and resurrection and give their allegiance to him and for him that's it trust in the Saya that's the entry that's the entry card to this family and the any other added entry requirements in his mind is another good news
this debate there's a red thread a line right to one of the most famous paragraphs in the letter that comes in the next chapter in chapter 3 and it comes at the conclusion of him doing this long complicated argument to make this for a point that anyone of any subgroup of humanity can enter the family Abraham this long all it takes is giving your allegiance to Jesus as the Risen King of the world and so Galatians chapter 3 verses 26 through 29 is a culminating paragraph that you read it cuz in this context that has a punch to it for you are all children of God through faith in Messiah Jesus for all of you who were baptized into Messiah have been clothed yourself with the Messiah if an interesting metaphor from some of the Garden of Eden story your clothes your closing when naked low creatures and we can generate our own clothing or we
 baby clothes with a new Humanity with you think I can comes from the Messiah God giving the animal skin yeah there's about the clothing that starts with the the clothes there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither slave nor free man and there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Messiah Jesus and if you belong to Messiah than you are Abraham's descendants heirs according to promise you're part of the family of God and it doesn't matter if you're Jew or Greek slave or free male or female you're all on the same yeah I noticed how he brings it into them the debate in Glacier not only do you belong to the Messiah to part of Abraham's Abraham's faith
 do you want to be Abraham's family you get circumcised but then Bible in light of what happened with Jesus life death Resurrection in the gift of the spirit and then all these nausea is coming in and we talked about that previous episode yes and how Abraham was credited with faith before he was yeah circumcised yeah yeah that's right this is what Paul highlights here yeah that's three categories will we might call ethnic or national identity and ethnic whether you're Jew or Greek Greek Jew or not Jew to her basically Jew or not to which is everybody because because everyone's Greek the Greek world that's exactly right there is neither slave nor free I am in Roman society that those are the two basic categories in your whole life
 neither male nor female so it picks up like the big three in the 1st Century Roman culture yeah City slave or free gender this is really an issue about it in the city correct yes with the issue at stake here is only the first of those three or not Jew but then he adds slave and free what that show is is he's actually got some larger framework a way of thinking about the unity of the family of God and what's at stake and Glacier is just one way this could all go terribly terribly wrong but let's say that there was another church of Dalmatia if we had the letter to the Dalmatians then what
 if a dog the dalmatian and dalmatian and the moment you asked I was like think of a hundred and one Dalmatians, Dalmatian of anime okay so if we have the letter to Dalmatians and it was a group of Christians who wouldn't let their slaves sit at the same table and they gathered on the Lord's day then we would have a similar letter from Paul the Dalmatians and same as there is a group of men who wouldn't allow women at the same table then we would have that letter to so that's why I think this paragraph is so significant he's only addressing one specific way the division can manifest itself in the body of the Messiah and there are many ways that we ought to have our I thought for even though Paul was addressing that specifically in this letter and many people have looked equations 328 these three categories as an important guideposts for later
 Generations in the history of the church to apply this principle of the unity of the family in ways that the apostles maybe didn't encounter the first century but we encounter them and we should have the same passion that Paul Ted so the point here is that the can't be a category that defines whether or not you're in the family of God other than allegiance to Jesus any other category whether it's gender whether its socio-economic category or an ethnic category and then we can add from there I suppose what other categories people might create that tell you whether or not you're in the family and this all goes back to the opening paragraph actually the opening line of Galatians recess Grace and peace to you from God our father in the Lord Jesus Messiah who gave himself for our sins so that he could rescue us from this present evil age
 in in the story that he's painting Jesus is in the midst of a rescue effort creating a new family of God right here in the middle of an era that's characterized by certain patterns of organizing groups of people see your important you're not important like you belong you don't belong you're in you're out that's the evil age the evil has this whole idea of we don't trust in each other anymore we stand up for the people we think we're like and we had violent opposition against the other slaves in Paul's mind if you're human your candidate to be in the family of God. And then the the entry card is simply Allegiant towards the truly human 1in is how do you define Allegiance right cuz then you would say what but you got to be circumcised to have allegiance to Jesus
 because now you're making a snake divided or someone can say well you need to eat a clothe yourself with the Messiah to have allegiance to that one yeah that's right and then he gives a long exposition of what that looks like it's the nine-fold fruit of the spirit love love is the same chapter 5 and 6 loves to Phil's the Torah so if you're not an honest but I can live by the Torah when they love than their Neighbours themselves and love God with all thy heart soul mind strength and I Think Jesus said something was the main issue in the first century but the fact that sings and try to maybe like there's some you can really sympathize with a Christian subculture I understand what it means have Legions with Jesus and it's these things are those things aren't the real things
 oh you're in trouble but when those things are the real things yet it's protect this so then what how do you know what the thing is so the trick is in any cultural setting where Jesus movement takes root constantly evaluating are the the practices that we invite people to do to Mark themselves as a follower of Jesus did we make these up do we know for a fact that these are the core or maybe these are just the way our pictures of tradition has developed how you live and how you mark yourself as a follower of Jesus so that's what they're negotiating right here and I think every generation of the church that had to do that and so much will depend on the social location of the group that we have so much I really everything I mean it's pretty pretty short list regarding to like love I'm in the Fruit of the Spirit
 play the scotus faithfulness something and self-control goes all the way back to our first conversation baked into the DNA of this movement at least the way that the apostles and tickly hear Paul saw it it's a movement that is both has a core to it it's very clear but then also is it's a very flexible tradition it's a universal story that can be the Jesus Jesus story can be adapted into so many cultural forms which brings us all the way back to you know the Lord's Prayer being inscribed in 100 languages in that church or the Church of the Annunciation of cultural representations of Jesus and his mother yeah you can't you can't contain the thing it was never meant to be so we got to get to infusions.
let's just take some soundings probe little into one of Paul's other shorter letters letter to the Ephesians where he's got the same core conviction driving his mind and his heart as he writes but he's not addressing a crisis and so instead of really specifically getting into the Weeds on about a crisis Paul's Just Waxing eloquent about the beauty of the purpose in mystery of God coming among us to unify the Human family so it opens with the Jewish style him in in the opening sentences and it's kind of I don't know how well now this but I fell in love with Ephesians long time ago so that it's very familiar at this point it opens praise be to the God and father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah he has blessed us with every blessing of the spirit in the skies in the Messiah and what he goes on is to praise God for those blessings that he chose us
 but he's raised us with my science on but at the center is in the poem open cam has three movements in the center of the century movement is verse 9 and 10 where he's praising God because he made known the mystery of his will which if you've make known a mystery is not a mystery anymore demystified a mystery yet it's the Strategic plan about bringing the times to their fulfillment that all things would be on a Cafe Rio in the Messiah the things up in the skies and the things down here on the land everything would be on an FYI yes this is multiple translations here unified under one head brought together summarized it's a difficult word to translate in English compound words which means use it to mean repeat or do again or are you coming to bring back around and then
 actually cares there's another example is one other time Paul uses this verb that really eliminates it's in Romans chapter 13 I have it down here I'll let you read it you shall not commit adultery you shall not murder you shall not steal this is a good advice we should not cut it
 if there is any other commandment is summed up brought to get on a Cafe Rio in this saying love your neighbor as yourself were there for love it's so the point is this Romans 13 verse 9 he uses the same verb there's all these commands different commands you don't steal but you know really they are on a careful eye on their Essence is all connected build distilled there's an inner Unity there different commands but there's a Unity that they all have not unifying factor is they all are stuck in orbit around some other object yourself do that everything else will follow so when you unify something to display its Essence and inner Unity
 that's on a careful eye all so what he just said was in the Israel's Messiah who was crucified and raised everything in the skies and on the land has been on a couple of the universe and all of the different things in it so everything gravity for everything is Jesus is the Messiah is something he doesn't he doesn't Colossians it with a bomb with poetry it's because he believes Messiah was the one through whom God generated the entire Cosmos he is its creator so of course the creation would be unified in the mind and heart and will and purpose of its creator and if the Messiah is raining is the king of this unified Cosmos
 then things like that which would shape my behavior and some pretty specific ways it seems like that would shape it communities behavior and how they behave as a community in some pretty specific ways
 I wonder what that would involve lucky for us it's called Ephesians chapter 2 3 4 5 and 6
 so what happens is in every single section of the letter that follows he's essentially unpacking either another aspect or will highlight some specific things that are different but yet are made one in the Messiah apply it in terms of conceptually or once he turns the page to chapter 4 he's going to call people to specific practices that will demonstrate that Unity among the community is the letter about the unity of the unifying factor to all of the cosmos then by implication the way we should live as humans Jesus should unify us is that we as humans is realistic enough to know that what he has to work within the moment is a network of house churches so as he says in Corinthians the people outside the community God will deal with them let's
 focus on the coherence of our communities right here so he's concerned about the unity of these Jesus communities in his mind their the Vanguard of the new Humanity the model for the rest of the Human family what it means to live as immature got so low and behold in Chapter 2 he moves right towards what history is the most important Horizon for the unifying of the family of the Messiah which is he's addressing a mostly none to wish audience and so that's the thing we've been talking I think we've been talking about you so how do you in the family of God if family of God came through the Jewish man that came out of a covenant with a specific family just people who have practices that made it so that they could be faithful to his Covenant that were juice boxes how do other people compare this
 apply this unifying Messianic theology 2:14 Paul says the Messiah is our peace and buy our he means Jew and Gentile which means he is the one who created peace between these two ethnic groups so this is idea that there wasn't peace but yes right yeah three the Hebrew Bible or look at it from their point of view there is yeah the maccabean Revolt where there's juice right now I'm supposed I'm yeah so the Messiah is the one who made the two into one the two ethnic groups yes yes but also that the two maybe one where is he getting that phrase from getting that from the Garden of Eden story where God took one human but one human is made them into two so that they could become one again to Covenant and number in that story I was trying to ever worries about gender that stories about marriage and gender
 but in the image of god poem in Genesis one gender is just one example of the larger does many other ways that you have and you know what's interesting is when you were doing that maneuver I was like that interesting maneuver yeah he's taking the language that spells up myself from Genesis 2 verses 23 and 24 for this reason a man leave his father and mother were joined to his wife and the two will become one flesh he's taking that phrase but now using it as a paradigm for another division in the Human family and he uses the same phrase to talk about the ideal image of God is two becoming one great example thank you for drying attention that I was good and then you made me be more clear picture of the dividing wall and that's again just talking about
 did not pay stubs yeah there's been this wall dividing Jews and non-jews that generated hostility and Jesus absorbed that in his own flesh and he's an Israelite Messiah getting executed by the Romans like he took in his own Flash the hostility between Israel and the nation's he did something to the Torah that has commands and decrees there's a translation actually challenged here that we're going to work work on a couple episodes in our interview with Andrew Rivera who's done important academic article on this paragraph than June dentist efficiency something to the Torah is something in relation to the Torah so that you could create in himself for the phrase again the two into one new Humanity Making Peace so that he could reconcile the two through one body to God she's got this two and one thing going on and it's all comes out
 yeah Genesis 2:24 yeah which is this which is contemplation and was it mean to be damaged of God it's to be unified in our diversity so Jesus was the one human who now is welcoming two different kinds of human do a non-jew into his body and family and so if Jesus is saying listen I took the hostility between you into my own flesh on your behalf you don't get to fight anymore I died because of your hostility and I declare peace he Jesus was The Peacemaker of the Beatitudes anyway let's keep going to watch this to one language fused sentence versus later he'll sun rise again and stay through the Messiah the two of us have access into God's Presence by the one Spirit the most the two in the one but now the one isn't just Jesus it's a spirit Spirit lets see the opening of chapter 3 he uses some
 language I'll let you read this one the Open Secret the mystery is Lots relation to the secret that's now revealed by the spirit to Ida's my translation which means it's for the mystery has mystery has now revealed by the spirit it's been revealed to his set apart Apostles and Prophets and if this the nations are Cody and KO body members and Co participants in the promise in the Messiah through the good news all the nations of the Nations yes we all get to participate together and inherit together be one body together because of Jesus on the important news for this theme
 call what's the inheritance of the Messiah what does the Messiah inherit the land in the Messiah speak up and say hey guess what God Said the world is your inheritance the promised land of Canaan for a nation's I will give the nations of your inheritance and not only are the nation's The messiah's Inheritance but now the nation's actually if you were one with Messiah the nations are your inheritance you're a part of the all these metaphors coaers ghobadi members participants okay here's a good one this is later on chapter 3 pulse ox about how he's in prison and some people might think it's a bummer to imprison he considers that if people in honor because he's in prison for this job and the job is right he says here's my job verse 9 chapter 3 to bring to light
 strategic plan of this open secret mystery in the past so it was quite see it as clearly in the past but now through the eye which is the Greek word for the Assembly of Jesus followers so through the Assembly of Jesus followers here's what God's doing God is making known the multi diverse wisdom of God Multiverse Multiverse wisdom so diverse it's a Multiverse who is god making known through the assembly the Multiverse Divine wisdom tooth to the rulers and authorities in in disguise
 I want separate I'm somehow through this assembly of Greeks and macedonians and Romans and Jews of men and women orphans Merchants slave Freeman the diversity of this assembly yes the fact that in the Messiah such different people are being treated each other as siblings and family that this diversity represents God's wisdom is a display that's the way God makes known his multi diverse with the Multiverse people makes clear the multi divers wisdom so does the word that he is not a compound word Poli many views that English words poly polygon polygon poly climatic my sister went to Polytechnic High School which was like you could learn metal work
 wear polyester polyester you and I met at a skatepark Ministry should we tell that yeah you did tell me that story I think I think we were on Mike when you come in the store yet I have been this episode but the law stuff version of it.
 at the money did record that we did the second time we've had this conversation I knew it I don't want any I said polyester it did this weird thing in the back of my head was like this has happened before I want to tell the story I'll try and tell it quickly skatepark Ministry and the one of the Outreach Outreach wings of the ministry was a bunch of us who were leaders who volunteers at skatepark on WE formed a demo team we're getting busy we get in the van and put on trailer a bunch of ramps and just go set up shop in the parking lot like near the mall I'd rather crowd near us somewhere and gather a crowd and do a skateboard circus at the skating the ramps and dude cool looking stuff and then one of us will get up with microphone and tell the story of Jesus the grand finale of the circus was
 big metal rebar ring that paw started the ministry welded into a huge ring and would put it in between two ramps or wrap it and burlap and set it on fire and then we would jump through the ring of fire through what is Johnny Cash's song Ring of Fire or Eye of the Tiger demo you forgot to bring the burlap I don't know how this happened but there was like a polyester blanket somebody had the back of somebody's car and he ripped it up and wrapped it and polyester and then let it on that are fire and that's like basically like it yes it became immediately clear that he just wrapped it in plastic because it was Dripping fiery drips a bunch of us went through somewhere unscathed and then other people like that drips of molten plastic on there
 yep I'm so sorry I was such an unnecessary Polly Polly Holly Esther and skateboards through it I guess so album and imagine being in a burning building wearing a polyester shirt is coming back Paul's got this idea that a Polly what's the second Community through a polyester at Community the polypoid Silas is the second part of the Sao Paulo means multiple but poor Gilles means diverse Silas is the word used to describe Joseph coat that Jacob gave him the the coat of many colors in the Greek the Greek Septuagint translated the coat of of diversity
 normal word but it makes it gets the point across what does that mean to have Multi-Device wisdom wisdom is demonstrated through a multi a diverse community of people to whom to whom is that wisdom made known through the Multiverse Community people to the principalities and Powers which is weird that's weird but first of all I can't like what's that mean for your wisdom to be displayed verse okay in the skies you have Angels the Divine beings the sons of Sons of Elohim of Genesis 11 scuse me of Genesis 6 that Moses refers to in Deuteronomy 32 this whole biblical theme of that like God chose Humanity or lower than the Angels there's his creatures that like we're Earthbound and we like made of carbon atoms but there's his other creatures that before we try and
 translate it into our cosmology let's think in terms of biblical cosmology there's the skies in the land yes there was rulers Below on the land we have to call the image of God the humans there's the rulers above the other called the host and co-host of evidence otherwise known as the sons of Elohim in Babylon and story of The Exodus in Deuteronomy 32 there's this developing theme that the many nations that have don't want to live under the allegiance of the Creator God I think there's they're giving their allegiance to the ultimate Divine being but in reality they're giving their allegiance to Idols which are Woodstone and nothing or even worse they are actually being deceived by dark spiritual Powers the Manifest themselves through social structures so Paul's got one for sure on the brain that's front-and-center it's a goddess named Roma well Roma
 impulse day is the Roman Empire the Roman Empire is a deity the power and might of Rome was considered to be not to personified in the metaphorical way but in their cosmology embodied not invited the Roman Empire is the embodiment of the power of a goddess and that's their wisdom pranks is Manifest in Roman Legions going stacking other cities in annexing them into the Empire and Paul says you know how we got to this real cool came Among Us in the person of Jesus reveals his wisdom is by creating communities of people that just thumb their nose thing you say they laugh at and gather over against the dividing lines that run my wants to put in place Roma says that your identity is
 find by whether your slave or whether you're free okay that's the wisdom and that will lead to that's the right way to do things cuz if you're a slave you deserve it and that's probably in your nature to be a slave and to be inferior and impossible and the wisdom of God that's multi diverse made known through the enthroned Messiah is that every human is an image of God and to be a part of this family you just need to be human and man give your allegiance to the right key will unlock your humanity and allow you to be fully human and a community of the Beloved that's the assembly but he's talking about here I see this diverse assembly who's living as one is actually showing to the cosmic powers
 which is manifesting just culture culture what we would call class things like class or things like just biases yeah that's right you're prejudiced by the systems of inequity yes stomach things all of this stuff in the biblical worldview is not just some institutions or has a larger spiritual climate that's that's making that a reality is forcing us into tribalism and it's forcing us into being separate but the wisdom of God is displayed through Unity amongst the church Community consists of people who outside of this church would hate each other would never be seen together never eat together never be civil talking to each other but when they gather here and call each other brother and sister
 give their allegiance to the one true God and love and serve each other help each other that is a incarnate display of the wisdom of God their nose to the powers-that-be tattoos father that's exactly right now that's a good that's a great observation the same Core theme coming out in two very different books of the Bible Ephesians and John but it's the same core idea the unity of the Human family this is powerful stuff man this bridge is very quickly from the 1st to the 21st century
here's a little excitement for listeners of the podcast we've only made our way through the first half of Paul's letter to the Ephesians you all just take literally 20 minutes to listen to or read through the second half and count or get a yellow marker for every time the words one Unity body members one another, and you're going to have hits in multiple paragraphs about the rest of the book and his burden there is to explore the actual lived practices the kinds of behaviors that it will require us to realize and invited the Multiverse wisdom of God how do you actually treat other people to create a community that makes known such a way that you can be in unity with others correct so some people call it the ethics part of the letter of the first half of the patients about theology second half is about ethics but that doesn't quite what you doing it's about what kinds of communal
 Behavior will create communities that send a signal to the powers-that-be that their time is up and that they don't get to divide up Humanity anymore by their own fabricated schemes and then to close this we talked about just looking at this passage in Revelation one last time. Maybe just read it and we can just do slam and he says you know this is a city that doesn't need the sun or moon anymore because the brilliant glory of God lights it up and the lamp is the Lamb what's the source of life God or the lamb zactly exactly will walk by its light through a daughter the lamp that we had this conversation in the first episode and the kings of the earth will bring their manifestations of their honor and
 into it so it's a full-scale multinational multi-ethnic polypoid class celebration and they bring the redeemed Humanity has still has their unique identities and Splendor of God is Not colorblind ordination blind if it doesn't cause you to abandon the unique aspects of your identity of your human Community but what it does is provide a story in which they can be recreated and brought into Unity with all the other families of the land and then imagine what would have been redeemed Portland have to offer the world or redeem Kenya we're redeemed for Brazil or what-have-you in the daytime because there's no night there the gates of the city will never be closed everybody will bring the glory and honor of the Nations
 yeah yeah man that's the vision at the end of the Bible any retelling of the biblical story that doesn't highlight the Steam and lead us to be unsatisfied with a Church community that isn't in some way striving to embody these ideals in every Church look different in context and culture but the longer I sit with this theme the more
 compelled I am that it's an assembly of Jesus isn't going after this in a really practical way and pulse conviction we are not keeping in step with the good news is supposed to calling and the really exciting prospect thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast and that's it that's a wrap on the family of God series although we're going to do one more episode of a question and response we've got a number of questions from you that we can't wait to dig in too and that's next week after that we're going to release a couple interviews of some Scholars that we recently got to talk with both of those interviews tie and well to the theme of the family of God and I look forward to putting those on the show we like this podcast we would really appreciate a review reviews really help get the word out or you can also just share this with a friend and you might also be interested in a brand new podcast that Bible project launched
