in the first movement of Deuteronomy two words appear more frequently than any others the word listen in Hebrew Shema and the world will listen and love over and over Moses tells Israel the love you alway in to listen to him because these are the ways that they'll preserve their Covenant with him in every close relationship I can think of one of the most simple but also difficult ways to show love his attentiveness thing and responding and doing something because of what you hear and this isn't just a one-sided listening Endeavor Moses assures is real that Yahweh is listening to them far more than they will ever listen to Heaven Moses Warren's that they shouldn't give their allegiance to other gods because they are gods that do not show Mama so you were too small and the few Shema you enter this relationship where y'all way will listen to you and if this whole concept of
 loving I thinking about your close friendships or your marriage that's because it's supposed to so Israel's Covenant loyalty and love to be Ava is also described with this word to describe the marriage Union of husband and wife in the Eden store I think with the analogy of thing essentially is that just as God provided a covenant partner for man and woman that needn't be so that they can be fruitful and multiply and have long life in the land and then together they are to become God's Partners here Israel is depicted as having a partner of Yahweh and that is to love and cling to. I made a synonym for Covenant loyalty and love in the first movement of the Deuteronomy scroll and you're listening I will probably podcast thanks for joining us.
hi there we are in Deuteronomy assassinating the Torah or Journey our year-long journey through the Torah yeah and we are in the fifth and final score Fifth and final scroll called Deuteronomy in English from the Greek meaning the second law second law of the second giving of the Torah and so we set this up last session about how Moses is introduced by the narrator as preparing to give a speech and in the speech he is talking to the next generation of Israelites the kiddos of those who left Egypt and said your parents got and I'm going to explain it to you I'm going to do with it but are there yes make it legible to you if you eat it
 in the English it's b e apostrophe ER okay so it looks like the word beer with a little a little apostrophe in the middle are looking to burrow in the world is going to roll the dice. Roll down the air never do the full like what he called I don't know I can't do it it's like I would make the sound but Luke full rolling of RS you know that that's it strong think about but if you did a real soft next soft me up if it can sound like the letter L in the mouth of English speakers right but anyway that's just language difference so that means you have to explain this is near and dear to Your Heart John I love the metaphor of making something legible which is what that means that's exactly right
 we talked about how Moses is doing that to the Next Generation but that the way that it is worded throughout Deuteronomy and presented is there just a guilty as to who the audience really yes yeah but then I talkin to that generation going to the promised land or is he actually also talking to Future Generations will be in a similar situation where they need to come back to the land and they need to follow the law that's what I need to explain to them so that was a previous conversation was there was an intentional blurring of the audience of Moses's Speech cuz he's constantly talking to the children of the Exodus generation but he's recounting of events that happened to their parents but saying you all experienced that yeah and then he is going to be talking about how you the second generation that they're standing for him in the narrative we're the ones who were at Mount Sinai or
 experience The Exodus and you all are going to go into the promised land and then he starts addressing to you as if they're in the land and giving them directions for many generations in the future being in the land and so there's a blurring of past present and future and it's a narrative technique for the author who's the narrator who introduces the scroll and concludes the scroll chapter 34 and of the narrator is presenting Moses in the narrative as a dressing every generation of Israel past present and future which one the narrator's point of view the narrator's the same voice that narrates all the way through to the next cross Joshua Judges Samuel Kings which lands the people in Babylonian exile so all of Genesis the Torah and the prophets then come from the voice that is at least on the other side of Israel's Exile and presenting Moses as a dressing
 every generation putting Max Isles what about us because we are also X-Files the point is that every generation that reads the scroll is waiting to go in and experience the promise of the Eden land does the promises have not yet come. Tell the tour ends a prophet like Moses who's going to restore the people and bring us into the promised land that profit hasn't come yet so we have Deuteronomy is actually for every generation of God's people and in that way where we see ourselves like that second generation after The Exodus there's a phrase in the mishnah which is early collection of Jewish Scholars meditating on the Torah from 2nd to 5th centuries after Jesus and his repeated multiple times that every generation of Israel should see itself as the generation of the Exodus
 that's the function of the book of Deuteronomy you were there at the mountain yeah that's right and for us we really experience the journey by reading it and experiencing it through the door itself that's how we go on the journey ourselves yeah yeah yeah that's how the book of Deuteronomy presents itself so what we want to do in this conversation in the next one is focused on some key themes in Moses his opening speech which is what we call Deuteronomy chapters 13 11 maybe real quick let's catch a picture of the macro design Thursday remind me real quick it's fairly simple I guess it depends on your definition of simple
 but Moses has speech is broken up into three big chunks which were calling the movements which were calling the three movements so essentially what we call chapters 1 through 11 are the opening speech at Moses and they read like sermons condensed persuasive rhetorical masterpieces meant persuade God's people to listen and love chapters 12 through 26 verse 15 are Moses expounding explaining individual laws of the Torah so it's a collection of loss we're getting used to that this will be the last collection of laws in the Torah and goodbye to the collections
 and then the third movement moves from 26 verse 16 through the end of the scroll and Moses begins his sermon mowed again but specifically invited this generation into the Covenant and he lays out the blessings or the curses of the Covenant which was classic ancient near East Continental kind of form is here's what I'll do for you here's what you'll do for me if you do it there's a good stuff blessing if you don't do it that's in the struction the curse and then Moses will sing some songs about why he's pretty sure they're not going to be faithful to the Covenant and it's all going to go terrible and they're going to end up in Exile but one day God will restore his people that's what the final offensive oh okay so we are going to spend this in the next conversation exploring key themes in the opening speeches in chapters 1 to 11 so the first movement are three sermons I suppose you could call them
 is the first sermons in the Bible they are there long speeches that are just rhetorically crafted to persuade and move your heart and mind towards a certain goal do you think this set in motion what has become the Protestant had an obsession with preaching totally yeah Moses is the first picture in that sense yeah in the Jewish Christian tradition and we want to look at those two sermons but you're going to say there's some themes for us to pay attention to and all three exactly yep and for those of you going through the reading Journey on the app we've highlighted to key in a related words connected to the video we made about food around me but they are the some of the most repeated words in this first collection of sermons chapters 1 to 11 and they are the words listen
 and the words love ya listenin love know this was not a thing video this was our first video ever made on Deuteronomy we made to yeah we made a video series on the Torah and in the one on Deuteronomy there's a whole lot of side about this idea of listen in love with me and how cute it is another concept to understand Deuteronomy yeah that's right so that's why we're going to focus on right now
so just a quick note listen that's always interesting part of how you know you're in the presence of an important pattern or repeated theme is that a certain word idealimage gets all of a sudden starts getting repeated a lot in a certain section so in the book of Deuteronomy as a whole the Hebrew word listen or here is the word Shema Shema Israel that's right and we also made a whole video and a video series about this word in the world video on Shema that's right connected to the prayer called the Shema that is from Deuteronomy chapter 62 so the word Shema appears 91 times in the Deuteronomy scroll and you know just a quick call them up here one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 96 right now
 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 35
 35 * in chapters 1 to 11 so 1/3 of them in the first third of the distributed and the vast majority and like all of them are going to be either accounting narratives of where is real did or did not listen or Moses calling this generation to listen so let's listen up the next one is the word love which is the word I have in Hebrew of and then I'll have all that's how I remember if that's the new yeah the verb is a half of a half and then I have a and then this word appears 12 not 10 11 12 times in Deuteronomy 1 through 11 things that you're saying that listen is a multiple of seven and love is 12 * 80
 listen 35 relationship with each other so another feature isn't that the speech in chapter 4 the speeches in chapter 5 and 6 and 9 all begin with the words Shema Israel listen of this round here and that the key structuring pattern here to listen and love are with key so let's go to the first passage where these words occur together and I'll come see them how they work so Moses speech in chapter 4 which is at the center of the center of the first collection Central speech in chapters 1 to 11 and it begins with Moses saying now she is real listen to the statutes and the judgments which I
 I am teaching you to do so that you may have life and go and possess the land that you always giving you got you this is another word for the Los yes yes see you at Moses develops the vocabulary for how to refer to the laws you can call them laws statutes and judgments decisions ordinances actually they overlap but each have a little distinct meaning of the word study in a future together so notice that the basic call is Yahweh has provided teaching and instruction for the loss for life so that you might live in God's instructions lead to life in the garden land that's the basic point of Deuteronomy the way to life could be listening live yeah that's the result of listening
 it turns out that listening love are two aspects of the same call to love this to listen and you listen you are loving and if you love you will listen cousin so the posture is to listen to yahweh's instruction and that will lead to life in the garden land sounds a lot like Genesis chapter 1 in to retell the story in chapter 4 about how Yahweh gave them his instructions and commands at Mount Sinai so he's going to retell the story in this right here about Mount Sinai in the word Shema is just off-the-charts he's going to retail at focusing on how the whole purpose was for Israel to hear Shema hear the words of the Lord so translated here instead of listen to the same words the same word and he put them up yeah yeah so in verse 10 Moses says remember the day where God said assemble everybody
 so that they may hear Shema my words verse 12 the Lord spoke to you all from the fire and y'all heard the words down in verse Moses warrants that they shouldn't give their allegiance to other gods because they are gods that do not Shema so you were too small and if you Shema you enter this relationship where y'all way will listen to you and you will listen the office interesting because there is this sub theme in the Bible about how these other gods are kind of worthless but then there's other times where it's like no other gods like our Rivals they can show up and they can yes so what is it says they can't hear or ER smell like it's like their dad this goes all the way back 2 years ago are Elohim spiritual being conversations so when difficult
 it's want to critique and persuade Israelites not to follow the other gods they'll do it in multiple ways to say the thing that you actually see my idol statues like the golden calf like the golden calf and statues and marduke Bell their dog on and they'll critique by using satire they're just wood and they don't they don't smell like a god like all humans are there in an event images that have no power so sometimes they'll say the word idle sometimes they'll use the word Elohim to refer to the idle idle so they're saying like look this thing can't smell or see your listen they're talkin about the material correct that everyone's worshiping yeah but that material is connected to this power of another Elohim and there's some times were that power shows up and God has to deal with it actually in this very chapter
 this is going to talk about how we're backing up to verse 15 this is rabbit-hole missed a good one and Bristol Tini Stoessel W carefully because you all you didn't see any physical form up on top of Mount Sinai when you always spoke to you from the fire you didn't see like a an image image so don't act correctly and make an image in the form of any figure a human likeness male or female the likeness of any creature on the land the likeness of any bird or land creeper or fish you just work through the cosmos to Cosmos according to this happen exactly in Exodus in the tech management essentially the same this is a great example of Moses explaining and unpacking further the implication of the first two commands of the Ten Commandments but he's not giving little sermon on it so basically you didn't see an image on top of Mount Sinai and so don't make any
 image to represent the power that has no image also don't lift your eyes up to the skies and look at the sun the moon and the stars the host of Heaven and Earth host means Army the Heavenly Army so that you don't lift up your eyes and see them and be drawn away to worship them and serve them that is to give your allegiance to them
 they are the ones that Yahweh has allotted or assigned to all the peoples under the heaven but you always took you all and brought you out of the iron smelting furnace to be a people of his own possession he made you and Into His Image Through Fire he's young wow The Exodus was referred to as the iron smelting furnace where y'all way fashioned an image that is Israel well so don't make an image and you said this before. Don't make an image because you are gottiline damage that's exactly the point. Point Ohio Fair Lakes place that did you get the metaphor right so don't make an idol that you've fashioned in a furnace nor worship the images in the sky that's right which you didn't fashion Yahweh Fashions them and they're his house that serve his purposes
 so serve you their allotted to the p.m. yet he's assigned them over the people's so here this is a little connection just going to get further explored in Deuteronomy 32 about the spiritual powers that Yahweh has delegated to rule over the land or oversee the land in the way that corresponds to the human ruler Christmas is all about Genesis 1 in the way the rulers above have some kind of mirror relationship to the rulers below stars above and then human rulers below right so basically this point is that there's Spiritual Beings that have to pick it up the lights in the sky and they have a purpose they have a delegated authority and don't give your allegiance to them they themselves are just images of God's light in power and authority in another way you can say is don't give your allegiance to a statue because it's just
 metal or whatever that's how we got here so In This Very passage Moses says hey there's some things that you make an image of and it's just you're making an image of a creature and it doesn't like yeah it's like you're the image but then there are also other beings in God's world that are real and that you know they don't see taste or smell the way we do but they are they are real but they're not inanimate and I didn't anime and they also don't give your allegiance to them cuz once again you are the image of God is called to rule in the garden land there on before Power. Ok Google but the idols they don't, but you are that was we starting verse 28 so I'm going to scan down the first 30 when Moses says listen to say that you don't listen to Yahweh things are going to go really bad for you but when you're in distress just returned to Yahweh and Chaumont
 his voice and you always compassionate and he won't forget the Covenant we made with your forefathers in the past so any moment you can turn this game around is never a point of the end think of this larger frame of Moses speaking to his generation and then the narrator using Moses the speeches to speak to every generation in Hampshire a group of Babylonian exile reading this would also find Moses speaking right to them and so on so Shima the word shamaya is going to play a huge role that's going to a 36 he's going to go back to Mount Sinai and he'll stay out of the Skies y'all will let you show my his voice to give you instruction like formative parental instruction it's translated discipline in The New American Standard
 he let you see his fire and you should not his words from the midst of the fire why did you do that because he loved your ancestors and he chose their descendants after them that is you he brought you out of Egypt he is going to drive out Nations greater and mightier than you to give you the garden land so here there's this reciprocity here between listen to Yahweh why because he loved you and your ancestors
 the words love can refer to God loving his people or took out the people loving God and returned and then listening is mostly about Israel listening to our way because you left them and then there will be occasional references to Yahweh listening to his people that is responding to their cries for help when he cries out so listen and lover in this tight I think in the video we had the two words on top of each other with little arrows listen leading to love and love leading to listen cuz there's this reciprocity for listen to love as I'm reflecting on it this is fairly intuitive for Human Relationships we experienced someone who's a really attentive listener is the is the field 11 in every close relationship I can think of one of the most simple but also difficult
 ways to show love is attentive listening and responding and doing something right because of what you hear well yeah and so let's unpack that because what we haven't explicitly said yet which is in the video of listening love and inertia my video is that listen doesn't just mean hearing yes right right cuz it is very loving just to hear someone someone sitting with you and they're just hearing you and you can tell that they're hearing you yeah that is very loving but in Hebrew it means more than just hearing right yeah absolutely it's synonymous with hearing and the response to what you hear is all bound up which is why you're not English translations it depends on which one but the word Shema can also be translated obey
 so right when the Israelites arrive at Mount Sinai and Yahweh invites the people to enter into a covenant in Exodus 19 verse 5 he says now then if you will truly Shema my voice and keep my Covenant
 so The New American Standard translates it obey my voice Miss I'm just curious here the SV translates Exodus 19 verse 5 Obey my voice and Ivy obey me fully and RSV obey King James prostandard and I could have easily been listen to my voice there yeah what he says Nexus if you will Shema my voice and keep my Covenant and keep us to guard or care for so it's clear that you're not a passive just taking in yeah yeah that's right and so actually back to get my sexy lips step forward into another specie are in Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 6 cuz it's where the famous your mama is so this is how it begins Deuteronomy 6 verse 1 now this is the commandant these are the statue
 send the judgments that Yahweh or God commanded me to teach you so that you will do them in the land you're going with that sounds very similar to have chapter 4 if you can that's because it is and the repetition is it's a signal that we're being a newspaper starting again we're starting a new unit within the movement 3 Israel you should Shema and be careful to do so that there will be towed for you good for you and that you may x x in the land Yahweh your God promised you the land flowing with milk and honey go to Beast that is the stuff that you produce their Agriculture and then the stuff that God provides in a while and it's rain
 there's four Shema Israel Yahweh is our God Yahweh is one you shall love you alway your God with all of your live live your heart all of your all of your being and with all of your mail owed John I guess we have been talking about all this for like 80 I was recently just catalog
 leather dresser. Memories all of your muchness your muchness all of your potential to word so this is the classic passageware listen Shema is paired with love listening is love loving is listen listen Israel and so love speaks to both emotion but also to loyalty and Allegiance cuz love is connected her with Covenant loyalty so love is a verb as some what is it an American Artist hip hop artist once that these words listen and love just keep repeating like this Throughout the chapter so that's one whole thing is that these two words were threatened throughout loving is listening listening is loving and that's a cool point just to meditate on itself however thing that really stood out to me and my last passed through the Section to do drawings
 was something we've already seen is how this whole setup of Israel standing on the border about to go into the garden land where they will listen and love y'all all of it through hyperlinks and narrative patterning is set on clothes analogy to Adam and Eve's opportunity that they had in their Garden Land by the river and Float out from the Tree of Life as this generation sits By The River Jordan about to go into the Cardinal and and all of a sudden a whole bunch of teams about loving Yahweh and their Covenant with Yahweh who is one there to join Yahweh in Covenant now I have one but you get to join him and Covenant all the sudden like I realize we're working the themes of Adam and Eve's relationship in the garden their relationship to each other and they're
 relationship the outline for a minute super interesting
who's first begin with a little, big picture observation that Israel is outside the garden land is there in the desert at the gates at the entrance across the river across the river but here the images the river is this boundary and the river going through the waters becomes a symbol of going through death going through trial and having to trust and then coming out the other side that's right so to go into the garden land they are going to have to go through the waters and then it turns out pass by a cherubim holding a sword really yeah that happens in Joshua or well they go through the water and by the fiery sword but that Joshua you do in the early July 3rd as you don't get a sense of being passed the river as a boundary point it's more just kind of inferred that there's a river that went out from eating and then split into four yeah so to go
 back into Eden will involve you know going back to the headwaters of the rivers of the world outside the land I have to go through the waters by Heavenly bouncer the door of the Caribbean yes I have one more thing though cuz most iconic Lee is Israel going through the waters of the Reed sea out of slavery yes in Exodus is there earlier images of the flood going through the waters and they're running and then the beginning the first the second sentence of the Bible which God delivers the land to place seeing animals in the humans on it so creation is depicted in Genesis 1 and 2 in two narratives God brings dry land out of the chaos Waters to plant a garden and then viewed from another perspective Genesis 24 and onward the chaos state is a desolate Wilderness and God provides why
 in the wilderness to plant a garden that is sourced by a river and there he puts the humans in both of those stories Adam and Eve images of God and they are given an opportunity for long life in the land and not have any skin eternal life in the land but it's all contingent on whether or not they will listen to the voice of you always command and there's one coming up and there's only one command but it's the word command Genesis 2:15 what's the word Moses using constantly remind me of the garden land is the end there in it but they begin outside in humans created outside the garden but they're basically I picked up by God of the gardens planted and cultivated than Yahweh picks them up then rest them in the garden in the rest to 15 give them rest in the garden and it gives it a command says this whole place is for you just one thing to follow my commands
 so that whole setup right here is being replayed your explicitly through all the same word repetition Israel Is On The Border's about to go be invited through the waters pass by a cherubim to go into the garden land where there's Tove goodness the phrase in Deuteronomy 1 through 11 there's this phrase Moses says so that you may make your day is long in the land constant repetition when you go into the land if you obey the voice of the Lord you will make your day is long in the land is that long life in the Cardinal and so it's the same thing is that you always commands lead to life in the garden land you know a side sorry Genesis 2
 it's not about long life it's about you trying to let her know life yes I suppose why isn't Israel now interested in eternal life it's just now more about like we want a land where we can have long life and there isn't a sense of this desire anymore for life eternal it depends on Whose perspective you're thinking with them if you're thinking within the characters in the story yeah it's a narrative about a people group going into the land to live long there but I'm a reader of the truck and then begins with the Torah and the tour begins with Humanity given the offer of eternal life and then continues on they failed forfeit that and then Yahweh is on a mission to restore eternal life of Eden to his creation and that leads to this moment in the story so Israel being given long life. Eternal life but longer
 in the garden land is a part of a bigger instead of patterns in the Hebrew Bible and by the time you finish the whole to knock you are into the Psalms and you're into Daniel where it is all about returning to the ultimate eaten where there is eternal life. Kind of by the phrase eternal life appears only in Genesis Psalms Daniel for the author for the narrator this picture of Israel and during in the land for long days is an image for the reader of the Tanakh that ultimately is about the return to the ultimate eaten it is about eternal life that makes sense it does it could have been worse I could have said they were you going to land and you will find Eternal I'm sure that's not what happened and how it happened but that would be fusing the perspective of the final framers of the whole to knock with the perspective of the characters within this
 moment of the story and it makes sense totally do the characters in this story expect they could have eternal life doesn't seem that way I mean if they had read the story of Genesis 1 through 3 they might have that perspective I think when we are reading is that we limit what the text means to what the characters in the story might have thought right and we forget that the characters are being presented to us by an author and the narrator this connected to the perspective of the whole of the Hebrew Bible not just limited to the perspective of characters so this whole moment of the story is a part of a bigger set of patterns that also is connected to the ascent of the son of man to Heavenly Rule and eternal life in the Book of Daniel and these stories are designed with a knife
 that trajectory and Daniel is written as a summary of what these stories are all about terms of author's perspective so I can enter play maybe it's sort of like if you're sitting if you watching a movie and there's a really tense scene and the characters don't know what's going to happen and you don't know what's going to happen if that's what makes movies exciting to watch but it would be a mistake to say oh man I wonder if the director like knows where the store is going to go and it's like well at the movies finished like the director made the movie really distracted by trying to understand how God is working in human history in a way that is a logical and makes sense because of God's mission is to bring Humanity back into an internal relationship with him
 then why hide that from this generation and just have it be about long life in the land your step in the story is just to become the kind of people and which then the Messiah will come and you don't need to know about the author of eternal life and be distracted by that just just have a long life let me just get inside the Apostle Paul's way that's talking about this traffic which passage choose so interested in seeing 10 Paul's writing to I'm loving this Rabbit Trail this is a total fail by the way and I must attend for I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact brothers and sisters that our ancestors were all under the cloud pass through the sea baptized in the Moses in the cloud and in the sea this is God as of the cloud and fire but you're referring to the cloud
 leading them through the waters Into the Wilderness important bunch of non Israelites and Israelites that followed Jesus in the city of Corinth he tells the story of The Exodus and says our ancestors like 12 tribes of Israel that went through all that are our ancestors okay so this is somebody Paul gets how the audience of the book of Deuteronomy Works cuz he sees himself and the Messianic community that is right carrying forward the story of the Hebrew Bible as their story so now we are a part of Israel that went through Texas that came out of Egypt yeah so what are you going to say Siri tells the stories of the Wilderness and then number 6 what he says is now all of these things happened as
 to boy voice doesn't create new boy types types of needing the word to pass out here I'm just going to open it in the power aren't encouraged and Denker greek-english lexicon of the New Testament early Christian Literature Like The Standard so here's what the word to Pasta means it literally means a Mark or an impression made on something because you pressed on it so clear the glycomark and then secondly a model
 copy or an image because how would you make a type of something except for like have a stamp that's a great way to do it which is also related to a set of meetings which is pattern yeah and then it becomes metaphor so the story of The Exodus in the wilderness wandering and Israel going into the land is it too fast or two boys just the floral patterns of pattern do a thing happened but from the perspective way down the line where you see the many things that happened and Link them together within a series of patterns you start seeing a pattern cycling over and over and over again and Paul says all of those narratives are patterns for us and then he starts talking to the Corinthians about how to deal with meat sacrificed to Idols but he's using the narratives to give Torah guidance and that makes sense from the perspective of later
 narrators compiling the stories as Torah for future generations and then for me to know how does live in my city yeah that's right from the sense of this is also Israel's history and these were actual people then it stops making as much sense and it's like why why are they just used as pawns almost seems like their life this brutish ancient life was just so then I can have an example of how to live in Flagstaff well they're more than that the other way more important than that so fascinating yeah I might just invite a reframe on that so
 the biblical out there's no I'll just stick with the Hebrew Bible for the moment so in the final centuries BC second temple. Israel's rebuilding slice in the land and the Holy Spirit is part of this long process of guiding a minority group within Israel that believes the God is revealed to them the true meaning of Israel history that Israel's history reveals a pattern in a purpose of the will of the Creator God for all of creation and so the oil traditions in the written Traditions they received the constantly studying pouring over meditating on and crafting them into literary holes eventually take the form of the final shape of the Scrolls that we have
 and the production of the Scrolls as we have them is itself the product of generations of prayerful Spirit guided meditation on the meaning of Israel's history so those authors or editors are composers whatever inadequate terms we want to use they want us to see Israel's history in a certain way that's why the generation here and do Randy is being compared to the Adam and Eve here so that we sitting way down the line can see the meaning of it all and so I don't think they experienced it as well whatever the people who actually stood there on the by the Jordan River where they thought was happening we're just going to use whatever they thought was happening to them I think it's more of that each generation of Israel begin to see that it's the experience wasn't folded in a part of a larger plan and a picture I think then that's a problem getting it and I think that's what it means for us
 see our lives within the same set of patterns is like when Jessica and I got married and made a covenant I was invited through the Apostle Paul's teaching in his letters to see the Jessica and I were we were making Covenant the last for our lives to each other but that also this Covenant relationship can be a space where we can either experience the desolation of Exile cuz of broken Covenant or experienced little glimpses of Eden and of eternal life when we listen to love write each other and ultimately those longings the little taste of Eden will be fulfilled in the new creation but that doesn't mean my little experiences of that in the present are meaningless it's the bigger stories viewed from the end that is what gives the meaning now but when I like a man having a good day and I'm being loving and attentive family
 usually those are moments when I've got new creation on the brain and I really want to bring the whole story and where Creations going to bear in this present moment and what these Israelites whether they have that in their minds or not I don't know if you know what to ask him what that I think that's the dynamic and so
 am I scratching at the thing that was itching you yeah I really appreciate it I think the reframe is important in that these stories aren't to explain to me exactly what the relationship God had with these people inviting them into from their perspective from their perspective into relationship with him drink but we are being told narratives around what would seem like we would call got inviting them into a relationship with him but they're free and in a way to become a pattern for us that's right so they're composed and framed in a way to serve us as to pass to pass through them so I get distracted by like what did it mean to them and how does that serve them for got to love them and bring them into eternal life and that's not the question
 composers the narrator's the editors whatever you want to call them were thinking about they were thinking about how does this become tore up for us gym or how is the will and purpose of God revealed to us through the stories of our ancestors that they can see the pattern of God's purpose at work so these Israelites from their perspective it was about hey we are an immigrant nomadic Community through the desert or escaped slaves from Egypt here we've been told that they tell him name Yahweh the creator of land and sky made some promises way back to our ancestors that we're supposed to go live in this land and that if we trust
 see how he's going to Deliver Us from the Giants that live in that land and Rule it and he's going to give us this land and its abundance as a gift and we will live long and have many generations of fruitfulness and Security in this land from the character's perspective that's it long life in the land from the author's perspective this is a pattern a type and it's about long life eternal life and the ultimate Eden land which is how the story begin because Jen until the tortoise and we know that God is using this people to then make that possible for everyone yeah it's the promise to Abraham their ancestor I will bless you so you can blast the nation's so we know that I'm just thinking like if I was a missionary to ancient Israel I wouldn't be like I'd be excited you're going to live in the land and be like hey the land that's the temperature
 I think we should care about is eternal life right so whatever whatever reason that becomes a little hang up in my brain but I think the reframe is to allow those who have crafted these narrative to do their things to serve me and be okay with that
yep we could stash in that rat hole somewhere I just want to pick her head up cuz it's how we got here was I was showing how the narrator is using this as a tie pin is using the speech of Moses and all the language around it is language drawn from the first chapter of Genesis texting Adam and Eve in the garden land but their enjoyment of it is conditional on them a wedding with the white man threatened so that led me to just noticed one little thing that it's interesting so in the Eden Story begins with god making a singular Adam human outside the garden bringing them in and then we know that this is a creature that supposed to be fruitful and multiply but how can I do that alone so God says yeah it's not good that Adam is a loan so that's what's the Adam male and female
 and then that one human that has become two male and female is then to become one again and this is Genesis 2:24 get the narrator breaks into the Eden story and talks to you the reader who's sitting way in the future this is why a man leaves his father and mother and devoxx to his wife said the rock it's literally the word grab onto and not let hold of sometimes translated cling to cling to his wife and they say that is the Two Become One flesh in the word covenant is not used but the function of what a marriage covenant does is that the two become one and two boxes of the word that's used to
 very interesting to notice that the word divoc to cling on to cling onto is introduced right here in Genesis chapter 2 and often travel to the United and Ivy translate that unites right here ESV says hold fast when more literal New American Standard be joined that's not really what it means and the classic which one was that was that yet sweetie that's New American Standard right but the word means to use your hands grab something and not let go of it and then King James is Cleve Wichita cleave unto his wife that old English that means to hold on to that happened to grab onto and not like a
 so what's interesting is that words not used very often throughout the Torah it's introducing Genesis and then off the charts in Deuteronomy then these are from the opening speeches to mothers check this out so Deuteronomy 10:20 you shall fear Yahweh your God you shall serve him and David back to him you should cling to him please untie our way, hold on to remind me 11:22 if you are careful to keep all of this commandment which I am commanding you to do to love Yahweh or got to walk in all your ways and to cling to him
 so Israel's Covenant loyalty and love to Yahweh is also described with this word used to describe the marriage Union of husband and wife in the Eden store so I think with the analogy of saying essentially is that just as God provided a covenant partner for man and woman that needn't so that they can be fruitful and multiply and have long life in the land and then together they are to become God's Partners which is implied in the Eden story here Israel is depicted as the Covenant partner of Yahweh that is to love and cling to their spouse was Yahweh in Israel and entering into a covenant here and it's precisely that word to hold on to that made a synonym for Covenant loyalty and love to the one God
 bring all the way back there on the 6 verse for listen to his real Yahweh is our God Yahweh is one and we've talked about this hallway is one yeah I think this is a part of again the rhetoric of Moses his speeches of is that there are many out of him right out there that you're going to meet in the world or in the Lander up in the sky and they are not you're a lame There Are Spiritual Beings out there that are not your Elohim Yahweh is our one Elohim he is our Ally y'all way is out of Yahweh Yahweh the one and it's hard for me not to see this as a part of the analogy being set with
 Adam and Eve picture saying the two become one atom of one atom Manatee one but as one wasn't able to multiply and fill the Earth Humanity needed to be splitting in two male and female two others that are separate and other from each other but then the narrative says those two others need to become 1 by Clinging On to each other and we know biologically that's how you multiply yeah and it's framed as a covenant of this uniting together and so you're saying that there's something here where God is depicted as one and other ya kholi and that humanity is depicted as another or Israel particular particular hair image of a DS created in the furnace
 melted in the fiery furnace to represent humanity and they are being invited to cling on to God it's the same word of a few humans coming together and cleaning on to each other and this is a family that all the way back and Abraham left the house the father and mother Abraham left the house if I need to become one with his new covenant partner and this generation of Israel is now invited to enter into a listening loving Covenant bond with one partner of the cowboy hats for sure what's going on here another words what I'm saying is that Deuteronomy through intentional hyperlinking to Adam and Eve notice where the book ends of the Torah here right yeah that when you get to the prophet Hosea for example later in the Tanakh and he's just going to assume
 this whole metaphor of this whole web talking about Israel's Covenant bond for the always between a man and a woman and is a broken relationship or the song of songs which is going to be all this poetry about a man and a woman trying to get to a garden together and then it ends by telling you that love is a gift from Yahweh stronger than death saying is that the imagery of Adam and Eve's human love for each other and you always love for his Covenant Partners there are actually two ways of exploring the same Ultimate Reality meditate on the meaning of Torah yeah because what does he say he says well for him it's about Messiah and his people write steba Lee in this is heading that's right in Ephesians 5
 is that he believes the Messiah is the Incarnate form of that way they'll Hema this realm but true image of God that's right and so for Yahweh in human form to become one with his people that is what a marriage between a man and a woman is an image of and so that's why he can go in between talking to husbands and wives and saying what I'm really talking about is Messiah and his Covenant Partners the church and then you can just write Flex in between those two as if there's one thing now if man and woman coming together and Union is about the multiplication I mean more than that but that seems kind of central to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs uniting with God are uniting with the Messiah what's the analog there the fruit of that I think it's Abundant Life Garden life and not an ending this unending days and unending Life by fruit of the Union of man and woman his children
 the union of God and man humans yeah is that we get to participate in the abundance and infinite multiplication of Life enjoy for Asbury and goodness and happiness and existence in a ideal uncorrupted form love is life and love is life is the weight of true life that's what this is about so once again the narrator of Deuteronomy presents Moses giving these speeches to his generation of Israel but will for the reader of the Tanakh this fits into the bigger story of yahweh's invitation to all of humanity to listen and love so that we can experience wife
 and it's a pattern it's a set of glasses as it were through which I enter my day-to-day life and relationships and see like my life today is another cycle of the pattern and I have choices today about whether or not I'm going to listen and love and experience contribute a little bit of Eden to the world or add 2 and prolong my own Exile in the worlds Exile from the presence of God and that's the choice that way before Moses in this generation and that's I think with choice that the reader wants us to see you before I do
 another major theme we're not going to have you traced through if you're doing the app reading Journey but then I want to talk about in our last conversation on these opening chapters is why there's so much mention of Giants running around in the land that Israel's going into what's up with the giant what's up what's up with the Giants and what's up with God's commands to go in and like kill the Giants and kick out the Canaanites and killing Giants and the speeches in Deuteronomy introduce these themes that are very disturbing for most modern readers now including myself which is about God's commands to attack destroy or dispossessed the Giants and Canaanites in the land so I just walk we've never talked about this before. And that's what I want to talk about in our next conversation thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to Grapple with a difficult topic Yahweh
 instruction to Israel to completely concur the people who already live in the land of Canaan a land where the Nephilim land the land that is marked out to be a hub in life for the rest of the nation's but it's inhabited by snakes and my nephew lien and give her a ring when a human culture gives itself over to death at practices that lead to death which they think are good that's Genesis 3 through 11 but the portrait there so he ran these people groups in the land are portrayed as a people group that are too far gone like the generation of his blood today's episode was produced by Cooper pelts the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder was edited by then double Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Mackenzie buxman provided the invitations for our annotated podcast in around Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to choose us everything that we make including the podcast all of our video
