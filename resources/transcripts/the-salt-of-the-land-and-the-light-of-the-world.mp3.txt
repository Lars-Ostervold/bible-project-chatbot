this is Bible project podcast and this year we're reading through The Sermon on the Mount of John Collins with me is co-host Michelle Jones hi Michelle need a well-known part of The Sermon on the Mount Jesus calls his followers the light of the world get this straight from the prophet Isaiah just him he pointed that God's light and God's instruction shine out to the world to show the way to True Life In Jesus is assuming and building Isaiah's wordplay and that's going to play a key role in understanding what he means well before Jesus says you are the light of the world he says something that's a little harder to understand he says you are the salt of the land that's less intuitive what does it mean to be salt is going to start today we're going to look at the many different ways that salt is used in the ancient world and will puzzle over why Jesus called assault that you're joining us here we go
hey John high they were in the introduction of The Sermon on the Mount the opening movement of Jesus's Sermon on the Mount and so we're talking here about how Jesus calls his followers are the salt of the land the light of the world and city set up on a mountain three images Witcher 3 metaphors will go through them will also think of them into buckets right yeah that's right the salt of the land names first and he tells a little Parable a little pumps riddle about the soft and then he bundles together that the metaphors of the light of the world in the city on the hill those are really tightly bound together and for important reasons cuz they're tightly bound together in the section of the Hebrew Bible that Jesus is hinting at it while we think of them as three separate metaphors because think of them as two
 images two images but they worked together in a really important why so that's why we're talking about how Jesus calls his followers the salt of the land light of the world in the city on the hill what does it mean Jesus what did you mean
 first but then I was going to read through these maybe John all that you perform a reading of Matthew chapter 5 verses 13 through 16 y'all are the salt of the land but the salt lose its flavor with what can it be made salty again what makes salt salty again it's useful for nothing except to be thrown out and stepped on by humans y'all are the light of the world a city that is set up on a mountain isn't able to be hidden and they don't light a candle and place it under a basket rather upon a candle stand and it will shine on everyone in the house in the same way let your light shine before humans so that they can see your good works and so they can give honor to your father who was in the skies so these images are about who Jesus imagines his followers are in the world like who they are two other people and he starts with salt
 light in the city of Sault star Sault since Jesus does and this is a bit of a puzzle is actually quite at the complex puzzle what is it mean yeah so salt is in the most universal a human foods or preservatives the word flavors flavor salt is actually a very Universal item used across cultures human cultures but it does lots of different things which means it has lots of different metaphorical Association it can mean a mini things totally yeah so I found very helpful the work of our to Scholars combined commentary on Matthew by WD Davis and Dale Allison it's an exhaustive, Terry I think I've courted it many times already and I will quote it many times again they have an amazing comprehensive
 discussion of all the possible meanings of salt that Scholars have suggested throughout the centuries as to what Jesus could mean they've come up with 11 different possibilities so just a quick quick sketch are in the Hebrew Bible salt is described as many times as a crucial element added to Israel sacrifices the animal sacrifice is offered. Oka there is an important phrase used multiple times in the Hebrew Bible called the salt of the Covenant Israel's Covenant with God that is somehow to be symbolized by a heap of salt meeting their relational agreement commitment to God that is often used to wash or purify things undrinkable water purified with salt interesting Lee a story about Elijah the prophet
 salts is a condiment for food there it is that's the one I know that's the one in many cultures around the world may be something that is less prominent for modern people who have refrigerators but in the pre Refrigeration age salt was a crucial preservative for both Foods in and meet Maci that food and spoil salted meat was the way to make me last more than a couple days until it goes bad the phrase is eating salt with someone or sharing salt with someone is afraid of being friends with them at the store Hanford sharing a meal but it's like I pass the Salt Palace salt means let's be friends I love that perhaps that's why salt in a couple things in the New Testament one of Jesus salt is linked with peace between people
 phrasing in Mark chapter 9 Richie says have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another. Trusting in Greek mythology salt is beloved by the gods is salt makes food enjoyable for humans and if sacrifices are like offering food to the gods than offer salt with the sacrifice so the fact that salt is out of the sacrifices is across cultural phenomenon in the internees but what does it mean how do we get leverage here this is a wonderful example of when you have a passage or an image in the Bible capable of many meetings how do you how do you know which is the more precisely intended new so what you're saying is all of these could have been on Jesus is mine is is what he saying that you all make the world taste a little bit better are you like the seasoning of the world
 for that make life a little spicy is it y'all are the way that the world will be preserved like everybody's going to destroy the world the world like a big hunk of meat and your butt is my followers live by my teaching the world will be preserved. What do you mean does he mean you were the way the world will be purified and salt. He doesn't mean you all are the way God's covenant with Israel is going to be embodied in New Generation kasol representing the one way to think about how to solve this riddle of the salt is to notice that Jesus has prepared the salt of the land very closely with the two other metaphors the light of the world in the city on the hill that shines it's white out to the nation
 add salt and salt let's look at the light of the world it's much clearer yes and if it's connected then we'll then do what Jesus get out and so actually a game this Insight from another scholar that I've been mentioning throughout the series new text message call Jonathan Pennington and he draws attention to the fact that salt is connected in terms a meaning with the images of the light in the city on the hill and that this light and City on the hill have a very clear reference to a specific set of passages in the Hebrew Bible and if we understand those it's kind of give us some like backwards insight into the meanings of salt that Jesus likely had in mind
 so what we're going to do first here is dive into what it means the Jesus calls his followers the light of the world in the city on the hill it shines at the light to the Nations that can't be hidden
 so before we take a dive into that first there's just a fundamental underlying kind of Hebrew upon the Jesus is working on here so in the Hebrew Bible specifically in the book of the prophet Isaiah Scroll of Isaiah there's a key word Play Between the word light which links all the way back to day 1 of Genesis R&B let there be light Hebrew word for life or you could maybe transliterated just do our interior or I love how soft your role as his word light the word underneath the noun Torah is Yara but you can hear the rhyming of light Torah instruction for La Tortura what was that other word you said well okay
 Laura is a noun that comes from Hebrew verb Yara but when you say it in the form of to give instruction or to teach somebody it's your schedule is like tore a means toward destruction and means to give instructions to give instruction to means destruction that you were given this actually exactly right that's right and they all have that or they all have as a key part or prophet Isaiah used that connection between light and God's Torah instructing people you put that word play to good use in the kisser poems that we're going to look at key points that God's light and God's instruction shine out to the world to show the way to True Life in Jesus
 is assuming and building on Isaiah's wordplay and that's going to play a key role in understanding what he means
you know it's Dawning on me that light as a metaphor for wisdom and understanding is also really common in English totally like if I were to draw a picture of having an idea I would draw a light bulb over my head when you see the light like you finally understand her or accept something or like a clever realization is a bright idea in like me asking somebody to explain something more clearly and lighten me yes
 thanks Michelle you really shed some light on this
 okay so next we're going to have Tim walk us through how the prophet Isaiah pushes this metaphor forward let's listen in
 all right so Jesus is peeling to The Scroll of Isaiah when he references the light of the world and the city on a hill this is a key chemo TC runs right through out the scroll of Isaiah from beginning to end and it begins most explicitly in what we call Isaiah chapter 2 which is kind of the second main literary unit that opens up the scroll Isaiah's building on the key metaphor of light as God's life goodness and Order bringing instruction and word all of that from day one Genesis that's like that idea is so buried and Isaiah's Consciousness that it just comes that leaks out in this poetry here he's thinking not about the past but about something God has in store for the future for his people Israel and the poem in Isaiah chapter 2
 it will come about in the last days that the mountain mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the head of the mountains it will be raised up above the hills and all the nations will River up to it
 and many people will say come let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh to the house of the god of Jacob that he may give us to reports that verb your that he may teach us concerning his ways that we may walk in his pants because the Torah will go forth out of Zion and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem cancel deposit at their so this scene is that Jerusalem and the temple was that the kind of the highest point of ancient Jerusalem that is itself on this Hillside with valleys all around it literally surrounded by valleys on three of four four sides. The tallest hill in even in that region it's a pretty tall hell but it's not the tallest hill and it's not what I would typically Call Nettleton know it looks like a hillside surrounded by many Hillside
 couple of what you're taller but these are mountains depends on where you live cuz if you live in a really flat region any any Hill Mountain. But the point is that this till it's Cosmic significance the role that God Destin's this hill and the temple on it to play will make it like the highest of all the mountains and who cares about tall mountains associated with places where Earth reaches up to touch heaven and we're having an earth overlap some epic Scenic places yeah the elevation now the elevation of Earth up into the sky mountains are viewed in the Hebrew Bible symbolically as places were having dinner there one
 to buy Eden is described as being a high and holy mountain Mount Sinai Mount Carmel in the story of Elijah and then Jerusalem the mountain of the Lord and actually there's an allusion to the Garden of Eden here with all the nations River in up to it because there's the river that goes out of Eden to all the nations yeah yeah the word Isaiah uses in the poem the Nations will River up to it is using a verb in the hot
 that corresponds to a noun in the Garden of Eden story which is on the Haw River flowed out of Eden and split into four heads that water the other nations of the land to but now the nations are the river and they're coming back out and does not flowing out they're coming back in when they go in there going to get God's God's instruction is teaching so God will teach them your and then God's instruction to Laura will go out or the nation's go in and they are taught and they are instructed and then the instruction also goes out to presumably instruct even more so what happens when God's instruction reshapes the minds and hearts of the nation's first form he will bring Justice between nations you will render decisions on behalf of many people's render decisions you'll Kia immediate settle disputes.
 so like this nation's like no those are my wealth and the other nations I know those are well and then God will be like now you guys get to get to that's how it's going to be now you reach out to us and they're not cool we won't kill each other now so that one of us can have for well yeah because we probably will you know so when you get the Divine judge mediating peace between the Nations what happens the Nations will Hammer their swords into plow blades we don't need to kill each other anymore when do the swords to grow some food Spears into pruning blades to like prune you know your victories imagine all of the budget that goes in my goodness to developing things that are designed to kill people it's horrendous and most you know Nations that can afford to do so this is he
 huge amount and so it's just to say like that it reflects something so I imagine a world where all of that budget is reallocated goes into farming hell yeah yeah metaphorically to making food and shelter yeah I guess not metaphorically here but in a way metaphorically set sustenance life that's a world where people's minds and hearts have been shaped by the life-giving generous instruction of God so this is what it means when instruction when Torah goes out to the nation's so the last line of this opening poem is the prophet now I'm talking to Israel saying come House of Jacob. Jacob is Israel's ancestor let us walk in the light of Yahweh the or so God is shining a light on his real whose capital city is the city on the hill
 and Jerusalem and that light is meant to saturate Israel and guide their path so that they walk in it and if Israel lives in the OR of Yahweh that is somehow linked to the Torah going out to the nation's yeah it's interesting so is it that the light being in the light of Yahweh as being on the holy Eden mountain and you're in the light or is it when you stream out you are also now the light so the idea is that you always shining his old on this mountain that is destined to become lift it up and a source of Torah to all the other nations set the light that comes from God's word and they want to Genesis is now connected to God's word that is his instruction he's chosen the people who is they live by his instruction
 they will embody a way of existing in the world yeah that's a whole new way of Being Human that results in peace and no more war you should walk in the light so right now we're not about the light shining so I get the picture of being on the holy deed Mountain being in God's presence with him in the cool of the day you're in you're walking in the plot line of Israel as a whole people has throughout its history failed to walk in the light of Yahweh and so instead of being a source of life and peace among the nation's they just get embroiled in the violence in the greed and the you know political battles and intrigues of their time
 and that Lance them in Exile in Babylon and so what Isaiah begins to anticipate is that is God's purpose for Israel is ever going to happen that calling to walk in the light of Yahweh to be a source of peace among the Nations is going to fall on the shoulders of one Israelite who is just called the servant in the latter part of Isaiah and so there's some coupons where the images from sa-2 are drawn upon so here's one of them and Isaiah 42 God says behold my servant the one whom I uphold My Chosen One in whom my soul Delights I have put my spirit on him he will bring forth Justice to the nation's Justice we talked about that to God it's going to bring justice but now that it's God speaking to the servant of the Lord
 I have called you the servant in righteousness I will hold you by the hand and watch over you I will make you a covenant of the people a light to the Nations to open blind eyes to bring out prisoners from the dungeon those who dwell in darkness from the prison so I get it I'm going to help you do justice. Justice is releasing prisoners healing people and then that's being a light to the nation's so we were walking in the light and now the servant like is black comes the light comes the lightning is going to live in a way that create restorative restoring people restoring relationships restoring communities to wholeness out of bondage
 that's called bringing Justice to the Nations and bringing or the or going out to the nation's CR2 or to the nation's you say you are a light that's right walking god's light to being be like in the light for the nation and that's the role of the servants the role of discernment when I was supposed to be the role of Israel all the way back to the Covenant God made with Israel at math I know I'll make do the kingdom of priests a holy nation of the people of Israel and now the servant is that Covenant the servant will embody in this in their individual life the Covenant partnership that God desired to have it all of Israel why so that they could become to how they live in treat each other a light that is an embodiment of God's instruction and there's the old
 play trap. The light to the Nations is his people live in by the Torah Heather brings Justice is Justice in the way to pain and Isaiah 49 we get a speech from the servant who says repeats all these images God has called me from the womb to be his servant he says later on God told me I will make you a light to the nation's so that my salvation and just it's too good man the word salvation is the word Yeshua is Jesus's name in Hebrew name jeshua can reach to the ends of the Earth and God says again I will make you a covenant of the people
 the all this comes together in a set of poems if at the end of the Isaiah scroll I'll just read that comes from chapter 16
 rise up shine because your light has come. The dressing the people who are inhabiting this new exalted true Slim
 the glory of Yahweh has risen upon you look Darkness covers the land is like the pre-creation state of Genesis chapter 1 deep Darkness covers the people's butt Yahweh will rise upon you his glory will appear over you and Nations will come to your light so now God is addressing people who have been restored by the servant. The light will shine on them so that the Nations will come to the light and then later and it is sixty the Nations will come around you bringing their grateful offerings to help rebuild and restore Israel that was destroyed by the Nations and has a 60% it says they will bow down and call you the city of the Lord Zion of the Holy One of Israel
 so this is all storyline Isaiah the light of the world the city on a hill by first start following Jesus you know when we share the same house or summer you spent that summer in the basement reading Isaiah in Hebrew that's true that's my memory of you I think I just finished second year Hebrew class I was really into Isaiah but I guess I could just begun to see that Isaiah was very meaningful Jesus and Jesus use the language of Isaiah to explain who he was and what he was doing and his followers this is a great example out so let's go back to Jesus's words hear the opening words you were the light of the world you are the city set up on a hill that's not able to be hidden and then it kind of gets into this little joke like listen if you got a really nice candle yeah
 don't put it under basket it's meant to shine yeah so everyone can see that he flips it he says let your light shine before humans so they can see and you think what he's going to say a see your light but then what he says is they can see your your good deeds or your good works your Justice in the pieces together of the city on the hill in the light to the nation's from Isaiah it what are good works except to well be peacemakers and be the ones that are helping arbitrate between disputes bring peace to show God's wisdom to live healthy lives and that's the good works so he's eluded to the good works in the nine saying so you could lie but also he's setting you up for his discussion about how his teachings for still what do you call the Torah and prophets were literally in the next paragraph is that I've come to fulfill the toy
 and then he's going to give 6 case studies on how to love God and love your neighbor so really is good works this last line about the light shining in the the good works it's kind of the pivot into the next part so he carry mentioned the or the light the next paragraph to follow in the seminar about the Torah the filling the Torah so the light and Torah what are linked together are so this is clearly Jesus is drawing on this bundle of ideas God called Israel to be a light to the nation's live by his instruction in the way the prince of peace and Justice is real has failed that that story The Revival but God promised through the prophet Isaiah that he'd raised up a servant who would fulfill that calling and invite A Renewed Israel into their Heritage and that's what Jesus is claiming right here with these very dense little parable of the light and the city on the hill
 all right this is the super helpful and what you promised is that this will help us understand the metaphor of salt pellets are talking about salt
a metaphor of light is so rich I think of First John got his late and in him there is no Darkness at all that's the walk in the lights exactly so then there's some 119 your word is a lamp for my feet a light to my path and the purpose of this light in this path is for justice and peace in the world and this all comes together beautifully and Isaiah 61 when he speaks the words of God to Israel by Yahweh have called you in righteousness I will take hold of your hand I will keep you and I will make you to be a covenant for the people and the light for the Nations this seems really Central to the idea of life in God's covenant as Tim promised understanding the use of light is going to give a Clarity on what Jesus means when he calls his followers salt
 okay so start with preservatives the most universal use of salt because it's connected to food but also connected to keeping you alive which is not an association must modern people have kept people alive okay cuz they preserve food for long periods of time so the idea of salt that maybe we don't have right at the Forefront of our minds is that salt is what makes things last a really long time so not just a preservative but like make things indoor that's a primary meaning salt the most people for most of History so salt is a symbol of God's long enduring Covenant with Israel and so every sacrifice gets assaulted The Scholar Jonathan Pennington really helped me here with some insights from his book on The Sermon on the Mount hey this is Jonathan Pennington and when we think about the metaphors of Salt and Light it can be confusing sometimes because
 salt as a lot of potential meanings in the ancient world salt was used as a metaphor for a lot of different things and sometimes light was as well but I think what's really crucial to understand is that Matthew has put these two metaphors in parallel with each other very clearly so to understand both salt and light is helpful to think are there places in the metaphorical meaning of salted light that overlap with each other and I think there is a very clear place the place where both salt and light can be used in the same sense is with the idea of a covenant you use salt to make a covenant to emphasize the permanence of a cabinet in the ancient world and light is maybe even more clearly something that's used all throughout the Old Testament especially in the book of Isaiah to refer to God's covenant the light in Revelation going forth in the world
 the Covenant is is a long-lasting covenant and so salt preserve things that they call it the salt of the Covenant is to emphasize its long-lasting Miss God says that all of his real gifts the numbers 18:19 are to be salted and God says it is an Everlasting Covenant of salt with you and your descendants so there that long lasting nature and of salt are bundled together in one and one phrase OK peated in the chronicle scroll were God's covenant promise to David's that he would have a descendent that ruled forever it's called a covenant of salt I'm just a couple biblical references that show that salt was connected with a long-lasting relationship okay so the Covenant is at the center of all of this
 and it seems like then that all these other meanings of salt still have a lot of meaning and implications but now they're meaning comes from the fact of the Covenant is at the center never salt was a means of washing things clean or purifying them yeah and work we haven't got into it but this idea purification in the Hebrew Bible was really important that's right idea that moral compromise of choosing selfishness greed that these are things that make us metaphorically in pure unclean dirty war as being clean washed pure these are states of being that are associated with life and healthy relationships and connection with God or is this connected to the doing good works is like being in the state of being where relay
 it's our whole where does Justice around you it's a state of sorts element of meals and meals are part of creating social bonds and relationships and staying alive and staying alive and then what is the coven accept a relationship between God and humans so you know you're passing salt with God that's right is actually really is the perfect metaphor all the dimensions actually really come together but at the center of it is in the Covenant and even saying coming it's essential like how are we to make our way through the world learn to rule the world with god without some sort of relational commitment yes so for Jesus to call his followers the salt of the land you all who are receiving the kingdom that I'm bringing from Heaven to Earth to Fuccillo
 having it promises to Israel you all are the salt y'all are the salt and then look this little riddle it's the salt becomes unsalty which is kind of impossible like well as salt is not salt it's not it's not
 so he can surely he had a twinkle in his eye here is salt loses the thing that it is it's almost like it's impossible is salt loses its saltiness it's not salt it's like dirt to get stepped on by humans it's like a light losing its light and I wondered for a long time if there isn't a little kind of symbolic retelling of is real story here that they lost their saltiness so to speak to Babylon stepped on them getting trampled on by the nation's is a metaphor in the profits for their defeat at the hands of Assyria and Babylon and then Exile this inside of salt become a nun salty it's kind of like an impossibility a contradiction this is another great inside I learned from Jonathan Pennington about the purpose of Jesus's kind of rhetoric
 salt can't stop being sold to eat or if it did somehow it'll be kind of useless if you built a town on a hill everybody's going to see it and if you lie to a lamp you don't put it under a basket so nobody can see it I think the point is he's using the sort of very a powerful all those comedic rhetoric and moments to say look these are clearly not what you can do and that adds the urgency in the sense that the disciples really need to listen to what used to saying and continue Faithfully to be his ambassador's his Heralds his Salt and Light in the world
 yeah I get the joke I get the truck now I'm trying to think of another like rough on the joke something really simple words like the thing as soon as the things not the thing it's not the thing that's the joke the joke yeah and he's at the End by thing you are the thing so to be the things be who you are you are this yeah stop being something that you're not okay so this kind of gets to it then what does it mean to be it right I get walking in the light of Yahweh I mean ice and maybe get it to me but like you know has an idea yeah yeah I get it but to them be the like these a lot I get like God made a covenant with me be the cabinets like what what am I helpful to remember that Matthew Chapter 5 the intro to The Sermon on the Mount comes after Matthew chapter 4
 so Jesus comes on the scene after John the Baptist both of their messages was God's going to do something now to bring his Heavenly rule here on Earth that will bring
 the story The Covenant partnership story of God and Israel and the nation's all to climax things are moving forward to your folks and so the time that it's happening and so the Jesus would call together a band of people that he's healed that he's restored that there are beginning to live by his teachings and that he says you all the good life this promised by the Proverbs in the Psalms it's happening OK Google I love the salt you were the Covenant through which gods long-lasting promises to his people are going to move forward you were the light of the world you are the city on the hill so in other words you are the Israelite crew that if you learn to live by my Torah my teachings that fulfill God's Torah revealed through Moses you will become this Beacon of light like a lighthouse you know
 the dark world out there but this shining a light through how you live together as a group of people and and think about what he's going to talk to him in the rest of the sermon is like how you relate to people when you're angry right reconciliation conflict resolution how men really two women ride with integrity and honor how you should relate to people you really don't like for people that have hurt you peacemaking non-retaliation release nonviolent resistance to evil I think this is the stuff of the good works of Jesus begins here with with this introduction to the sermon
 okay but just asking what time I get do good works I get walking the lights yet and the good works are the light that shines out of the like can I get that the kingdom of God is coming and I get to be part of it and when I say I get it I mean conceptually conceptually
 what does it mean to be the light what does it mean that you are the results of the Covenant like is there a and is this an actual distinction the Jesus is making am I getting hung up on something that's not important interesting well the salt of the Covenant the salt is an image of a long-lasting covenant Promises of God are the Covenant promises that I'm not the Covenant know but people embody the Covenant so you embody the cover to be a people who live by his life-giving wisdom and instruction that there's not people live in by the Covenant there's no company that's right that's right that's right it's the joke if you're not the Covenant there's no cabinet will be the Covenant to be the Covenant yes I meant there was this key passages about the servant in the Isaiah scroll where God says I will make you the servant a covenant of the people
 the servant becomes the Covenant and the servant is Jesus the know Jesus is sharing his Covenant being with his followers that you all are the Covenant how you live in treat people according to the word and wisdom and instruction of God will you will be the Covenant will become the Covenant of God's desire to be partners with all humans in being responsible for this world can exist regardless if I walk in it yeah yeah yeah yeah if you walk in it you live by it yeah I guess I'll come get you in some way yeah like Moses haha yeah yeah my Jesus are like stars which is surely an image about when you spend enough time and you always liked his instruction his life-giving wisdom and instruction
 Ken's to reflect off of you cuz other see how like an image like an image potent metaphors of overtime I've become really grateful that Jesus didn't just say exactly what he meant and reserve a distract language but that he used these rich metaphors that can keep a couple of guys talking for a long time pondering what they mean and yeah you are the salt of the land you are the light of the world you all are the city set up on the hill what happens when a hill was it a telling us it also gets trampled on by the Nations and at least I didn't miss Rose case it just stopped being what God made it to be which is too bad for the city you know good thing God is in the second chances which is what Jesus
 another chance to Israel for the Covenant to be fulfilled that's the key key part of what it means to be installed in the light in the city
that's it for today's episode next week we're starting a new section on The Sermon on the Mount where Jesus connects his vision for Humanity to his ancient scriptures that is the Torah Jesus will say some people might look at what I'm teaching and say I'm dismantling the Torah no I'm saying that what I'm here to do is fullfill the Torah and Prophets Jesus views the scriptures as something that points forward has set of text that create momentum at expectation that needs to be resolved in some way Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you thanks for being a part of this with us hi this is will and I'm from San Jose California
 understanding court and many more about the scripture first heard about the Bible project from church I use the Bible project from my own deeper Bible study to transform my mind and to teach my children Bible John seems to have a lot of the same questions that I have and I really love the introduction of scholarly works that I can study on my own we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus by people like me project.
