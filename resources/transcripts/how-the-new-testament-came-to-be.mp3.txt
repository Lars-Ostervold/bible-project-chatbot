hey this is John from Bible project and we are continuing a series on what type of book review the Bible we're calling it The Paradise Series in the last episode we began talking about how the old testament's also known as the Hebrew Bible or not is not one single book but a collection of Scrolls all written in different literary genres over the course of a Thousand Years by contrast the New Testament collection were written and a half in they're finished written form within half a century about five decades the Hebrew Bible was masterfully assembled into a literary hole to tell one unified story the story of God and Humanity how humans are meant to be God's image his Partners in ruling the world how we rebelled from this calling and how God is using the nation of Israel to Bri
 sing us back to that calling that through Israel will come a true image of God the true human explicitly says I multiple occasions that who he is and what he's doing is announcing the arrival of God's Reign and rule over Israel and over the nation and the all of this is bringing to a climax in fulfillment a long story that was pre-existing what Christians call the Old Testament the New Testament begins with four biographies of the life of Jesus all showing that Jesus was God himself become human to rescue us after that we get a biography of the early church and then a large collection of first-century letters written by the leaders of the Jesus movement for the early church has spread out throughout the Roman world
 it's so today on this episode we talk about the formation of the New Testament why are there four separate accounts of the life of Jesus and did the authors of the first-century letters think they were adding to the Hebrew Bible and why did Jesus see himself as fulfilling the story of the Hebrew Bible that's today on the show thanks for joining us together
we are going to continue this conversation on the Paradigm by which we read the Bible that a good sentence and also the Paradigm we think the Bible is putting forward the Bible presents itself to be read this kind of what is the Bible series anyway yeah that's right what is the Bible and what is it for and how do you what do you supposed to do with it and how are you supposed to read it this is the fourth episode of this series and we're jumping into an attribute of biblical literature which is that it's a unified collection of literature and so in last episode we talked about how open the Bible next to me to find two big collections the Hebrew Bible how to refer to the Old Testament and then the writings of the Apostles often referred to as the New Testament I should say we have Tim and Chris are both here hey Timmy Chrissa
 here we are and to tell me you're going to lead us through the formation of the New Testament collection of literature and how that contributes to the unified story of the whole Bible by over formation is Hebrew Bible but really weird is trying to flag the key issues we're kind of the key insights for what kind of collection it is but it just as a point of comparison industry call the Hebrew Bible is a collection of literature that was in the formation stage over the course of a millennia 1,000 years plus the long time I never think about something existing or becoming coming into existence for thousands of years window at a building that was built in Portland I think two years ago and then probably was in the planning three or four years before that we live in the western shore of the United States like nothing nothing like that.
 there are some like you know indigenous American burial ground you know where you can see burial mounds that much older than a thousand years but other than that there's not a lot why you go to the East Coast of United States to get a few centuries, centuries anyway the New Testament collection the documents that we find in question is a testament all were written and in their finished written form within half a century about five decades so when I say that what I'm doing is upstanding from what time does Jesus that's we counted in the story of the gospel song Jesus in the 30s and then by the 80s and 90s 80 we are in the time. Of the writing of the last document Testament so yeah just compare a small rabbit Thousand-Year formation history vs a 50-year formation history
 taking one year okay what's in them was think about it in terms of historical events a man named Jesus of Nazareth happens like just he is an event unto himself the man Jesus of Nazareth what he said and didn't what happened in light of what he said and did so that happens Jesus of Nazareth launches a movement people and he even appoints key leaders of that movement and what those leaders go on to do what we should say Jesus of Nazareth was a Jewish man who read the Hebrew Bible okay I was going to get there or something
 in light of what he said and did and you points leaders of that movement those leaders go on to help Stewart and guide the movement and what the New Testament is is a collection of writings from that first generation of leaders of the early Jesus movement so it's post Jesus in terms of after his wife's death and Resurrection all the documents after that and written within just the decades immediately after that cuz the moment they start to die off in a 40-50 years later is we're getting into the second third generation of the Jesus movement it's all the documents come from that really window that's one way to think about it another way to think about it is to get more focused on who who Jesus thought he was what he thought he was doing and then why he would have point leaders and watch a movement in the first place
 that's can I get this into the next layer of understanding The Collection so should we talk about that that who he is and what he's doing is announcing the arrival of God's Reign and rule over Israel and over the nation's and all of this is bringing to a climax is not so still meant a long story that was pre-existing that he said we read about in the Tanakh Bible old testament old testament so that's the story I've got any kind of conversation to the humans as his image and rulers job Big Time. Uses a Remnant family Abraham to be his Representatives out of all the nations they do a really good job that all goes crashing down a Remnant cores out of that
 tries to rebuild life in the land and the hopes for the coming of someone who will do for Humanity in Israel what nobody seems to be able to do a king from line of David a royal priesthood a messiah and anointed one and Jesus sees him presents himself as that one and so so the New Testament first has four accounts of essentially that key. Of the final years of Jesus announcing the arrival got the rain the conflict the degenerates with Israel's leaders is he saying he's the leader of Israel were presenting itself as 1 ml Vistaril don't take kindly to that so they have him executed and then he's all of a sudden the live again. The people and commissioning them to share the good news that he is the king of the cosmos is a big takeaway here which I think we should over state is that Jesus both red and Hebrew Bible understood the story
 he saw it as a unified he shouldn't literature and then he saw himself as the filling all the story and the promises and the themes of this literature to me in his life and then in his ragtag group of followers after him and so everything that he's doing and that they going to do is continuing the story in the themes that have come to fruition in the Hebrew Bible called unified or where we're talking about the Bible's unifieds that's the point you're making a unified story that back to the Paradigm that it's Messianic literature but it's about of Messiah kind of what it's about but the unified aspect in the Messianic I suspect are closely
 is one of the ways that it's you that funny
 do cats what's the forecast for accounts however one of the Gospel accounts was actually written as a two-part work what we call Luke was written as the Jesus volume with a matching followers of Jesus volume that's called the book of Acts and so the New Testament opens with a governing Narrative of foundation narrative just like in the Hebrew Bible the foundation narrative is from creation to Babylonian exile from Genesis to Kings the sort of like the gospels and acts form the foundation narrative for what's going on in the New Testament collection so that open the New Testament with this kind of governing their separate works but isn't like Ezra Nehemiah where was one scroll and we broke it up and it to us with the author saying in my former work got it
 opens with five large narrative accounts for of them are all telling the same story from four different angles and this is for one of the challenges to this unified aspect were talking about is that okay if this is a unified work why are there four distinct accounts that could be uncomfortable for a lot of people in the past in our how to read the gospels conversations a couple years ago but it's a never-ending question it's one of those questions I love to keep bringing up every few years and think about it what a fascinating collection to telephone dacian Story 4 times over the Assumption being No One account could exhaust full meaning of what happened so you need the stereo scopic treatments it hear it from four angles
 four separate account treatment
 I don't know what if what is each of your family members wrote an account of the life of John Collins many account so we're just keeping our fly over here so in terms of the The Narrative being told it goes from Ashley the birth of Jesus up to his death and resurrection and then each of the four counts and was some kind of launchpadder commissioning to the Next Generation to carry on the announcement of goodness that Jesus is the king of the world and so the book of Acts is the 1 scroll the pics that up and carries it out another few decades into the future and it's about the growth of those men outside Jerusalem outside Judea and then throughout Asia and Roman song so that's the foundation narrative what comes after those five Scrolls to tell the sound a
 narratives are a big collection of letters that were all written by key leaders in that first generation of the Jesus movement letters literally letter first century Greco-Roman letters written by Messianic Jewish authors is unique to this collection because the right there's no letters per se in the Tanakh oh a couple books have short letters within them Jeremiah as I have some but yeah unique letter Scrolls in the Bible say about that's right the unique literary style in the Bible That's only in this part of the New Testament and so we've got all you know the letters of Paul 14 and then there's a few other letters we got Jacob James
 Jon Jones and then you got the Revelation which is a letter which presents itself as a letter to seven but it's it's a long very poetic it brings together the literary styles of letter and apocalyptic into one well the Spy of the 27 books in the New Testament today five of them are the foundation narratives there's one Apocalypse at the end of a letter so it you know you can yeah it's either 22 letters or 21 letters and then an apocalypse at the end is that the Tanakh seems so heavily design yeah yeah if this collection doesn't seem to feel like it has that level of design it's a different kind of unity unity and in other words
 it doesn't seem like there was a final editorial hand or crew that gathered all of these and middle editorial tweaks to unify them because its formation history is different Jesus movement didn't began it began in Jerusalem but all the New Testament books were written in Jerusalem and the Jesus movement decentralized within the decade and then was just spreading all throughout the Mediterranean region and then down South and North Africa and then East and they're established different cities that work on a different network hubs for the Jesus movement down Alexandria up in Antioch over in Rome Ephesus and so each of those networks have their like leading Scholars are Apostles that are you know nerds who are preserving the stories and crafting these books and so these books
 come from in thinking I had would have to have been a network of churches that have the money could raise the money to provide for the scholars to research an interview eyewitnesses and to form the gospel accounts we have them Luke mentioned his sponsor the awfulest so there has to be an infrastructure in the production of these text Paul relied on networks of sponsors for his missions and where and when you would have written those letters on these missions and so on and so yeah imagine the network of unnamed people that made the writing of these texts possible don't point is it wasn't centralized what was Central was Spirit of Jesus animating this diverse movement and so you have books originating different cities and then beginning to circulate across the networks and spread and so the story of the New Testament is much more like this is both a good analogy and a terrible one over the years
 some ways that is similar to a handful of like original key writers who create some YouTube videos and so maybe they say they trade 100 videos but thirty-two of them go viral and then they're spreading across different networks and so on and he's 32 kind of rise to the most of use and they come to epitomize like what the work of these founding whatever creatives was really all about of course there was a ton more kind of like most of the top Matthew's account of Jesus's life like Jesus has it and it's awesome let's get a copy and like stuff that I wrote to the laodiceans and that they read the letter I wrote to you
 Testament you begin to have the manuscript evidence is in the mid 100 the four gospels are being read together as a collection in different networks across the Mediterranean that shows he was that they spread and there was some kind of early consensus arising that like these are the four C's of the for the best capture what it was about re organic nature to that same thing happened with the letters with Paul's letters the letters are being passed around the most and when people think like what are the important letters that help us understand how to continue to do this movement these are the ones reading and it's a Spirit-filled community of God that just recognizes them and reads them and that's how they continue to be accepted it so much more organic and decentralized process
 all of them are written within the first 50 years but then the emergence of these texts as a coherent collection took many many more decades to sort itself out because there wasn't ever a moment we're all the apostles were in a room together to say this is the New Testament like that meeting never happened so what what is the result of is a couple hundred years of these texts being used in worship like you said Carissa and these are the the text that Rose to the top but it wasn't just that they were popular important it was also important that there was some kind of lineage of connection the people can make between a text in Back to the first generation it was clear to them that the spirit was at work through these letters that Rose took them to be at the same level of scripture as the king Bible for them
 mine is even if you just want to know like what are the facts on the ground when it comes to the origin of the New Testament just give me like what's everything we know of all the historical details and how you put it together in the story Bruce Metzger go to classic work that's been updated and so many editions cuz it's just it's everything in one place just called the Canon of the New Testament its origin development and significance of reading reading title about how as a Christian if I'm going to accept this collection as being on the same level and Authority as the Hebrew Bible and here it does a human and divine word how do I account for the process of its selection of these texts and why not some other friends or why why one of these maybe one of them should have been left out you know what how do I account for that and it's supposed to be a scholar of New Testament manuscripts
 and a theologian a Michael Krueger is what multiple bucks but he has one called the question of cannon that was really helpful for me but for me what's beautiful about the story is that these texts are window into the first generation back to Jesus in the early Jesus movement they're written by the people that Jesus deputized and so you have accounts from this and Luke John and Matthew of Jesus authorizing be certain followers to become like his mouthpieces and so just a sort of like Peter and John and James and Paul become kind of like the Moses in the Jeremih and Isaiah so to speak of the New Covenant of the Messianic movement and you would expect the new collections text with arise that would tell them the next part of the foundation story and then guide people for how to live within the story faithfully and that's what we have in the New Testament but it's a day
 this all may be a too long of response to something you said a little bit ago John which is the New Testament is Unified in a different way than the Hebrew Bible is Unified they're both unified by governing story you know you're at the formation history in the collection history is different in a way that I think is really interesting understand
yeah so is your reading through the New Testament what are some or a major unifying factor that you would notice as a reader not just its formation but what is its formation mean that we would see ya so some of this will seem like way too obvious Jesus none of the New Testament documents failed to mention Jesus not everyone mentions his death book James doesn't talk about Jesus death but it does talk about Jesus as the Lord Of Glory and hoping for his return which assumes that he was exalted and this the king of the world so yeah this is the stuff of New Testament Theology and it's a fascinating question of what is it that really unifies this diverse set of text that came from different leaders in this very decentralized Messianic movement in the first century Jesus all the New Testament documents presented Jesus who's in continuity with the storyline of the Hebrew Bible
 nothing really important because they're emerged offshoots of the Jesus movement that were down for Jesus but that we're not down for anyting Jewish they disconnected Jesus from his Jewish Heritage from the Old Testament scriptures in the really gnostics living down in Egypt and the Gospel of Thomas is kind of most famous document associated with them at all there's no narrative Jesus sitting in the back rim giving secret teachings to a few disciples and they're all very cryptic in strange but there's no story of his death is nothing about anything to do with anything with Israel or he actually have it sounds like a Greek Mystic philosopher who telling you how to shed this Mortal coil of the physical world
 hey ya very much very much about leaving the Material World Behind to go to Eternal non-physical world after you die by unifying factors so the song about Jesus as the Fulfillment of the story of Israel in the Hebrew scriptures yeah those are announcement of the kingdom of God his death and Resurrection the key things that hold the whole collection of the unified story is about god-appointed Humanity to rule and then this constant failure and the need to like the rescue so that we can then actually rule in creation that God does have to keep be creating and choosing then the New Testament all these writings are reflecting on how that's coming to a resolution with Jesus and the community of people who see themselves
 as the continuation of Jesus like they actually see themselves as like Jesus is body continuing on Earth all uses for the body of Christ and so that that's the story continuing through that literature and then the apocalypse then takes the devil all the time and send the Melodies of the biblical story and projects them out into the ultimate conclusion of history as we know it and the transition from world as we experience it in two or three births in in the new creation when Jesus is installed as king of Heaven on Earth when they rejoin as one so that one's a really fitting conclusion to the whole the Bible read book review
 I'm somebody riding on Revelation as it's a book by Brian Tabb called All Things new revelation as canonical Capstone canonical being an adjective from the word Canon which means is a Greek word spelled in English letters
 that has come to refer to the Old and New Testament as one unified collection collection so it is he's trying to read Revelation not just as the culmination of the New Testament that has the combination of Genesis to Revelation about Revelation is it it's the most kind of Jewish literature feeling of all of of the Scrolls of the New Testament so you got the gospels and those feel like they're really like yes they're like it's in the tradition of Jewish like writing of narrative when you get to the letters and then kind of feels like it's people talking about Jewish literature and then what it would mean interpretation and then just kind of like bringing it down to earth to be like so here's what's going on the ground with you guys and so let's talk about all the themes and ideas of the Jewish there's but but it doesn't feel like Jewish literature are you saying that
 Revelation feels like Jewish literature because it's really hard to understand the whole Testament
 or is the bed it's just full of symbols and images from the Hebrew Bible because in the Hebrew Bible you have apocalyptic literature and that's a very Jewish it's not the only way they did but it has that and in the Gospels it seems like the way that they very intentionally told stories hyperlinks and like the design and craftsmanship of the scroll in the way the stories unfold that all seems like it's pulling from the second temple Jewish tradition the letters just feel like yeah just letters like anyone would have been writing letters like this potentially I mean I guess we talked about that and how to read the New Testament letters conversation the literary form of the New Testament letters follows the template of first-century Greek and Roman letters
 forecast being employed by Messianic Jews to write to reflecting on the Hebrew Bible and light of what Jesus is doing on the ground in there so in a way it just kind of feels very sticks out like a sore thumb to me is different just feel right at home with like if you're reading through the Hebrew Bible and then you read the gospels and the apocalypse oh just everything would just feel like I have the smallest miniature just had the same design and the letters are thrown in there in your life and Portland contribution cuz they're like little snapshots into how the apostles were giving practical guidance and instruction to mechanic house churches about how to live as if Jesus is King in there
 1st Century Greek and Roman context from like the time of Judges like circulating around like yeah sure and like here's how you know it would be really fascinating but it's just the way you know it's a very unique New Testament think it is a few collections of ancient Israelite letters and this was before Papyrus Scrolls were really well distributed and popular and so what people wrote letters are broken pieces of pottery know how many letters and see brake pots all the time are those shards are called ostrica and an ancient Israel that was very popular medium on which to write show
 no it's very short notice so there have been found collections of ancient Israelite letters so there's one group called The Lucky shastra cut another group called The A-Rod ostrica the two cities that were founded in a straight up like one of the luck I had to do a paper on what is cool and it's a letter from a woman to an army General about this guy in her neighborhood who stole her cloak no joke he's like hey you know General so-and-so son so I took my cloak won't give it back to me what am I supposed to do can you come help me sing like we do have letters from ancient Israel and they don't read like Roman letters they read like those literary forms a little different So based on this thing about interest is how you write a letter based on your cultural location and the New Testament letters use a certain convention specific to that time and place
 resources available even to write longer works of the longest letters in the call could have written wisdom literature and he didn't I mean I guess in a way it is I mean it is with them but it isn't in the tradition of Proverbs are Ben Sira right like he could have been like this for century Christians and I'm going to like craft all this really amazing within their shirt and now I felt very Jewish sure you know another way to I'm trying to probe like what is underneath your question the letters also uniquely have a feature that they are all the responsive correspondent like John clearly sat down and worked on the apocalypse for years it reflects yes a very very detailed trapped
 not to say that Paul was careless and writing his letters but he wrote them in response to real issues and so in letter correspondence timeliness urgency is often a factor and so they have a different literary quality to them and purpose so that way it feels different then yeah the reading Isaiah or the apocalypse or right
I don't know if this is a good analogy but sometimes I think of the letters in a similar way to how I think of the writings of the Old Testament because you have this core material the gospels that is talking about Jesus and his life and death and resurrection and then the letters are kind of interpretive or responses to happened or explaining more how to live in light of that it's like a reflection in some way or another on the life of Jesus sometimes I think of the writings of the Old Testament that way to like a reflection on what came earlier I don't know if that is referring to the Third
 is a new narrative context a community of Jews in Exile and Tricia but it's picking up all of the themes of when the nation's conspire to sort God's plan God raises up a chosen Remnant and they face a great test have to surrender their lives is R&R everything in the trust that God will create life out of death could summarize Genesis Esther takes those themes from early on the collection but the work cuz I'm in a new way and in a similar way Paul will pick up the story of Jesus but then as he addresses the crisis in the Corinthian house churches start practical ideas but then address them in shape it all in a different way than he would in the letter to the Romans or the way Peter does to the churches of Asia Minor is that what you're saying it's the same core ideas developed in a different direction but I guess the question I have is
 call think he was like finishing the cannon like contributing to the finishing of the can Cannon because it seems like if Paul was to sit down and go I'll man so the story needs to continue we got the Tanakh and he's I don't know what his familiarity with the gospels were you can tell me but like we need some literature that kind of finalizes and helps bring this to Capstone as we were saying if that was my agenda and I was very fluent in the Hebrew Bible I would have tried to write stuff that felt very at home in that literature like in a wisdom literature or narratives about the apostles that basically instructed them teach and give wisdom but through the way that narratives do and poetry stuff and I guess Paul does have poetry in his letters but you know he's running
 that's right some your part like in this in his correspondence with the Thessalonians he talks about how I hate when we came and showed up the Salonika which was like I think access they were just there for 3 weeks it's a few weeks before the black plant this church you much longer. He talks about how you received us you received our words not as human words what does a word from God so Paul had an awareness of being commissioned by Jesus to announce the good news that he believed came from the god of Israel so in that sense he believed that what he was writing was on behalf of Jesus given God's guidance to these communities and Peter are also says in 2nd Peter 3:16 that you know Paul talks like this and he says things that are hard to understand then he Compares it to the other scriptures that are graffe so it's like there was a recognition that what Paul was writing at that time with scripture Peter recognizes it
 did you have one parcel of recognizing another Apostles writings is giving divide and guidance the same way the Hebrew scriptures do so I think part of it is just we encounter the Bible for small we call it with a singular noun the Bible everywhere else in the in the Bible it just refers to the Bible's it's always put off because the word bible means scroll in the Bible isn't one scroll it's a collection of Scrolls so we encounter as one volume down between two coppers I think that constricts our imaginations right because the Kodak switch is the pound conversion to the show up until all the 300 something yeah it was invented earlier but it was adopted like. Team in the second third centuries before that you're always going to just have a scroll saw and unlikely will you have all of them cuz you have to be really rich so so if I ask a question did Paul think he was riding a text that would end up in
 my Bible is the Bible that he was offering Divine guidance commissioned by Jesus to early church communities benefit next to the Torah Scrolls and the enemy knew that somebody was reading that alongside Genesis in the Sunday Gathering I think Paul would feel great about that and that is what has started happening which is why he says to the Colossians hey I wrote a letter to this other Church you should read that and then they should read the fine with you because the apostles view themselves as the Heralds of the a New Covenant between God and people that's been inaugurated by Jesus and the Covenant with Israel was launched through Moses that had a body of writings attached to it the New Covenant has an emerging body of writing so attached to it as well and is Michael Krueger's his book I mentioned earlier this is how he conceived the VIN and helpful to me so the New Testament the New Testament
 Covenant it's the New Covenant documents that those tell the story and then give guidance to the first century communities and how to live out that story and then all of that boat collections become God's wisdom to all people of all times but that gets us to a later later one I'm thinking about your question about why Paul didn't write narrative or wisdom and kind of imagining what it would have been like if he did and there's something to the Jesus story as told in the gospels feeling like the culmination of that story The Narrative of the Hebrew Bible that feels like it would have been kind of weird if the story discontinued in story form I mean it does a little bit in the book of Acts like how the church started to carry that on but I wonder if there's something to Jesus being the culmination of The Narrative of the story that then gives place for something a different kind of literature speculation
 Elsa I mean just the Ya-Ya another with the apostles other than the gospel authors including Luke rotax the current need wasn't yet another Foundation story James wrote the closest thing to it up with him later and Peter's needs were very practical that's why it makes me feel like he wasn't thinking like let me write second temple Jewish literature book of the Bible you just kind of like I'm doing pastoral work but it was really important and God breathed and the other Apostles believe that they were writing on behalf of Jesus and God to know that James Jacobs book does feel like he's like let me do some s Temple. Bob arum's literature get off a second temple Jewish man grew up in these Scrolls he was a Pharisee like
 this is his Jam surprised he is like other things to do
 yeah I see that describes the life of every Pastor I know there's like never enough time to do the things you actually want to do then must your time putting out fires go quarantine on an island somewhere to like write something with another girl station I mentioned in the last episode I borrowed an illustration from to Scholars about that the Hebrew Bible is much more like an Aspen Grove were a core group all that is the story of Adam and Noah Patriarchs Moses was like the score root ball that gave birth to all of this other literature that all started growing simultaneously alongside the roof off and that was the last episode of the New Testament is much more like going to that local garden nursery and you go to the back and you say can you show me some Maples can you show me some fig trees
 and what you're fine just things are organized into like categories and so you'll find for nice Maples but then also one of them that was a cutting from one Maple and grown up that's luke-acts related and then I'll let me come over here let me show you these trees and they're all potted and their separate but they've been scooted together because they're of like kind of the letters together and then maybe all of them have something else in common that is the they're all about Jesus and how expensive was the story of the scriptures go through all of them or something that's right you have told us exactly and once again once the Revelation was written early Christian production of literature didn't stop their continued to be very popular influential text written some of them that even do seem to come from the tail end of that first generation and they were very popular text called The Shepherd of hermas
 I know that the did I can use like a little manual for early conference like a little teacher's manual for Christianity 101 the letters of just and Clement more letters by early church leaders and it ain't so on overtime in a decentralized way the Jesus movement came to a consensus on this 27 however and I'll just say this is a foot and it is not the kind of consensus that was popularized once again by Dan Brown in The DaVinci Code 40 mean a big part of that was he helped popularize the minorities he says that the New Testament collection was formed by Constantine at the Council of Nicea in the three twenties 80s problem with that it's just every trace of evidence we have about the Council of nicaea it's like it wasn't about that at all it was it was about trying to come to a consensus on the name
 picture of Jesus humanity and deity and how they relate to each other and it was a theological dispute between church leaders being brokered by the Roman Emperor but what they were not debating was what's in and out of the canyon there were conversations that touched on some of those types of issues but it had to do with what books can we appeal to for guidance as we tried to determine the nature of Jesus Humanity in. And so anyhow there's a great series of anthologies put to buy Oxford called Oxford handbooks and has brand new one I haven't read it yet but it's called the Oxford handbook to the Council of nicaea looks outstanding and if you want a nerd out on the Council of Nicea that's where you should go to all that stays there was never a moment we're like a secret what are the council that room of powerful church leaders in robes and hoods got together and said let's trick everybody and make a new testament
 weather another try to trick everyone is out to whatever Force our view of Orthodoxy on everybody and we only slept these it was a decentralized organic process that took place over many many decades and was later church leaders are doing when they drop list is there to saying hey what's everybody reading what did everyone already agreed upon. So that's a lot more like the garden nursery where are you these 27. Put together and yeah that's the difference between something coming into being in 50 years versus 1,000 years exactly right we can all just kind of happened everything was written all that room and she was brought together and you're like cool this is totally off base and isn't true about the life of Jesus there were other people around that would be like that didn't happen cuz it was written within fifty years and really close to
 was eventually died out was lost with the group that produced it and was buried in the Sands of Egypt for fifteen hundred years but ya didn't drive with you Jesus so we're talking about the Bible being unified literature and what we've been talking about is that there's two different collections with in the Bible big Mega collections here Bible in the New Testament and both of those collections contributes to the unified nature of the Bible it is an anthology it has many literary Styles many authors written over many years but it's a type of Anthology that's so kind of meticulously crafted and kind of so obsessed and weigh over one and of Melody as you described it last episode of talking about the purpose of God and Humanity that it all it all congeals into a really you.
 wide form that taken together is having something very specific that's right and unified and two main ways that was focused on Main on one which is the unified in terms of the origin of its formation or its editorial or compilation history we focus on that for the Hebrew Bible we've been fixing up the New Testament and then the other way that's related is a governing story for narrative we've developed that actually in this conversation but that's really what the next part of the Paradigm is about the unified the Bible is a unified story that Lisa Jesus that leads to Jesus will we call the Paradigm this is number three that the Bible is Messianic literature that it's unified in what it is about a story about a representative human which is what Israel called the Messiah
 open the Paradigm the Bible is Messianic literature next
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue the series on the Paradigm and we talked about how the Bible is Messianic literature There's Something about making each story about me and my spiritual journey that I think is actually really different than what Jesus is trying to tell us about what all the stories in the Torah prophets and writings are up.
