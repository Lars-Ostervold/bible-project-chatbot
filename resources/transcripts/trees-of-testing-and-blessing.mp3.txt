one of the first stories in the Bible is of Adam and Eve at the tree of knowing good and bad and God says do not touch it or you will surely die even tempted by a snake to desire the fruit of this tree and she takes it I'll keep in mind the story and those details when we read another story about Abraham meeting King abimelech in the story Abraham starts telling everyone that his wife is his sister is so King abimelech takes her what's interesting is God Appears to this King in a dream says hey guy lied to you and don't touch that woman or else you will surely die Abraham's wife is the tree that is not to be touched or eaten from lest you die this King becomes the Adam figure and Abraham plays the role of the snake the lying treacherous snake in the store today on the podcast we are in the second movement of the Genesis scroll
 these are the stories of Abraham and in this movement we're tracing the theme of trees and Hebrew it's the word 1/8 can refer to any wooden object of tree or bush or log and when we see a we sometimes find moments of temptation but we also find moments of Deliverance like when Hagar is wandering in the wilderness with her son about to die and she puts her son under an ape's you have a woman is about to die and her child that died in the desert with no water by a bush with the word used to describe the bushes in Eden story and then her eyes are opened and what she sees is water God provides water in the wilderness and gives them life and says I'm going to make you into a great nation in these chapters we also get the climactic story where God asked Abraham surrender everything and he does it at the top of the mountain on an altar of eight Dear God
 them to completely surrender the future blessing of their family over to God in the form of a sacrifice only to receive it back by God's grace with not just a promise a blessing but Covenant with a Plus on Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie Krista Quinn and I trace the theme of eights through the second half of the Ibrahim stories we find temptation deliverance and blessing thanks for joining us here we go
 alright we're back at it we are moving through the Bible Movement by movement and we are currently in a movement to of the scroll Genesis which is the first scroll in the Bible hello hello three of us are working through this and we're looking at the theme of trees and Abraham stories and so we just looked at how the thing that she's begins in the dark to be in blachly it begins in the creation narrative has one or God gives seed bearing trees fruit bearing trees as his gift of life it's a good thing for humans and then in the second creation story there's a really extra special tree the tree of life and it's in the center of the garden which is in the center of the
 which is this hotspot we're having ribs are connected as a trees in the Bible the steam is already really connected to this idea of being in the place where God and humans work together as one you didn't and tree in Hebrew can refer to what we think of as a tree like an oak tree but I can also refer to what we would call but yes or a mine the wooded made of plant that's what it means is that you go on in the biblical story the tree imagery of Eden can be activated not just by the same word tree but also by the appearance of other bushes or plants or low-lying shrubs but if they play the same role in the story as the Garden of Eden tree then you know you're in the presence of a repeated scene and it can also be activated not buy tree imagery but by that same word at speaking Translate
 in English is what we see that come up in this movement later Genesis 22 oz can use up to activate the Garden of Eden tree so the second time you shows up then is when Noah new atom character who walks with God he goes through the chaos Waters got does a new creation and he up on a mountain but you survived because of a boat maybe it's okay. The tree is the means by which got a little micro eaten and then he goes on to a mountain and he plants a Vineyard which is a tree and there again we have this idea of God in humans together on I drive and the tree also becomes his downfall
 and the garden and the garden there were two trees one became the downfall so we got into the Abraham there it is Timmy kind of showed us how Abraham or Abram as these first called he is a new Adam again I do know of a new opportunity God pulling one person out of the many to give them blessing and try to restart the project I'm partnering with Humanity to bless the world so you showed us how the stories of Abram and he's hanging out at a tree with random details like oh he's at the Oakdale more yeah and we pitch the tent and built an altar and Yahweh appeared to him suddenly you realize this is Eden stuff or an Eden territory so we looked at a number of those in fact this whole block of Abraham stories ended with him again at a tree on a mountain and then God actually comes to visit
 and they have a feast in a garden yep feasting on food the subscribed using the exact look happy Larry of the food offerings from The Book of Leviticus second-hand seen that image of approaching God and connecting with him the tree that was the downfall of Adam and Eve now Abraham's hanging out at the tree inviting God and and it's a success is a reverse of the fall and then this is where then God promises Abram that he's going to give him a son which is crazy because Abram's really old wife is really old late 90s the bats that famous story and this is a really high moment the life of Abraham and for the whole story of the Bible so far yeah totally so that's where we left it at the beginning of chapter 18 so what's going to come next is the story of Sodom and Gomorrah and how God invites Abraham into his Divine count
 to determine the fate of the Nations and turns out they always really eager to show Mercy will spare the many many Wicked it's there's just a few righteous but that's a whole story but don't have time to get to do stuff more stuff happening yeah we move into the second part of the story of Abraham it's mix-up but we call chapters 20 through most of chapter 22 there's for narratives they're arranged here they're really tightly organized through repeated words images so the Ford Store is go like this right after the Sodom and Gomorrah event Abraham I'll goes down to the South Southwestern coast of the land which is where the Philistines later live and he goes there to city and he lies about the identity of his wife in the city
 and that's actually part of how you know it's the beginning of a new part is in the first part of Abraham story right after he was given the blessing he lied about the identity of his wife and put her in Jeopardy for her safety in Jeopardy was the first thing you said now Abram just received another promise of blessing and a son and the next narrative about him that kicks off the next part is Jim replaying is failure so what's interesting is God Appears to this King in a dream that says hey Sky lied to you and don't touch that woman or else you will surely die she is the tree yes this King becomes the Adam figure Abraham's wife is the tree that is not to be touched or eaten from lest you die and Abraham plays the role of the snake the lying treacherous
 in the story The really critical portrait at Abraham and the King passes the test and the Kings like Hey listen man I haven't touched her and Alyssa are you the kind of guy that's in the business of killing righteous people cuz I haven't done anything wrong I know that's why I'm telling you I'm just lying treachery second account as a tree hit even though tree isn't explicit that she's kind of like the tree it's definitely a Eaton replay but it's the tree doesn't appear in the store and it doesn't have the same connotation that these other hits have with the tree being on a high mountain and a meeting God there then you get a story about how Isaac is born finally Abraham and Sarah's son is born but there's a division with his brother
 there's a division among the mothers Sarah and Isaac Our intention with Hagar and Ishmael and so there's a division among the brothers and the unchosen mother and son are exiled from the land is replaying the can the naval tension in the Exile and non chosen from the land to interesting and so you can all story of Abraham and Ishmael then right after that story you have another narrative about Abraham in that came the king that he had conflict with us and now it's a story about how that King wants to make a covenant with Abraham cuz he sees the hay God is with you and I noticed that you know even though you're kind of a champ your your god-like has your back and things got pretty good for you so can we be friends let's be friends maybe I can get some of that blessing make a covenant and then after that story you get the famous story of Abraham in the Bible
 near sacrifice of Isaac says it's kind of a story about Abraham and the King Abraham and the nachos and Son Ishmael than a story about Abraham and that King again and then story about Abraham and the chosen son so it follows a neat symmetrical kind of pattern and there's lots of hyperlinks in connection between twin stories but it's all about the whole thing is the nations are going to be blessed through you and your seed and that's exactly what these four stories are exploring and meditating on how the nation's get in on the promise but what if the promise is put into the hands of a guy who's a blind treacherous snake whose family is dividing which is what this is about and so it only happens when instead of lying that Abraham and the nation's find a way to make peace through Covenant together and then what does that mean for the future of the family well it's going to mean the sink
 out of the non Chosen and God's going to take care of them though it's sad that there has to be a division of the brothers in the first place and then we can see his God is even going to ask for a division between Father and Son Abraham was going to be asked to give up the sun on Whom The Promise Hanks which brings whole story to a crisis cuz it's like the whole thing depends on this sets The Arc of this section of the Abraham story so long called trees play a role and Genesis 21 story of Abraham and Ishmael in Genesis 21 story of Abraham and and story of Abraham and Isaac all three have eaten tree moments that really talk with cool significance you say it's right here you got is Hebrew translator to get SEC yes yeah trying to spell the name of the way the more the way the sound in Hebrew
 Abraham Abraham is the name of the king so should we just kind of diving
so in Genesis 21 right after Isaac is born so Abraham and Sarah finally have that promise child and they make a big Feast have a big party Genesis 21 verses 9 and Sarah saw she looked at the son of Hagar the Egyptian the one she had borne for Abraham making laughter causing my after she saw the sign and she left she saw the sun and not son was causing laughter or making laughter though the sun was like yeah most of those translations yeah playing or mocking yes but you know just a few versus prior right Sarah had said anyone who sees that God has blessed me like this will last the laugh with me and it seems like a positive thing they're so Isaac name means laughter because both Abraham and Sarah laughed when they first heard there were two
 it's the name in laughter and then you write Justice sentences before this she said everyone who hears of my son that I had to sign will laugh with me so it seems the app seems positive laugh with me don't laugh with me so laughter is born but then she sees that other son from that other wife and he is causing laughter it's so interesting Lee I think because our English translations see some sort of negative connotation hear what she doesn't like what she sees or so and Ivy translates that mocking us visas laughing nrsv full-on like does it hurt to move playing with Isaac just inferring that the story so it's not the normal word for laughter it's a causative for like causing laughter so it's a little unclear maybe it's like you know Isaac
 is meant to cause laughter on Sarah has him and now she's Ishmael causing Lassiter name so she gave birth to laughter but then there's this other son who thinks he can do it you know so that the narrative doesn't nail down for you what he was doing but you can tell a reaction that she interprets it really negative play it's just like the division of Cain and Abel The Narrative doesn't say why one offering was better than the other or if it was exactly right that's a great that's a great observation the division of the brothers in Cain and Abel story there's a duties and why God did what he did and there's going to be that same ambiguity what God's about to do here but also in what's Sarah's responses so what she says we know what she's feeling cuz what she says and first 10 is banished the slave and her son he will know
 inherit the son of the slave woman along with my son along with laughter it's so she wants to separate the two sons was bad in the eyes of Abraham on account of his son he's bummed yeah this is real bummer for him and on account of his son is that referring to a smile yeah there's so much son language in the story I think it's about his firstborn son Ishmael Ishmael that came through when you guys took advantage of Hagar that's not the promised son it's just interesting paired with that line right above there are saying he won't inherit this along with my son and then Abraham is bombs on account of his son to son yeah cuz Abraham said couple chapters ago like it would make him the chosen one exists because of a
 a lack of faith and so it's not because Hagar and Ishmael are bad it's that your smell is a son that results from their scheming in their plan and the whole point is for God to show them that this blessing will only come as a gift by his new creation power and also there is a theme of the second-born that's right being chosen that's right over the 1st which is a whole nother thing that's right and I think that's what being highlighted here this was bad in the eyes of Abraham cuz he's cuz I already have a first born son like he's born first that's how we do it in the East here we raise up the firstborn and even if it's not from your and I know how this works if your primary you probably why it doesn't matter I mean this little attention is going to be full-on developed in the story of Jacob follow with his many wives who's the favored Sons on there already talking for position soon so tell him says to
 Abraham listen don't let it be bad in your eyes I've already told you that Isaac is going to be the one to inherit the blessing so don't let it be evil about the boy and the slave woman listen what Sarah says to listen to her voice it is by Isaac that your seed will be called and the son of the slave woman I'm going to make him into a nation because he is your seed I'll bless those associated with you I'm going to bless those who bless you so well is going to have the Eden blessing going on and go his way but that doesn't mean he's the chosen one so it's interesting the chosen in the non chosen can have God's blessing but what the promise is going to trace has the lineage of that leads to the sea to the woman crushing the head of snake in the promise is looking for the human who will not fail the test will crush evil so Abraham is asked to give up his fur
 born son right here and he's going to be asked to give up a second born son and another chapter of parallel stories stories about God promising the whole story has been a great family and then now I can finally has two sons and he's God saying you have to give them both back or give them away real crisis in the narrative here so Abraham Rose early in the morning he took bread and like essentially like a Nalgene water bottle to get a loaf of bread and a water bottle and he give us this day our place to hang up on her shoulder and also the child and he sends her away and they're in the desert so here she is she wanders into the Wilderness of the air Shiva name bear chavala means well of seven
 spring or well seven and all the sudden the water was finished from the water bottle and what can she do she is in a land with no water
 and so she puts her child under a bush and she goes away sitting a distance away you know is about as far as you can see he said I can't see the death of the child then so she said distance away lifted up her voice and left powerful say so just real quick here she's in a desert where there's no water to the land was wild and West the member how the Garden of Eden there to begin with they were no bushes in the land who actually heard of this is a good one word for Bush here in Genesis to Genesis 2115 said she puts puts him under yep the only two times that that word unique word bushes he is just right here and at the very beginning of the Garden of Eden story when it says there were no
 even though bushes in the land but God caused a stream to rise up out of the ground to water the surface and he makes life out of non-life so now we have a woman who's just run out of water in the wilderness and she puts her child under a bush but we know that the name of this place is called the will of Elohim heard the voice of the boy in the messenger of Elohim called to Hagar from the skies and said what what are you concerned about don't be afraid I heard the voice of the boy get up taken with your hand I'm going to make him a great nation and I'll let him open her eyes and she saw a 7 well The Well of seven she saw is like the tree of moray
 advenir at the tree and a snake says so you're not going to die the day you eat of the tree your eyes will be open and you'll know yeah you'll know good and evil and be like God exactly you have a woman is about to die and a child not to die in the desert with no water by a bush that's the word used to describe the bushes in Eden story and then her eyes are opened and what she sees as well water God provides water in the wilderness and gives them life and says I'm going to make you into a great nation blessing verbatim the Covenant promise given to Abraham and Isaac the reason why we're retiring it's this into the tree of life is because of this word Bush and then all of the image of the desert no water but then God provides water and gives blessing of future seed and that's not the word at a different word but it's the same order
 as to when it said there were no bushes in the land and then the response has a god planted the garden View and made in trees to stop there the other big hit here is water in the garden story you know God you showed us those truly missed but you called it up is that the one that turned into the four rivers Has a Miss comes up and Waters the ground making mud so that's what got forms the human plants the garden and then there's a river flowing river flowing river blessing and secure you've got a land with no water and they're going to die from a lack of water and thank God provides water yet but there is a little detail here of of the Bush you want to offend you be like
 why are we using that word why not just use another word for bus the more normal word but it echoes something important from earlier I think she cast a child under one of the bushes it kind of makes you think okay where have I read Bush before that's not a very common word I haven't seen that come up a lot and then you have to search for it in English though so far so far and an English translation I don't think you would come across the bus yet except for Genesis 25 because it would just be even then I don't think it's a translator Bush it's translated shrub shrub over the ground or shut the field that would actually make it stand out more to me if it was called a job because the story of Abraham and Isaac
 going to be employing a lot of this vocabulary especially like the Hebrew word for under is the same Hebrew word for the in the place of Sebring and that's going to be to be in the place of the Bush going to be important in a pram and I also is important because this is an Eden blessing with the the bush and the water in the desert for the non chosen andonios kind of like with the Kings who were with Abraham ya even though Kane was not chosen for blessing but then God said Hey listen like you have a choice have I was just go if you do good there will be exaltation for you to but he did do good hamburger here you have the nachos and brother and they don't do evil instead they're banished and so what they get us the promise of blessing
 dialed and in that place of Exile there's a mini Eden and a blessing before entrance a little he's not going to Desert for garnish mail story Genesis 21 let's move on to the next appearance of trees which is in the very next story that takes place in the same place at the well if so
so we're moving on to the next door here I'll be melick the king who he deceived back here in chapter 20 now comes up to him Abram and here's the story came about at that time to tell you know I'll be melick said we'll also see call the captain is Army was there and he also said to Abraham so you have a king an army Captain Secor Secor it means the word Mouse call is the word everything for an army Captain yeah yeah yeah I am sure it was a great name back then you have the nation's both Kings and warriors coming and sang Elohim is with
 and everything that you're doing so how about us together to wear those to me buy all of them look if you deal falsely with me or with my descendants according to the loyal love I've done to you so you will deal with me and with the land that you're migrating within so when he says basically don't deal falsely with me you don't like you did last week and what did I do to you I showed you love to see you came to my city you lied to me put my whole city in danger but I did right by you so you do the same to me so I will humans with you remember the dream he has a dream Tanya so over him said yeah let's let's go in on this contract so they make contract together know what's interesting is Abram just happen to remember something at that moment that he had a dispute with his Covenant partner on account of a
 water because the Servants of APA milak install the Well from him so sore like a covenant Partners now what about those well that your guys have had with this really is is like a conflict of interest between two business partners and it's like how we're going to get along especially when we're not blood relatives all this binding us together this contract remember the other Canaanites we were in a covenant with Abram up chilling by the trees and you know but now we're exploring the opposite portrait what if there's a conflict between the chosen one in the nation's how are they going to sort this out well I don't know who did this and besides you wait until now to bring this up today so Abraham took sheep and oxen he gave them to Audra melick and they cut a covenant Abraham set up seven Lambs where what is a petticoat
 detoxing oh well to cut a covenant is the most common term to use about the making of a covenant together. So sometimes it would mean the sacrificial ritual of the animals like what happened earlier in the Abraham story when God makes a couple of Dave Amity cut the animals and a half they're going to cut a covenant but then what about to learn what's going to happen seven lambs and Ivy Malik said what's up with the seven lamps and Abraham said well you're going to take these seven lamps from my hand and these seven lambs will be a witness on my behalf that I dug this well he's paying for the well even though it's not as well as well he's a generous moves he's like yeah
 he dug his own oh he says hi Douglas well in verse 34 this reason this is why people call it the well if 7 because the two of them swore a Shibuya there and they cut a covenant at the well as Sheva so many word play is crashing together so Sheva is the Hebrew word for the number 7 but it's spelled the same letters as the Hebrew word shokawah which means oath which is a synonym for Covenant at The Well of seven think of the previous story yeah yeah this is exactly where Hagar found water that provided life for her so these two stories are next to each other about the way God provided life out of death at the well is seven in the desert and then here at the well has 7 instead of Brothers dividing you have the families of the Nations coming together in peace but it requires Abraham to
 give this costly Act of generosity and so the nation's make peace they make a covenant with God's chosen line the story says I'll be mellow at got up and see call captain of his army they returned and so do you know what Abraham did he planted a tree a tree at the well of seven and he called on the name of Yahweh who is the Eternal God so what's great is the whole story builds up the Eaton imagery or rather it waits till the end to place all of this whole scene at the well of 7 buy a tree where he's going to meet with us and worship call on the name of Yahweh so when the nation's make peace with the chosen one when the chosen one will sacrifice and give 7 to enter into a covenant then there's peace in the land at Eton tree images
 Nations I can be blessed through Abraham. What is that thing look like because life is messy steal stuff even unintentionally like this is a story of a guy and I can realize he had done something wrong by Abraham so you're saying this story Abraham giving seven Lambs is the symbol of like going above and beyond to make this relationship right and so we get this cool picture of that and then at the very end of the story were told that I was shown that this is like a neat and picture has Abraham plants a tree there yeah peace among the nation's so that God's chosen ones can really be that blessing to the nation's but it's costly it requires sacrifice it requires generosity and The Binding Together of people at odds in the making of Covenant and then the last little know it is by the way this is Eden like place because of what happened to her
 set another reversal of Eden but it's almost reversing both the failure of Adam and Eve but it's reversing the decision of the brothers story that just happened was about the division of two wives and two brothers at the same place at the same place there Shiva so when there's jealousy and strife liquid Sarah you know drives out the nation's through Ishmael so to speak and then that's kind of sad portrait but God brings life hear there is division among the nation's but Abraham is a costly gift and they make a covenant and then you have peace among the brothers so two contrasting portraits that are ripping off the ideas of the Cain and Abel story about the division of the brothers it's interesting so Aiden is defined as peace between nations and the tree is signifying that or drying in March
 parking at yeah yeah that's right so there you go we had two mothers and two brothers at odds that result in division now we had to tribal Chieftains at odds and they make peace together we're going to revisit now the next story the climactic story about how God is going to cause a division between Father and Son paradoxically in order to redeem both
Genesis 22 story of the the nearest sacrifice of Isaac that's the troubling story in the Bible that God even asks for a sacrifice that God would ask somebody to sacrifice a child and that the right thing to do would be to say okay yeah yeah yeah yeah when you get in those books God speaks through those profits about child sacrifice as something Gus and Jeremiah it's something that never even entered my mind it's so distant anything I would ever ask from somebody but and so you don't you just have to sit and go but wait what about the story cuz he kind of did that you did ask for it once the story Begins by telling you it came about after all these things Delevingne tested Abraham so that does put into the reader's mind already like whatever is about to happen it is a test multiple things you don't know
 what kind of test cuz it could be a test of your loyalty to me by giving up your son by actually sacrificing him could be what it means but it could also mean that it's a test meeting I'm going to tell you to sacrifice him but I really have another plan of how this is going to work out the narrative doesn't close down either possibility you just have to keep reading and it's also may be important keep in mind that not only is this a sacrifice of a human your trial which I mean yeah nuts but this is also a sacrifice of the whole game for Abraham exactly like a little blessing that God has promised to becoming a great family inheriting this land being the one that restores that you didn't blessing to the whole world that's all in the balance yeah that's right and that doesn't have the same angst for me the reader but actually has a ton of gravity in the narrative
 has already said that that blessing would come through Isaac so Abraham's heard that promise from God and intense narrative but we have to read it this is a combination of the story so far it's so you have to read it in light of that God has made very clear promises that's things that he's going to do that this request country that said he's going to bust the nation's through your son but what so the narrative is highlighting this contradiction God seems to be going against God's Own well alright it's almost like God is testing God in terms of the narrative surface it seems like God's going back so what's going to happen and there's nothing for it you just have to let the tension drive you another piece to is you know the whole story has been about promise of a son they got their first son by abusing a slave and then by further abusing sleep by Bay
 that's laid out into the desert so Abraham and Sarah have hurt two people really badly in their quest for a son tried to make it come about through Hagar and Ishmael correct but then also even when they had Isaac they tried to make that promise come about through Isaac by banishing they aren't due amount it's like they are trying with both sons to do it their own way that's right and so it seems to me that is an important part of the reason why God is dealing severely here is because they've been very severe to Abraham my everything in this point like okay I blew it by Disturbed us some kind of thing I don't know if that's what he's thinking but you the reader know that they've been so terrible to be so gyptians that you can begin to understand why God would deal severely with his chosen one for their evil so we're just at the first sentence you know but
 those are some factors that are important here so I'll just kind of summarize God tells Abraham to take your son your only one that's kind of odd cuz it's the only son through Sarah the song that you love you talk and get yourself going to the land of more yeah that's interesting do you remember where Abraham visited when you first went into the way we met was either one letter different both Mora and the land more of those built off of the Hebrew verb to see and make him go up there as a going up offering on one of the mountains that I will say to you with a going up offering o c translated burnt offering but it's called the Ola and it literally means the offering that goes up because of the smoke of it going up going up like the whole offering
 part of it so he has to go to the mountains in the land of more yeah just like he went into the mountains by the tree of more at the beginning cuz if we're wrapping the whole story up here or coming to a climax so there's no Narrative of the internal dialogue he's just we see Abraham Rose early in the morning down does. Took two young men it's hard and he split the word and that word word there's word Apes but the tree for the going up offering and your cousin went to his place so I think maybe in the video about the tree of life we talked at length about the story this is Abraham's tree of testing the wood represents the choices he's making yeah because at trees are moments of testing that only the trees kind of Mark this is an Eden Place but it also is a place to mark that there's an opportunity
 you got choice to be made and you can make a good choice when you can make a bad choice and he is making the choice to even though it seems to go against us going to sacrifice the whole game because it sounds like a contradiction yeah but they're going to fit any point you could be like I think I don't want to follow this guy is a private place and we also know that Abraham is not afraid to stick up to stand up and speak his mind when got that I'm going to need like wait a minute you know there's people there and he doesn't do that here wait a minute you're not the kind of God who asks for the life of kids this narrative so puzzling it's so many ways so they go traveling and on the third day this is the first time that that little formula appears in there
 on the third day and its associated with a testing a test testing narrative that it's all going to be about what happens on this would on the it's ever been lifted his eyes he saw the place from a distance and he tells the young man stay here me and the young boy we will go there we will worship we will return it could be just give them the slip like yeah don't worry nothing weird going to happen we will return to you or maybe he believes that there's no way. It's actually going to make me do this I wonder which one can prove to be true so I took the wood that phrase right there taking from the tree cuz it's the same words take the AIDS he put it on it gets off his son then he took in his hand the fire oh yeah this is good and the helot it's the word food or eating and it's a very odd way
 to describe a knife either in Hebrew if you describe a sword with two edges as a to mouth sword okay cuz it eats flesh to call an ice eater but also he takes from the tree the wood and he takes the eating and Hebrew it's activating the vocabulary of the tree what's the word Hebrew it's from the root eat and when the woman sees that the tree is good for eating and she took from the tree that's the vocabulary being activated right here do we know yet if we're supposed to be saying this is a negative Eden moment if he's taking an eating thread yeah I mean he's doing what God Said So God said to Adam and Eve don't take from the tree and don't eat from it here he told him take your son and offering the sacrifice
 from the tree wood and he takes the heater knife so he's a bang the word of God and the two of them went together as one the two are one that's a very good thing you didn't moment Adam and Eve it sucks said to Abraham hey Dad I'm right here where where's the sheep for the offering Elohim will see to it that word see you again that's the same route letters that appear in the word more yeah the mountains more you will see to it that the sheet for the going up offering in the two went as one so they went to the place Abraham built an altar remember what he did when he first went into the land he built lots of altars he arranged the would he be bound up Itzhak his son in Jewish tradition the story is called the Arcada that's the noun that comes from this Hebrew verb to bind actually forgot the better than the sacrifice of a
 Eliza cassan sacrifice but he is bound bound up Itzhak to Sunny place them on the wood he sent out his hand he took the ether that has the knife to slay his son that is how the Nerdist really slowing down showing each step. Also I'm noticing since we're reading through Leviticus on our own to these Great Lengths to say there's the Altar and then put the wood on the Altar and then to the sacrifice on the wood on the Altar and it's almost exact same vocabulary that you find in the sacrificial descriptions another lens to view this as a case of something truly is a sacrifice and at the moment he's holding the heater his hands holding the food again the word nice here is spelled with the same letters as
 bird food from the tree in Genesis we don't do anything now I know that you fear Elohim number to Adam and Eve's they feared a lame yeah but too late or they didn't fiorella him at the right time at the moment of the test they didn't fear Elohim they desired to be Elohim and hear Abraham the sphere in your life now I know the word no here is also a play on the tree of knowledge that the humans were trying to gain total and now it's God that it's saying he's gaining knowledge knowledge by eating from the tree but now the focus on God's knowledge of Abraham's character because he took the tree and the food that is nice and how do I know that you fear love him you didn't withhold your
 you're my son so that's what's interesting Abram lifted his eyes and he saw through he said God will see to it that there's a sheet for the offering that's what he said they were enlisted his eyes and he saw and look a ram caught in a bramble Bramble Bush and so I went and took the RAM and made it go up as it going up offering in the place of his son remember in the story with Hagar and Ishmael she puts her son tahad the bush under the bus and then his life is saved by the water here and looks and he sees an animal caught in a bush and he takes the RAM and puts it in the place of his son and so I've been called the name of that place y'all way we'll see we'll see to it so this is the mountain of Moria the mountain of seeing
 where you always saw to it then y'all way we'll see and you know still in Jerusalem today we say on the mountain of y'all way it will be seen or it will be seen to this whole story is being told from the perspective of an Israelite way later in their history as a foreshadowing Israelite who lives at a time where the Tabernacle or the temple that's right on the mountain to be always rich is Jerusalem Jerusalem so provided an English translation well that's what it means it will be so it will be seen to it will be taking care of provided us where is the sheet for the offering Abraham says he will see healthy do at Hebrew idiom that we have an idiom in English I'll see to it that's why I use
 interesting there are so many parallels here to Hagar Hagar saying naming God the God who sees and Hagar lifting her eyes and seen just like Abraham lifted his eyes and saw when he was talking in the place of the Bush he provided water and then said I'm going to make him a great nation blessing so hear God provides a substitute for the chosen son in the bus and then that unlocks the blessing again the messenger of y'all at call David a second time saying I swear an oath remember how you and I'll be my lights just for enough to each other now you always says I swear on those because you did this thing you didn't withhold your son I will bless you all multiply your seed like the stars of the sky is like the sand on the sea
 your seed will inherit the gates of their enemies and all the nations of the land will find blessing in your seat so you're the chosen son received the blessing again but it it was all hinging on Abraham's obedience the bus at the wood of dreary and so they get up they leave and then go to the well back to the Williston wow so the main point here is Abraham this is the full inversion of the Eden failure all the language of the tree of testing here gets reversed and when you have someone who will be willing to give up the life of their future family or their own law I mean it's his own future now you're saying give up clinging to making the promise happen on your own for your family that could sound really scary
 yes but letting go of controlling the blessing on your own that's good they were willing Abraham and Sarah were willing to sacrifice the safety and well-being of Hagar and Ishmael abusing them to get them on their own terms and asks them to completely surrender the future blessing of their family over to God in the form of the sacrifice only to receive the back by God's grace with not just a promise a blessing but Covenant host of blessing and so it creates this pattern at work that because humans are so screwed up and they hurt each other so much it seems like the only way forward now is when God's chosen ones are willing to surrender everything over to God and that those are the moments we got Seton blessing can break out over to the nation's powerful story
 the last time the Tree of Life imagery appears is actually in a story about death the last part of Abraham story is a really interesting will section there's a short narrative about the birth of Abraham's niece back in the land that he left a long time ago then there's in contrast to the story of his nieces birth is the story of his wife's death yeah that's Rebecca and Sara born in the next chapter and so he buys a cave in a field with all kinds of trees talk about that but after that story we go back to Rebecca and she makes a journey just like Abraham did she leaves her family and her land to go to the land of Canaan and she receive his Blessing who her name sounds like the word blessing and so there's a whole story and then the next door is Abram marries again and then he dies and he's buried in the same cave so this is all about
 birth and death the passing of one generation the births and marrying of the next-generation so definitely death is both signal here in the double death of Sara the neighbor but then also the new life and blessing is signaled by the person marrying Rebecca and Isaac opens up the door to the Next Generation kind of this last section here but this did this cave a cave and Makela is a long story we don't have time to go through the whole story but you give me short notice to Sarah's death and then there is a long story about Abraham to go shooting the rest of this cable is long like back and forth is this please my Lord listen to me you do not listen it's like listening to hagler's that we're not going to Abraham legitimately
 the nation's want to give this and he says no I'm not going to take it I'm going to buy it fair and square and this is the first and only piece of land in Canaan that Abraham ever purchase Ellen's on purchases so bittersweet because it's for death took place of death docks that it's where he and Sarah die and are buried but it's the first down payment of the promise that the Nations will find blessing when your seed is in this land and they'll be buried there forever if you feel you can go to the city of Hebron today in the West Bank and there's a mosque that commemorates the spot and then there are some centuries-old like buildings and tombs that marks a traditional spot the burial so you can go there and it's really really cool but what I just want to focus on is the paragraph at the end of chapter 23 and what's interesting is that it talks of
 okay so first of all the Cave of machpelah the word cave it's the Hebrew word that comes from the Hebrew word exposure or nakedness a room it's both the word play on a rim to the same letters but it is actually spelled with the letters of the word exposed the even though the cave is the opposite opposite enclosure but it's the words in Hebrew sounds that sound like the word exposure are so it's the nakedness the exposure of the pair is the name of naked pair of the naked pair come on we're better than expose their nakedness was a sign of their Disobedience that led to death this is a
 burial cave man the nakedness of the pair come on so good man just doesn't get any better so Abraham bought this is 417 this it was transferred this field that the longest Efron the Canaanite the steel that was in pair which was facing mom Ray that's where that tree was the trees have Mom write the field and the cave that's in it and all the trees so many trees around the nakedness of the pair that are on the surrounding border it was all transferred to Abraham as a possession in the eyes of the sons of head along with those entering the Gate of the city after this Abraham buried his wife in the nakedness of the field at the pair which was facing mom Ray I just have Ron in the land of Canaan and so it was transferred the field and the cave that was in it to Abraham as a burial plot possession
 from the sounds of it you know Hebron also the root of Hebron is United 2:30 night and in the really unnecessary Leeward e-way right that's my point when usually when that happens it's because there's a literary since I'm at rehab in the future that's trying to draw your attention to something and clearly the emphasis by repetition is associating the nakedness of the pair the Cave the phrase Cave of machpelah means associating it with a field full of trees and it's right next to Mom right well what do I know about Mom write you a little story oh man that's the places to eat in place with a eating spot so essentially Abram is now owned and not just putting up a stent in but now owns and possesses a little Eden but it's a place of death he's burying his wife there
 yes but it's a possession good down payment yeah and the possession is a down payment of and the way God wants to restore the blessing what I like optimistic place to bury a loved one in the place where eternal life is supposed to take Route think of somebody who buys a plot of land cultivate so it gives it over to all of his grandchildren and then is buried there but precisely so that it can be where the next Generations going to flourish so it's place of death but also a place up for life and promised specially if it's a plot of land associated with the promise of Life at the cave being next to the field with the trees and all its repetition of that and next to Mom right next to Mom or a which is the place for early berham met with God under the tree
 under the tree had the feast yes Mega high point of Eden moment let's all bring that together not only that but the nation's coming to an agreement and a moment of Abraham actually inheriting the land in a very tangible way he didn't steal it yeah he didn't fight for it it was like a peaceful negotiation this is the last this is how the Abraham story ends in this cave and then the last part of the story is him dying and then him being buried in the spot in all the same language so even his death has all these little hints that the promise of feeding life through whatever God's going to do in the next Generations stories are so amazing yeah well if you got a couple Hebrew Scholars
 tagging along with you I mean I read these stories you know before and it can become mind-numbing all these random people in random places and then repetition of random details and you just go yeah like I lost a little bored and I'm confused and I know this is supposed to make sense it's supposed to make sense I was to be God's word to me to have this devotional moment but yeah this breeding bobbin community and that's why we're on this journey together. Did you want to do either one more hit then with that they're gone they're buried in the cave of the naked pair so that wraps up this went to school trees and the story of Abraham will move to movement move to the movement 3 of Genesis which is a stye
 Isaac and Jacob mostly about Jacob and we're going to be tracing a new theme to that movement and will introduce that theme and that movement all right thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we begin the third movement of the Genesis scroll in this section we follow the complicated journey of Jake and we traced the theme of the blessing and curse and then as we're going to see if there's three elements in page 1 Genesis where God blesses God bless us three times and each time it is in effective bluffing or it brings into reality the thing that God is saying and so it's performative speech and there's traces of that when we say bless you after you sneeze there's a hope that my word will bring about the help to you instead of the cold the biblical meaning of blessing is performed his speech and when God
 because it brings it out and then when we speak it what we are meaning is that we pray that God will bring a blessing to you today show is produced by Cooper pelts edited by then, and Zac mckinlay the show notes are by Lyndsay Ponder Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus the Bible is beautifully designed literary arts and we're learning to read it through its own structure and to see its own themes you can develop these skills in our new Bible project app it's free on IOS and Android in fact everything we make is free this podcast are videos the app and it's all three because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you all over the world thank you for being a part of this with us this is Maria and I'm from Indonesia I first heard about Bible project earlier this year when I stumbled upon a video on how to read the Bible
