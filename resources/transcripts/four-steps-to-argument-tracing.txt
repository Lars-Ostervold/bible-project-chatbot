Tim Hey everybody. This is Tim at BibleProject, and welcome to the podcast. 
Today we are wrapping up our final conversation in our series about 
how to read the New Testament letters. If this is the first episode you’re 
listening to in the series or on the podcast, welcome. We do recommend 
you go back and check out all the episodes leading up to this one. But 
if you’re just going to dive in first right here, here’s an introduction.
 You’re probably familiar with the letters of the New Testament. They’re 
some of the most well-known books in the Bible and they’re full of 
inspiring one-liners. These are letters that Christians often quote 
just single sentences from. They’re actually are fairly easy to read 
as devotional kind of grab bags where you just read a sentence or a 
paragraph at a time. However, we want to invite people into a more in-
depth and thoughtful way of reading these as whole letters. And part 
of learning how to do that means learning the literary context of any 
given sentence or paragraph in the flow of the letter as a whole.
 So today, we’re going to talk about some of the skills involved with 
following a train of thought from the letters beginning to its end in the New 
Testament. We’re going to give you some tips and skills for how to read the 
letters more effectively, and we’re going to discuss an interesting question 
that comes up between Jon and I about why Paul sounds so aggressive, 
even bombastic, and arrogant sometimes in some sections of his letters. 
 Paul was trained in ancient Greek and Roman style of rhetoric and 
public speaking. So the way that he writes is really different from 
how we might try and develop a line of thought in a modern Western 
context. We’re going to explore things like that, and even more in 
today’s episode. One thing to note is that Jon and I recorded this 
conversation, we were in our office. It’s a little bit different than normal 
but we think it should be fine. Okay, thanks for joining us. Here we go. 4 Steps to Argument Tracing New Testament Letters E9
August 3, 2020, 69.00  
Speakers in the audio file: Jon Collins, Tim Mackie
00:00:00
00:01:00
00:02:00  2Jon So, Tim, we’re recording outside the studio. 
Tim Yes, we are. 
Jon inaudible
Tim Yeah, we did.
Jon So we found this field recorder and we’re just in our office.
Tim We’re in our office sitting next to each other having this conversation.
Jon Staring at the screen.
Tim Yeah, staring at the screen together. We are carrying on our 
conversation about how to read the New Testament letters. We did a 
whole series on the historical background of the letters, learning how 
to dive into that. This conversation is about how to actually read the 
New Testament letters as literary wholes from beginning to end.
Jon You kind of broke my brain talking about these 
letters being written in community. 
Tim Yeah.
Jon But it’s good.
Tim Yeah.
Jon There’s a new appreciation for... 
Tim The letters come from Paul and his team.
Jon And his team. And there’s a pro scribe involved likely. It’s just a new 
category but it’s really helpful for me to imagine that and bring that in to 
what does that mean for this to be God’s Word. It’s easier just imagine God 
zapping a dude who transcribes something straight from the Holy Spirit.
Tim Paul’s meditating and praying and a study alone. 
Jon And he just hears the word of the Lord be like, Put it there.”
Tim Totally.
Jon It makes it feel more complex. But why can’t God work in that way too?
Tim Yeah, He clearly has. We’re imagining all those scenarios from the actual 
data in the letters. That he names co-senders or co-authors, which is not 
standard in 1st century letters. Yeah, there you go. So they’re the product 
of Paul and his missionary teams, and they’re working out the content over 
the course of years. Then, as they travel and they’re on the road and so on. 00:03:00
00:04:0000:02:18  3 Where we’re going to go now is a little more practical in how to, which 
is strategies and tools to actually read the letters and notice stuff, and 
learning how to identify what’s important and things like that. So the first 
type of approach is just to understand the form of 1st century letters. I still 
remember learning how to...be taught how to write a letter. I was given 
a template. You put certain points on the page, the date up in the upper 
left, and a home address, your name. I remember it felt weird to me.
Jon Why did it feel weird?
Tim To put that information up at the upper left and you write your 
name and address. I remember being like, “Isn’t my address 
on the envelope? Why do I need...” Stuff like that. 
Jon Do you ever do that in letters?
Tim Oh, dude, I can’t even remember the last time I wrote a paper letter. 
Jon But have you ever opened up like a Word document and there’s templates?
Tim Yeah, I’ve done those.
Jon There are letter template.
Tim You’re right. I’ve done those.
Jon There’s a business letter template.
Tim Totally. The thing is I don’t create it. I just use a template that’s within page...
Jon But all to say there’s a template for how you write letter 
and there was a template for how you wrote letters.
Tim Template. Yeah, totally. So here we’ll just summarize it in the most basic 
form. It’s pretty intuitive. It’s not rocket science. Ancient letters, in the 
centuries before, especially in around the time of the apostles, the first 
words is your name. And then the receiver. So this is called the opening 
address. You identify yourself, who you’re writing to, and usually use some 
form of the Greek word “charis”, which means “grace” or “favor” to say hello. 
“Grace to you.” “Paul to the church in so and so. Grace to you.” There you go. 
There’s almost always some little line of giving thanks to the gods for what...
Jon After the opening address?
Tim After the opening, there follows the second main part of the form which 
is called the Thanksgiving. You give thanks to the gods. “I hear that 
you’re in good health, I give thanks to the gods.” That kind of thing. 
Then you get the body of the letter, and then you get the closing of 
the letter, which is usually saying hi to people if you want to, travel 00:05:00
00:06:00  4plans, a final prayer for the well-being or health or sometimes the 
praise to the gods, and then whatever, PS (Postscript). So opening...
Jon So opening address, thanksgiving prayer, which is kind of a 
formality of sorts. And then you get into it, “Here’s why I’m 
writing letter,” getting all the content, and then the closing.
Tim That’s right. 
Jon Then what you’ve got here is just a chart of all the New Testament letters 
and how they do this. In the opening here, you’ve got 1, 2 Thessalonians, 
Galatians, 1 Corinthians. You’ve got all the letters. And then you got 
columns. And you fill them out. You got to sender column...
Tim I just copied and pasted the opening paragraph.
Jon Paul’s the sender. And he gives himself a title usually. He 
doesn’t in 1 and 2 Thessalonians. In the next column over you 
called it a description. So in the opening, it’s like, “Here’s who 
I am, and let me describe why it’s important who I am.” 
Tim Yeah, yeah. The most basic form would be “Paul to so and so.” Actually not 
one of his letters begins that way. He almost always adds a description 
of himself. Sometimes short, sometimes long. He often names the group 
that produced the letter. He’ll name people. So that’s the first thing. He 
rarely puts just his name. He usually puts his name and other people’s 
names, and he usually describes himself with long or short descriptions. 
 The basic point is that if you start comparing all the different beginnings 
of the New Testament letters, you’ll notice when Paul or Peter or 
John is taking the existing form and tweaking or adapting it to the 
unique purposes of that letter. That’s the basic idea. There it is.
Jon Cool. So the same thing is true for Thanksgiving. He always has some 
sort of thanksgiving prayer before he gets into the meat of the letter.
Tim Correct.
Jon So feel free to skip that? It’s a formality?
Tim Okay, here’s what’s interesting. From here I found a helpful collection of 
ancient Greek and Roman letters from a collection by a scholar named John 
White called Light from Ancient Letters. And you just read collections of 
ancient letters. I don’t know. Most people probably should not read. In fact, 
I don’t know. I recommend it. Actually, I do recommend it, but it’s like...You 
know. What’s interesting is, one, we noted in our last conversation how long 
the New Testament letters are in comparison to all ancient other letters.00:07:00
00:09:0000:08:00  5Jon Paul writes long letters
Tim Especially Paul and the letter to the Hebrews.
Jon That’s a long one, too. 
Tim They are among the longest letters from the ancient world.
Jon Not like long like, “Oh, yeah, this is one.” It’s like, well, you 
went twice as long as anyone else ever goes.
Tim Twice or three times.
Jon Twice or three times.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. So the Thanksgiving is like this. Usually, 
if you read any ancient letters, it’s like writing, “dear so 
and so,” “Dear Jon,” at the beginning of the letter.
Jon That’s the opening?
Tim Yeah. Like using the word “dear”...
Jon Oh, it’s a formality?
Tim Yes. Do I actually mean you’re so dear to me? No. I 
mean, you are Jon Collins. You are dear to me.
Jon Thank you. 
Tim You’re welcome. But you know what I’m saying
Jon Yeah. 
Tim Like when you write “dear so and so,” it’s just a formality. 
Jon Right.
Tim The Thanksgiving prayer: “Many thanks to the gods that you are healthy 
and well this year. I give thanks to this God because He protected me and 
you.” It’s just what you say. When you read Paul’s letters, he’s taken the 
Thanksgiving and he’s turned it into a whole movement of the letter. 
 Here’s another little fun homework assignment. Go through all of the New 
Testament letters and study the Thanksgiving prayer. What you will find, and 
more often than not, is all of the key themes or vocabulary that is going to be 
developed in the letter is introduced in that opening prayer in a really cool 
way. It shows that Paul especially saw the Thanksgiving prayer, first of all, as 
Jewish, it’s just good biblical style to give thanks to God. And then you fill out 
your thanksgiving to God. It’s like a third of the Psalms in the book of Psalms. 00:10:00  6 So what he’s done is taken the Thanksgiving prayer and 
really filled it out as a communication tool, and to make 
these theologically and poetically quite beautiful. 
Jon So don’t skip it?
Tim Don’t skip it. No, they’re super important.
Jon Looking at your chart, he always has a Thanksgiving 
except for the book of Galatians.
Tim Yes, he’s got no thanks.
Jon He’s not thankful.
Tim No. In the place where you expect him to say “I give thanks to 
God for you,” in Galatians 1:6, he just began, “I am stunned that 
you have so quickly abandoned the good news about Jesus.” 
Jon It’s the opposite of giving thanks.
Tim Yeah, totally. So the absence of thanksgiving in 
the letter to the Galatians sticks out. 
Jon All right. So we got the opening, and then Thanksgiving 
prayer, you could start it all see what Paul’s doing with 
those or whoever is writing it. And then the body.
Tim Then you come to the body, which we’ll talk about in a moment. 
Jon Okay.
Tim Then the final main form or standard convection is the closing, 
which is actually fairly flexible, but it has common elements 
in it. You usually pronounced a peace benediction...
Jon Closing Thanksgiving of sorts. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. But peace be upon you and your so and so, 
peace on you and your animals this year, that kind of thing.
Jon The church would call this the benediction.
Tim The benediction. That’s right. Yeah, that’s right. So what Paul will often do 
is use the word “peace” but in creative ways. Like in Thessalonians he’ll 
say, “May the God of peace bless you and make you holy, faithful as the 
one who called you.” Other times he’ll just say, like the end of the Romans, 
“May the God of peace crush the Satan on your feet.” That kind of thing. 00:12:0000:11:00  7 So with the closing, there’s often a peace benediction. Or sometimes 
he’ll boil what he wants them to do down to a really brief command 
called the final exhortation. There’s usually greetings. “I say hi. 
Say hi to so and so. So and so says hi.” Then sometimes he’ll even 
identify his autograph. Like at the end of Galatians, he says, Look 
what large letters I’m writing with my own hand.” Actually, that 
goes back to our scribe conversation. What Paul’s saying...
Jon He grabs the pen from the scribe. He’s like, “Hey, let me throw in a line.”
Tim You can tell my handwriting because I have large, sloppy letters. That’s 
what he’s saying. Because the scribes trying to maximize space on that.
Jon He’s got small, tight, beautiful letters. Paul comes 
in and he’s like, “ unintelligible .”
Tim “Look at the huge letters of my name.” But the point is, “I’m the 
one writing this to you like this?” Yeah, that’s it. So that’s the kind 
of the closing. So once again, it really pays off to compare the final 
chapters or paragraphs of all the letters. And you’ll notice unique 
things that begin to mark each letter and kind of give you the 
unique profile of each letter. It’s opening and them it’s closing.
 And if you do that for all the letters, you can even start to see 
there are things that will teach you what to look for when you 
turn to the body of the letter. Key words, key ideas. 
Jon Why did he describe himself that way in the opening, and 
why did he pray this specific prayer and Thanksgiving? Why 
was this his finished final exhortations? All those things are 
clues to what he’s doing in the body of the letter?
Tim Correct. That’s right. One of the most helpful ways to study and get 
the main ideas of the letters is not just to follow the train of thought 
in the middle, but actually, pay real close attention to the beginning 
and the end. You’ll notice things that will set you up for success 
reading the body. That’s the basic point. That’s the basic tool. 
Jon Great.
Tim I think we can do that in the video in a pretty short form. 
Jon Yeah.
Tim So that leaves...
Jon In the video, Paul could be opening up like a Word 
document template and filling it out?00:13:00
00:13:22
00:14:00  8Tim Yeah, totally. I feel like this could be real intuitive of just like in every 
culture, people learn how to write a letter in standard ways. Those ways 
existed in the 1st century. And then you could show what’s interesting is 
to watch how the apostles though would adapt, tweak it. You could show 
the standard and then show just the basic point that we just made.
Jon Right. 
Tim Okay, so turning then to the most difficult part of the 
letters then to really make sense of the body. 
New Section
Tim First, a quote from Randolph Richards, who quoted from 
already Paul in 1st century letter writing in his work. He says, 
“Paul’s letters were inordinately long. The typical papyrus letter 
was one papyrus sheet in the approximately 14,000...
Jon Is a papyrus sheets about 8 by 11?
Tim On, I think a bit smaller. I forget off the top of my head.
Jon I just read last week, the Wikipedia page on papyrus because that’s 
the project we’re talking about. And I learned a lot. It’s this plant 
that grows in the flood plains of Egypt. It’s from the stalk of this 
plant. It’s like a shoot. And then you slice that up and then you got 
these thin pieces of strips. And then they put all the strips...
Tim You weave them together.
Jon You weave them together, and maybe smash it, and then they 
maybe even decompose a little bit so that they kind of stick 
together. Then it’s dried out and then even kind of ironed out. 
But you can stitch together as long a sheet as you want.
Tim Correct. That’s right.
Jon So there’s probably some sort of typical sheet slice. 
Tim I bet that’s right. I’m sure it was standardized in the production of them. 
The first time I ever saw one of these it actually wasn’t papyrus. It was 
leather parchment made of animal skin. But the Dead Sea Scrolls. And I 
remember being blown away how tiny they are. They’re not huge. When 
you see pictures of them, these are all magnified. But they’re like this thick.
Jon What?
Tim Yes. 00:16:1400:15:00
00:17:00  9Jon That’s how tall they are?
Tim Yes.
Jon Your hands are about 6 inches?
Tim No, 8 inches
Jon Eight inches?
Tim Yeah, 8 to 12. They’re not big.
Jon Okay. Yeah, I always imagined them like... 
Tim When you see pictures of them, they look huge.
Jon It’s because the handwriting is so small?
Tim Yeah. But they’re tiny and the handwriting is so unbelievably tiny. 
Jon Wow. 
Tim Anyway.
Jon That’s why you need a pro.
Tim You need a pro. It’s about economics too. 
Jon All right.
Tim Okay. We’ve only made it through two sentences. So back to Randy 
Richards. “The typical pirate’s letter was one sheet. In the approximately 
14,000 private letters preserved from Greco Roman antiquity, the 
average length is about 87 words, ranging in length from 18 words 
to 209 words. That’s long. The letters or literary masters like Cicero 
or Seneca were considerably longer. For example, Cicero’s shortest 
letter is 22 words. His longest letter is 2,500 words. “Nonetheless,” 
Richard goes on, “Paul stands apart from them all. Paul, shortest 
letter, Philemon, is 335. His longest letter, Romans, is 7,100 words.”
Jon So the average length of a letter in Greco Roman 
antiquity, which...what’s that? That’s like?
Tim Oh, got it. These are mostly from 3rd century 
BC up to like 1st or 2nd century AD.
Jon Okay. So there’s 14,000 private letters that we have preserved, we 
found. The average length is 87. The longest letter in that collection is 
209. But then Cicero and Seneca, they live in Greco Roman times.
Tim They are, yeah.
Jon Why aren’t their letters part of that collection?00:19:0000:18:00  10Tim Oh, because they are wealthy elite. Their careers are...
Jon They are like professional letter writers.
Tim ...progressed through letter writing. And they were some of the best letter 
writers in the ancient world, which is why their letters have been preserved.
Jon So you take those guys out of there and you’re like, these are the elite 
letter writers.” Cicero’s average letters look like the size of the longest 
letter of any other ancient letters. Seneca’s is like three times that.
Tim Cicero’s average letter is 295 words. Seneca’s average letter, 995 
words. Paul’s average letter, 2,495 words. I mean, like two and a half 
times longer than the longest letter writers of the ancient world. 
Jon Paul has a lot to say.
Tim Paul has a lot to say. That’s the basic point here. The body of Paul’s letters 
are among the longest and have letters preserved from the ancient world. 
Jon That’s really interesting. 
Tim It is. 
Jon We talked about that before. So I’m still trying to figure out like, 
what’s the takeaway from that? I mean, that’s interesting that...
Tim Part of it is that Paul, among all the apostles, as N.T. Wright says, he 
is inventing the concept and the medium of written theology. 
Jon So that’s what I think I mean with pushing communication 
technology. It’s like he’s got...Yeah.
Tim He doesn’t just retell the stories, he doesn’t just quote the poetry 
or makes exhortations, he’s developed a whole new way of 
philosophical theological discourse of thinking through what 
happened in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.
Jon Seneca was doing similar stuff, and in Cicero, right? But he’s like 
taking it to another level. He like found a fourth and fifth gear.
Tim What’s Cicero and Seneca, for the most part, doing is mediating 
the traditions in which they were raised. Oh, and a lot of his 
posturing. A lot of its rhetoric. And it’s just making friends with 
so and so. Career strategy. For Paul, he’ll write something like the 
letter to the Romans to a couple of hundred people in Rome.
Jon Really it’s for everyone. 00:20:00
00:21:00  11Tim Think about the impact of the letter to the Romans throughout history 
and that the original audience is a couple of hundred people. What the 
majority of the letter is his theological reasoning in light of the story of the 
Bible and what happened with Jesus as to why they should unify together. 
So Paul’s got a lot to say because of his unique calling and vocation.
Jon So Seneca didn’t just write letters. He wrote like essays of sorts?
Tim Yeah. Or his letters will have short essays. I’m not an expert. 
Jon There’s 1st century letter writing. Was our 1st century essay writing?
Tim Oh, yeah, sure. That’s often what’s in these letters. This is why in the era of 
letter writing pretty much before email, this is why people preserve famous...
Jon Correspondences.
Tim Yeah, correspondence of famous or influential people is 
because often their letters will have short essays and...
Jon Beautiful thoughts in them.
Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Jon So these are really long bodies of letters.
Tim Yeah, Paul’s letters, especially, but also Hebrews, and to a certain degree, 
1 Peter, they’re pretty long, dense bodies. So there’s two things. One is 
learning how to follow the main themes and the flow of thought through 
a dense body from any time in place. But then second is when you have 
Messianic Jewish authors who are using Greek and Roman rhetorical 
styles to create that flow of thought, then that takes a little bit of adjusting 
too. I think those are just the two basic steps. One is just thinking like, 
“Hey, I’m entering another culture’s way of arguing a point and...
Jon We’ve talked about this before, and like there’s two cultures we have 
to wade through to get to what Paul’s doing. Because he’s thinking in 
Hebrew and Jewish, shaped by Hebrew Bible. But then he’s writing 
in Greek and he’s using Greek rhetorical style and a Greek letter 
template, and we’re reading it in English and thinking in English.
Tim Correct. So as with any part of the Bible, it’s a cross-cultural moment 
to adjust. I’ve totally had this experience myself, and I’ve talked 
with other people, especially Paul, that he comes across pretty 
bombastic sometimes or just very aggressive or assertive. And it’s 
off-putting for a lot of modern Western readers, I have found.
Jon I could have imagined that’s his personality too if you met him.
Tim I think there’s an element of personality...00:23:00
00:24:0000:22:00  12Jon That I might be like, “This guy, he’s very sure of what he believes 
and he talks a lot.” I’m just imagining that’s how I would feel.
Tim Totally. But another part of it too is he was trained in the Greco Roman style 
of giving speeches and trained in rhetoric. If you learn the art of debate 
rhetoric if that’s a part of your training, and it was certainly a part of his 
training and a part of education back then, it was a way of presenting your 
thoughts to a public audience. It was a whole tradition that for the most part, 
Western audiences works totally...we swim in a different river altogether.
Jon I’m sure there’s still part of that in our culture. I mean, 
were you ever part of speech debate team?
Tim Oh, I never was.
Jon Me neither.
Tim But it’s a mode. It’s a mode you enter into. In fact, here’s a quote from 
Jerome Murphy O’Connor. Very helpful. Murphy O’Connor says, “Oratory 
and rhetoric are about the art of persuasion. At all times, and places the 
ability to win others to one’s point of view has been esteemed, and in 
all spheres of life, business, politics, law relationship. In the democratic 
societies of Greece and Rome, success in public life depended on 
eloquence. It was the hallmark of civilization and the characteristic of 
an educated person. And while some were gifted in finding the key to 
an audience’s heart, the majority were not. And so began the project of 
studying and codifying the art of persuasion in Greco Roman education.” 
 This was like a whole field that you’re trained in. It’s the equivalent of, 
I think, what at least the American education systems what I know of 
like math and science now. This was one of the standard tracks. 
Jon Math, science, and rhetoric.
Tim Rhetoric—learning how to articulate your thoughts in a way that 
is winsome, persuasive, and gets things done. It’s an art.
Jon Yes. I took this really interesting class. It was at a community college. 
They took a philosophy class and a speech class, and they combined it.
Tim Oh, interesting. 
Jon So there was the speech teacher there and the philosophy teacher 
there. So half the class was talking philosophy, then the other half 
the class was now we’re going to talk about how we would present 
these ideas to each other. And then you would do speeches of 
different types. It’s all about how do you persuade someone? 00:25:00
00:26:00
00:27:00  13Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Jon How do you give a good presentation? Still super valuable.
Tim Totally. I took my first speech class in college. 
Jon And it still rules the world in terms of career. If you’ve ever 
gone on LinkedIn, it’s just what people are...they’re just talking 
either to the camera or giving little blurbs and trying to...
Tim You could say it’s actually a universal kind of human trait. In a group 
of people that they get together and forms a society, the ability to 
communicate persuasively to get things done is super valuable.
Jon Super valuable.
Tim Some people have innate talent and confidence to be able to do it. But 
nobody can do it perfectly without training. I mean, you have to work at 
it, to practice. In the 1st century, there was a whole system. Actually, a 
lot Aristotle, Plato, all of them have famous essays and tracks on rhetoric 
and persuasion, and so on. The most famous kind of like Godfather who 
codified and wrote the handbook, it’s still a guy named Democritus. 
 But in the Greco Roman tradition, there were three main forms 
that you were trained in. This was actually helpful for me, 
because as I’ve sat with the New Testament letters for many 
years, it’s helped me kind of know what mode they’re in.
 The first is called deliberative, and it’s essentially when you’re persuading 
people to do something. So you’ll use examples from the past, you’ll project 
future outcomes, you’re using reason, but not always logic, and not always 
data. You’re using reason or just persuasion to get people to do something. 
So persuasion mode. Paul is often in this mode. When he’s trying to get 
the Corinthians to stop doing something, he’ll get into persuasion mode. 
 Another is called forensic, which is essentially law 
code. But it’s you get into attack mode.
Jon Dismantling someone’s position?
Tim Yeah. You attack someone’s credibility or the credibility of someone’s case. 
You point out how something that’s crazy, insane, ridiculous, and then you 
establish your own point of view as clearly superior and so on. I find that 
this is the mode that it’s most off-putting to modern Westerners. Unless I 
guess you’ve been in debate class, which I never was in debate. Anyway.
 Then the third is what’s called display rhetoric. This is interesting, 
because in display rhetoric, you’re actually not trying to make any new 
points or ideas. What you’re doing is elevating certain people and values 00:28:00
00:29:00
00:30:00  14and decisions as like, “This is what we’re all about.” You’re celebrating 
certain choices and paths or devaluing others. This is how 1 John works 
completely. In 1 John, there isn’t really anything new. In fact, he says it 
multiple points “You already know everything I’m writing to you.” So you’re 
persuading people and reminding them of what they already think they 
value and you’re just holding it up as like, “Listen, you say you value this.” 
 So these are kind of three modes. All of them are at 
work at different point in the New Testament.
Tim And these are modes that in the ancient Greco Roman world...
Tim People are trained in.
Jon They’re specifically trained in these three modes.
Tim Correct. Deliberative.
Jon Deliberative. I want you to do something, so I’m going to try to convince 
you to do that thing. Forensic is I’m trying to prove a position against 
someone else’s position. So there’s a lot of tearing down the other position.
Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Jon Display rhetoric is just...
Tim You’re reinforcing what you think your audience already believes but you’re 
trying to remind them and reinforce it so that they’ll keep valuing that thing.
Jon This is happening everywhere in culture. Yesterday, the US Senate 
began its impeachment trial. It went like all day. So it was...
Tim And late into the night.
Jon Late in the night. Because I turned it on at night to listen to some of it....
Tim West Coast time.
Jon West Coast time. So it was midnight out there. And as I listened about half 
hour, and it was a lot of forensic rhetoric. It was a lot of like, “Let me explain 
why the other positions is just untenable and ridiculous.” And deliberative 
rhetoric of like, “I want you to now really appreciate my position.”
Tim That’s right.
Jon And it really is all rhetoric. 
Tim Persuasion.
Jon It’s all persuasion.
Tim That’s right.00:31:00
00:32:00  15Jon And they literally are trying to persuade a few people 
to change the way they’re going to vote.
Tim Sitting at the front of the room.
Jon I want to persuade you to change the way you think. 
Tim Totally. Yeah, that’s exactly right. So for sure, Paul’s writing and 
vocabulary display as all the signs of being raised in Jewish 
education system and then in his adult years being formed in some 
way through the Greco Roman education system. When you read 
Seneca’s letters, you feel like Paul and Seneca were buddies. They 
talk like each other in how they make their arguments and points 
and what they’re reflecting is a common educational track.
Jon Seneca was like in this stoke school of thought, right?
Tim Oh, I believe so. To summarize this point about rhetoric, essentially, what the 
body of the letters are is they’re stylized speeches. They’re literary stylized, 
condensed speeches using persuasive, forensic, and display rhetoric and 
different strategies. Here, I’ll let Murphy O’Connor say this again. He said it 
well. First, let me contrast it. I think when I was introduced to the Bible, one 
of the main modes that I was introduced to was the theological handbook 
model, was I’m trying to form my beliefs as a new Christian in my 20s, what 
should I believe? And what should I do? So theological Handbook, where I 
go to certain verses to establish a belief based on the information inaudible . 
 So what this mode is adopting is learning to read the letters as 
communication wholes. And notice that their goal actually isn’t 
just or even primarily to give me information. These letters are 
communication acts between two people, and they’re designed 
to do something. They’re trying to get something done.
Jon Convince me of something.
Tim Yeah. Or to get a certain group of people to actually do something. 
So Murphy O’Connor puts it this way. He says, “Paul never put a pen 
to paper except when it was absolutely imperative. A letter for Paul 
always had a definite goal. He designed it to accomplish something. 
Lacking any mechanism to impose his will, he couldn’t enforce. He was 
inescapably bound persuasion. And in the ancient world, persuasion 
was the staple of the educated who were all trained in rhetoric.”
 So this interesting. Paul forms these communities, but these 
are all voluntary associations. The churches. People can 
leave. So he doesn’t have power over them the way...
Jon Unless they give it to him.00:33:00
00:33:36
00:34:00  16Tim ...the senator would. So what you see Paul doing is trying to 
persuade people to the Christian worldview. So anytime he’s 
communicating theology, it’s always in the service of some goal, 
very practical goal that he’s driving at in the course of the letter.
Jon I think what I hear you saying is, as you’re reading a letter, there is a 
purpose for him writing that letter, it isn’t “I want to give you a bunch 
of theological thoughts for you to dig out at your pleasure.” It’s usually 
something very tangible. “You guys need to stop living in this way. 
Start doing these kind of things.” And all of that’s reinforced through 
rhetoric. And in that rhetoric, he does make theological claims. But 
those theological claims are always serving the other thing. 
Tim That’s right.
Jon So to isolate the theological claim and then build something all 
around it apart from what he’s doing, you can get in trouble.
Tim You can get in trouble. That’s right. We’re kind of back to the first one of 
what you call situational context. What can I learn about the situation he’s 
writing into to understand his goals? Then knowing what his goals are 
will help me read the body of the letter and its flow of thought with more 
precision. Honoring his intent more, basically. So that’s the first basic point. 
They are written speeches designed to accomplish something and they’re 
using rhetoric to do it. That’s one whole thing. We could go much further 
down that rabbit hole, but it’s just a point to make that I found very helpful.
 So that leaves really the most practical work left, which is to 
actually just read and reread and reread the body of the letter, 
and to follow it. I have found four practical steps to be immensely 
helpful. So I think what would be helpful is actually the pick a letter 
for us and for the video. I think the letter to the Ephesians could 
be really helpful. And just to kind of illustrate these steps.
Jon These steps?
Tim Yeah. There we go. Four steps to a better life by 
reading the New Testament letters.
New Section
Tim Step one. Get a sense of the whole body and 
isolate the paragraphs. Main paragraphs.
Jon Now Paul didn’t write or any of these authors didn’t write in paragraphs.
Tim Correct.00:37:0000:35:00
00:36:00
00:37:40  17Jon It would all be just one dense...
Tim Yeah, one dense text.
Jon Maximizing space.
Tim That’s right. So remember they were designed to be listened to. 
So what you’re looking for is cues for transitions between bodies 
of thought. Now, let’s talk about paragraphs for a second.
Tim Okay.
Jon Because I was never really taught what a paragraph is. I think I had to 
intuit it. Even to this day, there’s times when I’m writing something, and 
I’m like, “I’m going to put a paragraph here.” I could also not. I could 
put these two together.” It almost feels like an art, not a science.
Tim It’s totally an art. It’s absolutely an art
Jon What makes a paragraph? And why are we isolating paragraphs?
Tim Oh, yeah, good. So you got the body of the letter. There’s something 
that Paul or Peter wants to accomplish, and they’ve written a movement 
of thought to take me on a journey somewhere. So going next level. 
This is about learning to take my Bible reading to the next level.
Jon Because you could read that. You read the whole body in one go.
Tim In one go.
Jon And most letters you could do that in 15, 20 minutes. 
You can get a sense of what he’s doing. 
Tim Yeah, some main ideas, good one-liners, the basic flow of 
thought. So yeah, this is about taking your Bible reading one step 
further and really making more explicit and tracing and going 
slower to identify each step of where they’ve taken me and what 
each step is actually doing and how it fits into the whole.
Jon Now, a lot of Bibles have tried to do that for you.
Tim They have broken things into paragraphs.
Jon They break into paragraphs, and oftentimes even 
sections. Like, “Here’s a header for you.” 
Tim And often giving them little summary headings that 
are sometimes helpful, sometimes unhelpful.
Jon So most likely in an opening row, you’re going to find that was 
already broken down into paragraphs and main thoughts.00:39:00  18Tim That’s right. They’re usually maybe indent. Different Bibles have different 
conventions for how they marked paragraphs. But what you’ll find in 
the body of letters is that each paragraph will almost always begin 
with what the author intended as a cue, an oral cue. For like Phoebe 
who’s performing the letter to the Romans to a group of people, these 
would be cues that Phoebe would be following as she reads it aloud.
Jon I see. These would be kind of like “therefores”? 
Tim Yeah. I’m going to call a group of words called logical connectors. 
They’re hinge words that transition between a paragraph and a 
new paragraph. So yeah, it can be as simple as “and” but more 
often, words like “therefore”, “for this reason”, “because of this”. So, 
here. Ephesians essentially consists of about 13 large paragraphs, 
and each one of them begins with a line like “For this reason.”
Jon You haven’t defined paragraph yet.
Tim Oh, a paragraph is either one focused movement of thought on a 
specific topic or idea. Or sometimes it will be a paragraph has itself 
a progression of thought within it. But it’s a coherent, complete 
movement of thought signaled by these words called logical 
connectors. So as you go through, what you can often do is trace—
and the translators will usually have done it for you—trace what are 
the paragraphs and identify the logical connector words that are 
the hinges between them. So “for this reason”, “and as for you”...
Jon The logical connective word.
Tim ...”therefore”, “on account of this”, “now then”, “so then”. You get 
the idea. “Finally then”. So visually when you’re reading, this help. 
But this is why listening to something I find sometimes listening 
and reading, and you’ll just start to notice these cues. So the 
first step in tracing the argument and flow of thought...
Jon Would you recommend for someone then to have a Bible that 
doesn’t already do it for you just so you can practice doing it?
Tim You can. Yeah, totally. A practice I’ve been getting into 
in general for study mode is to get a digital Bible, get my 
computer out, and copy and paste to a Word doc... 
Jon With no formatting?
Tim With no formatting. And just start doing the work myself. It forces you 
to slow down, pay attention in a way you wouldn’t normally. These sorts 
of hinge words that summarize or transition paragraphs they really 00:41:00
00:42:0000:40:00  19stick out. Then there are some parts where you realize like, “Oh, the 
translators in my Bible made a decision to make a new paragraph here.
Jon I don’t know if I would have done that.
Tim I maybe wouldn’t have done that. But it gets you 
thinking in a way that you wouldn’t have.
Jon Or maybe I didn’t see something that they saw.
Tim Correct. You know, there’s the difference between sitting down and 
eating a meal that’s been prepared for you and then going back 
in the kitchen and getting the raw ingredients, and then making 
it yourself. It’s been huge for me to just copy and paste.
Jon When you copy and paste from an online Bible, when I’ve done that, it always 
pulls over the verse markers, and oftentimes other footnote notations.
Tim Oh, yeah.
Jon Do you have any way around that?
Tim I don’t know. For study...
Jon Are you doing in Logos? 
Tim I do in Logos. But I’ll just copy and paste usually the New 
American Standard because it’s the most kind of word for word. 
But I try and find a version of copy and paste that doesn’t have 
all the extra. So the first is just isolate the ingredients.
Jon The main paragraphs, the main flow thoughts. One of the authors shift 
from one idea and kind of finish up that idea and then go to the next.
Tim Correct.
Jon And there’s usually a logical connector of sorts. Like, therefore, finally. 
Tim That’s right. 
Jon And that’s a hinge.
Tim Again, they’re designed to be listened to and feel like a short 
speech. So usually, those logical connectors will stick out as 
oral cues to the transition. First, get all the main paragraphs. For 
Romans, it takes a long time. There are so many paragraphs.
Jon But in Ephesians, there’s only 13.
Tim Yeah. There’s a few debatable points, but there’s 13. 
Jon And that’s just for the body or is that for the whole thing?00:43:00
00:44:00  20Tim That’s for the body? 
Jon For the body. Thirteen in the body. 
Tim That’s right. That’s the first step. These steps are cyclical. The more 
you go through them, the more you’ll be like, “Oh, I see. I think that is a 
paragraph” or “I think what I thought was a paragraph is actually two now.”
 Step two. Set each paragraph aside, and you’re going to do individual work 
on it just studying it. So first is pay extra lavish attention to the opening 
paragraph. So very often, and especially Paul, Peter is like this too, the 
opening paragraphs are a little Symphony condensing all of the main...
Kind of like Thanksgiving prayer, but then ratchet it up. Here’s the basic 
thing. Everything that spills out of this is going to be coming back to the 
vocabulary and ideas of that opening movement, opening paragraph.
 For example, if we’re going to go with Ephesians, the opening paragraph of 
Ephesians is so remarkable. It’s a beautiful poem that works in three steps, 
and ends each step with the same phrase, a little refrain, to the praise 
of God’s glory, or to the praise of God’s glorious grace. There are three 
movements. In good Hebrew Bible form, the first and third movements 
are symmetrical in vocabulary. The Trinitarian, where he’s praising the 
Father, and the Messiah, and the Spirit for blessing and choosing us.
 Then in the very center of the opening paragraph, he has this 
key point, which is going to unfold...literally, every paragraph in 
Ephesians is going to unfold something related to the thing at the 
very center of the opening paragraph. Which in Ephesians, Paul 
calls the mysterion. “God has made known to us the mystery.” It 
gets translated mysteries sometimes. I like the translation of Lesslie 
Newbigin. He translates the word “mystery” as the “open secret”. 
Jon Open secret.
Tim Yeah. In English, mystery means something that is still hidden.
Jon Something hidden, yeah.
Tim In Greek, mysterion mean something that was hidden, but now is out. 
Jon But now is available. Do we have another word for that? 
I guess we don’t. If Leslie had a better word.
Tim Yeah. The open secret. So these are the sentences at the center 
of the opening paragraph of Ephesians. “He made known to us 
the open secret of his will, according to this kind intention that he 
purposed in the Messiah. This was in accordance with his purpose 
that he pre-planned in the Messiah for the purpose of arranging 
the fulfillment of the times.” This paragraph is remarkable.00:45:00
00:46:00  21 Clearly, the point is God’s been up to something, a plan, and that plan 
came to its fulfillment. And it’s all been worked out. And what is the 
open secret that has been pre-planned? It’s to head up or summarize. 
We’ll talk about this. To summarize or head up all things in the Messiah, 
things in heaven and things on earth. So it’s all about the heaven and 
earth coming together, becoming one in the Messiah through His 
life, death, resurrection, and ascension to become the cosmic King. 
There it is. I mean, he’s made his main point in the first paragraph. 
 Not all of the opening paragraphs are designed 
quite as exquisitely as Ephesians.
Jon Well, is this likely a prayer or a poem that he had and then go, 
“Oh, that would be great to open the letter with this poem?
Tim It’s a great question. It begins the way a number of Psalms begin 
in the book of Psalms. So he’s written it as a Messianic Jewish 
psalm but it’s so clearly dialed in to the vocabulary and ideas that 
are going to repeat throughout the letter. Even if it had a pre-
existence, he’s adapted it to be the introduction of his letter.
Jon Okay. So we’re in step two, we take one paragraph, and we just...you can 
even break that down. You can see, like, for example, in this first paragraph 
in Ephesians, it’s got a three-part flow. It’s a chasm of sorts. And in the center 
of it, he’s making a point that ends up really summarizing the whole book. 
Tim That’s right. That’s right. And gives you the vocabulary that he’s going to 
work out through the rest of it. Because what he’s going to go on is then 
begin to talk about how God has brought together Israelites and non-
Israelites, the nations together into one body. That’s going to be major theme 
of the letter. Then he’s going to talk about how within just the community 
of Jesus, slave and free, and the poor, and the rich you’ve all been brought 
together into one. Then he’s going to go to the household, the husband 
and wife are brought together as one. The slave and Master are one.
Jon This is heading up all things?
Tim It’s about all things being unified in the Messiah. So he’s introducing 
it here, and then the rest of the letter he’s going to be working out 
how it is exactly that heaven and earth and all things on heaven and 
earth have been made one in the Messiah. That’s the basic idea.
Jon And it is usually the case that his first paragraph does this kind of work.
Tim Yeah. The Thanksgiving and then opening paragraph are often these places 
where he introduces. So what you’re going to do, then, step three, then 00:48:00
00:49:0000:47:00  22is to then go forward. And if you’ve isolated all the paragraphs, you’re just 
going to now kind of work your way through them and just study each one.
Jon So step two is just the first paragraph.
Tim One is isolate all the paragraphs. Step two, give a little extra love 
to the first paragraph because it’s usually very strategic.
Jon Step three is now go through and look at all of them.
Tim Go through and just...and I find over time...
Jon So you just summarize like, “Oh, this paragraph is about 
this,” and try to create your own headers almost.
Tim Yeah, I’ll create my own summaries, identify repeated words. 
So this is where repeated words come in really...
Jon Repeated words within a paragraph?
Tim Studying repeated words within a paragraph. That’s what we’re 
focusing on right now. This is the most intuitive thing. It was one of 
the first skills I learned reading the Bible is learning to pay attention 
to repeated words. Which doesn’t mean the identical word. It can 
be a group of words or related words. This happens a lot in the 
Hebrew Bible. This is what a German scholar Martin Buber called...
we call it in German light word. In English, it means lead word.
 Israelite biblical style of communication and the apostles pick it 
up where they’ll have a word group or a key image that just works 
through the whole paragraph. I find getting colored markers and 
isolating repeated words and ideas, and then you can just see it in 
color. You can just see the flow of thought through the ideas.
 So I have one example. For podcast listeners, this is not 
going to be that helpful. But I just put Romans 8.
Jon And then you highlighted keywords. Would you consider this one paragraph? 
Tim Oh, I just have the whole chapter.
Jon Oh, you have the whole chapter.
Tim Just have the whole chapter here. So forget even the paragraphs 
within the chapter. I’m just paying attention to words.
Jon So you’re doing repeated words across a whole string of paragraphs?
Tim Yeah, within one chapter. That’s right. Totally. I should 
have technically broken into paragraphs.00:51:0000:50:00  23Jon And obviously, there’s no one correct way of doing this. But you’re 
kind of giving a progression. And in your progression, you isolate the 
paragraphs and then you look at just the key words within a paragraph 
first before you start seeing key words that go across paragraphs.
Tim Correct. That’s right.
Jon Okay.
Tim Romans 8 is itself a whole movement that culminates chapters 5 through 
8 and then culminates, and a new movement of the letter begins.
Jon When letters get really long like Romans, you could have paragraphs that 
lead up to the body. It’s almost like you get these new paragraphs that 
lead up to like whole movements and movements that build the body.
Tim That’s right. The main movements of Romans are like 1 through 4, 5 through 
eight, 9 to 11, 12 to 15. Then within each of those, there’s paragraphs and 
subheadings and stuff like that. This is more just an exercise to say, here’s 
Romans, chapter 8.” And you can just see the spirit is through almost the 
entire chapter, in almost all the key important movements of thought.
 This contrast between spirit and flesh goes all the way up through 
verses 1 to 13. Then you don’t see flesh anymore. What you see is 
spirit and family language. So the spirit is dealing with the flesh in 
the first movement. Then the spirit is creating the new family of God: 
children, Father, heirs, children, childbirth, sonship, firstborn. Then the 
whole chapter culminates in this dense repetition of the word “love”. 
The love of Christ, the one who loved us with the love of God.
 Even just like going through and with a marker, and you can just start to see 
big movements of thought of the spirit is dealing with the old humanity, 
creating a new family. And it all culminates in the love of God. And just that 
right there is cool to notice. You can even just see a movement of thought 
by paying attention to the color of your markers and noting repeated words.
Jon It seems like this is the most valuable when you do it across 
paragraphs, so you can see the flow of thought.
Tim If you’re looking at Romans 8:1-13, what you’ll notice is a dense 
repetition of “spirit” and “flesh” and dense repetition of “death” and 
“life” vocabulary. Like right in here, verses 1 through 11, would be like 
a paragraph. Then as you begin verse 12, you get a therefore, new 
paragraph, you get a little spirit and flesh, it’s like a hinge, and then 
he starts moving into the spirit and the new family language.00:53:00
00:54:0000:52:00  24 This would be like one paragraph to study verses 1 through 11, 
and just noticing what’s going on here. Yeah, isolate the next 
one, noticing there. But it’s the same skill set as the do the next 
step, which is start to notice patterns repetition across.
Jon Once you’ve done it, or just individual paragraphs, and 
you can step back and look at the whole thing.
Tim Yeah. And usually, it’s happening simultaneously. So I think visually what 
we can do in the video, I think we can communicate this all pretty simply. 
To say there are ancient style speeches, they have movements of thought, 
broken into paragraphs, indicated by logical connectors. That’s one step.
 Second step is start noticing we can use color or something, repetition of 
words within individual bits, and then how whole themes occur across the 
letters repetition. That’s pretty simple point. But at least for me, it’s taken 
me years of reading and rereading to really get it. Because this is dense. 
Jon Yeah. I mean, once you’ve done this, it’s not like all 
of a sudden, “Oh, it’s all makes sense now.”
Tim Yeah, totally. Sure. There’s still individual bits or paragraphs 
where you’re just like, “How does that fit in?”
New Section
Jon This is step three or this is step four? 
Tim Step three is identify repeated words within individual paragraphs. The 
next part of step three is follow it throughout paragraphs. This is what your 
intuition is. So if you do it through Ephesians, for example, if we wanted 
to do it through Ephesians, it would be about the unity of all things in 
heaven on earth and the Messiah. And then what you would start to pay 
attention to is, okay, this image of many becoming one, things coming 
together, things unify, things coming under the head, the verbiage is to 
head up, is all going to be connected. And so lo and behold, the next 
paragraph culminates with Jesus being made head over all things. 
 Chapter 2 has this long thing about Jew and non-Jew, the two becoming 
one in one body. In chapter 3, it’s about my role as an apostle, that Jews 
and non-Jews are fellow heirs in the same body. Chapter 4 has this long 
bit about how we’re all really different, but we all are part of one body 
with one spirit and one hope. So you can start to see the key vocabulary 
of unity and oneness and body summary. And it’s just like a red thread 
throughout the whole letter from beginning to end. And it was all given 
to you in that first paragraph. Then you notice it in each individual 
paragraph, and then you see it like a thread uniting all the paragraphs.00:55:00
00:56:04
00:57:00  25 So the last step is go back, and you’ve got repeated words in each 
paragraph throughout. Now, come back to those clues that helped 
you identify paragraphs in the first place, those logical connectors, 
and then take them seriously. It’s like a building of an argument.
 So the opening prayer of Ephesians 1:15, “For this reason.” Chapter 
2, verse 1, “And as for you.” Then really allow those to inform the 
logic of how the paragraphs progress as a flow of thought. There 
you go. You feel like you’re being taken on a ride. All of a sudden, 
the role that a paragraph plays within the larger whole, you begin 
to see it more as like a little movement within a big symphony.
 What I have found is as I begin to read the letters as holds this way, the 
old mode of treating these letters as theological dictionary and coming 
to a paragraph and just taking one verse out, it almost feels wrong. 
Because what I’ll be asking is, “No, wait a minute, this paragraph comes 
at this point in the argument. And in light of the whole, it’s making this 
point.” I guess you can quote it out of context and use it to make this 
point. And sometimes you’d be like, “Oh, yeah, that’s what Paul was 
trying to say. That’s a good point. I should build that into my theology.” 
 But it’ll also really help you spot verses that are taken out of context. 
And then you’ll kind of be able to see maybe when there’s some 
verse or some idea that you had that was being built on verse 
being totally taken out of context in the flow of thought.
Jon Here’s what I’ve I find is my experience in the letters. I’m now 
imagining, “Okay, I’m going to do this exercise” is I’m going to get 
to a paragraph and I’m going to get to a sentence in a paragraph. 
And that sentence is just going to confuse me and confound me. 
Tim Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah.
Jon And it’s going to use a word that’s just loaded in my mind, like predestined 
or something. And then I’m going to start thinking about everything I 
think that might mean and I’ll just get stuck there. My intuition is I got 
to solve this, I got to figure out what Paul means here. I guess what I’m 
hearing potentially is some freedom to then not try to solve all the like, 
what does Paul exactly mean by this term? And what is his theology 
behind this and that? It’s to just move on and really try to see what’s 
he doing in this letter and not get tripped up by those questions?
Tim Yeah. But I build lists of those questions.
Jon You start marking those questions. 00:58:00
00:59:00
01:00:00   26Tim Yeah, you start marking them. And then I go back. Sometimes it’s the word 
study. So it’d be like, okay, let’s dive in, create destination vocabulary. So 
you get out of concordance. Where else did Paul use this word? Look 
at all those? Where else is the word used in the New Testament and the 
rest of the Bible? So sometimes a word study will be the next step if it’s a 
word that’s throwing you. If it’s just the sentence doesn’t make any sense 
to me, then you go to your nerd friend, Tim, and say, “Do you have any 
commentary on Ephesians?” And I’ll be like, “Which one?” There you go.
 But if you want to understand these texts, easiest skill set to develop is 
what we just went through. That’s not going to solve everything but it’s 
going to highlight all kinds of things. But my hunch is that you would 
have a sense of “Okay, he’s at this point in the argument and it seems like 
this is what he’s doing. I can see that’s what this paragraph is about...”
Jon Helps me organize what I do and do not understand, or oftentimes I’ll 
come to the part of the letter and it’s just like, “What is he talking about?” 
And I have like a dozen questions. I feel frustrated. But now I have so 
many questions. I don’t even know how to prioritize the questions. If 
I open up someone else’s commentary, they have different questions 
that they’re trying to answer sometimes. Not my questions. So now 
I’ve got their questions and my questions. I just often find myself like, 
“This is too much work.” What I hear this doing is at least it’s helping 
me organize my questions and understand where they fit within the 
whole flow of the body of the letter and get some more shape to it.
Tim Totally. Yeah, that’s right. This is a process that I was introduced to in my 
second class on how to study the Bible. I didn’t even know Greek. And I 
just started doing this in English. Anybody could do this in translation. It’s 
learning how to follow the big picture flow of thought, looking at each 
step of the journey, and beginning to profile each paragraph. Then it 
gives you a place to hang all your questions about each paragraph and 
how it fits in at the words. It brings order to the chaos. Otherwise, you’re 
just like, “What do you do with these huge bodies of these letters?”
Jon What you do is you just find a part of it and read that part, you 
meditate on it and hope that that gives you something.
Tim That’s what most of us do. This is more just kind of “here’s a way 
to take it easy next step.” And that can take you really far. What I 
find then is when I do start using commentaries, I’m coming with 
some insights that I’ve already gained on my own. I’m not a blank 
slate anymore to just take whatever they say at face value. It’s 
that I’m invested. So we haven’t addressed this. This is work. 
Jon It is work.01:01:00 
01:02:00 
01:03:00   27Tim It’s work. It’s work to really understand these letters, and 
internalize what they’re trying to communicate.
New Section 
Tim So another step, which would be like next level would be 
when they quote from the Old Testament, go look it up.
Jon You know what I’m realizing is there’s a couple of things like word 
studies or looking at things in Old Testament. These are almost 
like meta skills that we could add to the how to read the Bible. 
Tim True. Oh, to the series?
Jon To the series. I mean, we did one on design patterns, 
which wasn’t originally on your list.
Tim Correct. It’s true.
Jon So kind of the same thing with word studies that 
kind of get you in the same world.
Tim There is a sense in which I think we could maybe build it into 
this video. I feel like we could do even though it’s taken us a 
while to talk through all of this, I feel like this is all...
Jon Yeah, it’s very visual thing...
Tim It’s visual. We can communicate it pretty simply. We could do a quick 
little...it would just take 30 seconds of like a little bonus. “If you really 
want to supercharge your reading, notice there’s always quoting from 
the first three-quarters of the Bible. Start going and looking that up...
Jon Go look that up
Tim ...and read them in context. And you’ll either be confused like I 
was actually most of the time, or you’ll see cool things. Then the 
second would be word studies, which is essentially a concordance. 
Technically, that could be its own video—how to do word studies.
Jon But looking up, your translation will likely show you when 
there is reference to another part of the Bible.
Tim That’s right. If you’re quoting from another part of the Bible.
Jon And sometimes they quote directly, and sometimes it’s more of a summary.
Tim They’ll paraphrase; they’ll use a couple of words. Yeah, that’s right. 01:04:04
01:05:00  28Jon What I found is most Bibles do a pretty good job of showing you those 
in footnotes. But then what I find is I go look those up and now I’m in 
another text, or I’m even more confused than the text it came from.
Tim Yeah, totally.
Jon So it’s truly like a two unintelligible  level.
Tim That’s right. So this video is about the literary context, reading the letters 
as wholes, crafted written speeches. Notice when they’re tweaking the 
forms, and also learn how to follow and trace the flow of thought through 
repeated words over the course of many paragraphs. There you go. 
Jon That’s a lot of work.
Tim That’s a whole lot of work and potential just right there.

Saavi  Hi, this is Saavi SP and I’m from India. I first heard about the BibleProject 
when I watched one of their videos on YouTube. I use the BibleProject 
for having a better understanding of the Bible. My favorite thing 
about the BibleProject is the wonderful and engaging animation 
and how they break down complex theology into things that I can 01:05:56
