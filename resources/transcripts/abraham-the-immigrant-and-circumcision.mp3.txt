according to the Bible God created Humanity in His image meaning we are meant to reflect his character out into the world and partner with him to rule it on his behalf now to do this humans need to be unified working together for this sacred goal because after all we all come from the same family we are the family of humanity the family of God yet read the first dozen pages of the Bible and you'll find that as Humanity grows its instead full of corruption and violence and division remarkably my page 11 humans come together in unity at not to reflect God's character instead they want to make their own name great this project called Babylon and God ends it by scattering Humanity all over the land he scatters those who try to exalt their own family and list their name up to the skies and this
 brings us to the story of Abraham and so here's a guy who's going to do then be an immigrant wandering into a land go around as a Sojourner in the immigrants there and he this is the one that God want to add salt to a great night and it actually key to the drama of Abraham stories so we read this guy says I'm going to bless you so I can give you a great name a great nation but the last line is the linchpin on which the whole reason for the calling of Abraham hinges does as in you all the families of the ground will find Pleasant there to live with that identity knowing that they have that greatness precisely so that others can become great I'll bless you so that all the other families can discovered less I'm drunk Collins this is Bible project podcast today we look at Abraham the father of many nations the man tasked by God to bring blessing every family honor and all this despite his failures thanks for joining us
all right into your conversation on the family of God theme of family of God in the Bible where is you have called it to the family of humanity in your mind family God's only mayonnaise I think because humans are the image of God to size the same family of God is the family of humanity yes we've been we've been walking through the ideal talk about the ideal of humans being image of God in our diversity which is both male and female but that is also becomes different tribes in different nations and all the diversity that we find in the in the human race is part of what it is to be the image of God we didn't talk a lot about how it is human family gets divided to violence and threw in the Cain and Abel story in the lead
 the flood is about violence and you're violent to someone when you lots of different but it's not a unifying activity correct knows the exact opposite it's dominating or erasing the existence of another person in mind with the whole Tower of Babel Tower of Babylon through the lens of being disliked monoculture I never read the story sure that lends its highlighted with the repetition of the word one in the actual story you have one one language one dialect they want to be one and not scattering go out right where God wants Humanity to be one but to be diverse and the spread out but to remain its unity and its diversity Babylon wanted everyone to kind of be
 in the image of Babylon that's right and be wanted thought one in word and deed and over at the beginning of the biblical story this picture of Babylon as the anti-god unified humanity is sowing the seeds that will blossom in the portrait of Egypt and then I Syria and then Babylon again under Nebuchadnezzar coming and blossoming was the Book of Daniel where he makes a great image the great human image representing his Divine Kingdom that's reaches up to the skies so even though we're in the beginning of the biblical story we have our eyes it's being designed with an eye towards the Babylon that is to come later in the story and the reason that's important is because that later Babylon will be an example of subjugating all the diverse languages and peoples and tribes and Nations into the service of one monoculture that is Babylon this story is designed to show the roots of
 all began right here Genesis 11 not to get too far back but this whole idea that Genesis sets as an ideal of one human family we're getting that all from the image of god poem but then also from the from the commission to multiply to do hair so I can rule correct you put those two together and we need images of God who are diverse but unified now spreading out and multiplying and they are called the image of God that many wood can be just too freaking nipple male and female in the Palm Genesis one or the multiplying Human family you can stay there many images of God but Pullman Genesis one actually calls all of it the image of God human that's a big audacious claim of being one unified Human family and the way that the Bible comes out in a certs it is it could have been more overt
 the telling a story where all the characters in the story and merge from one couple challenges for us today trying to understand and relate that to command his genetic history and all that and so that they'll separate conversation but narratively it's saying the whole Human family is actually unified in with a common origin and identity I guess I'll just take that for granted because of the time and place I've grown up in decided that I could do a lot more homework on this but I know it was an active debate in ancient cultures about what family originated from the gods what family is originated from the dirt was a way that some tribes or nations could assert their superiority over another is to say they were from a different origin then that other group over there here it's interesting what you're saying is
 Bible cares a lot about the unity between different what we call Nations I grew up in Christianity and I was never that was never a thing we talked about world where that didn't need to be asserted it was just assumed well if it was assumed it just wasn't on the radar it wasn't like there's something the Bible cares about who cares about whether or not I'm going to go to heaven whether or not I'm a part of a little part of God's family but this idea of all the nations finding Unity I just don't remember ever talking about yeah I hear that and just so you know that we're not out on the limb here when Paul the Apostle wanted to represent the Jewish Messianic tradition to a bunch of philosophers and Athens Greece he brings up the same point she gives in Athens and Acts chapter 17 and he begins it well he begins bye talking about how I saw a statue this led to an unknown God but
 Begins the story of humanity saying he made from one he made from one every ethnos of humanity to live on the face of the land and there's a debate hear some people think he's talking about Adam and Eve other people think he's talking about Noah because it snowed getting off the boat as a new Adam is the one connected to the tribes in the families in languages and Jen that we read before so I actually think the Noah one is more likely earlier but no is and you have them in the same claims being made from Bell so Paul obviously read his Bible and it was one of the things he saw Bible asserting is he can stay with these philosophers and Athens right and do you like we're brothers we actually are all from the same origin place with Ryan's our Fates are Origins and our future Destiny of all connected well yeah and also just as all the talk of every tribe tongue a nation pops more I took that for granted to it's like why every it felt like
 there's a lot of quality there I guess but I guess you could ask the question why does this face movement this religion whatever you want to call that said that Jesus started why does it care about every single tribe Plantation yeah I got it it's because of this idea of correct biblical style Universal it's the Bible's Way of including All Humans within the scope of its story so even if you know that whatever they are in the ends are only side characters on the actual stage of the Hebrew Bible their story is fully being accounted for here within the biblical story because they're humans and it's a way of the Bible becoming Universal document just why is being raised and translations by people around all around the planet now we find ourselves within its story but it's so easy to not see that as a significant claim
 might just already believed that human families unified that you have to imagine yourself into the time in history where they were competing claims for who were the true the human ones is depending on the context of the conversation I feel like there's one or two of those of substance because either those are taking place because there's some conversations that I have where there's this sense of yeah we're all human while the image of God but then there's other conversations that give her a nationalistic and then forget that and the conversation gets very much about yeah my own country yep you could say the value of our connection as one family of humanity that that value gets put on a lower-tier of importance compared to some other kind of unity of one particular Nation or drive right so neither were humans to but usually the
 nationalism is elevating the particular connection I have to a subset of the Human family right that's the Babylonian impulse to elevate the importance and value of one family over and against other families and the table of nations in Genesis 10 showing the common Unity of the Human family is trying to actively undermine that not devaluing the unique identity of Any Given Nation saying it's not the basis for a value claim over another people okay walk me through that again how is the table of Nations during that by showing that the Human family is one was one know I got off the boat three kids rent out of the three kids come all the different nation and even though remember in Genesis 10 there's a weariness that there are even other nations than just the 79 but it's using the number 7 because it's the one is difficult ways of saying it's complete your whole so by saying we have a common origin and a common identity are fundamental
 identity is shared that's the way of undermining one subset of the family going off and saying that they're the most important and what they have in common is actually more valuable than what everybody hasn't, I'm saying an abstract way I grew up with one sister discovered later I have an amazing half-sister who I got to know in my teenage years but I grew up like my formative years with one you know one sister some people grow up with many siblings it's essentially like let's say you have like four brothers it's too brother breaking off because maybe they were born in August but a different years and then they form like the August human Club is taking some other thing that's part of their identity they're both born in August. The fundamental thing that all four share but is elevating that August identity and saying this is what really makes us human this is the most important thing and then they began.
 press and not invite to soccer games the other brothers who were born in January and October really. I'm trying to make light of actually what's a really horrific pattern in human nature which is to do this kind of stuff here and then kill and hurt other people because of these fabricated value systems sorry I'm going to bring it back to where we where we left off you said something really interesting you just said that there's an Impulse to say my family or my kin are more important than other we're special in some way more than others and on its face you think the reading of Genesis 1 through 11 is saying that is not true at all can't live that way oh I'm saying it's undermining undermining that kind of quiet
 and go where God got calls out on family and Saturday to make you guys special yeah if you're if you're trying to find Unity as a family to elevate one family I totally remember the calling of that one family is a direct response to God's scattering the previous The Babylon project and what God does is he scatters those who try to exalt their own family and list their name up to the skies and then what he does is give a great name to this no-name guy so here's a guy who's going to do then be an immigrant wandering into a land and right go around as a Sojourner in the Immigrant there and he this is the one that God want to exalt to a great name so it's inverting the power games of like a king
 exactly he didn't want the mighty Hunter who founded Babylon what he did with scatter nimrods Kingdom and he exalted the name of nomadic yeah so and this is how God operates in the story The Bible he exalted the proud so that's one thing but your instinct is to say but God is elevating one family but elevating them for what purpose and what goal and that's the key to the drama of Abraham stories so we're at this guy says I'm going to bless you so I can give you a great name a great nation but the last line is the key linchpin on which the whole reason for the calling of Abraham hinges in you all of the families of actually the literally it's in you all the families of the ground will find blessing for the Graham Family remember the word ground is the word
 Mama it was rhymes with Adam Humanity all the families of the family so strategy for restoring the Eden blessing to all the families of humanity is to choose one family I know you could say and Elevate them but what's interesting is that this choosing this election. The election of one family to be a vehicle a blessing to the nation's actually introduces a whole new subplot in the biblical story of all these problems because Abraham it seems starts to come take this for granted and he gets a little get a little careless and he starts hurting a lot of people and it's exploring actually the dynamic from another angle of what happens when one family even God's chosen family begins to think of itself as having the great name what did I do have a great name exactly
 yeah tell us how it works you know it's interesting that God God says I will give you a great name a family and it's just a live out of that greatness without letting that greatness make them feel like other people aren't great enough to live with that identity knowing that they have that greatness precisely so that others can become great right I'll bless you so that all the other families can discover blessing that's the logic yes yeah
this might be I can't tell if this be a side Trail or not but this is the first well no actually it's not the first example of God's choosing one that begins with Adam and Eve got to think of them and placing them in Eden then out of all the corrupt generation of Noah God chooses Noah and his family than hear God chooses the theme of choosing choosing a system of election Simpsons electing a election in Christendom has a lot so the English word election comes from the Greek word eklektos eclectic and then it's the word to choose to select so if you have a lot to select from you have an Eclectic selection or choosing gots to using is a way of referring to this pattern as the design pattern God carries out his purposes by choosing and then working through
 select people were family and all these up to the story of Jesus who was called the elect one Chosen One the New Testament so it presents a challenge for why would God do it this way this is a very unwise not to let it Alexa patriarch from every family okay sure and say hey guys pulling you out let's have a little round up your all my image get with the program go back yet another as we think of we think of God dealing with the whole Human family universally we do you think of God doing with everybody simultaneously at once right after all she'd need just appeared everybody that wants yeah you know the Future King nonsense tell everyone okay so this was a main part of the biblical story that I really wrestle have wrestled with for a long time and there's one theologian
 Theologian actually scholar named Leslie new begin who was the British Theologian who was a missionary in India for most of his career Church Scotland and then he came back to Europe after not living in the UK for decades this was in the mid-twentieth century and so he came back in the post-war era and he didn't recognize the Europe that he came back to it was so fundamentally altered culturally from the left before the war and so he began to write and try and convince people in kind of the established churches in Britain that the church needs to become a missionary to its own home culture the Western culture has shifted so radically in the 20th century that we can't assume that the way we've done church will actually communicate anything at all to people who knew he wrote a book called The Gospel in a pluralist society it was deeply formative and helpful for me and he
 has a way of talking about how to understand God's purpose in choosing to reach the many not by going to the many but by choosing one to reach the many like what's up with this this is kind of an extended quote but it has meant a lot to me over the years he says says we can only understand the biblical view of election if we see it as part of the whole way of understanding human situation that's characteristic of Bible in contrast to both Eastern and the modern Western views there's no attempt in the Bible to see the human person as an autonomous individual so that the human relation with God is the relation of one lone individual to another loan individual and God from its beginning the Bible sees human life in terms of relationship human life is mutual relationship image of God from Genesis one that's the point of that phone the most fundamental being between man
 woman parents and children between families Clans and Nations the Bible speaks of humanity in terms of families of of the earth Genesis 12 verse 3 so the song he says it follows that this Mutual relatedness this dependence upon each other is not merely part of the journey towards the goal of Salvation rather its intrinsic to the goal of Salvation there is and there can be no private salvation of humanity no saving work of God that doesn't involve us with each other. Saving Revelation doesn't come down to a straight from above so to speak in order to receive God's revelation we have to open the door to our neighbor whom God sends as his appointed messenger not a messenger that we can eventually dispense with once we learned what is needed but a fellow human image of God with whom we will together permanently share our home
 I've always felt like there's a lot of wisdom a lot of why is reflection on the Bible in that I think he's really he's getting something about the biblical story seems to me scratching my brain is different ways over the years and these conversations about we wish God would just your smell All Humans a set of like to see you and hug you and headphones that immediately you know I came up with that oh I really thought yeah I mean I kept saying why not and you're like yeah like you and headphone I understand and we can all just put them on here directly from God correct that's what he means when he says in contrast to both Eastern and modern Western views okay cuz in the end both Eastern modern Western views there's this idea that we can all connect to the Divine individually modern Western would be hyper-individualism yes but you started the opposite of that much more Collective
 religious cultures weather in the Wismer Buddhism he's a religious systems that connect people to the Divine individually you might need to be in a community to learn to like my two people to learn how to do it but ultimately the goal of Nirvana is about your individual Transcendence of your identity you actually disconnect correct everything not only disconnect from everyone around you you disconnect from your own self ya say on the Journey of Nirvana I see and so what you saying is the Jewish Christian view it's all about connection is all about relational interrelatedness of families and communities which is why God's salvation can only come to us through others that's his whole point you could say it's a horizontal view of God's that's what's Happening Here In The Blessing of Abraham know why does that follow though I understand the first point that and we could just sit in that point it's beautiful for you
 Bible I don't think I fully understand it actually but the Bible presents us with this ideal of not being individuals we could find Nirvana or salvation or whatever to our own kind of individual Quest but it it's this idea of interconnected relationships which for humans tend to multiply and become families such as human life is mutual relationship the most fundamental being between a man and a woman purse and children families and clans animations eastern and western culture would disagree with that and that's not the part that he's saying it's the biblical story part but what he saying specifically then is about not about how we relate to each other kinds of collectivism or individualism what you saying is about how we relate to the Divine through these relationships
 through these human relationships are not part of the journey to the goal itself so to find heaven on Earth is to be United as human family that is the goal the goal is for a family of people to be the image of God it's actually it's this is another way of saying humans are the way that God is both present in the world and you're the vehicle of his purposes on the world bring it back to the image of God theme that's right God designed us to represent him and to do this as a human family and so if that went awry we're still trying to get back to that idea yeah correct you could unfold this from a different totally different seemingly unrelated part of the Bible the Lord's Prayer the Jesus passed on to us may your kingdom come and met your
 will be done here on the land as it is in Disguise on her says it doesn't happen but that's first half of the prayer the second half of the prayer though goes on to talk about the way is the we will embody and display it manifests God's will through radical trust community of forgive are forgiven and then threw a community that is willing to surrender all in the in the great test you ever test the face and so it's through God's people through humans that God's kingdom and purposes worked out in human story and that's just that the different religious Instinct then as he says both Eastern and modern Western views where we think Universal is Artemis keep playing yeah yeah we're just if God's going to deal with Humanity you should just deal with all of us simultaneously at once
 okay that's what I was going to get to that's why I understand that first part that were one human family that the goal is Unity as as humans Imaging God but then why does the next follow which is so the way that God deals with us is it all at once individually but through these relationships couldn't you still decide he even though that's the end goal I'm going to tap you on the shoulder separately and whisper in your ear and goal is to love your neighbor and be unified sure yeah I hear that that that isn't the pattern of how the god of the Bible works it isn't and I guess that's all we're after here cuz we're trying to understand the depiction of God's purposes within the the Jewish Christian Store found in the Bible is not that he has to do it that way it but that it follows logically that he would use that as his that's my strategy if the end goal is that
 huge liabilities with the strategy of gods because humans can be really poor images and misrepresent him and not carry forward the purpose to bless but carry forward violence and curse in death and that's in fact of one way of thinking about whole point of the Abraham narratives to explore how the family called the vehicles. Blessing ends up bringing as much curse and Death on the people around them as they do blessing and welcome to the Arab store
so I'll just stay in summary form then will drop into a couple narrative to explore it God called Abraham his family to be as a vehicle of divine blessing to the world it's going to happen through Abraham journey to this place has never been to before and then trusting the God will give you in his wife so I'm the first story after Abraham goes into the land in Genesis 12 verse 10 and he sets up camp there and then we're told that there was a food shortage in the land it's not awesome it's not it's funny it's one of those things that that would have been such a universally understood pain right side was experienced that yeah that's right but here I am nothing to me liver of privileged sliver of humanity that to him
 this happens where there is just growing conditions changed and there's not food not fit now he's in the land where God said I'm going to bless you and he looks around and he's like and where is that what so what he does just leave the land he probably leave the land the first story about Abraham after entering in the lens setting up camp and getting the Divine promises is to leave the land somebody that says yes as part of the verse yes you just leave right away you went down to Egypt down there and he wasn't asking for their blessing down there maybe so it came about when he came near the entering a job that he said to Sarah his wife I'm look please I know that you are a woman beautiful to look at literally beautiful of seeing and when the Egyptians see you they will say this
 is that guy's wife and they will kill me they will keep you alive so all of a sudden us to things here what did God just say to him I'll bless those who bless you whoever despises you or treats you is cursed I will curse God told Abraham uncertain terms you don't be afraid I have you back and I'm with you and the first thing he does is leave the land got told him to go to and then tries to protect his self try to protect himself cuz his wife is beautiful and how he comes up with a lie at Deception to save his own life they will kill me and let you live so he says please say that you are my sister and there will be good for me on account of you that I may have life on account of you say Abraham is trying to get goodness at his wife's expense by the lying and deceiving another sure we're so yes and we're so in the rain
 all of Genesis 3 about truth vs deception about what God said he would do and now I'm not trusting what God said he would do or wondering if that's really how it works and so there's this alternate plan and the vocabulary you're a woman is beautiful of seeing just like the woman saw that the tree was good so this is about a human trying to find life and goodness through lies and deceptions owns games because they don't trust God we've been here before in the biblical story where only on page twelve of the Bible and we've already been here before and this is the first kind of real Narrative of Abraham other than him going to the land after here and got the call is not very flattering portrait so it came about when neighbor went down to Egypt this is also the first time that a broom is interacting with people of another family so we're at we're thinking is a room going to be a vehicle of God blessing
 presentation is going to go down to where you went down to the Egyptians saw that the woman was beautiful and the officials of pharaoh saw her and praised her to pharaoh and the woman was taken they saw that she was beautiful and they took her and he did good to Abraham on account of her in fact for Abraham there was sheep and oxen and donkeys and male servants and Egyptian female servants that's important and female donkeys and camels you think it's a bunch of gifts gets a bunch of gifts Egyptian swag yeah yeah nothing fact again member got to promise what was God's promise great name great nation kids he just gave away is his wife so not only is he trying to get blessing and security for himself he's safe but now he does know his family what you guys said he's going to bless you just put the promise in the Jeopardy you just right
 how to drive the wife with whom he's going to have the kids that will become a great nation so this is not a flattering portrait of Abraham that keeps getting worse so here's what's fascinating for 7 so yeah we sent plagues upon pharaoh and he sent plagues upon his house great plagues on account of Sarah Abrams wife without on their legs yeah sent to Bonne Terre right this is a design pattern to connect to the Future Pharaoh right that was going to ask yeah God sending plagues on Egypt has already happened in Europe in the biblical story but that story was Moses it happens because of Sarah's deception here it's happening because of deception right yeah I didn't really do anything wrong and hit and then his world view take wives
 yeah but little did you know that that God said those who curse you I will curse and yes this is not well for Abraham so many layers to the story because God is defending his man who is a liar and God is punishing because of his verbal promise to the guilty
 do a liar that makes sense God promised has now put him in a very difficult situation cuz he has to defend a liar not because a Liars worth defending but because God promised to promised to this guy that this what I was talking about the liability in the very first story in the very first story is is showing how humans are not reliable people forgot to ask but yet God won't give up this strategy of carrying out his purposes through humans that's what gets got into the situation Canada yeah there for ya what the story is Raising is the liability of election choosing one family to be as vehicle that's huge liability there and this the first story of the first chosen by ancestor of Israel is putting it front and center how much is always found the story fascinating
 but you liabilities first liability is just partnering with humans for us to be God's image the first place big liability and then the next liability is trying to use humans to rectify the situation so this moral contradiction that God has placed them but committed himself to a liar this is a team that's going to keep working cuz he's going to keep bailing this family out of trouble off himself made trouble and protecting them even though they don't deserve protection I always read the story that Pharaoh must have done something wrong no it's very clear it's very quick in fact the second time Abram does the same exact thing a guy named abimelech abimelech speak up to God I'm just dealing with my dude Abram here working with this guy and sometimes he delivers
 call they broom it says what is this that you've done to me that's exactly what God Said to the humans in the Garden of Eden why didn't you tell me she was your wife why did you say she's my sister so that I took her for my wife now then here's your wife take her and go and Farrell commanded his men and they sent him away with his wife and all of that stuff that he got which includes some female Egyptian slaves were going to play an important role in the story of Allah ya all the story of one of the Egyptian slaves is the next Man story where Evan plus it as God's dick all black
 so Genesis 16 is the famine represented a threat or a a challenge to Abraham's face that the land would give his Blessing right now Abraham and Sarah's inability to have kids and years are going by is about their trust in God's promise to provide zero family the great nation even just one son or daughter at least one suggests the 16 opens with Sarah Abraham's wife had borne him no children but she did have an Egyptian slave whose name was the Immigrant we talked about this for Hagar is the exact word The Immigrant Hebrew Hebrew it means the Immigrant The Immigrant has prevented me from bearing children please go into my slave to go into me and he brought him one of the men here are idioms for go into my life perhaps I will be built
 through her like my family line will be the last time the word was used was described the building of the woman for Adam when he sleeps not building of the babbel or the I think it's a hyperlink back to the god providing and other room the family come up on another reason is because of the next line is also a hyperlink to the Eden story and Abraham listen to the voice of Sarah exactly what Adam Dusty is at the base of the tree he listened to the voice of his mind with these Genesis 3 Eden hyperlinks it's replaying this as another, that sex against a tree of testing so after they born live 10 years and land of Canaan so 10 years they've been waiting and no kids Abraham's wife took hug are the Egyptian her slave and she gave her that's Genesis 3 the woman took and she gave 2
 her husband Abram as his wife so that's good take metre of knowing Good Neighbor went into her car and she conceived and she saw that she conceived and so in her eyes that is in Hagar size Sarah was cursed another words Hagar now sees that she has a place of privilege to the mom she's the First mom in this in the family yeah the Immigrant The Immigrant you know who was the object of now Abrams sexual pleasure now asserts her roll and try to dominate over Sarah to say that Sarah I became cursed or despised in the eyes of Hagar Hagar doing now to Sarah are now
 has been doing Hagar Hagar as the victim of their their evil but in the same moment she tries to assert her dominance over there at the Sarah said they met the wrong done to me be upon you a bro I gave my slave into your hands think the in story I gave it into your hands but she saw is that means it's where the woman sees and she takes her husband but she saw that she conceived and I became cursed in her eyes may the lord judge between you and me and then here's Abrams response look your slave is in your hand do what is good in your eyes and so Sarah oppressed Hagar and Hagar fled from her presents humans man do what is good in your eyes and so Sarah I pressed her yep press the Immigrant long before the Egyptians ever oppressed that Israelite slaves
 Israelites were repressing their Egyptian slaves that's what's happening in the story the story is all that coming off of the Eden story they're replaying the sin of Adam and Eve what God promised I try to tame it on their own terms correct and it's exactly what I was just doing in Egypt that's how they got in the first place so I promised to protect them took into his own hands yeah hung his wife out to dry it ends up hurting her putting her in Jeopardy and hurting a lot of the gyptians now they're trying to get their own blessing of a child to their plan and they heard the Egyptians life in the process so what happens is Hagar has a son Abraham's first born son Ishmael and so now you have this challenge because God says God said to Abraham will one who comes from you your lineage will be the promised one Ishmael is born and it turns out that he will not be that Chosen One
 God reiterates actually here in chapter 17 is right after the story of Hagar and Abraham was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said I am El Shaddai God the mighty one walk before me and be blameless for going to say stop it stop it stop it I'm going to establish my Covenant between me and you and I will multiply you very much this is Genesis 1 be fruitful and multiply Abraham's fell in his face and God talked with him we talked about this passage this actually really important for the theme of the family of God for good luck my Covenant with you and you will be the father of a multitude of Nations and that Hebrew word multitude is Jamon hum h a m is how we represent so your name will no longer be of rum but raham repeats for I will make you the father
 Jamon of nation somehow what follows from them a pressing an Egyptian god that was down on his yes that's interesting not only will even become the vehicle a blessing to many nations now he's going to become the father of many nations we knew that he was going to become a great nation Nations nuggets and right now I got you yourself will become a father of many of a multitude of Nations I will make you exceedingly fruitful I will make nations of you Kings will come forth from you well. Wish my Covenant with me and you and your seed after you for many generations and Everlasting Covenant step forward their oh okay so it's happening because now he's going to have his two sons that are two different nation has two sons in the sun's that they just had from their own scheme is not going to be God
 promise on this happens after they have Isaac or this happened before either before Isaac will get there ask for you if I just told you about my Covenant to you here is how you will keep my Covenant you your seat after you here's my Covenant you'll keep between you and your seed every male among you shall be circumsized and you will be circumcised In the Flesh of your foreskin this will be the sign of the Covenant between me and you ever email among you eight days old will be circumcised throughout your Generations attention any slave born in your house anyone bought with money from a foreigner who doesn't belong to your seed any servant in your house they should be circumsised this will be my Covenant in your flesh for an Everlasting Covenant this is the entry of circumcision in to the right and somehow it's connected
 to this circumcision isn't just for a problem with the Sun that we have it's for anybody who's not even from his online can join in the Covenant and become a part of the Covenant family Covenant family doesn't really depend on blood hear the entry into the family is to circumcision because the first thing Abrams going to do after this is go circumcised Ishmael after the story's over at work with the women so everything I'm about to say the insightful it's a circumcision I've learned to Hebrew Bible scholar Jacob Stromberg and David Andrew Teeter so this is the second time that God chooses one among the many and makes a covenant with them and establishes a sign of the Covenant set design pattern right after I got off the boat signs the rainbow sign of the rainbow in the Book of Genesis
 going to be the father of many nations just like know us and after something terrible that happened God's response is to double down on his Covenant promise to his chosen one and then there's some symbol and then call the Rainbow of the Covenant you're saying both stories have all these what's the goal the goal is compare and contrast and they become commentaries on each other about the first sign of the Covenant what did humans do while they ruined the land with Bloodshed so what was God's response to allow the cosmos to collapse right to remove the creation remove is ordering power and let the waters above call Kathy Griffin but then God by his Mercy chose one and threw that one re-establish to Genesis one order and made them the seed of
 Old Navy humanity and you know it's interesting as you even showed the logic of the story is really funny because my merchandise story where God he says I'm never going to do this again because humans are evil which is why God did in the so what was the vehicle of God's judgment the rain Waters Waters what is the symbol of God's covenant that you won't ever do that again the rainbow and it is specifically says when a cloud Up the Sky with clouds the rainbow will be seen because they knew the rainbow is associated with us with the rain the rain so it is actually just real time this is what all 2020 we just had a major thunderstorm come through Portland area very rare around hung around a park where am I
 for school this is massive tree with split half so when rain storms come what they do is remind you of the power of the storms to rip apart creation it's normal put fear God yes but then you see a rainbow and rainbow is the symbol of beauty against the Dark Cloud sky that could rip your trees apartment is the rainbow is this site isn't God says that's a sign of the Covenant it's both a symbol of judgment and mercy because the storm clouds have to be present for the rainbow to appear strong clouds judgment in flood story but the rainbows this beautiful promise that God will bring New Creation somehow out of this whole mess so that's the analogous story
 sign of the Covenant cutting off part of Abraham's penis symbol of the Covenant that God makes right after he used his penis to oppress the Egyptian immigrant what Abraham and Sarah I did to the immigrants becomes analogous to what humans were doing to each other before leading up to the flood okay and so in the flood God cuts off Humanity from the face of the Earth is the actual word cutoff who interesting use all over the foot story and right here what's happening is a part of the part of Abraham's body through which he wronged the Egyptian immigrant is now being cut off and that's a stick a sign of the Covenant but simultaneously that's what you would say that the act of judgment cutting off and you buy something off your body very unpleasant but at the same time it's marking
 very part of the body of Abrams body that contains the future promise of the seed so it's very much like that rainbow it's both a sign of divine judgment and hope Future Hope and Mercy. Mercy in the same simple right why else are these two stories being connected together with supposed to ponder the meaning of the rainbow and the meaning of telling off this flesh from a man's body what's analogous to the flood that in the story well the flood the rain waters are the way that God cuts off life from the land in the vocabulary Inside Story here it's a knife that cuts off flesh from part of Abraham's body but that same part of his body that is cut off is the source of life in Future Hope just like the rains can be a sign of seedtime and harvest like is what happens after
 my whole point is that this story is purposely placed right after the story of Abraham and Hagar and circumcision in the sign of the Covenant is happening to the very part of his body that he just used to secure his own future by his own plans with Sarah and abusing and that's the very part of the body here and so it says if God saying listen that part of your body is mine marked the future of your family depends on me and my promises it's a way of surrendering Abraham's genitals over to God right which is a represent the future of his family threat which represents everything for him correct and it back to the snake Crusher it represents everything Messianic city of where the seed will come from God is marking that okay so here's what's what's interesting is that here circumcision is introduced as this Rich dense sign of judgment and mercy but it's for
 everybody who isn't from your seed to be included into the Covenant of circumcision is the way that the nation's can be included into a cup of God's covenant with Abraham being included in the Covenant is separate from being included in the blessing right interesting so God's chosen one actual lineage in the story to be the vehicle of his blood forgot the goal is to bless many and so is this image of God wanting to include others within the family of blessing and to be in there you actually don't have to be part of the lineage you here I'll be in through this symbolic sign the sign yeah and so that's exactly what it's going to happen at the end of the story okay no actually we're not done reading but that's circumcision
 yeah. Goes on to say one more thing it's important to keep on yes keep going
after that God says to Abram Sarah your wife is first 15 don't call her name Sarah anymore she gets a name change its symmetry around the circumcision just Abraham being named here and then circumcision and then this will speak about Sarah and matches the speech about every don't call her name Sarah anymore call her Sarah will be her name which means Queen I will bless her and did I will give you a son through her then I will bless her she will be the mother of Nations Kings of people will come from her and fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart o a child will be born to a man a hundred years old and Sarah who is 90 years old will bear a child Abrams sent to God listen Schmale you said oh the Ishmael might live before you as my first born
 what what's wrong with this mail but God said no Sarah your wife will bear a son and you should call his name after you suck because he was laughing yeah I will establish my Covenant with him as an eternal Covenant with his Seed Dentistry ishmael's I hear you I will bless him I will make him fruitful and multiply he will become the father of 12 princess and I will make him a great nation this is really so first of all what God saying is the child that you produced through your oppressive scheme that's not how I operate. Says if I were to endorse and validate that lineage that would be an endorsement on what they did so what I'm going to do is do this miracle child thing so that you can't attribute any greatness to yourself yeah this is the same with Babylon got choosing to No Name
 it's absurd we're going to call him after but then look at what happened so so you might think okay so bummer for Hagar and Ishmael that the oppressed or going to get left by the site and What God Says is no I'm going to make them a pre Israelite Israel so just because I'm going to make them fruitful and multiply they'll be a new humanity and he'll become a father of 12 which is with Jacob will become who's named Israel I'll make him a great nation so you have this idea but the Seed of Abraham that's not through Isaac is still gets in on the blessing the family of Abraham was always meant to be bigger than just the lineage that goes through Isaac even though the lineage through Isaac is the vehicle of the Covenant and the blessing that was never to the exclusion of the others it was always meant to be the father of many nations so this chapter so important for understanding the Biblical story and then especially important
 first and Paul is this the story of super important prop all understood his mission to the nation's tell me what your processing you staring blankly at Genesis 17 is like me on here so I think this try to summarize what I heard you saying is he at yes God called one family elected them to be a vehicle for the blessing and that creates all these problems that's one kind of thread to this thing but even though that's a strategy we can't lose sight of the goal which is a blessing to all the nations and you seeing the Spilled Out in a number of ways one is that you see that when God gives Abraham the sign of circumcision it's not just for him and his kids and their kids it's for anyone wants to be part of this thing immigrants yes slaves yep just come on in and just take the sign doesn't matter if you're part of this or not
 CC it spill out in that way but then you also see God's desire to bless everyone with what he does kind of the the solution to Abraham's oppression and creation of this now unwanted son Ishmael I mean Abraham way to say I'm going to make sure he's hooked up and he even uses the same language of his promise to Abraham promise to Abraham and even uses the 12 yeah which is the thing where we know in the story is the 12 tribes of Israel that are going to come through Abraham's third generation or 4th generation and so all of that is screaming that yes God cares about you and elected you but the end goal is it is for everyone is for a multitude of Nations a multitude
 it's actually through Abraham and Sarah's sin so to speak that he becomes the father of a multitude of Nations they send against Hagar and didn't trust in God that results in the birth of Ishmael but then God responds to their Evil by turning it into good by now there's going to be a whole multitude of Nations that God is going to bless and work with its the motif of Genesis with humans do evil God responds by doing good when you say those are going to be more Nations to God works with you mean more like covenants like Abraham well I'm just following the narrative logic in chapter 16 they do wrong that wrong results in the birth of a son and then what God says is you know what that Sun is going to get in on your blessing don't worry I'm not going to make him the vehicle of the Covenant but that he's going to be get in on your blessing and he's going to go on to become a great nation that is one of those multitude of Nations that's
 part of the family is Abraham 5c but you're saying yeah look at this family of God the God's Building through Abraham is not identical with the family of Israel The Chosen elect family that God is paring down through one of Abraham's sons that that is Isaac but the god selecting and choosing that one is precisely so that threw that Covenant God's blessing can go out to the many stories so Abraham's family is both he's becoming father of a multitude of Nations but he's also becoming a family of divided Nations because the ishmaelites are not going to live peaceably with the descendants of Isaac there because of the descendants of Ishmael become which stations but this is the first this follows just like the
 Shem ham and japheth from Noah that resulted in three sons and they're all going to go be at odds with each other throughout the red store right now Abram has two sons and their descendants are going to be at odds with each other through the rest of the biblical story and this is actually important pattern that this furthering the storyline of the divided Human family but now it's been invited Human family happening through the one that God chose the unified given family options which is a bummer but maybe God can still be good even though the fact that his chosen one does he takes listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to continue the series on the family of God and here is Abram finally dying and he has become a father of many nations and they all hate each other is it down there you really like man that did not go well this is a very realistic depiction of the human story estranged
