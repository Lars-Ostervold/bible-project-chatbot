say we continue exploring the theme of the city now in the Bible the ideal location for human existence is not a city if it started and the introduction of the city in the Bible is actually a tragedy the city was this thing that is introduced as the sad result of humans exiled from Eden and their violent nature so you need walls now so you would think the story of the Bible is all about getting rid of our City's getting rid of the walls that protect us but ends in a New Garden City and in this new city they're still walls there although their decommissioned and made of jewels it's a strange detail why have the walls at all even in this new form the walls are kind of like the nail holes in Jesus's hand if it were there signs of something that was terribly wrong there Scar left from what humans have done to each other but God doesn't erase
 then he incorporates them into and heals and transforms them into the resurrected world we want to build cities to protect ourselves to deliver ourselves but cities weren't the first thing built to protect humans today's episode will look at the first thing built to protect Adam it's built by God when he split them into and builds and either here is a human in a place of vulnerability and with an obstacle they can't do what God has called to him and to do so God provides an Acer at delivering Outline by building for the vulnerable human god build the delivering help in the form of a woman this story is meant to be a meditation on the story of Cain when paying bill the city the phrase looks exactly like the Hebrew phrase god build Nether building his own Deliverance the woman is what God provides for the Salvation and the
 prince of the loan human and the city is what came build to provide his own deliverance from Death first efforts to build human security were actually a sad rejection of God's offer to provide what you meant.
 play Tim Mackie and I talked about the first city in the Bible I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 Item John hi we are talking about cities in the Bible we're doing a theme on cities which means that a city is not merely setting in the Bible but it does a lot more work than that yeah it's definitely a kind of place with a feel and lots of meaning attached that doesn't overlap entirely with our modern experience of cities some of the test but a lot of it doesn't and so maybe we only had one conversation but kind of a couple takeaways I'm back to it bring us up to speed is one what we were started calling the surprise of the city which is the store the Bible doesn't begin in the city begins in the garden and when cities are introduced there a problem they're both the result of a problem and then a further generator of the problem violence and they become the place where
 arrogance and violence mankind just comes to like a film it and then away so you kind of imagined then reading the story The Bible the Plex the city is a problem and whenever I get a glimpse of what it could have been or what we should have for what we could go back to its Garden imagery and doesn't make you think of like okay cool let's go build some cities or is it the future will involve cities because it's for call the Hebrew word City and the fundamental concept of the city in the culture and Times of the Bible is a fortified walled enclosure that keeps you safe from all the humans who want to kill you up outside those W yeah that's about security security in a dangerous world so the surprise is that you begin to get
 glimpses read Psalm 46 and there's this is Heaven is a city of God the city that that's so high and so remove it so different then a normal City that while all of the land could just fall apart and some chaotic apocalyptic like end-of-the-world scenario Mountain slipping into the sea the sea covering the land of talking about the creation this city will City and then Isaiah talks about Nation streaming to the city and for there to be some sort of new sense of Peace amongst all the people of the world Zakaria talks about it as a city that doesn't need physical walls because Yahweh fiery glory is the wall but instead of keeping
 everybody out it's actually going to attract all the nations who going to come become one with the people of Yahweh God will be in their midst season are the walls become a signal for the Nations to come on John Wright's the Revelation he has a vision of new creation and its fulfillment these ideas at Isaiah and Zachariah are riffing on and saw him as he sees a shining like a gem of a city descending from the skies uniting with the land and like a bride about to get married coming down and you said that's going to be an important little piece in this conversation this course which will affect your big-time cool be a bride and the gates of the city are always open and never closed in the nation's come in and they bring all their honor and knows this kind of uniting of humanity not in a way that like now
 everyone lives in this one city sound like the city where the world lives but it's a hub of Refuge the way we wanted cities to be but actualizing see what we want it which is a place that keeps us safe and at peace yeah that's right so what we call the surprise of the city was this thing that is introduced as the sad result of humans exiled from Eden and their violent nature so you need walls now so you need City's walls but then the city's as you say become incubators if he's more violence in danger
 surprises that God doesn't just do away with that and go back to appear the garden ideal God incorporates the pain and tragedy of the human story and heals it and that it's now incorporated into the part of the future of God in humans in the world so the city's play a key role in the imagery of the new creation it's garden and City that's one
 and the one thing that makes the city sad the walls to me about people who want to kill you that's the thing that gets completely changed because the gates are always open or you just don't need them what Revelation they're there but they're like they become a crown they become like an art and the gates are never closed means the walls don't serve that function anymore the walls serve some other function and they're not needed and that's the surprise of the city it's the beautiful art of the storyline of the Bible it's like in a way this is purely like how I would think of sermon illustrations back when I used to preach a lot but the walls are kind of like the nail holes in Jesus hand if it were there signs of something that was terribly wrong and real pain there scar
 right left from what human have done to each other but God doesn't erase them he incorporates them into and heals and transforms them into the resurrected world one way to think about the surprise and City and we don't wall or cities we can't know but we do all our little properties but that's more of a privacy that's not for security
 it's all know it depends it depends okay oh yeah and if I'd grown up in Portland never lived anywhere else when I was in my mid-twenties Jessica and I moved to Wisconsin for graduate school in Madison Wisconsin and we lived in mostly Apartments but we noticed was even the property of like the apartment complex would have no fence for the neighboring houses next door and then as we got to know people and went over to their house has many many people had no fences in their backyards and it was just a huge shared big yard big yard and it was clear there was a demarcation of like where you know these are my plants at the Loma Theater in the grass is a little different there but it is very common for me
 I felt really beautiful that's cool it's totally cool cuz it the space back here is shared and also that I wanted to be shared with my neighbors and anyway it's different but it's kind of similar also we well we didn't talk about any imagery of just like chariots and like those are also protecting the city like above War the war machine sure the military-industrial complex about like the security of our cities or a nation I think of you don't like the police and the military law enforcement think of like when words go on now it's a lot about just like can I take out that drone can I like take out that tank can I those kind of things yeah yeah that's right now so it's different but another
 there's a lot of similarity the court instincts are there it's a space that me or my group controls and that we prevent any dangers from entering into our space. That's the function of the city and the culture from which the Bible emerged in the Bible itself animation near East it wasn't many people cities were smaller they were walled yes and in the towns around the cities are the little like family travel centers around the cities where you at farm and produce stuff those were recalled daughters and he called the Blue Notes and then the name of the city so the Jerusalem would be the little Villages that works outside Jerusalem so that's where we've been we're going to go now is as always to the Garden of Eden story because we're going to see the building of the first city happens outside of the Garden of Eden by Kane Adam and Eve's firstborn
 but the language and imagery that's used when Cain builds his city is all hyper linking back to a really important scene in the Garden of Eden story and visit so Illuminating on so many levels
 so let's start with just remind ourselves of why why is a garden the fundamental concept of the ideal in the imagination of the biblical authors because it wasn't just them the thought that all of their Canaanite and Mesopotamian and even Egyptian neighbors all pictured the ideal human State at least looking back as beginning a garden and like I think I remember in Babylon you would get these beautiful city Gardens that they would create total that would celebrate their success and Beauty so even within the city they would make these wonderful card so you got one right here so I'm here driving what's Grace know if we've been at this project so long that there's certain things we've covered many times so I'm just looking back at notes that I made a long time ago from the Tree of Life series and then
 incorporate a lot of that material into a Bible project class classroom on Genesis 1 in the meaning of Heaven and Earth in the Bible and so I'm actually using the class note that began life as the podcast notes for the Tree of Life series and that class is free to take it up there right now so I'm in that section of the notes were talking about the meaning of sacred trees and Gardens in the ancient near East in times of the Bible's and wonderful resource that I use then was a scholarly volume by a scholar William Osborne called trees and Kings a comparative analysis of tree imagery in Israel's prophetic tradition and the agent. I remember reading this quote like 2 years ago in the Tree of Life series but it's really insightful and immediately gets us where we want to go so William Osborne on page 31
 as any astute tourist quickly observes the landscaped of much of the near East is predominantly Stark and Barren desert is talking about from the Mediterranean Sea and then just go east and go east are just dry israel-palestine Syria through here on a rock it's a lot of exercise Stark Barren desert land some of that low desert some of the high where in the World Cup there this will have happened in Qatar happened this way south to get out of map and you look kind of from where Lebanon is on the northern coast of the Mediterranean so it's North of Israel Palestine and then you just go due east and you'll see a ghost from hills and green to adjust Brown on satellite All the Way East
 but then if you look Southdown you start where the Asian continent emerges with the northern Arabian Peninsula down in Saudi Arabia on down there at it's just that would be just light brown on the satellite to does mega area so we must warn continues the land is comprised of innumerable shades of brown with only brief interjections of green or blue water and plantain the higher in elevation one goes The Greener that picture becomes consequently mountains rivers along with forests that Adorn them seem to be natural focal points of anyone who lives and travels in these lands the ancient peoples from the remote Western World of Egypt to the Eastern river marshes of Babylonia lived in the land not simply on it
 they were all agrarian culture has whose livelihood was found and maintained among the shade fruit and shelter and beauty of their trees as a result that can be little doubt that this lifestyle had significant effect on these ancient cultures and the way is that they perceived the world trees and trees are associated with garden tree he is nominating Gardens he can close those were some of the most sacred elements places in ancient near Eastern civilizations environment of the people groups out of whom Israel came in the biblical authors were all the South experience the world you're traveling through that area and it's just Brown b r g i can see any spot a little bit of green up on a hill you're like there might be a river there there's some life there like you can actually like yeah set up camp try and find them
 life ain't fair and a hilly area that has a spring on top that the money you could make a permanent encampment you have a water source a glow garden and you're up high and protected in Europe I could do some walls around the spring and you'd have a city with a river in the middle of it never makes glad the people you know to find a spring on top of the hill and so when you get the Garden of Eden what do you have you've got a spring coming out the top of the hill that forms a garden yep that's right so what school is you can go and Osborn does this and then other Scholars that I've learned from especially the work of a German scholar of marcail Keel he has a number of books called the symbolism of the biblical world and basically he is just collected more
 any other Scholars into volumes that are really accessible ancient near Eastern architecture sculpture and artwork and then organize it around key ideas in the Hebrew Bible so you can just let me look at representations of trees in the ancient near East and off my kids put them all together in these volume super helpful so what's interesting is that Imperial Kings and whether that's down in Egypt over in Babylon or in the Syria when they made their palaces they often made them just riddled and stocked with all kinds of garden like art and I can ography and architecture so things are kind of all the pillars are shaped like trees with leaves you know and all these pictures that we have more carvings depicting palaces and throne rooms that's all I could just wrap Gardens so what that shows is
 and never the gods are in the midst here cuz they believe the gods gave them life so wherever there is city center with a ruler and they would create it to look like a place where the gods are here giving life fertility every city was just first a garden a place where humans felt like all the gods have made this a place where there's trees here that the river here now that we could set up camp here you know what's funny is you ever noticed that like little Suburban housing developments are always named after the thing they took over to her Park Meadows yeah yeah Mountain View Mountain View broke a spring no longer there's no longer that it was here and we built around it and now it's part of us
 yeah or in this case like the palace gets turned into a little symbolic you know Garden Oasis though they are right now we're just looking at 7 Century wall carving of ashurbanipal Throne Room where it's just a big garden and he's posting some other Royal dignitaries and he has some sort of Ark of the Covenant kind of thing there at South Point I think it might be a serving table for the food items and looks like it has like chicken wings on it and has interesting handles been famously in a Shabana Paws Palace he made one of the most famous gardens in the ancient world and he says he describes it as a little he channeled through a conduit or less things called
 oh conduit water where you can direct it. Maybe 2 funnel a stream into his Palace garden and then you know he had a court poets write all about it about how it was like the center of the kingdom and he talks to all the different types of bushes that grew their the whole point is even when a king in a city wanted to create an ideal space to display How the Gods and live here with me and they have pointed me to rule what they make is a garden that's the fundamental picture here and so the Garden of Eden is another expression of that ideal that God the ultimate Cosmic came for the Israelite authors wood
 Touch Heaven and Earth together and plant is human ruling images and what do you get this in the garden us first grade General point to make like that's what we should be feeling The Vibes River in the garden itself so when we are there in the garden story God plant a garden in the middle of the desolate Wilderness there's a Wilderness by the river out of the river water creates mud I think of a flat place but you are so this is a Wilderness that was on a mountain in this case it doesn't say it but this stream that God's going to provide is on a hill can become a river splits and goes out to water all the Earth yeah pretty epic Hill is static Hill so the elevation of Hell's not drawing attention to yourself focused on here
 send it is assumed to get water goes downhill so so God forms human from the dust of the ground and breathes Tina into the nostrils the breath away so then there's a big focus on that River and says it went out and watered the garden and after it left the garden it separated and became Four Rivers out it goes in and load Hogs can be important for the cities that water's one river is called pishon I mean gusher it goes down to the land of havilah which is as you find out later in Genesis and important stop on the way to Egypt to this river is going to Egypt
 the second river is the geek on
 now it says it goes around the land of kush which is typically in Northern Africa but there's another Koosh that the tribe like Central to the land of Israel is an interesting one is the name of the river that will become also means like gusher or what's another word for Gus Splurge Splurge name of the spring the sources water in Jerusalem in Solomon's day the name of the third river is the Tigris that is it goes throughout Syria the name of the fourth is the Euphrates for those two are very clear like Rivers we know them cuz they some form of them still exist today but the point is the places where the one is the seat of the Egypt second is associated with Syria for its associated with Babylon noticed this is in the Eden story select the narrator these lands exist
 England will become the settings of all the bad Empires all the bad cities yeah but it's that all the source of life that they're going to get comes from comes from this Yep this heaven on Earth River Cats so God takes the human put Steven in the garden gives him a command next thing. Whalen said it's not good this first thing that is not good
 7 days it was good good good good good good very good the first thing not good it's not good for the human to be alone cuz there's just one human and I was just the human the human I will make a Hebrew word here is Acer for him so this is revisiting podcasting back in the family of God, stations couple years ago we've really focused in on this is usually translated with the word helper King James helpmeet I recently came across what is now my favorite translation translation thank you dr. Carmen dimes Revival Professor down to Biola University she has the translation Ally I wish I could just perfect vanilla Ally and I've modified it slightly to delivering a lie because a Naser is always well actually the main one at dusk
 in the Hebrew Bible every time this word appears it's God and specifically when God comes to rescue Israel actually we saw it in Psalm 46 in the previous conversation. God is the help there for his people are for his City when the world's falling apart so if you have the idea of like assistant helper helper to the assistant likely I'm not the only one who turned who can provide the Deliverance that is needed to provide safety or accomplish the mission that's why I feel like making a treaty with a neighboring King who can come in like protecting rescue you or even more that they have the river in their land and we have like the flat fertile Farm Fields yet and so let's become each other's either so I can grow the weed you have to send the water to me I said we need
 Alice Alice perfect word thank you Carmen so I will make a delivering a lie for him but delivering because why are you adding a delivery man and we're delivering because what it means there's something wrong there some challenge episode about the Ally you're in trouble you're in trouble and so this relates to what do I know about the job given to Adam from the 7th a narrative it is to rule as male and female that together are the image and to be fruitful and multiply yeah I'm not calling cannot be so filled with the lone human so I'll make the delivery now I'm so you get the scene of Yahweh forming creatures
 from the ground bringing them to the humans to see what the human would call them and the human cause the names of the creatures but for the human there was not found an Acer so now we really have a whole narrative where God takes the human on a journey so that the human begins to see what the human needs to realize that the human doesn't have an answer because like yours those creatures in those creatures then well that's not like me I can't work with that I can't be in a lie to me
 which I think that's what's going on so God causes asleep actually not just any sleep but like trance Visionary altered Consciousness sleep that's what card am I what means that he slept and he that is how I took one from his side's one of his side's you close the Flash in this place if the keyword and you always built the side which he took from the human into woman and they brought her to the human than the human sexual assault in the rejoicing in translated as rib correct one of his ribs yeah but the word and we talked about this before the word in Hebrew literally means aside yeah describes sayla describes the side of a building side of a box like the Ark of the Covenant where the side of a hill
 one of the sides and then putting them into in a way he is very suggestive and I think they will be invited to see many layers of meaning so the fact that when I say him you've also kind of made a point of saying hot dog was like not gendered in a way like in the well I mean I think there is a default in that hot Adam is a masculine noun but it also is the generic title for species in the first time Haddam the human is used in the 7-Day creation narrative is explicitly is the species name for male and female this in Genesis 1:27 God created Adam and here you get this picture of someone who split in half becomes male and female yeah so whether the default beginning state is mail and then out of mail
 woman you can that's a legitimate inference of the narrative but I do want to at least be aware that that male default not the emphasis of the store has hot Dom is generic can refer to the species or two human male and then the words man and woman that are specifically gender words or biological sex words don't appear till after the splitting I just feel like I has to be significant so you made a point of saying when y'all way takes the side highway built so this word build It's Curious it's the way here I'll just do a real-time situation here this is Jenna's 2019
 The New American Standard has fashioned kind of make the word feel less awkward retracted or something yeah yeah so 375 occurrences in the Hebrew Bible so no is going to build an altar that's the word Bona Nimrod just going to build Nineveh Abraham builds in alter actually in the Book of Genesis the two things to get built our cities or Alters actually that's a really interesting and I can make sense but it's a deep Rabbit Hole 1 Israelites are building cities for Pharaoh Moses build an altar and cities altars and cities okay building the side of atom into a woman that's weird the weird thing to say in Hebrew it's supposed to catch
 attention like it supposed to make you think like is this an altar is a city what you build are constructed items and the only two things yet built in the Torah because when he formed man out of the dirt yes it was a word for molding molding which is what's used to describe what a Potter does with Clay so this is more of a construction word so this is very common in the Hebrew Bible the biblical authors will use intentionally awkward strange feeling turns of phrase is awkward in Hebrew in Hebrew to get your attention that there either and idea behind an idea that they're either hyperlinking back to or in this case I think foundationally like establishing an idea that's going to become important and what follows so my point here is just to say here is a human in a place of vulnerability and with an obstacle to can
 do what God has called him and to do so God provides an Acer. Delivering Outline by building it for the vulnerable. Builds the delivering help in the form of a woman that's the foundational image in this little scene and those are details you would necessarily know to pay attention to us are going to see the whole thing I just said is just going to keep coming up over and over and over again but in really creative twists and thing that you said is that he builds you have somebody who's in a desperate situation that can't get themselves out of it. It's so God provides a delivering a line in Acer
 and God provides it by building it for them on their behalf of what they could not do for themselves God builds by giving them an Acer.
what's this idea so what's interesting is that word hazer Brian Zion rash has consonants that keep appearing in the rest of the story and if you don't know to look for this you wouldn't know so yeah I'm going to drown the work of a scholar has gotten the waggle who's and he's a Semitic language test is publish on so many different things but he is like the guru of word so we have two words in English puns and wordplay has described the way we form words and take advantage of graphic or similarity of consonants between different words to make points sub another kind of love them that's her a kids like Dad loved him
 right just last night oh my gosh my kids are reading the Diary of a Wimpy Kid and so we spent bad time just trying to think up famous people and different names for underwear and pick you up behind my favorite of August was Lincoln Longbottom's
 and then that I made ramen think of Leonardo long johns and then I was like Ulysses underwear it's just the first two letters yeah yeah okay that's enough that's enough but there are other ones anyway so we have word play and pain to describe that the technical term is paronomasia and so Scott has published a book called we're playing in ancient near Eastern text and it's all about how ancient especially Semitic authors were super super into doing this he demonstrates it in Egyptian literature Babylonian literature literature and Hebrew Bible all everywhere everywhere all the time so this has become one of us a really crucial tool that I was not taught
 when I first learn how to read the Bible. Margaret a brochure in this way later that this is a significant to Old hard to see without knowing the reason languages as it takes for granted you know the language that spells don't work cross side so the irony is that the Acer that God provides a n i n i n n s that one we talked about last time yeah you closer to about trying Sion rash
 so what's interesting is what you're told about than the man and the woman that Acer and then the human once they're together is that they are our room naked our room and the word Aram has four letters but three of those letters are identical or have almost the exact same shape as the three letters of delivering Ally the iron race and then the word our room has a letter Vive that is drawn almost identically to the middle letter of Acer to Sian but just doesn't have a little Cross quick on the top what sound does it make in this case it's the vowel in Autumn marks the bowel
 so the Acer and her the one she's there to deliver are both Autumn and there's a similar sound in that you're using two of the same to same letter the same Alex sounds letters but then there's also does a visually visually it looks similar as well so it's a graphic interplay so you would say the word naked is made up of three of its four letters look identical you are denicol two are identical in looks the third looks like and that's important enough and Tobago has a whole chapter on this on how do you know it's happening and if you see essentially a high density of similar letters keep popping up with in a connected literary unit and you can begin to see interconnections area in place of meeting between them than you you got a good case there's paronomasia going on
 what's interesting is they're naked but then that nakedness so notice that the nakedness and the A's are who's the woman there that becomes the main focus of the snake in the tree story where the one the azer that God has provided actually becomes the target for deception by the snake and then when she sees and takes from the tree and then gives her husband and he eat the first thing that happens when they open their eyes and they realize they are so the one that God has provided the other has now brought about something that's now not good mainly that they see that they are out of which is fine earlier but now it's a problem so then the nakedness of this couple
 now been brought about because the Acer was deceived and then the man was deceived there are M and so they're exiled from Eaton but then there's that little note that God provides garments of skin for the humans and that weird skin
 when I involve rash is spelled with 3 letters and again that look almost identical to the word azer yeah it doesn't sound right here is a Caesar or so it's a graphic similarity because the Z is now the vowel song looking for love in the middle is over the care much anyways yeah it's really just the are that it feels very similar so about the mechanics of how paronomasia Android play Works Scholars appointed this particular inside out to me I was David Andrew Teeter his work on Genesis that is beginning to be published in so so insightful so he's one of pointed it out to me and essentially here's the connection is that God provides and builds and is there to deliver the lonely human
 but the Acer tragically becomes the one first and then the man whose targeted that results in the human's realizing that they are autumn
 but God provides for they're all room nakedness by giving them or as they are exiled and go east from the Garden of Eden which is a type of help o the Exile or the or the or exactly another words both the skin and the taser and those two words look almost identical yeah are things that God provides and in a bad situation where I miss you no provider has a lotion here is now providing covering for a tragedy so the two things that God provides. That's all I am the skin are nearly identical shape and then those letters are all linked together in a really precise sequence that is er leads to the our room Lisa the or God provides the other humans create our room but God provides the or God provides by the Allies we to the humans naked so
 provides the skin. So these are not things that you would necessarily notice I think your attention might get drawn to them cuz of other features in the text but that's step one the next step is when you take the next story on board and you start to see the same words or letters or ideas popping up in a way that is hyperlinked back to the previous story and that's where we get find the story of Cain and the building of the first it
so here I'm just going to will the sun rise in say the story of Cain and Abel recession the story a lot over the years so I think what I'll just try and remind us of a top load is the right outside the garden the parents are expelled from the garden in Canaan God's conversation you discover there by a door or some kind of gait presumably the Gate of backed into the garden and they're offering sacrifices he and his brother are Cain and Abel are Adam and Eve's two sons got favors Abel sacrifice and then got us a conversation with Kane and you realize Kane has a choice about to do good or to not too good and there's an animal like creature crouching Desiring him that he's called the rule
 and it wants him but the portrait and just with those little brush Strokes the narrator is painting can just to make sure someone's listening or not know the story the conflict here and dial it up is that they're both getting sacrifices and God shows his attention of favor on Abel sacrifice is like what's the deal why are you ignoring me in fact he's hot with anger angry was he going to do with his anger when he feels like God's not being fair God's not doing what's to him seems like the right thing to do which is to give him a favor and touched him
 so what God says if you have a choice between good and not good and there's an animal crouching that wants you to influence you and you need to rule it so what those little lines that's the language of what his parents were called to do to the animals to rule them the animal that's trying to get you sounds eerily similar to the animal that was trying to get this. Did get this guy's parents and it's a choice of good and not good to know just exactly the words used of his parents the tree of knowing good and bad
 this cane is the next-generation standing at this death tree so to speak so he makes the wrong choice he kills his brother out in the field
 so just like God did to Adam and Eve God shows up asking questions after the same question where is it came out of anywhere are you comes to Cain and says where is Abel your brother there's a lot of like what do you say but not blame shifting in this case but like punting and I'm trying to evade the question like I don't know where was my keeper of my brother and members of Adam said why is the woman you gave me and so what God says to Kane is exactly what he says to the snake and the man or the woman which is what is this you've done he says to Kane what is this you've done and check this out this is important so what God says is the voice of the blood of your brother is crying out to me from the ground
 so the word blood is related to the word human it's another word play and remember this when human was made it was a Dom and human made from the Optima the dirt the dirt so human and dirt the word blood is actually connected in here cuz the word blood is dumb so a dumb human Adamo ground Dom blood so what he says here is you have made the Dom of your brother go back into the the Dom to the Altima so what God did was create a dime out of the Altima and you just took a human life and have returned it back in the Dom of an atom to swim to the Altima
 numbers 10 to get upon himself to become got to take away life but the Dom lives on in a way I'm crying out exactly a variable in the automobile is crying out whatever that means yeah it's it stands there before the blood on the ground is still is to any human wasn't desensitized to it and when you see a puddle of blood it should be and it is shocking like that's the life fluid of a creature that supposed to be in that creature you're saying crying out as a way of saying like there's something wrong here it's startling so startling that when it's seen and noticed
 it ought to shake us to our very core and so it cries out meaning that it demands some kind of response me as an answer demands an answer yep and God says I I heard it and so what's interesting is the God doesn't kill the murderer take the life of the murderer rather he X-Files the transgressor just like he did to her parents so you're going to still have to work the ground and eat but you'll be a Wanderer and a vagrant in the land
 Kane set the away My Punishment it's too great to be able to carry or lift up you have exiled me banished me to Beckley the word use to what y'all why does Adam and Eve you advance me to stay on the face of the ground I'll be a Wanderer and a vagrant and it'll come about anybody who finds me will kill me
 I'm a murderer so I won't be safe out there by Matt off exactly right yeah I'm just now my reputation goes before me I'm going out from the garden land I am I mean at least I was next to it and I'm still in Eden where is the region of the light once I'm out there someone's going to kill me and we always says this is astounding you always said whoever kills Cain he will be Avenged seven times over and Yahweh established for Kane a sign so that whoever would find him would not strike him so he provides a sign that is a promise
 the canes life will be spared if someone tries to bring Justice upon him so that's another cord image here just came and he's afraid that someone's going to take his life and I know human nature totally yeah like who are the other humans out there in the story just assumes that there are out there that's a whole other thing but so here we have once again again a human in a place of desperation and need and God provides for them something to preserve their life
 and the thing is called I signed know what is the sign I think it's intentionally ambiguous but it whatever it is it's something that's for Kane it doesn't say that it's on him that idea has a long after life about The Mark of Cain and all that and it just that you were text does not say that to sign for him and it's intentionally these in ambiguous because this idea is going to get filled in with lots of different types of signs does the biblical story go to know how the word signed generally used in Hebrew symbol of some kind of symbol that is a connected with cane that the supposed to make it clear that his life is to be saved some sort of visual something usually is Visual and usually it's visual that's right that's for him and it's for him him so here's the thing Kane goes out from before the face of Yahweh
 and he went and dwelt in the land of wandering which is the Hebrew word not the Land of Nod East of Eden exactly his parents were exiled to the east of the garden their sons are allowed to East of Eden
 now Kane is out here in the vulnerable and he has a sign that God's provided that his life is protected but like you know what we're good this I'm going to do well you'll be Avenged that's right it's going to motivate someone but it's not angry enough you know I'll deal with that later so say I won't keep somebody from killing you what he says is all you know there's going to be consequences consequences for them to work with right now trusting God's sign
 so what's the first thing we're told that he does first thing is he finds a wife he has a son second thing he does builds City
 and he named the city after the name of the son who named the city Enoch or Hannah dedicated and then you build a city and then he named the city after Sunset notice the close correlation of woman child City Mary's he knows his wife son name of the Sunday build a city named the city after the name of sun that he can start building his little a little world and builds for himself City imagining like he could have like literally just been like okay I'm going to start building this wall literally build a wall around a hamlet mr. build the wall and I'll have my own allies I will come if they want will make peace they can come in and we'll just keep making this bigger wall got it yeah you know the extended family grows and
 his mother wanders will come along and they were talking about a town like I had a walled to a hamlet Hamlet yeah yeah go to Francis last summer with my family and we were right way south of Paris real and I went on a number of runs just in my grill Countryside France year amazing and I saw for the first time what the word Hamlet mean it was a wall it was like a shoulder high stone wall hundreds of years old around maybe four or five houses and then there would like to attach two barns in a bunch of fields in the wall went around a building here remember the definition of city is walls again this is what David
 play not to me and it's certainly right so notice how Kane is clearly replaying the story of his parents yes and God's treatment of Kaine is very similar yeah cuz Adam and Eve they're told they're going to die death penalty for meth or consequence I had not killed it spared from Death they're banished East before the banished they're given the skin of an animal to cover their nakedness given a gift or set East spare their life that's right Kane murdered his brother you think death penalty
 God says I'm to spare your life I'm sending you farther east than he gives them a gift to not skin but it gives them a sign exactly exactly nine is to protect him from people who would go out and kill him because he's out there with new humans who maybe they know he's a criminal and I think I'm taking up and maybe just like I mean human nature like the guy I don't know he might be a threat let's take him out he's no longer with his family he's out on his own so interesting
 that all the keywords use it precisely these parallel moments all look or sound alike in Hebrew so Genesis to God builds Hebrew word banal he builds the Ally which is the Aether and then that Azar tragically you know becomes the vehicle for the snake to make them all to him and so God provides a new thing for the one in need namely provides the or the skin for them
 in a similar Way for their son in Cannes moment of need even after he's guilty God provides an oat which this one's harder to see in the modern Hebrew alphabet that I'm using the thing Google Docs right here but the words are graphically similar or skin and oat so it is Olive of love but you can't even see it the way the tarvas shaped is identical to the main the restaurant part of it is the main swoop of the rash the middle letters are the same word skin begins letter i in the word that begins with all of their the to silent letters in Hebrew and depending on the alphabet script being used they have graphic similarities but it's kind of relative to the alphabet you're kissing so that mean I can meet you in the moment but then check this out
 what does Kane do God provides a note but then what does Kane do built see well he builds and year so the last time we had the word build it was God providing God builds other and what Cain builds is a near and dear to other means help ear means City are look almost identical it's the first and last letters are the same letters and then the middle letter is actually that top swoop of the letters Ian in the word ezer is what the letter Yoda is not top swoop just without the vertical line under it has is when Kane build the city the phrase looks exactly like the Hebrew phrases with God built build a Nether and once you've linked all these words together in terms of their meaning they play the exact same role
 so in a moment of desperation God provided the Ally God provided the skin after the tragedy of both and those help and skin look together here in Genesis for God has provided something for caned to preserve his life
 But Ken wants to preserve his own life by his own means and he builds the city so the building of the city now okay I never came is already taken on himself Godlike roles he took the life of an atom by spilling the Dom into the Altima and now he's taking on himself another Godlike role which is to provide his own security and delivering help and he builds the city which is imperialism to God building the answer for the given that makes sense for how the parallels work that makes sense I'm wondering how it's not Landing completely for me like why is this so significant just as God built in a lie because of the humans inability to preserve life Humanity Adam was unable to be fruitful to do the Earth X
 because he could reproduce I mean a big thing that's right so he has life in the loan has life but can't preserve it and can make it go go on and so so God provides by which is the woman that allows married women get that builds and then once that Alliance is broken because of Humanity's failure God provide something again he provides the skin just as God did that so similarly God provides a sign to compensate or cover for canes failure and what does Kane do
 he decides to build a city for himself so the thing that God built to preserve life Kane is now building for himself to preserve his own life and the sign that God wanted to give him is like the skin to God gave his parents to cover for their failure so is the thing that's supposed to be standing out to me is that the big difference here is that canes building his own a taser yes I had of letting God give him an Acer building his own Deliverance his own salvation is on delivering a lockout introduce two cities the first time the idea of a city yeah is in the story of the Bible is from a murderer On The Run who who God said God said I'm going to protect you and they decide yes great but also I'm going to protect myself yep that's right the first time is it
 a it's a sad tragic necessity from the humans point of view to protect ourselves here outside of Eden the sad reality that could not we could not be further from the garden at this point and is supposed to make a sad so the woman a lie that got built for the preservation of life is contrasted with the city that Cain builds to preserve his own life and I were supposed to notice that and we're supposed to sit with that contrasts so here's what's fascinating from this is that City's when they're described with any figure of speech or metaphor throw the rest of your reliable they are always portrayed as women always and we saw that and Psalm 46 yeah. Is in her so city is referred to with feminine pronouns cities are referred to with phrases like
 lady Jerusalem born daughter Zion Revelation chapter 21 by saw the holy city coming down as a bride so the fact of God's Heavenly provision of Life a new creation is depicted okay I dab as a bride for her husband you like a thief in the heaven for me the Heavenly City coming down to marry Arthur a new razor a new Acer but specifically God's providing the bride just like I did in the Garden of Eden in the New Testament writings the church is also called The Bride totally different conversation
 oh yeah you know that's a good point no it's very similar but I haven't thought that through with how that connects to the kitchen ideas well maybe I do truly I haven't thought of that okay to bring a new idea into my I had a nice neat little package of these ideas get together in your you're putting another one in there I know it certainly fits the church is just an assembly a community of people people good people here and so is the city exactly exactly so it makes perfect sense who also Babylon is called daughter found one and both in the Hebrew Bible and into the Revelation Babylon has described as a woman like a sex worker a prostitute and sitting on a dragon so a woman is sick so my point is all of the that imagery later in the Bible about cities as women
 Oh I thought this was poetic creativity and it may be but it's sort of creativity to make you think about these ideas were talking about that all assuming this deep connection between the city and that is there in the woman earlier on in the story because the woman is what God provides for the Salvation in the Deliverance of the lone human so and the city is what builds to provide his own deliverance from Death last time we last episode he talked about the puzzle this feels like a puzzle time it's like you've got how is a woman connected to the city and what's
 God builds Kaiser which is the woman and it's a delivering Ally to rescue mankind to be able to do the thing it ought to do when we get to Cain Cain builds the year
 and it's like those two phrases look identical god build a taser can build the ear God does it to protect Humanity Kane does it to protect himself
 and what cities become then is this picture of humans trying to protect themselves and just creating more violence then there was even before Cain killed his brother but cities are going to kill an entire cities that's what we go in the next episode of the conversation is the scaling violence of the city but I wanted to just focus on this moment of the origin of the first city and so when we see in Revelation the city of God come down and it's called The Bride then the payoff there is saying what we built on our own to protect ourselves is the thing actually God wanted to give us all along he wanted to give us the Allied delivering out delivering out yeah and we didn't need to go out and build it to protect ourselves we could have built it with God and God's going to give it to us
 yes okay thanks Beth even with Clarity I had typed out yet in my notes and that's exactly right the thing that God did give and wants to give even more of is what can refuses to accept and builds in his own power and ability to just follow that weird play and it's like God builds the Acer God gives the order that gives the out what stands out is next it's not God builds the city pain pills that that's right that's weird I was waiting for the God because that's the pattern God did the thing I did think I did the thing yes painted the thing and then we've got this long now story of humans building the city until God comes and says let me give you the City Kansas City gets out of control
 with violence and then the next cities will be Nimrod cities and then the next cities will be Sodom and Gomorrah and then the next two days will be Pharaoh's Storehouse cities they make slaves build and you decide did cities getting out of control and it all comes from this moment two cities also provide security but what if the first efforts to build human security were actually a sad rejection of God's offer is a provide what humans need to preserve life and what if there was a city where God dwells in it and he was the reason that city was Secure narwhal yeah yeah
 yes on power so this let's just maybe conclude moving from Biblical theological symbols what is there that's more fundamental to human life experience than wanting to save your life yeah am I safe yes like the question psyche am I safe from those like a deep in there and then our subconscious anytime we're awake and cruising around but then also like in moments where we feel in danger we don't have to think about what to do our bodies kick into gear what does the limbic system right kicks in and despise your body with hormones so that you do whatever is required to stay alive so the preservation of life isn't just some like idle Pastime that you used to like it's like this is core
 and that's the thing that Cain is feeling threatened so you can really sympathize with why I know it doesn't seem that weird I don't get to this and go oh how is building a city that's going to be a problem he had a great I mean totally so I want to emphasize that cuz you could like paint this is movie saying that's like a dark cloudy day and there's thunder and lightning and can't what time does Wicked Smile as he touched the brakes on it I was going to get her and in a way what God is asking came to do is really counterintuitive
 but in a way that's kind of like that that we're back to the decision at the tree it looks beautiful it looks good deal give wisdom why wouldn't I eat from this tree why wouldn't I build a wall why would I build a wall it's the most natural feeling in the world and that's the kind of stupid not it's not for the humans I want to kill me at least for the the critters Critters that want to eat coyotes so it's not like a simple picture is like evil kayn builds the city it's like a genuinely the human impulse to protect ourselves then create the setting have in which it's going to backfire the Same by ruling of Our Own Worst inclinations will yep just come to life consume us Seven Generations down the line with that to send the name of my back that comes from this guy who lives in the city the train goes off the tracks
 so that's portrait and I just want to end with that cuz it makes it really personally realistic I think that the origin of this thing no I just put in a ring doorbell I can see everyone who comes to my door now that's it it's my own little Fortress account and like do something with it to ruin your life and ruin your children's lives and that would be the parallel to like what happens here it just gets out of the thing meant to preserve life becomes now a tool of death there you go
 so that's the origin of the city I was a lot of conversation around just a few chapters in the few words but I'm so grateful for that scholar and your teachers work if it's so insightful for understanding these chapters and also why cities and portrayed as women play such a huge role in the stink going forward and depressed of the Hebrew Bible speaks of listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're discussing the stories of Kane's the sentence who carry on in the footsteps of Kain Kain the leads to the flood and we're going to look at the city of nimrod that leads to the great scattering the narrator Genesis follows the genealogy of Cain down through the generations and what we see is an intensifying a human murder and spilling of innocent blood in the land and that leaves God to deal with it today's episode was brought to you by our podcast team
