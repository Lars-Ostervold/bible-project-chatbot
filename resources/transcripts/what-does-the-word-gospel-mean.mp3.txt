Pat is a John and Tim and this is the Bible project podcast the daily on podcast we are beginning a new series of sorts on the gospel yeah we have two videos coming out this fall about the word gospel yeah one of them is a word study how is the word gospel used you as a threat to the gospel is also for different books in the Bible how to read the Bible series and we're going to do a whole video of how do you read this genre of literature the gospel of Matthew Mark Luke and John so those would be the two videos and we had a conversation leading up to how to read the gospel and we're going to have those conversations on the podcast however you had the opportunity to sit down with Tom Wright and discuss
 the word gospel which is going to be more about the word study yet kind of idea what is that was a weird meeting a few conversations with the New Testament scholar and see right and so this was another one of those are really great and after that you'll hear me reference it at the beginning I was in Scotland not a thing that's normal for me I was in Scotland to be part of a small conference with some other Hebrew Bible awesome people and it was on the campus of the same University that Auntie right teaches out and so I reached out to him and will be able to spend some time with him and so we recorded this conversation yeah which is all about the Greek and Hebrew biblical words for gospel and good news it's a pretty fast pace conversation we are ranging over lots of parts of the Bible so I think in the show notes will probably reference to the main scripture texts that were talking over
 they were multiple points where I made a little note so I can go back and think about this more people who have the Bible very internal I've been thinking about these things going at it was it was funny but I learned a lot in this conversation you know just lots of fascinating things are come up I think you'll learn a lot to about the word gospel what it meant back in the first century what it means in Hebrew Bible and what it means for us till today to join us
alright Tom thank you for taking some time to sit down and talk about biblical Theology and other awesome statue talk on the phone but to be able to sit here with you in the place where you do your work through special for me so thank you for taking the time to do this so the bar project series of videos that we work on called words that is with these short little tours they're both word Focus but seemed focused on Greek and Hebrew words and we are currently working as of what this is August 2019 so its in production about the first good news or the words vocabulary for goodness which in Hebrew it's the verb the saw and then in Greek New Testament the noun Jon Bellion me explore this quite a bit and I've learned a lot from you so let's think about this way so when you reading the Gospels
 play Mark chapter 1 the first sentence of Mark tells you that this is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Paul obviously the you want to go lay on the gospel this is steamatic throughout his writings and its location there's two main backgrounds that seems significant for understanding the meaning of these good news words one is the Hebrew Bible but the other one also is the Greek and Roman backgrounds for these Royal announcements of good news that would be announced about Emperors and so on so maybe he was an interesting place to start and in your mind when you pick up the gospel of Mark and you read the Yuan galleons does your mind simultaneously go to the Hebrew Bible and to what you know of my Chrome and propaganda what would a reader of Mark's gospel what does Mark want his readers mine to connect to when he opens with the fence by the good news about cheapest is wonderfully
 application and also want to play some pool and then the winmock puts that line of the beginning of his gospel assuming it was Mark who put it that because there is a school of thought which says well the end of March seem to be lost to the beginning of Mark seems to be a bit Jackie and Oakwood cuz he says his written in the eyes of the prophets and then you get a quote from Malachi and how does that work and some people have thought that maybe the phrase I'll get you to you if I can give you your Chris to the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ some management said something about maybe a heading that somebody off tomorrow to put on there because well as you can leave the end of the Gospel with us it's hard to do that in the beginning that's the notion if this is a way of saying this is the beginning then the answer to the question what did he mean by I just read the rest of the book and see it so because this is the point about would studies and I love word studies you know how cold and Susan and dictionaries are some of my favorite books when people
 which which of the books that have been for the two most I was shocked them by sight in the world, but as soon as you get into that world you have to realize the people don't live on etymologies they live on narratives and the meaning of the word it says it's a juicing a text in the context is usually a story so what story is being towed now in the Hebrew Bible the verse says the one who announces a good news in Asia $14 and I took two it's a very specific good news where you've gone Israel in Exile in Babylon and Yahweh is rose gold apparently having abandoned Israel and the good news is he's coming back that's how I saw 41211 he's coming back this is the good news and the Heralds of shouting he's coming and then that theme you have to wait for its they knew more through the next
 captive until in 52 you get it again and now the Watchmen looking up their voices and shouting because I love lie upon the mountains are the feet of the one who brings this good news the good news is you all wait is Avis Rent Babylon he's one of the great Victory he has released his people from captivity and he himself is coming back personally to Zion in order to be king so it's all God Reigns is the seat so it's good news is about somebody becoming King the name of the god and then you can track that through the uses that's the same vocabulary used about David yeah I'm absolutely in Solomon you haven't had an argument and the arrival is the thing and then go to know is that it's such a shock because here is the Royal arrival but it's a chapter 52 what does it look like when the arm of Yahoo has revealed it looks like
 he was despised and rejected an unbeaten up and killed and that Paradox then of course burst out into 5455 so you need the whole matter to me you can just take it out and I think what's happened in our Traditions is the people have allowed the woods study soda vegan is which is a way of saying we won't stick to text really seriously want to hear Tamela g w e r come from to serve a different purpose and where it's assumed that we no want the gospel or to be because we modern Western Christians are still trying to play out the late medieval questions about an Angry God and a hell and a judgment until the rest of it so we want to gospel The Rescuers from that so that the best we treat all the stuff about you all very stunning design as a metaphor as a figure rather than actually know that's the reality and it's all stuff that's the later corruption
 so then once you get that sense of a long period between one of the book of Eisenhower was put together which and I don't know and I spect you to Liberty Ridge knows but between then and the time of Jesus the results of people who are praying and waiting and hoping and something I was working on earlier this week the ways in which eyes are Fulton 55 and the theme of consolation of Zion being restored and design being a bereaved mother who is now told you going to have her children and more now that theme is picked up infesting all kids picked up enfold azra is picked up in the book of the roof and these are second temple. Books which are saying we are still in the stage of desolation and we need the good news we need the consolation and the New Testament fits right in there and it says now we will tell you the story which is shucking in the same way that I desire is shocking
 I thought this is the real good news and his appointed by good news before we segue into a Redmond news in the device would people often get wrong that when there was that there was a book published by the Jesus seminar 20 years ago called the five gospels in there as well as you can join and when I reviewed that book it suddenly dawned on me what's going on when you put Thomas in the Thomas is not about events that have taken place as a result of which the world is a different place Thomas is about here is some teasing sayings which might help you reorder your interior space in other words if you say that they will really like Thomas what you're saying is no good news is good advice and this all the difference in the world between used uses something has happened as a result of which a whole new set of possibilities opens up but you may not like about that
 this is how the world now is you know I'm specially the death of a mother can the accession of a pneumonic or some great victory in battle or whatever this is news everything is going to be different now that we've experienced this so that's the sort of story The Gospel is that in the within the storyline of the Hebrew Bible this is like a poetic condensation of the themes in storyline as the whole Hebrew Bible God's purposes are the blessings of Abraham promised Abraham through the family of Israel Israel because it's replayed the sin of Adam on the scale even larger and so the good news is about the restoration of kingship and blessing over Israel and threw them back out through them back out into the world yes
 the question of the blessing to the nation's as opposed to Simply the Best of Israel and maybe a few others will come in on it that's a very tricky one at the moment when I wrote my biography of pool coming years ago I sent it to a leading Jewish rabbi who I know and said can you please read through this and tell me if there's anything in here that makes you as a Jew today feel uncomfortable and he got back to me with on a few things which I was able to correct it was just little turns of phrase but one of the things you said to me was I guess if you look at certain bits of the Psalms and eyes are you can see that maybe pull had a point but from the point of view of today's Jews you know some of pull successes have made life very difficult for the west side effect but you don't seem to me that the theme of The Radical inclusion of Gentiles within the blessing which then you can track back to to to the Abraham stories and how do I don't think that's so explicit Shania is our forces 55-minute does say look to Abraham
 but you could read that simply in terms of the restoration of Israel but nevertheless both in 4255 and in 56 or 66 and can you do have this sense both of the massive restoration of mothers on end of the extraordinary blessing of people coming from far away or so on 5th. So that's the primary Hebrew Bible contacts for canonical gospels are clearly intending to pick up that narrative knows if you're not familiar Google it narrative at all and no connection to the Hebrew Bible
 it's it's it's ultimately anti-jewish it's it's going away from the narrative World which is about a girl who made the world loves the world in his rescue in the world and into a different social world view which is about how we as human beings can I do go to skate this world into a different sort of private space which is of course what a great many people in the first entry under the twenty-first century I wanted to do with a very understandable drunk at the mess of the world and less like us know you're with all of these primary sources in terms of Greek and Roman authors I do remember still when someone first I think it was Ben witherington commentary on Mark had a long quotation that I don't know how to pronounce Dupree ending Credit Union
 take a b c d e f g. So this is inscription announcing we're celebrating the birth process of ideas by the stage it's just by the way it's his birthday so let's sing happy birthday because Providence has ordered our lives in the way of the Divine and since the emperor through his Epiphany his appearing has exceeded the hopes of all former good news surpassing not only the benefactors who came before him but also leaving no hope that anyone in the future will surpass him
 and since the birthday of the god that house was for the world the beginning of his good news May It Be decreed and then the inscription go to talk to us well informed here in a well well I mean of course it's a question of who said what about the emperor at what stage is quite controversial among ancient historians because it looks as though the further east you got in the Roman Empire what we call Chucky is roughly sort of halfway to that far east as it was then the easier it was to have the Improv in divinized where is they rather carefully didn't do that initially itself that would have been seeing his is 2 + be dangerous but by the second entry is happening but this day what's happened is that Augustus came to Power Stroke occasion came to power after the death of his adopted father Julius Caesar and there was a massive Civil War because Julius Caesar had made it quite clear that whoever was going to run
 Rome was the one with the biggest army in the most effective power based and so it was a matter of different people grabbing grabbing it and so Octavian one out by defeating Anthony when they had already the two of them to featured the conspirators Brutus and Cassius set and you have to imagine that this Civil War was full Tide laundry in Greece and Turkey around with them initially they went somewhere else to have that baffles into the hole of the central Mediterranean world was involved in this horrible turmoil which side are you on what do you want you in the back does this mean our city is going to be destroyed doesn't mean we're going to be enslaved Centra Centra Centra so when or gangsters then says it's all over we now have peace I've settled the matter Centric there's a kind of a collective sigh of relief that something has happened as a result of which the world is a different place now I'm so they then call on various themes for me
 mythology at cetera to talk about the Golden Age and hardest has this wonderful song which is a mole in Praise of Augustus through whose victory in the other world has become a wonderful drawer is play Virgil writes that he needed in such a way as to tell the whole story of Rome and climaxing with this amazing moment and you can such a field of shimmering music in the movie something amazing has happened to Stephen parents of a god I'd lost and so the thing that I find doubly fascinating is one that they use this very explicit language and that means they should Western turkey in Greece and Rome itself anyone reading the letter to the Romans anyone reading Marquan one would say he is a Jewish narrative but it seems to be saying something which looks rather like a hot SEC which one of the talk about the narrative is it tested this out with conscious
 because as far as I know nobody else in the ancient world and was telling a thousand Yuan a narrative with the good news about somebody becoming King as its climax know the early Christians I don't think got it from Rome because they clearly it arriving at from Etc the Jewish and likewise the Romans suddenly didn't think o these Jews of God who sings Don't let borrow it but somehow and again the inscription from trying to talk about the Providence of God I want says in quite a different way somehow in the Providence of God when the timer to fully come if you like I'll Galatians for these two storylines I'll coming in side by side independently both talking about your great event as a result of which somebody who is the appearing of a God has brought peace and Justice to the world and the Cozy on Sundays
 August is August has his successor was Tiberius then you had better than you have the year of the Ford a 69 they rule of Civil War again then Jerusalem was destroyed station became emperor was that really the beginning of peace and justice for the world or was that simply in yet another wretched game meanwhile this strange little movement Wingstops in Palestine in the thirties in the trenches and feta cheese and grows like a mustard seed until within a couple of centuries the a worrying about yes that's right isn't that fascinating so you have this conversation just a bit of History wow how did that happen but then when you should reflect the laundry today and if you got two narratives both competing for the same space you might have to say that both
 rubbish or one Street in the others. Or whatever and in a sense that is precisely what John's gospel particular is all about if you think of where John gospel reaches its climax it's the conversation between Jesus and Pontius Pilate and John 18th and 19th which is the kingdom of God versus the king of seas are there arguing about Kingdom in truth and power a crucified Jesus. John has told you that this is the revolution of the love of God
 it was interesting about that example is that Matthew Mark and Luke often called the snuff text use a lot of you on Galleon vocabulary throughout their narrative and famously John uses that vocabulary very little but what's interesting about yeah what you just said was the royal significance of GSW reality and its message is the same subject matter of the Gospel of it's just he's doing it in a different that's why I asked John to talk about the kingdom of God is so yes which is also analyzed ionic and John draws very important key moments on the same passages of eyes are who has believed our report in John John 12 is the kind of initial climax of The Gospel and then we can decide will just go sit until 12 that you got that as I could and there's a lot of eyes on a kind of woven in Saturday as you go on through
 Sunrise that they're saying in the broader recent memory of somebody reading the gospels in the first century were hearing Paul arrived and that's when he gay and giving him a good news they're aware of especially if they were Gentiles what they're primarily we're of is how that Civil War resolved and I'm hearing the propaganda about the good news of the emperor but then if their Disciples of Jesus and you know they are meeting on the Lord today and eating a meal together then they're on now learning the stories of Jesus they're learning the broader narrative the Knicks Center and this where do you want to Galien is once again right right at the center that word was elegant parallel tracks the erroneous story it strikes me that in the Septuagint of Isaiah so we're somewhere in the 150s b c d f 150 and somewhere in the 100
 be safe down in Alexandria there's too much scholarship and the word that comes to their mind when they're translating the Hebrew just saw her from the best dad is Iran going on so I'm sure somebody's done a study on why that word yet seemed appropriate to be one of the most all the bits of the Septuagint you know that that is flattering and often will choose but sometimes will choose the wood which just sounds like the Hebrew word even though in fact it doesn't mean the same he doesn't know what the Hebrew word mean so you could find a Greek word that sounds a bit like it sometimes there is palm oil from genuine Yukon proved too hard I thought it would you find Galliano evangelism my is quite rare in this afternoon when it does occur in those passages are in 52
 state is very striking yeah yeah song before Augustus sends the Greek World anyway. I mean I would just focus particularly on you know we use the word news so it casually and I Grumble because our newspapers frequently especially this time of year where recording August off and what passes houses news is in fact that the magazines and nothing much just a study that was done three months ago in some University now chosen at this is news announcement a lot more in the old in 1952
 I was taken by my mother to the Town Square in the little town in England where we live to hear the town crier announced that the King was dead and long live the queen when George the sixth star died and Queen Elizabeth became Queen and there was a tramp with a bell doing the old-fashioned thing here everybody we have a we have a queen told us John and I are in a previous conversation that's when you got when your first Bible that was when she was crowned going to invite everybody and to put all the stands in to Westminster Abbey so that everyone can pack it and let you know cuz they see 12 three or four thousand was Westminster Abbey nobody understands 2009 June 2nd 1963 was my Best Buy
okay that's we talked about the opening sentence of Mark so this is interesting about the use of that word in the gospel of Mark opens that it's the good news the beginning of the good news about Jesus but then he what you read on a narrative immediately is Jesus announcing the galleons of God the Good News Bible story line that then he summarized as the good news about Jesus Messiah Jesus is there that's what a fool to the obvious answer is Jesus talks about God becoming King in order to explain what he himself was doing correct famously Jesus is announcing the time is fulfilled there's some story that he's he's coming to a combination repent and believe in the good news so Matthew
 interesting way is he has a little summary notice at the end of chapter 4 of Matthew verse says Jesus went about announcing the good news of the kingdom and teaching and healing and so on and then what you get after that is going to the high place and The Sermon on the Mount about his disciples living in the community of the Kingdom so there's an important Matrix there she's a sudden a thing that God is King he's the one bringing this reality into being and then Matthew neatly gives us the whole unpacking of what it looks like to live as if it's in Matthew for there when I'm just sent you quotes in La obituaries from Ice Age the end of eight and threw in 29 which is the bit about the land of zebulun and after they by the Sea of Galilee of the nations of people will be so great
 those who dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them as a light shine and then it says on Jesus began to claim saying because kingdom of God is arriving and what Matthew knows what is Regis has to remember is that the very next bus if I was on I named the outside 92 news about the coming king that's right it's one of the classic the coming King I was 19 and 11 which then for sure do it in a reading of eyes are as I pulled you to the first seven song that's very true 253 so you call his Royal team have a right to recover user description I thought and I'm sure that's that's exactly what's going on and then the idea of the kingdom of God in the seven of them and this is about what is it looks like to live in God's kingdom but the me the most exciting thing about that is in the Banshee tubes at the beginning when the years I use
 to read them as simply oh my goodness are all the different characteristics which aisle has a disciple of Jesus watch to be exhibiting and oh dear this is really quite difficult and then pure pure in heart in the poor in spirit and hunger and thirst testing for righteousness and merciful them of this is this is a huge moral agenda that I'm going to have to take on board and that's kind of makes me nervous and still makes me a bit nervous but I've come to Regions no ties here before the people you need to be because you need to be scared of the sort of people through whom God's kingdom is exercised in the world because this is the big thing with Janet Jesus met the whole time when he said God is becoming King and people said we want some signs where show me what it look like and he said he's not offended by me but that wasn't what people wanted in today we Face the equivalent ejection
 show me to which the answer is when God takes charge he doesn't use his phrase again again God doesn't send in the tanks he sends in the meat in the port of the hungry for justice people in the messy full of the peacemakers and cetera and by the time the people with the tanks in the gums I realize what's going on the Miken the most people in the port and talk and have established schools and orphanages and hospitals and all sorts of projects in order to show what it looks like when your heart becomes game today against the day of Jesus final return when all those things will be punctual of God's New World cuz they were already beginning in Jesus day so this is a whole new way of reading the seven of them out not just here we are retreating from the world into a private Kingdom but by our being this sort of these sorts of people that is how God's kingdom comes in the wide world
 obviously famously called the Beatitudes yeah you're right it says if the Beatitudes assume if a people are going to model the way of Jesus and live as if this God really is the king of the world they are going to look that it's exactly like the conventional Avenues are institutions of influence and power but in reality they are the fortunate ones in folks over them exactly as annoying. 55 is not simply a blessing for them but a blessing through them I will give you a text and it's on I-49 Wonderful's favorite passages right after the Beatitudes you're the light of the world
 precisely that's why 95 is so subversive and its original context and you are the city on the hell y'all are you get my message that I just wrote the dangerous side is that the city on a hill language has been used by those who in the name of the separatist way we are just going to be this people and if anyone happens to be looking they will see how grateful you are instead of which the point of a design to tell me working on this is last week because the polls allusion to Psalm 87 in Galatians 4:26 when he says Jerusalem which is above is free and she is the mother of his old he is plugging into a Jesus strand that and it's very interesting because I'm in uses exception readable understand this
 as far as I can see nobody has spotted that at the end of Psalm 87 in the Septuagint reaches 86 there is a line was just to carry the Hebrew which is about your celebration because of the dwelling in you and the word for celebration is you fry Norman on the which is the same word that because of the beginning of Isaiah 54 one you front page of the Joyce exactly alluded to the song He's got that last line of Psalm 87 in the temperature in his head which hooks in verbally to the beginning of eyes on 54 and Isaiah 54 is regularly read in Jewish circles as about mothers on who have been by her and is now going to be fruitful again so he had precisely in Matthew 5 we we have the same
 listen to self comes out at this point is Jesus's announcement of the Kingdom create two people who in The Sermon on the Mount he invites to live in this new way it doesn't look like they're the fortunate ones according to people I can't ever since the whole inversion and doesn't look like Jesus is saying they are the inheritors of God's renewal of Jerusalem and has the results to say it again they are the ones who who did you want to help yeah I think I'm trouble here as it often is that then when it goes on into what we call at 6 yeah we read that in a post Kenshin way as all well here is here's some rules around the stringent rules this about your heart and not just your outward behavior and said was so fixated on that rather than seeing the people who become people like that I'll people through
 who whom God's blessing comes on the world looking at pools ethics unit said they were the works of the Flesh in the fruit of the spirit if you move to a new neighborhood would you rather than your neighbors on the street activity these qualities who was the effect of the fruit of the spirit and the point of early Christianity is it was though people thought they were mad and they were good people to have around and likes having them in the community because they Rejoice with those who Rejoice for those who haven't had the good news is good news on the street because people didn't know it was possible to live like that before and part of the good news is the modeling of the genuine human this is the back to that section of Isaiah as being the condensation of the themes of the Hebrew Bible one of the things in that section of Isaiah is because of what the servant doesn't 53 right near the
 the 53 he declares or makes righteous the many just loses his death and exaltation it seems to me that ties into a major themes it's mainly develop though in Jeremiah and Ezekiel about the renewal of the heart to create the New Covenant obedient loving God loving your neighbor type of people I've wondered in Reading The Sermon on the Mount again this is part of the deep structure would go from y'all are the city on the hill the New Jerusalem which means y'all are the New Covenant Newhart atsushi people actually makes perfect sense why he would move your talk about him and a video that point when you get this I sigh for 6:55 but then you do get the focus on the rear of the house in Jeremiah 31 or is he kill such a fool 56 Centro and 36 effectually and it says that
 all these strands with your hope that which different prophets and different songs in the different ways and which goes back to you from the 30th as well as they have seen that this strange vocation that Israel has had which seems to have run into the sand because of Babylon and because of pleasure and everything else that nevertheless if God is God sooner or later this must be how he's going to make it all happen again the New Testament just plugs into this very obvious be this kind of pressure on as your high near as it were primarily in the narratives of healing and he's going to be no going back from town to town the next step in The Narrative of the gospels is if they're working on a a u on gallion agenda as it were here then is Jesus going to Jerusalem for Passover and he immediately moves towards challenge
 the centers of power that when she goes right to the temple and rub against the week of debating I think it's probably a many many years ago through your work and Richard Hayes as well the Royal trail that that work in the passion there too but I mean it's just right there exactly know if I have been prepared to see all of this as a royal enactment the passion makes perfect sense in the gospels, which he wrote in haste while he was under base to sentence of death with pancreatic cancer five years or 4 years ago and was astonishingly rule through that and healed by a lot of prayer and looking pretty good medical work in the Duke Medical Facility but Richard in that book concentrates on what we've called christology of the person of Jesus and showing how the use of the Old Testament makes it
 are the full four gospels Jesus is the embodiment of Israel's God that is not just join in other words that does that but good Richard doesn't in that book move very far to Wood saying and here's how the Full Gospel explain the death of Jesus that's kind of a hold of it and the book is already 400 pages is exactly what you just said and it's as though once you said this is the you've been gallion at the beginning of the book has the prologue is a kind of what we would call a running head you have to imagine is the top of every paid by the way this is this conversation with god and Satan being played out and said the gospels have by the way this is the UN Kelly on this is what it looks like all the pieces especially the really turning the gospel authors are turning up the volume on it in the porch rail
 of the road the staff the crown your home is just very very intentional and it fits hand-in-glove with something like the Beatitudes these are the people through whom the kingdom comes into being beatitude type people Jesus is the Incarnation of that is being good to the city on the hill that cannot be hidden Jesus is the one who goes the Second Mile when he is before to carry his cross and Jesus is the was the one who turns the other cheek bone statements of the passion built into Matthew 5 is Gospel is very carefully structured you know the five greatest causes it. Wouldn't surprise me if if not used to say yes I'm glad you picked that up
 we've already been going sometime we haven't even talked about the Apostle Paul and um DeLeon in Fall let's briefly transition statement about this type of king of Beatitudes type of King in the Beatitudes Type of Way brings the kingdom exalted if we're staying in the van of Matthew he becomes the son of man who has authority over heaven in earth goes out disciples out out to the nation's so at that point Jesus is registering that his you on going on about the kingdom of God is now for his followers that you aren't going on about him. Mark 11 yes yes it moves into that because you could summarize both together by saying this is how God becomes king and then for the other church God has become king in a whole new way since I don't use this language I get old looks from people when I left for the zone
 and it's the new bit which really messes now there is a way in which God wants to run this world which God has not been doing for a very good reason that way back in Genesis God creates the creature called human through whom he wants to do stuff in his world having done that God won't go back on that modus operandi that we have operations God doesn't say okay the humans have messed up so we just going to scrap that time just going to act solo from now on God finds a way and the Never story is about the possibility that he might have gone back on it but then you don't send the Abraham story is a way of saying this is how God is going to do his work in the world through a human family and ultimately through the human being Jesus it's about going to becoming King through the Allegiant human but as soon as you say that the passageway jumps out of the New Testament is Romans 5
 imagine Adam seven the Messiah in the same Jesus and if it is 6:45 and so on the Messianic work of Jesus means that the Creator go to always intended to work in this world through the Allegiant human has no it lost on the great things he wanted I'm now through the rule of this Jesus exercise by this. Is that working and brush way in the world faces of the church's Mission and when I say that I think how many sevens and lectures of a hood on the mission of the church which just haven't seen it like that at all I think we urgently need to be ground by this fresh Boudin last thing to talk about there's two times where Paul explicitly defines I like I was his purpose the word
 Romans 10 1st Corinthians 15 set apart by God for the Yuan gallion of God what is the ongoing through the prophets and the scriptures concerning his son born of the seed of David according to the flash declared to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead according to the spirit of Holy Name of Jesus Messiah our Lord and we have now a commission to go summon the nation to a video through a very significant definition of gospel right here at the beginning of Romans and this is just what you were saying the exaltation of a seed of David as the human one trip through whom
 God's kingdom is now being exercised over the nation's that's Romans 1 1st Corinthians 15 famously you know you know the gospel of that was handed down to me I handed it on to you and it's more interesting in that he says whether it was I will day the other preachers this is what we need the Messiah died for our sins according to the scriptures he was buried and raised according to the scriptures and then the appearance as he's focusing on two different types of narrative moments in the gospel in the good news which means that Paul can the different moments and different times highlight sometimes the resurrection and exaltation sometimes the death and Resurrection for different audiences but there's one underlying story maybe I'll throw it as a question as well it seems
 that the 1st Corinthians passage has become almost over dominant and if you were to put a belt on a scale it seems 1st Corinthians 15 is outweigh it be on the bottom of what people think of when you hear the word go back to the beginning of my doctoral research back in the in the 1970s when I was working on Romans and I had grown up in the tradition which said the Romans 1 16 and 17 was the Gospel namely justification by faith Noah Coast 116:17 doesn't actually say justification by faith but it talks about the revelation of the righteousness of God and according to some theories of justification than what people means by 2 cuz you know who the righteousness of God is the righteous status would go to give children's to those who believe now I think that's completely wrong but I remember
 when I was first starting Raymond's intensively in the Greek being struck by the fact that in one suit 115 + 16 full size I'm not ashamed of the gospel because in it the righteousness of God is revealed and realizing that sentence means that the revelation of the righteousness of God is Not itself the gospel and that's what is revealed in the gospels and what is the going button supposed to set it up front and then I started reading common trees in our clothes and things on Romans 13 and full and I discovered the very interesting thing the particularly in the German tradition which is dominant in scholarship in the nineteenth and early Twentieth Century people did not want to find the gospel in Romans 13 and 4 because they wanted the gospel to be even justification by faith within a Lutheran framework where is what you going to Romans 13 and 4 is very explicit Messianic language seed of David at cetera and so people would bring out all the big guns and say okay pulling his head coaching and other Jewish Christian formula
 just in order to say hello to the people in Rome yeah I know this woman as well but actually it's not an essential part of his theology has been Common Core and I agree I agree it will be funny when you're writing you a great big carefully planned bless her what you going to say I'm from something you don't really mean and I'll give you a break and it's like the the wrong reading the collections one for which by the way could serve as another summer he doesn't say it's Evangelion but you said the Messiah gave himself to rescue us from the present evil age that looks like another summary and it's exactly the same point Blue Mountain Dew is a people of K Simon says he doesn't really mean that gave himself for our sins bit that's in order to say hello to the opponent's what he really means is to rescue Us in the present Evil 8 I don't they know those two bins on appsolutely together they explain one another for the same way at the beginning of Romans you've got this explicitly
 Messianic language which I think than contextualizes all the stuff about christof's later unless it because crystals is not a proper name Kristoff mean is Messiah whenever you find and Christo Etc is this is the Messiah and his people in this was the beginning of my exploration of Romans which led me to say the Romans 9 to 11 is not simply of the side and a bit about the Jews but he's actually weather whole day is going so once one grasps the Romans 13 and full must not be marginalised in favor of particular readings of 1st Corinthians 15 and then this becomes clear within the first Corinthians 15 and one should be able to get it from Simply the fact that uses the word kristof's because if this is another formula then there's no way that crystal says it is just a is a pumpkin a meeting your late 40s early 50s a d that means massage how do we know pulled me aside because in 1st Corinthians 15 2228 when he's spelling out how the gospel.
 he works he is drawing precisely on those Messianic Psalms said before some Tucson 810-1007 in order to say that the Messiah through whom God is putting everything into older and that the Messiah has an is the one who was raining to these put everything under his wings etcetera and so the Messianic exposition of the 1st Corinthians 15:3 following verses 24 means that the two are not so far apart to find the gospel as Messiah buried and was raised but the significance of that little micro story tying it into the in exhausted new human over the nation's is what the rest of the chapter goes on to be about a know that's exactly what he says
 what has happened in scholarship is that you can see this if you look at the look at the Nestle aland Greek tax return to its parallel passages in the margin here you've got the scriptures Isaiah 53:5 a 12 oz on the scriptures and yeah okay but that misses the point in this is not just by the way I can find a proof text I received which comes to focus in various passages and I would say if you want to know which scripture is Porter's referring to it as later in the passage read 1st Corinthians 15 turns out to be a massive christological exegesis of Genesis 1 2 and 3 and I got about a damn about the fool about the restoration of cetera within which the Messianic
 thumbs and so on on this dude and it's an extraordinary to the force of groups relaxing music ending up with 25 and Jose are 13 death is swallowed up in Victory to Waterview golf as sometimes when pool is really something things up you have to if he even moving the prophets and writings he does this in rims 15 he doesn't I think in collections. It's a Jewish way of saying we've got the whole scripture on side outside you didn't have fun but yes that is fine I want to follow up on questions for yes so what you're saying is in both cases and the Romans one statement in the hole if your screens in 15 it's not different in substance in the narrative argument of the four gospels exact exactly this is one of the things when you really think pulls gospel through to its goal it's tell us if you look back and you say
 you tell the story of Jesus to bring this house is it Lee Hooke into the Hebrew scriptures read as an as yet unfinished narrative they are saying in effect you know this great story Malachi of Luke does it by echoing 1st Samuel John desert by a coup in Genesis and now this is what it was I think it's quite so that's not the case is radicalism is on the side of the moon
so let's make a deal and this conversation on a well to me all of this is immensely practical but it's also a Theology and it's on but I served in pastoral Ministry for many years you have for many years to there is a neatness and handiness to a definition of the Gospel that rises above this very detailed multi-layer narrative to just say humans are screwed up God has to do something about it Jesus died for your stand can't believe this is really handy of course your short selling the story that we really have to offer the world we do that so I guess you could ask historical version is how did we get to a place where did that short version has replaced the biblical version but maybe even more useful is in practical ways in and through the way is that local churches operate how can we begin to talk
 about this big complicated narrative in ways that are just as simple in handy. Yeah that's a great question and yes I remember going to a lecture on the atonement in Oxford When I Was An undergraduate and the lecture set out all the different theories and all these wonderful bits and pieces and bells and whistles of the end of it somebody said how much of this does somebody have to believe a Christian Electra smiled and said very little about your love of God the death of Jesus and Discovery material part of that story and then once you cross that will be Ross buys everything else is yours to explore about another was you that need to understand all the theory in order to me like you did you know I had a really good meal in a restaurant yesterday I know nothing about the signs of how you cook but I enjoy the meal.
 going to happen if you Jesus died so now I'm okay much better than they think that then they think life is just a meaningless bunch of trash and I'm just going to go on the street and do drugs and it has no choice but the danger was saying God is really angry with me for Chinese punish somebody else instead so now I'm okay is that that distorts deeply who you think God is and it from Kate's who I now am as a redeemed person in Christ and drop by the spirit and in order to get the whole picture you need the biggest story and I think it went wrong particularly in the Middle Ages in the western church I don't know very much about Eastern Orthodoxy but I do know they didn't make the same mistakes as we made in in the medieval. They know. Make their own mistakes and Sentra and that's why we all need constantly to have our Visions corrected by a fresh readings of scripture this is not something which happens once a month I need to go
 open in every generation but it seems to me that you can see stages where the great teachers in the Middle Ages who were doing some great things in some ways are inscrutable to Greek philosophy I display two or as to Aristotle or some new mixtures of both so that then by the time you get the reformers protest thing about purgatory and the mass which of the two big Target sitting in the English Reformation think what they are doing is reinstating a platonic vision of Christianity only with a going straight to have involved in having to do time in poetry thing with a the Heavenly stuff is the important things that what we do down here doesn't count cuz that would be Works righteousness so Denver think that if you are a priest at the altar you can do this magic with with the bread and the one that's a political reason for doing what they are doing in other words are trying to give biblical ounces to Medieval questions the danger is that actually giving biblical strike platonic Oz
 evil questions on what's happened since then with the enlightenment this is to the cutting a very long story very short is the place that takes over and the Bible. Add that the Bible just becomes oh this is Autotext route by which we can prove all that his girlfriend said that much Weston 19th century Christianity you still claiming to be teaching of the church really do explicitly prefer Play here's to the Bible and I think that is that saps the life and energy from the Gospel of Jesus it means that instead of Resurrection you have old Jesus was taken up into heaven from where he appeared and from time to time and then we're waiting to be taken up into heaven as well and that's the real thing seeing God in heaven instead of saying no Jesus told us to pray for God's kingdom to come on Earth as in Heaven by by what right to you there's nothing. I was just a matter of our face
 I think it's absolutely fine if the name of the game is and we have these Souls which if exiled from heaven and will looking forward to going back there then Mission becomes telling other people that they have souls or exiled of the need to go to heaven that's never the mission of the church the mission of the church is to be the light of the world in this world to the other two I think it goes back to the middle ages under the fact that the reformers who were determined to try to give biblical oz to Medieval question borrowed funky Plato to do so because they assumed that the Jewish context was not in the irrelevant but misleading because it was about Works righteousness and so we don't want to go to that run into this as well if I post qumran or Songs of Solomon or 4th Ezra or whatever to explain what's going on in the gospels were pulled some people I could name in America and drop the hounds and horses
 it appeals to these Jewish texts but we know that pool was opposed to Judaism because he knew that was what is righteousness so empty righteous is drawing on these they have these naughty texts interesting yeah yeah yeah I want to say sorry we were into history yeah you want to know what the word righteousness of God means to look at other people using it to the old has a new definition of it but it strikes me just as I was reflecting on what you were saying in many ways the gospel narratives about Jesus announcing the good news about the kingdom giving The Sermon on the Mount of Duty his healings and then one of the new Christian in my twenties I read those stories and it was it was awesome I thought that Jesus is amazing and I am called to participate in a similar-looking and kind of announcement that's like the thing that Jesus died
 and then the thing that I do now is some other things kind of what you're talking about based on a certain way of reading Paul the Risen Jesus in the last census Matthew says teach my disciples to do everything I commanded you and talk to you where do I go find that even with in Matthew Jesus has a vision of how his followers will live in announce the kingdom will be the thing that he was himself doing what else is The Sermon on the Mount to live and talked about the Risen Jesus as king and living as if it's true Sermon on the Mount there that's like that's like there's the agenda danger with the way to read The Sermon on the Mount is this then just has become so here is a Christian ethic from Natchez then put into this post Enlightenment frame we're here things you believe
 and here's how you supposed to behave and if you find that difficult will try harder will pray for Spiritual something rather than seeing this is 12:00 right on which is only see Courtney young I ran into this actually the person I ran into at through was cuz who ties commentary on Genesis G80 to he is right for Trinity somebody recommended that to me when I was very young and I think it was the first commentary on Genesis I read right through it but the way he drawers out and how the story actually would make so much that they make an observation that that promise to Abraham is both a 7 line poem in Genesis 12 and a curse five occurrences of the word blessing
 the word cursed in Genesis 12 11 I love that the beginning of the few years ago I was joking with my oldest grandson who must have been about ten or eleven of us something about the Bible came up and I forget why but I said did you know the beginning of Genesis 1 and I got that he provided he doesn't read Hebrew cuz like I said look precious and about that for a long time I said yes you do okay on but isn't I love how this is why I've enjoyed doing these words study project stuff because in a way it's about exploring the whole storyline of the Bible
 that's right angles of vocabulary to my mind is the answer to James Bond's critique own because of us both to know that he had this huge box project to do very detailed study of all the words and bar is quite right to say that philology alone doesn't get you that and that you need an hour to contact buddy for me to study in the woods has forced me into the narrative the problem with the kids or thing the woods. Either way he did it is Hebrew dictionary but it went home through the wall and finished in the 1950s and it's it's of the woodwork for the week new test multi-volume and and I feel the show myself I still use it but it's very interesting and Inwood
 the word afterward and they take pictures Faith you have a section which is on 2nd of meetings and then you have the religious and of course what happens is that we now know and I mean no that these uses I'll totally fluid tonight but you can't separate fist is as in reliability of trustworthiness etcetera that uses to Norm dishes as in face with cushions I meant by faith that those to completely go alongside to tease out different context of meaning but then to say well because we are into religion or faith we are looking at these ones of those ones those are not look well. Then allowed in the 1930s kisses religion over here and the secular world has to do it to anything I mean I agree then with all sorts of critiques of that meth
 but I think that the answer is better words. He's not abandoning words that say what is the story here yeah yeah that's good well thank you that was enjoyable conversation to write good news
 listening to the Bible project podcast we are going to have a few more conversations on how to read the genre of literature that we refer to as the gospels of Matthew Mark Luke John fossil digging a lot more as to what is this good news is and why and how Jesus talked about it so much is a non-profit Animation Studio in Portland Oregon we make videos study notes other resources and this podcast because of the generous support of lots of viewers and listeners to this podcast just like you so you guys thank you for listening and thank you for being a part of this with us we are from California Los Angeles onion haseo project from
 play YouTube recommendation list and ever since then I started watching the videos and ever since I started watching the videos and made a really clear understanding of what certain characters go through and certain situations and ever since then I continue to watch in those really great videos where and how it helped her understand the Bible as it is a whole story so I love the fact that most of our project is being so many more videos on dematic John resin everything Bible project to do to you and then I'm going to take it easy
 beautiful
