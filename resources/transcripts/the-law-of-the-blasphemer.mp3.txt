this is our last conversation in the scroll of Leviticus the Israelites in the wilderness they've made a covenant with God who is now settled in there in a secret and called The Tabernacle and God wants is real to come near to him and so he provides Israel a sacrificial system which is administered by the priests it's a sacred task being a priest going into the hot spots of God's presence on behalf of Israel priests have to pay attention to how they take care of the Tabernacle that is really what do they care for like the tent isn't their responsibility for the priests so we're going to see in the section is it developing Motif that what Israelites care for the holy things that they possess in their mist is the name of Yahweh whose name they carry and so there's this repeated phrase you are the most repeated phrases through Leviticus 1727 about the file in yahweh's name don't defile yahweh's name
 did the file something is to take something that is fully and treat it like it's comment and we find out the final in yahweh's name is a big deal cuz you taking something that you always uniquely Alvarez and you're treating it like it's yours like you can do what you want with it if you remember back in accident Israel gets the Ten Commandments and the third commandment is don't take the lord's name in vain better translated don't carry the lord's name in vain and other words take this seriously you are making a covenant with the Creator God the source of all life it's always name and hold enough that's just keeping you all alive out here in the desert and so don't defile the name people who dishonor the sacred gift of yahweh's person in presents name in their myths it's like you're starting off the branch that you're sitting on it will look at the ways that is real can defile God's name and if that's it
 it is a confusing little story it's shorts and cryptic in a little disturbing it's a little narrative Parable that is commenting on the larger themes of the section that this is a people set apart for life and to Bear yahweh's name from John Collins this is Bible project podcast today to Mackey and I explore the law of the blasphemer thanks for joining us here we go
ATM hey John this is that this is our last stop in Leviticus in Leviticus 9 conversations in Leviticus and I feel like we just scratched the surface of all the goodies that are in here but we've taken a good dive into the book into its main themes and design has been really rewarding for me I don't spend much time at all in this book I mean really ever an obscure law from it or something in there so maybe one more time I'll do a quick overview of The Book of Leviticus it's the center Scroll of the five Scrolls of the Torah but even within the shape of the five Scrolls you have Genesis and Deuteronomy it's the outer book end so to speak and inside of that is three Scrolls that really linked together in the important sequence Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Leviticus is the heart of that
 Central set of stories so God is on a mission to find a human partner to rule having a nurse with so that God's image and character can be displayed to the nations of the earth through human partner and so at this point in the story God has chosen the nation of Israel entered into a covenant partnership with them and Mount Sinai and then what's the people said yes double thumbs up we want to part of Yahweh and got this great let's move in and so he has a special sacred tent constructed and he comes to live among his people and that's how the Book of Leviticus begins with the crisis of God coming to live among his people you thought it was great and it is great but it is also dangerous which is why Moses can't go in at the end of Exodus so God in the first movement of Leviticus provided a way for his people to come near to sacrifice
 suffering has chapters 1 through 7 and then once his people do come near the second movement of Leviticus chapter 28 to 16 God appoints in ordains is real a subset within Israel come near on behalf of the nation and on the first day on the job to the priests just blow it big time and they do what do Hawaii has not commanded them to do so they died those two priests died on the spot on day one, and that creates another crisis that there's death dead bodies introduced into the very hot spot of the source of life and so God tells Aaron and the remaining Sons to stop drinking before they come into the tent so they have a sober mind of wisdom to teach Israel the difference between Foley and common between Purity and impurity then Purity and impurity sets the tone for the rest
 chapters 11 through 16 leading up to the day of atonement when Israel's impurities or dealt with once a year and their sins are sent off an X-File that's right and so that leaves for this last part of the book now that the way of Yahweh has been opened back up again to live among his people even though their computer and morally compromised he wants to live in their midst the day of atonement and all the offerings make that possible so now they always comes to live amongst people what's the goal the goal is that the 10th facilitates a meeting between Yahweh and his people so that they can become more and more holy and set apart and more faithful images of God's character in the world and so we looked at the laws given for the Holiness of the people and we also looked at the way Sabbath in the structures of time in the Liturgy of time in Israel
 it's all designed to make some people whose whole lives are oriented Around The Way of the Lord and that's the section of the book that when there's a house that that's great that's good summary and here at the end we talked about the Sabbath as his weekly timer 20 and then 7 we might have festivals mowad know Ed is one of those meeting times and then the moedim the name is the meeting times at meetings I love you and so there's seven of them you walked through those they're all shaping you to live in the Rhythm through the practice of time and place and also the daily Lights of the seven lamp Menorah that are tended to every morning and evening and then the Sabbath bread that's replaced it's all of that the 7 meeting times the daily lights shining on the Sabbath bread that's renewed every seventh day
 the image it's an ideal symbolic ritual image of the way Israel is recreated as a bask in the glory of yahweh's light and experiences rest and eat throughout the meeting times of the year and you're like a ray I mean we're not back in Ethan but we've got a little eating Outpost among the people if they lived this way this is great what could go wrong and it's sort of like Pavlov's dogs you know the famous is it a bell ring a ring a bell and they would start to celebrate the bells sociate with getting food so that they would ring a bell give dogs food how many times then they could just ring a bell in the doctor salivate that you're hearing the bells of The Seventh-Day rest and food and be still ready for the fall and you're like this is great you're just by this point that he revived
 you know something's about to go terribly terribly wrong and something is going to go wrong before we get there I want us to follow up some tracks that have been laid to get us to the place of the points in the final movement of the book there is a particular phrase that's repeated over and over and over and over again about yahweh's name so here's what's interesting even though the tent is in the middle of the camp of Israel the Tabernacle is and it's a bounded by a courtyard screen fence and so Israelites it's our Pure they can go in the back Toys R Us but it's not like kids are going there to play soccer right now dedicated it's a fairly limited access. That big sure that's right that's right but even so the fact that is bounded by that screen means it's not and Israel I can go in there but if you're there to do business with our way through the priest
 the most part is the priest space if something goes wrong in there it's the priest fault cuz they didn't do the Liturgy right but here in this section of the book there's this emphasis it's the first time that God speaks to all the Israelites in the Book of Leviticus and the laws that we looked at the Holiness laws Holiness laws are for all the people and remember these are a kingdom of priests a holy nation one of the Ten Commandments is don't carry the name of Yahweh in vain in a way that frustrates the purpose for which God called you to be his representatives and so the priests have to pay attention to how they take care of the tent in the Tabernacle for the Israelites what what do they care for like the 10th is their responsibility as for the priest so we're going to see in the section is a developing Motif that what is relaxed care for the holy thing that they possess in their midst is the name of Yahweh
 whose name they carry and so there's this repeated phrase all through those were the most repeated phrases through Leviticus 1727 about defiling yahweh's name it's the verb of the word common or profane some others that binary of this holy set apart for Yahweh and then there's what's common in common is not bad no no and it's a starting place that's neutral but making something that is Holy and treating it as common yeah yeah cuz you're taking something that you always uniquely Alvarez and you're treating it like it's yours like you can do what you want with it so this would be like the priests you know somebody's bringing sacrifice and the priests just like naps in the back that's a really nice goat that motion just brought in here right now and I'm going to before anybody Moshe he just grabs it takes it to his house I'll be the filing
 something that belongs to Yahweh so in this section of the book she finally means making something common that was wholly something that is set apart for the president's the purpose of Yahweh and treating it as a normal everyday wear and tear and I can be degrading it that can be treating it like it's normal and not special treating it like it's mine instead of recognizing it belongs there's lots of West Jeff so I just want to do a quick survey here are different ways that Israelites can defile the name to be all the way in this section of the book so here's a command view Israelites shall not give it any of your Offspring to offer them to Molech who's like underworld deity of the dead and so don't press and the name of your God I'm Yahweh
 sacrificing your children to another God is taking the reputation of Yahweh and degrading it defiling it so I can see where that makes the list so here is one when you offer a sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord so this is one of the offerings where you take an animal and it's slaughtered if blood is life is offered to surrender over the highway but you get off a bunch of meat back so make sure you eat it on the same day you have two days to have a party with the meat
 but if you eat on the third day or any day after go get you are profaning that Holy thing of the Lord so you're taking that thing that you always gave back to you and you're trying to milk at 4 it's kind of like use as a gift have a big party and if you have some left over I guess that means you haven't shared enough is it also at this is a sanitation thing may be too. Could be but what's interesting is if you keep this offering for too long you're defiling making comment you making comment but it's saying that thing that actually belongs to you. Set apart for a purpose you always loans the animal back to you to have a party there and you're not getting the name in at the front of the name for preventing that whole thing
 don't swear a false Oath by my name and so profane the name was his name I swear by the name of Yahweh I'll pay you back for that meal next week and then next week comes around you like the well I'm sorry I just next week maybe you know so you use use you always name for promise and I like both of your credibility which you knew was it was fake you're just abusing you always credibility if someone dies in the priests family the priests cannot go and a baryon touch the dead body of a relative unless it's his mother his father his son. His brother or sister anybody else he will Proclaim himself then speaking of burying people priest is not to shave their head
 lost their beard or make any Cuts in the flesh were talking here about mourning rituals a grieving rituals those are all shaving her head cutting yourself do the things that joke does the priests are to be wholly to Yahweh their God and not profane the name of Yahweh the priests can profane the name of Yahweh by taking on physical likenesses of death as they grieve for the debt cuz they're supposed to represent the ideal human going in God's presence and so it's like making themselves, in which is going to make the whole thing totally, then let's see the high priest cannot touch any dead body of any member of his family he is not to leave the sanctuary he would profane it if he does took the high priest is like he belongs to Yahweh he doesn't really
 to have life kind of an intense job Joe so you get a conclusion here in chapter 22 so you all shall keep my Commandments and do them I am Yahweh do not profane my Holy Name rather I will be Sanctified among the sons of Israel think the 50 something is to purify it that right yea or to treat it as holy Sanctified something is a treat as holy okay to become wholly to transfer it into the realm of the whole day from common to Holy that's the same computer price that's right so don't treat my holy name as something common rather I will be treated as Holy by the sons of Israel I am Yahweh who makes you whole so I'm the one who makes you wholly if you treat me as if I'm not wholly you're only damaging ground ecosystem of holiness
 2 verse 32 don't treat my holy name as if it's not wholly I will be treated as holy among you I'm the one who makes you whole in the first place so it's sort of like if you treat me as if I'm something other than I really am but trust me you don't want to go down that road it will not end well for you notice how prominent the phrase a 16 x in the section right here of chapters 17 through 20 to this idea care is one more time in the book and it's in this odd little story that we're looking at right here and it's sandwich right in between the list of the meeting places in his people and then the story about the Jubilee year in the story goes something like this
now there was a son of an Israelite woman whose father was an Egyptian
 and so that son who is half is right half a Gyptian so in Egyptian would be doing the father's with them think the father came. Doesn't say doesn't say so it could be that the father is an immigrant or could be that the father was an Egyptian like back when they were in Egypt cuz I've only been gone less than a year does Israel have a Gyptian and he went out among the sons of Israel and the Israelite women's son and then a man who was a full Israelite well they got into a fight with each other in the camp and the son of the Israelite women pierced the name and treated as cursed treated the name is cursed yeah there's no object of the verb to treat this curse this awkward and Hebrew the son of the Israelite women pierced the name and treated it as cursed presumably treated the name
 curse right so they brought this guy in front of Moses and you should know his mother's name was payback Shalom eat from the word shalom means to befall okay completely to be repaid in full or Shalom is Paul Nassif his mom's name was payback Sheila meet the daughter of my word debris from the tribe of judgment Dan so they arrested him in at keeping place so that the command of Yahweh might become clear to them that arrested him into keeping place this is really it's really cryptic language it's the Hebrew Bible what do you expect so to rest him means to the narrative about to accept and put him but this is what God does to the human when he makes the human of the dirt and then puts him in
 Panda Garden the garden and then says to the human to work the land and keep it and here they put him in a keeping place cuz it's a little Eden in the middle of the Wilderness so they put him in a keeping place and they need to hear what y'all way they don't know what to do should be clear skies in a fight yeah or a real I have to do a Chinese in a fight and he pierces the name not treated as cursed yeah okay this little word to pierce the name this is a fascinating little word I love the Hebrew Bible quotes on the weekend. Probably clear by the time that I really enjoy reading the Hebrew Bible
 so this word has related words in Arabic North Syrian to drill a hole or to pierce its use in the Hebrew Bible is to bore through something to pierce or to punch through into it it is sometimes used maybe to like prick off they didn't use pen and paper like we did to make less so sometimes if they have tablet they would maybe like scratch little check marks and so some people think that to prick the name means to make a checkmark which doesn't make a ton of stand here but this is what this guy does he drilled into the name Pierce has the name which definitely a metaphor
 so yeah this guy's in a fight and for one reason or another he does something to the name described as piercing it or poking it and then that's explained as treating the name of Yahweh as this it's as if it's nothing from the Hebrew word color or Colour which means to treat as if it's light or nothing so so this word cursed there's a few words to curse in Hebrew so I can pronounce a curse on you but if that's the opposite of a blessing and that would be asking God to bring Misfortune and sickness and death upon you and your family or something like that so this word is when you treat someone publicly as if they are cursed or love status to mean dishonor yeah yeah it's about public dishonor and disgrace he treats the name as if it's nothing it's the word kolel the phrase
 profane the name is Carla so all those passages that we read don't find the name don't friend the name it's called L and then this is he call out the name so Rhymes to make comment is halo-halo and to like dishonors,, yeah the name and he treats it like it's dirt so presumably he says the name of Yahweh as a curse word yeah at the minimum at the minimum so they bring this guy for Moses cuz they're like you know what we don't know what to do this guy is not fully Israelite is half Israelite what do we do here maybe you can get a pass if you can get a pass so the Lord spoke to Moses saying bring that one who has cursed outside the camp
 let everybody who heard him lay their hands on his head then let all the congregation Stone it was dumped outside the camp
 and if you shall say to the sons of Israel saying if anyone treats his Elohim as cursed then he will bear the consequences of his failure more over the one who pierces the name of Yahweh will surely be put to death the congregational Stoneham The Immigrant as well as the native-born the one who pierces the name be put to death the way that that's phrase makes me think it's more than cursing the name he says to treat Elohim has cursed then he will bear his sin and that's check the post piercing the name put to death to death and so it seems like it's piercing the name is something more intense than just cursing the name yeah so I learned a lot here by interesting study the Hebrew Bible scholar to Marconi on Kowski who's written a lot on the section of Leviticus in your academic work
 pictures of article on this story so she makes the argument that in this section of the book the holy name of Yahweh that is on the people that sets them apart among the nation's is the holy sacred object that's available to any Israelite they carry the name of the people and they can through their actions with each other to file the name or profane it but how you treat you know your neighbor and so it's analogous with the name is to your average Israelite is the same as what the tent is to the priests and so she makes us argument does this image of piercing the name and so defiling it is being set on analogy to the sons of Aaron inappropriately pierced through the curtains and went into the tent on authorized and violating the command of Yahweh and so died
 because what's interesting is there is three stories linked together by the vocabulary of this so one is everybody lays their hands on this guy's head and takes him outside the camp and that's the language used of the goat set away to other cell in the wilderness where they lay the sins upon him and Exile him that was also the first used of the two sons of Erin who inappropriately barged into the tent they were killed and then they're dead bodies were taken outside the camp so you have the portrait hear of people who dishonor the sacred gift of yahweh's person in presents name in their midst has liked your song off the branch that you're sitting on as an Israelite it's yahweh's name and Holiness. Just keeping you all alive out here in the desert and you're going to profane the name or curse the name
 the story's not done yet this gets even more week actually complicated and interesting that want to keep going keep going but is it a capital offense to curse God's name in ancient Israel it isn't a story, story it is and I mean other times I'm trying to think they're there isn't another story like this in the Hebrew Bible is there any law around ya in the book of Exodus there's a command about not cursing God okay does it have a capital offense associated with it now it's good
 Exodus 22:28 you shall not curse Elohim Norcross a ruler of your people don't do it don't do it so it raises questions about like what was like how often did this happen and that the interesting question but the story has been put into the scroll of Leviticus a part of a communication pattern to help us has a purpose here and it has Toys R Us instruction for us yeah what the tent in the holy of holies is to the priest that they are to safeguard and protect and treat his precious and holy so the name of Yahweh is to any and every Israelite so much so
 that this Israelite Bears the same consequences that the sons of Aaron did when they Dishonored the tent and this guy also Bears the same fate as the goat send out of the camp on the day of atonement is interesting some reason was popping my mind is the kryptek thing around the unpardonable sin blaspheming the Holy Spirit and it's also making common sense in the context of the Pharisees are accusing Jesus of being in League with the powers of the evil one and Jesus says listen if I have power over the evil one I can't be in League with evil on first of all and then second of all if you blaspheme the Holy Spirit you're actually rejecting
 the only one who can give you life you're rejecting your very life so by definition you can't be forgiven for rejecting the one who is trying to save your life what you're saying here I can't soft brand so you're sitting on the exactly yeah I think that Paradox it's it's meant to be a sobering trips but it's trying to communicate Torah to us instruction for an Israelite they live and exist because of the name of Yahweh member in The Exodus story that's one of the main motive that you always doing what he's doing so that Israel and Egypt will know that I am Yahweh and so to take that name and reputation and to pierce it treated as if it's nothing is to destroy your your own identity your own self because the whole nation is priesthood that represented the name you Cara
what's interesting is after this death sentence with issued for the name cursor then there's another little legal paragraph here that set is an analogy, psychlo Parable and that goes like this if a human takes the life of any other human being they will be put to death that's the life for Life rule a retribution in ancient Israel the one who takes the life of an animal he shall repay it life for life is a man injures his neighbor just as he is done so it will be done to him fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth just as he injured a human so it will be inflicted on him the one who kills an animal will make a good and the one who kills a human will be put to death there should be one standard for you for their immigrant and the native-born I mean
 doesn't matter is gyptian Israelite like we are all accountable yeah yeah so there's legal reasoning happening here if you take the life of another human your life becomes forfeit if you take the life of an animal and animals life in their economies worth less than human life so you have to repay it with money but Life For Life you can't take somebody's life for killing your animal in other words the recompense that you deal to someone has to be at like Fair adequate to the level of thing that they wrong that's what this whole paragraphs about and it's a meditation it's helping you meditate on what's the severe what why such a severe punishment for the one who pierces the name before we like go back a minute on that is retribution laws we've talked about this in terms of The Sermon on the Mount cuz she's as close to us and then he says I say to you don't repay evil at all
 yeah that's right in this conversation you pointed out to me that these aren't laws about like how much you can get away with another license for Revenge isn't a license for exactly this is about putting brakes on retribution that's right limiting our impulse to deal out retribution lavishly has put a ceiling on so yeah anyone who takes the life of their animal you can't take the life of their child right you have to repay the monetary value the animal someone like breaks your tooth to break their neck and that makes a lot of sense and the Jesus Takes the wisdom behind that which is let's put a limit on our impulse retribution and he just turned it all the way up into that don't repay evil exactly right that's interesting but then you're saying if there needs to be an adequate or a measure the type of Retribution
 can you bring that back up to what happens to this guy who pierces the name is it is fair recompense for someone to lose their life because they unjustly took the life of another human and their legal conomy that's considered fair and just so if losing your life for taking the life of another human is that becomes this little commentary on will how much valium us the name of Yahweh have it's the consequence for cursing it means death is it as simple as this is a this is a fight we know what the fight was like why that detail did he kill this guy so it doesn't say that doesn't say no but then the next paragraph is like hey you can someone you get killed exactly yeah it makes you kind of go back up and go oh yeah they were fighting
 like maybe piercing the name had something to do with killing an image of God oh I was taking it to me in something different this narrative is a riddle is hiding all kinds of little details on purpose to make you stare at this thing and figure it out what do you think the details the fight is all about I think that's that I can wear dressing on the brothers struggling brother struggling struggling but there's another reason he says he is put to death for cursing the name that's what it says what the cursing the name is is connected to piercing the name that's right which is different than merely cursing a name right because you cursing name yeah you're accountable to that here's the name you die yeah there's something else going on here with piercing a name yeah yeah it's okay it's two ways this go one could be
 The Narrative is hiding in a detail that you're supposed to imply that piercing the name means he did something more than merely said he merely God's name in vain using an increase in God's name treating it as if it's nothing by the way that means like oh yeah you're horrible like what yeah it doesn't say the name publicly disgraced the name and then you get this other law after it that says listen capital punishment should only be reserved for the most gravest of crimes
 no specifically taking the life of another human life in the human yeah so you could say they're for its implying that he killed the guy that was fighting with it could also be the case that it's setting these two laws a guy who curse God's name got put to death and dealt with like the goat on the day of atonement and got dealt with like the rebellious sons of Erin who also just filed the name of Yahweh by their Rebellion by implication so you get that portrait of this guy of curses the name and he's put to death and then you get this law that says people are only put to death if there's a crime worthy really worthy of that severity of punishment
 mainly taking life
 in this case in the laws of retaliation of taking a wife so it could be that it sang to curse the name of Yahweh is such a moral equivalent of the moral equivalent of taking a human life. That's what I think the narrative is trying to communicate okay that's interesting and you're saying look for Israelites being set apart of the kingdom of priests the one thing that they have that they get to protect is the name of the eye and it's also the thing that sets them apart it's the thing the rescued them the name of Yahweh is as precious as life itself yes yeah no we get the story the story is Tora it's hard to imagine that they're killing everyone who says you know
 and that the story doesn't spell that out in other words we might have questions about how it was this was implemented all the time was that many people did this and not the interesting question but it's a different question than saying what's the function of the story in its literary context in Leviticus and it just so happens this is the last time that they should have the name of Yahweh comes up like this and all the thread of occurrences I'm actually really enjoying that you saw the end of the story I just I didn't think we would spend this much time on it but I am I like that you're into it but this is a good example of a strange story disturbing to me about it I'm trying to get a sympathetic hearing I mean you could argue that the response of the death of the two sons of Aaron was also you know little intent but they're the narrative was also trying to help us see that the others I think for me I digested the death of two sons of
 this way one they're priests there more accountable and they went rogue and so yeah I still that's still pretty intense to kill him but like if you just live in a society where it's like the death penalty for saying a curse word that feels a little bit more unnerving and chaotic than like the guy at the people who are signed up to be the priests have to do it right still that's hard but the second way that helps me with it is that it's a reflection on what what it's like the image of God to go Rogue choose to take the forbidden fruit and when Adam and Eve did that it was deaf and so this story is meditating on that and here is the people who are supposed to have to be replaying the true human on his behalf
 I quoted that scholar tomorrow come into house key so I'll just I'll call her from her essay here she says the name is that aspect of God that serves as a kind of port or meeting place between Divine and human following God's laws expands that portal and allows more Holiness to enter into this community you shall be holy as I am Holy and breaking of those laws results in defilement of the name that is a contraction of the portal minimizes the Holiness of the community and God's ability to make them all the time so those contractions the profaning of the name it strains the Divine human relationship impacting both partners because the name was a primary vehicle or access point for connection between the Israelite in the Divine it's natural that the name we need to be careful of guard
 but she thinks the story is trying to communicate do you think there's a lot of hyperbole in the story in a way of like yes the name needs to be protected but the guy is like he sent outside the city he treated like the scapegoat. We're all the sins of Israel are placed on this sent out to like them than anybody has anybody who heard him it's as if like directed by here at like their ears were made in pure yeah I'm totally yeah and then he's killed that whole thing almost feels like a little absurd on purpose maybe it's a sacrifice is a sacrifice as it were and you don't have a sense that this ever happens this doesn't happen normally no it's not told that it's a lot that you were supposed to do this to someone curses the name right we don't get any other stories of this ever happening now it's a little narrative Parable that is commenting on the larger themes of the section that
 this is the people set apart for life and to Bear yahweh's name and the fact that he's half a Gyptian is that woman has had the laws were really interested in that this is the same law for the Immigrant or for Israel so you're going to live in this community whether you are by blood or not then you need to follow the same severe possibilities that were put on the priests for bearing the name of Yahweh into the tent are here through this story being placed on every Israelite because God's holiness is for all of them so they are all in danger but also the God's holiness is both good and keeps them all alive and protects them from death and gives the Mana and water in the wilderness and it's so dangerous is that same team that also comes out later in the Hebrew Bible in the story of David when he's bringing the Ark of the Covenant up to Jerusalem and everybody's he's dancing
 and then there's that guy who so who thinks the Ark of the Covenant about to slip off the cart and then touches it so he sends out his hand and he posted on the spot and all party shuts down and David's frustrated and so these narratives are exploring the Paradox of being the Covenant people of God who are given a great responsibility which is both a gift but also and very dangerous location when you're dealing with a God who is a fire
 weather turned into mostly conversation about this is called the law of the blasphemer so here's what's interesting this is the story the story is the little center it's the little boy yeah I was going to what's the the meatless hamburgers what are those called with Beyond beef burgers part of Leviticus is a little sandwich chapter 23 on the first part of 24 and I was all about The Seventh-Day rest and psychosis Tabitha and song and how Israel is set apart to bask in the glory of the divine presence and you get this story but we just meditate it on for quite a while and then you get the last three chapters there the other part of the bun sew the buttons on both sides are all about Sabbath rest in 72 the last three are about the Year of Jubilee the last three are about the Year of Jubilee and then also the anti Jubilee
 that is exile yeah you for sharing this and that you said that you said something about all of Israel piercing the name is 25 we don't have time to read it but it's about how every seventh year the land is to be given a Sabbath rest for an entire year Alandra yeah you got the man dressed and then every seven times seventh year after the land has been given its seventh year rest you give it an additional 50th year of rest and that year of rest is called the Jubilee and lots of other cool stuff happened amazing things happen if in the course of the last 49 years you went financially upside down on your land and you lost your family land that you know your great ancestor Reuben got back when Joshua distributed the land to the Israelites
 guess what you get all that land back they got bought up by you know your relative down the road is from the tribe of Manasseh you get it all back any debts that you have and put you in that may be in that slavery to somebody else your debts forgiven you get to go free this is a Liberation that's inactive every seven times 7 years year the Year of jubilees and there's two key principles here for why they would do such a thing it's Leviticus 25:23 the land can never be sold permanently because the land is actually mine forgot my says you all are just emigrants and York a few camping on my land now you done it for a really long time but it's my land
 and what I say is every seven times seven years there's a Sabbath reset and we go back to the Eden like set up for when Joshua distributed the land powerful principal and I think I've heard that there's no evidence I've ever actually been done well not outside the Hebrew Bible there's a reference and Jeremiah and Ezra to some attempts to do something like it to forgive that but yeah are most substantial evidence for it is just the fact that it's in the Book of Leviticus and it's definitely reflects a time early in Israel's history Because by the time they are under the shadow of Assyria Babylon like we wouldn't be able to do that so yeah in Jesus's time you know Romans on more land than the Israelites do so this definitely reflects a practice from early early in their tribal history that's one thing
 but we're actually we could reference back to the archive we have a whole conversation on this chapter we take a deep dive in the Sabbath so the land is to be freed every seven times seven years that also is really any Israelite who was enslaved because of debt slavery so let's say they had that they went to. They had to sell their daughter or son or themselves into debt service to another Israelite their debts are forgiven and they go out the most common term for freedom from that kind that service in this chapter is to go out which is the same word used as the Exodus to go out from Egypt but you go out Liberation crate get set up sounds really really generous and yeah and it has its own kind of fairness next chapter
 don't make for yourselves any Idols don't make any images I'm Yahoo for this before keep my Sabbath day we recycling some the greatest hits here that's right if you walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments and carry them out guess what I will give you Reigns and their season the land will give you its fruit trees of the field will bear their fruit your thrashing Harvest will last you until the grape Harvest and then your grape Harvest will last you until you so see it again man you will eat food until you are stopping at the same letters as the number 7 filled up and you will live with security on the land I'm going to give you shalom in the land
 it's going to be no evil Beast the snakes while animals are your enemies won't chase you you'll Chase your enemies five of you will chase a hundred a hundred will chase 10,000 I will turn to you I will make you fruitful and multiply and establish my Covenant with you more over I will make my dwelling among yeah that's what is all but about I will walk about in the middle of you so Genesis to reference yes yeah this is what God is doing exactly the same the unique verb I will walk about with you in the middle of you it's the phrase used of the voice of Yahweh walking about in the middle of the garden in the Wind of the day even if you guys do what I say
 I'm all turn you into a new Eden is it sounded like eating and it's very clearly the case I am Yahweh
 but if you don't obey me and don't carry out all my commands if you reject my statues don't care about my commandment if you break my Covenant here's what I'll do to you and this chapter is intense and it's really long so I'll just show you a picture this is Leviticus 26 right here three big parts and thus Begins the middle part and there are five long paragraph teach one begins if you don't listen to me and then it's going to invert all of the blessings that you just read and turn them into curses so it'll be a paragraph for God says if you don't do what I say here's what I'll do to you tell her fever plague to be terrified I'll set my face against you you'll be beaten by your enemies if after all these things you don't obey me
 then I will punish you seven times more for your sins and then another paragraph of anti blessings. Severe seven times more and if you don't listen to me I'll strike you seven times more so you get the seven times more 4 x use a total of five paragraphs this is not high four ideas where to tell me tell me why well I mean going to wrap it up by time seven yeah that's right no words it's it's taking the Sabbath principle if you obey me I will the land will give you even more abundance in return then you put into it okay so that's like a Sevenfold you keep the Sabbath if you honor the principles of seven in the structure of your lives you will get eaten which is abundant over and Beyond what you put in and then this is we're just flipping it inverting it on its head
 in the same way that a compounded yeah there you go it's going to come down the other direction tell Ali to say even though I can explain the logic of this intense today in terms of the rhetoric in the poetic design of the chapter it's really intense but it says intense as the sons of Aaron dying as the blasphemer being put to death this is the kind of stuff that makes people be like yeah they got a little test was just an Angry God sure that's right and I all I can say is it's taken me a long time to sit with a portrait the way the biblical authors are painting a portrait of God
 they don't portray all of God's characteristics all at once different literary units focus in on different aspects and so this is an aspect where this is how God relates to his unique elect Covenant Partners who have been liberated to have been given Eden in the wilderness and if they turn on him then out of all of the nation's they are there more culpable than any other Nation the Sabbath principle of abundance will invert into a Sabbath principle of course we'd have to sit with the message of the section of the book I'm not sure what to say this it makes me uncomfortable to but at the same time this is a part of the Hebrew Bible's portrait that's trying to say even when God selected One Nation out of the many
 and did so much for them and if even they turn on y'all way how much more so are they accountable for severe consequences the police the way the the rhetoric of the narrative for Stakes are higher Stakes are really high like the priest so the people that's not how it ends 4:30 for so the fourth repetition of seven times over I will pay you back for three three numbers 32 so I will make the land desolate or 33 and you I will scatter among the nation's exile
 and your land will become desolate and your city's waste then the land will finally enjoy all the Sabbath all the days of the Desolation that you're in your enemy's land the land will get rest and enjoy the Sabbath because you did not observe the rest or the Sabbath when you were living on it so the land is like angry and there's a little break from your Contraption yeah the land here is depicted as the oppressed and Israelites are depicted as Farrah enslaving the land without honoring its dignity and giving it rest this fascinating you this is why I call it the anti Jubilee exiled becomes all of the Sabbath Sabbath years in the cycles of Jubilee that you didn't remember cuz the land doesn't belong to you. I said mine but you are going to live on it and treat it like
 all belongs to you so the land will finally get all of the Sabbath and you know there might be some of you who are left over as a Remnant verse 36 let's say there's a Remnant left over after the flood of God's justice and fight and clear the land and they are living in the land of their enemies and they're terrified and they're afraid buttress 40 if they confess their wrongdoing
 if they confess the sins of their ancestors their unfaithfulness that they committed against me and the hostility that they acted against me if they humble their uncircumcised hearts and make amends for their iniquity then I will remember my Covenant with Jacob my Covenant with Isaac my Covenant with Abraham and I will remember the land the land will be abandoned by them it'll make up for those Sabbath and in spite of this when they're in the land of their enemies I will not reject them but I'll remember my Covenant that's how thales chapter ends
 so ends with a little ski jump it's not a full promise of restoration what it is is that if they humbled himself ever even just a Remnant is out there floating on the sea of Exile in their little Ark calling out to me humbling themselves then I will remember them but the same phrase of what God does to Noah when he sees them floating in the boat God remember Noah and then brought about a new creation for him to inhabit not tell this chapter ends to so notice how the themes of Sabbath the name of Yahweh honoring the name the cycles of seven they're all brought together here
 and this is the straw of Leviticus
 I love you and try to summarize all this wealth me one way to make sense of this is that all of this took its final shape in around the time where Israel is in Exile totally totally that's right so yeah it's kind of on the nose right it's like hey dear reader your ancestors were given this opportunity reason why you're experiencing all this is because they blood yeah that's right they didn't keep the Sabbath that's right they treated the name of Yahweh as if it was common and now here you are and then it's like almost kind of begging you like humble yourself confessed sins of the nation and your own and let's get the mail and again totally yeah in fact the ideal reader of this chapter is someone like Daniel sitting in Babylon and it's certain that he in fact had the chapter on his mind wind in Daniel chapter 9 he confesses for the
 friends of Israel throughout their whole history asking for God to remember his Covenant I mean he has this chapter on his mind right so Daniel yeah it represents kind of the ideal responder to this passage right here someone sitting in Exile it was interesting is that narratively that Israelites are also outside the land right now sure they just have yet to go into it in fact this generation is in the next book of the Torah going to experience a pre Exile from the land of their own as interesting a 3XL they're going to wander the Wilderness and aren't allowed in the lantac lie because of their that's right Disobedience yeah so the generation that dies in the wilderness is it freehand style Exile from the land that becomes a mirror image of the generation of Exile on the other side of 2nd Kings and that's all intentional cuz that you have the final shape of the Torah like the rest of the Tanakh has a post exile
 stamp on it for people who are still awaiting the arrival of the ultimate Jubilee so this ending of Leviticus makes less sense for someone sitting in Exile wondering why my hair but then also there is in the logic of the scroll itself is just as foreshadowing for the people who are giving the initial Covenant like this is all being established yeah just like the blasphemer of the name they are going to be exiled outside of the camp yeah and then becomes a meditation on what's going to happen to all of his real that's right and just they will they will die in their stands outside the land just as the blasphemer died for his stand outside the camp yeah now for follower of Jesus possible when they then reflect on this is Tora yeah yeah we know exactly how they would do it
 yeah, we know how Paula do it Paul would say becoming a part of the Covenant family of Abraham is based on not your adherence to the laws of the Torah
 but by your sheer radical trust that the god of Abraham can create life out of death even inside of you and so in Galatians chapter 3 he says listen as many is quite 3 verse 10 as many Israelites has lived under the works of the Torah they were under a curse just as it was written cursed is everyone who doesn't live by all the things written in this book of the Torah to do them put in Deuteronomy guess when you get around me but that's essentially the the theme of what we just read it exactly yeah that's right and so what it goes on to say is to say that no one in the Torah was ever able to prove themselves right before God by obeying the laws of the Torah and it's not that the loss of toy were bad it's that humans prove themselves unable to live by the will in the word of God and so what he talks about is how the Messiah
 deemed us redeemed Israel from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us for it's written cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree the way policies it is that all of the Covenant curses that was for Israel were like focused in Baxter a magnifying glass in on Israel's Messiah on the cross and so Jesus suffered he sees the suffering and death of Jesus as the culminating Final Act and exhausting the power of the Covenant curses of the Torah that they no longer have a hold over those who are in the Messiah so and you could read Romans 7 and 8 and yes it's the same point of view so I think that's how Jesus the apostles would read this is that Jesus finished exhausted the powers of the Covenant curse so that the blasting can be released for the nation's or is Jesus says but and Anna Messiah and anointed representative would go into suffering and death and be a
 wanted to glory on the other side so that forgiveness could be announced in his name to all the nations beginning in Jerusalem which is essentially an outline of what it means when he says that you were in Leviticus plays a key role in that so yeah I don't I don't think I should be afraid of being cursed by God if I'm follower of Jesus like Jesus shoulder that on my behalf that's what he did for me so I read this as wisdom though because it becomes a case study in human nature and I'm human there's another type of wisdom pause like talking about the Disobedience of Israel and he's like oh yeah yeah yeah you can ruin your life yeah you can screw this up still and just like the guy in Corinth is sleeping with his mother-in-law and he's like was like I belongs to Jesus and still like you can ruin his life and you can put them outside the camp over to the realm of the evil one
 he might even die and his his Spirit belongs to God and so will be delivered from Death in the day of your way but you can ruin your life as a follower of Jesus yeah but if you've given your life and allegiance to Jesus and you belong to him thinking Paul's mind you belonged to him but and then we talked about that he brings up that dyes it is a genuine tension old school tension that we're not going to hear that the Covenant curses can be use they can be as warning and wisdom for followers of the Messiah to not come you can still soft the branch of sitting on totally and that you can still work against the grain of the god of the universe you're going to get a splinter out that's right and then alongside that you have other parts for the same Apostle Paul we'll talk about a guy who's really really blowing it and doing something inappropriate
 and he still believes that guy belongs to the Messiah even in a sin yeah those are deep matters to ponder the Leviticus does not solve for us but it does raise the stakes how to tie a bow on everything we just did a lot but we do need to type on Leviticus because it's over yeah we'll do a Cuban our yep but then we'll be moving into the numbers yes or no in Hebrew by midbar in the wilderness in the wilderness as much more exciting that is a better name a journey into the Wilderness is it much better name then make a spreadsheet but we have come out of the center of the center of the Torah and we are moving into the 4th
 for scroll the Torah is in the world
