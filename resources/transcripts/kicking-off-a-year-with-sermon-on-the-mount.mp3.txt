whether you grew up with religion or you've never entered through a church door you've likely heard sayings like don't judge lest you be judged don't build your house on the sand do unto others what you would have them do unto you he saying they're all teachings of Jesus and they can all be found in one place The Sermon on the Mount of the collection of Jesus's teachings found in the gospel of Matthew versus but has created an enduring Legacy that shaped both Christians and non-christians throughout history this year we invite you to join us in slowly sitora what Jesus taught us in The Sermon on the Mount I'm John Collins this is Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 it's a John and you know what today is I think I do yeah we are beginning a brand new series on the podcast that we've been working on for a while. It's sort of like the unveiling moment yes that's how it feels we are going to be talking through the entire Sermon on the Mount in 2024 slowly no stone unturned going to be amazing yeah The Sermon on the Mount is the first block of Jesus is teaching in The Gospel according to Matthew so for most of the history of the Jesus movement it's the first main block of teachings that people encounter if they pick up and start reading the New Testament and both for that reason and just the sheer Brilliance genius and power of what is that in these three chapters they have been a generative Beating Heart of the ethic and value system of the Christian Movement throughout its history
 2000 years now there's no better place to go if you want to get the heartbeat of Jesus for how he saw a reality and envisioned that his followers would live and treat other people so and that's putting it lightly we're also going to expand the amount of people get to interact with this year we're going to have some more scholar interviews and we're going to have these are two segments were going to invite friends in so this podcast it'll be what we normally do with some cool place Top moments are key pillars that's how we approach scripture so we believe the Bible is communal literature which means it came from a historical Community throughout time the people of Israel but then also we're going to encounter the wisdom of scripture in all of its Brilliance if we encounter it in a community of many
 minds and hearts and lives so that's part of what we want to reflect with this approach to The Sermon on the Mount in the series is more miles than the just yours and mine which we are a little community of Bible reading but we want to expand it because there's more to see here than any one person or even to can mine and Explorer so we're excited to have lots of different voices and people join us to explore the Sermon on the Mount in the mining of the mines
 so we want to do actually is get to know a few people they're going to hear throughout the year while we also begin to explore the greater impact that the sermon on that has had all over the globe throughout human history okay at the table with us Tim is Michelle Jones hi Michelle Michelle we get to hang out in the same building because we share offices Bible project our facility is here at Imago Dei Community Church and you are a pastor those listening long will recognize Michelle's voice in videos you were the voice of Lady wisdom which is just the coolest no pressure on that was trying to get my name changed on a lady wisdom but my family is not going for it I love it you also have been in a couple of the classes that Tim is taught in for our classroom product
 set reminder ditch with classrooms on with the Hebrew Bible and hand with a poetry one Bible words are at the art of typical words you ask great questions I have lots of them. So throughout this years ago just remind them out you're going to join us and be a tour guide with us and we're so excited to have you at the table with us I'm excited to be at the table with you guys you know The Sermon on the Mount is what I would call a costly interruption in my life and you know this phrase itself actually comes from Doctor Martin Luther King is whole nonviolent movement was born out of his understanding of what it meant to live out of The Sermon on the Mount one of the things that he said was the great problem of Life Is How We handle the costly interruptions the plans that go
 try the marriage that fails or the lovely poem that didn't get written because somebody knocked on the door and while those are his words their words that he never got to say because the legend is that they were in the notes in the briefcase for a future sermon when he was assassinated and so when you think about The Sermon on the Mount it is to me the consummate costly Interruption because it was coming into the world at a time where people were living one way and then here's this thing that says live this way I will never forget reading his letters from Birmingham Jail and you not be able to write Reflections on The Sermon on the Mount on anime love and forgiveness in jail in jail the really is no more authoritative kind of source in a moment like that that you would want to listen to
 in the moment at adding letters and those are revolutionary letters if one tends to them when I think about Sermon on the Mount to think about a guy like Dietrich Bonhoeffer great German Theologian also a pastor who changed the way he did things as he read The Sermon on the Mount and began to understand it in terms of his place in history in fact he came to the United States and he was living here and he was at a at a black Baptist Church in Harlem and really began to dive deeply Into The Sermon on the Mount and one of the things that he said in a letter to a friend of his was I would only achieved true inner Clarity and honesty by really starting to take The Sermon on the Mount seriously here alone he said lies the force that can blow all of this hocus-pocus of Nazism sky-high like fireworks leaving only a few Burr
 couch sales behind and when you think about that and what it meant to him when you wrote the cost of discipleship and it was the thing that caused him speaking of costly Interruption to go back to Germany where he was martyred and you know his whole thing about how not just we show up at church on Sunday and and just kind of pitty Patty our way through what it means to be people of God it cost us something we're really excited to have you as our tour guide I'm so ready for this also at the table with us is Dan gumel Dan you've been deleted her producer here I got a project for the podcast for years has been great so I kind of went on a big rabbit Trail as Tim would say around just the ways that surround them out has been influencing like pop culture at large so I want to play a quick little round couple rounds
 how about in the old Name That Tune game they all music trivia so so I got the first one pulled up
I've no idea who that is it sounds like a really 80s like a descent the song but but you got out of here Bono's vocals in that really yeah no Hispano just doesn't sound like he's going to ride with this is off the Joshua Tree album kind of expenditure Edition wow it actually is full of biblical imagery absolute Bono usable energy through most of the opening night of saying and Bono includes nine to him. He's not. I have no idea
 I feel like I listen to a lot of The Beatles. The Beatles to me like the early 60s on the lights in 1961 if you want to whenever me and my wife are somewhere tropical all we do is play Bob Marley yeah that's Bob Marley by Marley really don't this is actually the first single he ever recorded and it's all about not passing judgment on each other he's directly quoting Jesus for his career as a pioneering reggae and then he like Bono had a lot of references to various biblical ideas and imagery and he starts out his recording career
 Play the song called judgement now you are with us all the way from England although you're from New York born and raised in New York but I've been living in England for the past 5 years so this year's Stephanie you're going to produce a number of episodes for the Sonoma podcast and consult for the entire yes and it's so exciting to have you here you've been trained up in public radio working on shows like Freakonomics and Radiolab and scholarship elements to the podcast and I'm super excited to probably cuz just as we've been seeing Sermon on the Mount has throughout the ages up to today really inspired listener imaginations in so many disciplines and I'm kind of an omnivorous nerd so it's exciting to see that appetite
 what is Waterside like prominent examples in your mind and also a Christian writer she and her family hid Jewish refugees and joy of the Dutch resistance movement against the Nazis and they actually built a secret room behind a false wall in Corey's own bedroom and eventually the entire family was betrayed amazingly the Gestapo never actually found the secret room so the Jewish refugees were able to escape but she and her sister were sent to this concentration camp in Germany called Robbins Brook and that's where her sister died her father also died but Corey survived and she wrote A Memoir it's called The Hiding Place
 and there's actually a moment where she's preaching forgiveness in Germany and she looks out into the audience and she sees one of the cards from Robbins Brook he's standing right in front of her wearing this Overcoat Brown hat but in that moment all she can see is his blue uniform and his visor top just as he was back in the count
and all she can feel the shame of walking past this man naked with her sister in front of her
 after her talk he goes up to her and she actually says I know that God has forgiven me for the cruel things that I did but I'd like to hear it from your lips as well you know he sticks out his hand and asks Fraulein will you forgive me she's standing there literally having just preached about Jesus is forgiveness and she writes it could not have been many seconds that he stood there and held out to me but to me it seems like ours as I wrestled with the most difficult thing I ever had to do for I had to do it I knew that if you do not forgive men their trespasses Jesus says neither will your father in Heaven forgive your trespasses
 and still I stood there with a coldness clutching my heart but forgiveness is not an emotion I knew that to forgiveness is an act of the will and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart
 and so wouldn't lie mechanically I thrust my hand into the one stretched out to me and I thought I did an incredible thing took place this current started in my shoulder right down my arm spring into our joint hands and then does feeling warm seem to flood my whole being bringing tears to my eyes
 I forgive you brother I cried with all my heart for a long moment we crossed each other lb the former guards and the former prisoner I had never known Gods loved so intensely as I did then
 unbelievable you know what's amazing about that Story 2 is to think of the Nazi regime the world effects that that had and yet somehow the whole International drama week it's boiled down into a person of one person the moment and
 The Sermon on the Mount is kind of like that that's about everything and everyone and then it's about me and the one person I'm interacting with in the moment it sucks about all of it the same time you know that point actually not only Christians that Sermon on the Mount has impacted it was actually a huge influence on Gandhi he was Hindu but he actually read The Sermon on the Mount twice a day for the last 40 Years of his life I mean I don't know many people who do that. Yeah and inspired his own nonviolent Liberation movements which in turn inspired King in his autobiography he wrote that the first time here at Sermon on the Mount it quote went straight to my heart I saw that The Sermon on the Mount was the whole of Christianity and it is that sermon which has endeared Jesus to me
 no remarkable has to sit back and think about all these people and stories of the you know we've just named these are people embedded in some of the most important cultural movements in modern history you know whether it's WWII the rise and fall of the Nazi regime The Liberation of India the foundations of Modern India
 Bob Marley reggae Doctor Martin Luther King Junior Bonhoeffer it. This is the stuff of human life on the corporate level for just the last 100 years and they wouldn't be what they were had Jesus not set these words and it's not just that Jesus said these words right it's actually he was the living embodiment of the values that he challenged people with the which is why he was executed by the Romans you know I mean it sure doesn't get executed for being nice to people these words issued a challenge to the powers of his day of an alternate universe have an alternate reality that is still challenging our realities here today and these are just a few examples I know we could and we will in the course of the series we will Explore More stories
 show how impactful Sermon on the Mount has been so we are so grateful to have his whole career of additional people and perspectives of the table to explore these all important words of Jesus okay I am ready like I want to spend the better part of a year sifting through these teachings letting them shave my imagination and I'm so glad that we're doing this Michelle would you cast us off
 thanks for joining us here we go
okay so we're talking about some of them out but we need to start with some Basics what exactly is The Sermon on the Mount and here's how I'm picturing it Jesus went up on the mountain one day and he kind of gave his Greatest Hits to the people who were listening to him and Matthew was like well that's good I'm going to put that in my gospel yeah that's what's around them out is that is one way of imagining what the sermon is and how it came into existence but there's a little more context both in terms of how the servants fits into Matthews presentation of Jesus and then also how the sermon works together as a whole and then how it fits into the cultural context and historical and political context of Roman occupied for Century you know israel-palestine and that really matters actually
 a lot of the sayings not that they can't speak to us but that if we honor that contacts I think they can speak to us more powerfully okay so help set the picture for me
 where in 1st Century israel-palestine people group who have lived on this piece of land for centuries and centuries going back to Thousand Years to the time of Moses and Joshua but in Jesus day it's occupied territory cuz the Roman Empire like owns you know that whole section around and took it over
 so just imagine your Jesus and his people you are living on your own ancestral lands but you are now reduced to day labor or just kind of scratching out of lower class living in the land of your ancestors with Roman occupiers everywhere
 and you're a reminder to buy the presents cuz there's tax Booth texting the fish U-Haul up out of the sea for Rome for Rome Falls of the you know the wheat is grown in your fields and so on you have a lots of poor and sick people who are falling through the cracks by the droves this is the scene into which Jesus says things like if someone forces you to go one mile talk about a Roman soldier
 about Roman soldiers could commission anybody carry their luggage so when you talk about people suing and taking your cloak he's talking about actual exploitation of day laborers on these you know Jewish Farms that are now owned by Romans you know Jesus is drawing on actual political social economic realities people stay when he says love your enemies they have some enemies
 there was that a freedom fighter movement Jewish movement to liberate Israel through violent Revolt zealots stagger the dagger men who lived in the Hills there were lots of people who believe that Israel would be liberated by God if they just were more observant of the laws in the Torah so these are kind of like your biblicist write your Bible and God people and also known as the Pharisees and scribes and actually Jesus shares a lot in common with that crew a lot of values in common but he also differs it's a lot of ways he says in the sermon about you heard it said he quotes from the laws of the scripture and I say to you he's in dialogue with those figures okay so that's who Jesus is talking to and this sermon it takes place in what we call Matthew chapters 56
 and 7 so I'll Jesus says a lot here it's not that long it's like I think two thousand words or something about a little over a hundred versus the thing about Matthew Chapter 5 which is beginning I'm serving it comes after Matthew chapter 4 you read one chapter after another when you read a book granted school is that the end of Matthew 4 and I think we'll explore all this in more detail later but Matthew chapter 4 concludes with Jesus gathers a nucleus of his crew of apprentices and then he goes about north of Jerusalem in a region called Galilee and what Matthew tells us is he went about announcing the good news about the arrival of God's kingdom and healing every kind of disease every kind of sickness among the people
 news spread and people come from all over people come from Galilee people come from Syria up north people come from the place called The decapolis which was this network of Greek and Roman cities it was full of Jewish and non-jewish people and from Jerusalem and they flock to Jesus and he went up on to Hillside and opened his mouth and said
 after like the biblical story line and Cosmic context the sermon is actually Matthew unpacking what it is the Jesus set as he went about as a traveling teacher like a summery it's actually kind of like the greatest hits what would Jesus have said on any given day when you walked into the town announcing the good news of God's kingdom what did that sound like so you can equal a call this the good news of God's kingdom like that's actually the title Matthew kiss it and it's actually addresses the question that it occurred to many readers throughout history which is did Matthew have some record of Jesus sermons you know how much is 2/5 but with more than likely is Jesus with the traveling teacher he had like a whole series of themes like B his riddles
 little sayings and Parables is a short teachings in worded and pithy memorable way is here and he likely gave multiple versions of the same talk but in different ways and different audiences in dozens of villages do you think he worked on these like you perfected them how could you not have some of them are so brilliant we're still repeating them today yeah I kind of goes back to one thing we talked about a lot which is how God's word is designed and I grew up in Tradition where it's like God just beamed it down into the mind of a human and scrap it and so we got to the point where I'm like okay no humans worked on this with God's spirit it's interesting things Jesus did that to under a fig tree one afternoon while just like here so I could say that you know what it reminds me of is comedians yes like they will go out and no work on their material until it really land
 and then they get their hour together and they can present it and it works and when things like wow that was brilliant but they worked hard and they saw people's reactions will and DeWitt didn't landed they crafted it even more if your right hand causes your downfall cut that thing off just throw it away and then you read the room cuz I had that way and yeah and so while there is comedy and there's cleverness and riddle like features of Jesus teachings in The Sermon on the Mount what they are about is not just a set of ideas they actually are a way of translating into a vision of human life that matches what he's actually doing these living that way he's both living this way but he's kick-starting these communities with generous surprising acts of God's mercy has people's bodies are being healed and poor people are getting invited to
 begin to have meals and share life and reciprocity with people who have a lot more resources than they do have slaves and you have a tax collector in the other fishermen and Yabba farmer all sharing a table to table and then Jesus is Calling those people to live by a vision of what human life is about and Jesus names this moment as the arrival of God's Kingdom so that the sermon is itself an exposition of beautiful lofty ideals for human life and relationships but also it describes the thing on the ground that Jesus is doing is he goes into these towns so all the great themes you know the make the sermon so powerful that forgiveness generosity humility and the meal of nonviolent resistance to evil creative reconciliation and so to what end like what was Jesus
 imagining or hoping would happen if people really sat with these ideas yeah he's also making a contribution to the history of what we would call ethics some different cultures throughout history have entertained and explored different visions of what is the good life how did humans know what is the good you noticed modern ethnic categories are like utilitarian ethics is categorical Ethics in a connected to a manual, no idea what you're talking about for the greatest number of people okay but not to find some people might be familiar with categorical ethics from Immanuel Kant or what he called the categorical imperative and at least as I understand it he said any rational thinking person could be Deuce moral reason and that we need to follow that Universal imperative
 do that as an end in itself not as a means to cement this is not at FX 11 course but in the real world there was actually a tradition going all the way back to Deep Roots in Jewish culture Athenian Greek culture as well about what is the right and good way for a human life to develop not just in terms of actions but in terms of character who you are is called The Virtue ethics tradition the methods he is like a first century Jewish philosopher filling out a vision of the good life but again it's not abstract it's connected to a place and a time and an event namely that if God's kingdom is arriving on Earth as it is in heaven how then shall we left I've learned a ton from a new test call Jonathan Pennington on this point
 well Jesus is certainly being presented by early Christians as more than a philosopher he's not less than one he's been number books about The Sermon on the Mount Jesus teachings as ancient moral philosophy what does that mean it means he is being presented as wisdom itself as modeling and teaching the true wisdom about how to live well so that you might experience true human flourishing says use his teachings are constantly explaining what the nature of reality is how do you know things what the kingdom is like how to live well all the great philosophical questions so that we can be invited into his way of wisdom that we might experience true human flourishing
so Jesus is not less than a philosopher but I mean Jesus thinks he's bringing the kingdom of God and he has this radical vision for how to create a beautiful life and there is a call to respond by the end of the sermon do you know he says that if you listen to my words and do them you're like some to building a house on a rock if you don't your inability house on the sand and the floods going to wash it away that's pretty high sex to think about the sermon is it Jesus vision of like a counterculture a counter reality we're used to living in the world one way and Jesus weaves a picture of an alternate way of living as a human Community it's going to be embraced the poor and the tax collectors in Roman soldiers and everybody so it's a call to live in reality it's a vision of reality
 but it's not our typical Vision but it's something we know must be true or else it's like really worth living is it really worth living might makes right if that's actually true that help you misbehave but is it actually How the Universe Works is that actually what is ultimately the most beautiful in true about reality what if generosity and kindness make right what if that's actually reality would have a group of people live as if that were true and these words of Jesus then become like the compass pointing to the true north
 artima Bible project has been working hard to creatively visualize the ideas and the message of The Sermon on the Mount with animation and a new tempered series thats releasing this year and it just so happens there's a fellow creative who has done very similar work to us not with animation but with Cinema you may know the chosen a multi-season show about the life of Jesus well Michelle and I call up the creator of the chosen Dallas Jenkins and talk to him about how The Sermon on the Mount has been Central to the way that he and his team rights and structures the show Dallas thanks for joining us I'm a big fan we are to tell us a little bit about The Sermon on the Mount it seems like such a pivotal part of seasons one through three and a whole narrative structure that you're doing yeah we looked at it and said okay this is one of the most pivotal
 set up teachings in the history of the world and it's clear that Jesus delivered these things more than once as you know lots of scholars believe this might have been a collection of multiple sermons of multiple teachings so knowing that we thought we're going to take the teachings of The Sermon on the Mount. We're going to going to put them into this context of the moment where the crowds are coming the word is spreading Jesus is about to really lay The Gauntlet down and go I'm here I'm the Messiah and I've got a new way of looking at things for you and we're going to do that all at once for thousands of people it seemed to match well the growth of the ministry if I don't thing I'll say is that we wanted it to be delivered in a way that wasn't just a 30-minute sermon back-to-back what if the Beatitudes we're not just delivered for the masses but they also had a personal intention they were perhaps even the result of
 Jesus sing humanity and going immunity needs to hear this specific thing because they have failed in this specific area and so in the season finale when Jesus delivers that the attitudes and he's telling Matthew what they are we see how specifically they have been applied and who they apply to to his friends to the people have been following we have heard from all over the world that people were weeping during that thing I've never thought of the fact that those words weren't just for a crowd of hundreds of people just work for the entire world they were for me specifically or they were for Jesus's friend specifically doesn't change the words doesn't change the meeting it drives at home even more so what made you decide or how did you decide what to include what not to include and what to give weight to and what not to give way to such a question about the scary part right that's where you go or we're delivering the sermon but we're not delivering
 call thing it's kind of a montage of of the greatest hits of the sermon we do and we hope that not only people watching have some of them have read this before and maybe we're going to give them A New Perspective sons of never heard The Sermon on the Mount before we're hopeful that they'll go check it out cuz it's really good book is better than the movie we started with what are the elements of the sermon that most speak to the people in our story so with Simon Z was a former Zealot Jesus is talking about revenge right and that's personal way of not only communicating with Simon the Zealot is coming through in might be thinking but what the viewer might be thinking who struggles with
 and Justice and we all love justice but Jesus in the gospels offenses leave early just to the courts but when it comes to you and when it comes to my gospel in my followers we turn the other cheek for Simon the Zealot and anyone who identified with him who watches the show that's a puppy race for the heart so we start there what means the most to our characters in our story and then the second one is there at what feels like if we don't include it is going to be a glaring conspicuous hole in the sermon I don't want people listening oh my gosh I can't believe they skipped over the the back on Glee exactly so so there's a little bit of that and then the third thing which I will be honest is not the first priority but yes there is an element where part of my experience of making the show feel current and relatable is saying you know what they were going through
 XM is similar to what you're going through right now there was a Prussian there was poverty there was a division there was social and political ends and religious tribalism and Jesus had answers for that and I want you to hear those because they apply to today when you thought about seven of them out what were some of those creative true North's that you didn't want to get wrong or you wanted to stay true to I think one of them was showing the impact of the sermon for the disciples I think another one we talked about was showing disk shift from private Ministry to more public Ministry was there anything else anything else that you guys were trying to accomplish that's a great question and I think if we focus on The Sermon on the Mount that speaks to the larger truenorth as well but specifically in The Sermon on the Mount was thinking okay here's an opportunity for Jesus is preaching and Natalie want to make it make sense to are our heroes of the story but also to the audience and the audience consists of
 many Believers obviously but also many people who are on the fence people who are new Believers people who have church hurt people who haven't believed maybe in a while but their grandmother told him I watch the show and Seth are considering it and then there's the people who were skeptical of face and religion and are not followers of Christ actually represents a good chunk of our cast and crew so here's the good news the things that Jesus is saying in The Sermon on the Mount have residents and meaning and speak to all of the people I just mentioned all of those groups had something in the sermon that they can hear so you might not believe he's the son of God in your life but listen to this listen to what he had to say about how humbly was listen to how direct you was another six listen to what his priorities really were
 and that's somebody changed my life and a lot of it is because of these teachings so I think that's a true north for that scene and it's a true north from the show and The Sermon on the Mount is one really key aspect of that journey and how to test true for you when I was looking at Jesus kind of work shopping The Sermon on the Mount with Matthew and he wakes him up and says
I got it.
 Directions to put people should look to find me
 how did you settle on that metaphor of the map the moment with Matthew my co-writer Tyler Thompson he he wrote that line it's a map know if people want to know how to find me this is the person they should look for the person who is meet the person and I just can't even get goosebumps now remembering it I just thought my goodness that is so good and so resident and it speaks to how Matthew would be wondering at the month
 if someone wants to find me
 those are the groups we should look for
 images of answers that just went out. Thank you Tyler that is so beautiful that you're the beautiful moment last question you spend so much time thinking through how to determine amounts in the land for characters in the story and so as you've done that with your writing team was there something new for you or fresh or surprising about The Sermon on the Mount the thing that has stood out to me is Jesus was and is a personal God he is an intimate God he spoke to the masses yes at times but man everytime he healed every time he called someone to follow him every time he rebuked someone he spoke to their specific need or their specific struggle that has been my my greatest impact in the last 45 years is just he is the god of who knows me is the god who sees so that applies especially to The Sermon on the Mount is why I didn't show a ton of ycharts I always knew that when Jesus came out on stage instead of the audience standing up to greet him they sat down
 I knew that when he delivered the sermon it was him in the middle surrounded by people he's personally he looks at them he looks directly at the disciples that's a result of what I've learned about Jesus even more the second thing is that what really hits me as someone who happens to be just under six for 225 I was an athlete my whole life I have the ability to be a firefighter if I wanted to be I don't get challenge too often and The Sermon on the Mount when it talks about Meek Ness and humility and broken heartedness those are things that I'm not naturally those parts of the sermon I think hopefully resonating with Simon the Zealot a big James some of the folks were a little bit more aggressive man he is just clear over and over in the gospels turn the other cheek if someone asks you for one thing you give him an extra think I mean I'll give you a spoiler alert in season 4 the disciples are actually faced with a moment where they have to opt out
 live on what Jesus said about if you have to go one mile you go to LOL cool because I was referring to a Roman law or the Romans would at any point give their equipment and the Jews would have to carry it for a mile for me that doesn't come naturally to me I am not Meek and I am learning that that man is by the time I die on this side of Heaven I can at least make some progress towards to Beatitudes especially the ones about you think you should get even you think you should be strong you think you should be first you think you should be a leader and influencer know it in my weakness I will be strong I must die to myself all right that's going to take some time knowing that to say that you were so impacted when the line was written if someone wants to find me those are the groups of people that they need to look for the meek the lowly the poor in spirit that is impacted you still says a lot about The Sermon on the Mount
 I could cut through all of that this is who Dallas's isn't that the best thing that you can do is what the Bible project does it's what the chosen have been doing is how often you hear the word haha yeah oh I never... Is that the greatest thing you can hear if scales can be removed from eyes and so that scripture can become even more clear what could be better written on your Tombstone that's what the Sermon on the Mount could do and if it shows it could be part of that kind of real energizing or refocusing people's experience with these two thousand-year-old Transcendent words there's nothing better thank you thanks so much for having me on
 I grew up in the church and I can't think of a season in my life where I spent dedicated amount of time to just really go through The Sermon on the Mount yeah it's interesting to think about how different Traditions with in Christian history of emphasized or under a sized you know and then actually create this fascinating history because Jesus is ethical demands they're so intense that they have provoked a variety of responses let's be honest loving your enemies your actual cultural political enemies people that want to harm and kill you and your family that's what Jesus is talking about someone is threatening your way of life and he says love them bless them pray for them and the actually the disconnect between how many Christians have behaved through history in contrast to how Jesus called his
 obvious Delta people outside the Christian Community can look in real life really is that with you there was in the 20th century and Orthodox Jewish rabbi actually wrote a book about to ask his name is Kim strassel of the book is called The Sermon on the Mount Utopia or program for action and it's a book both exploring the teachings of a Jewish rabbi in this is Jewish rabbi riding by the ancient Jewish rabbi but also he was trying to kind of poke at Christians and just say like if you really read your rabbis music this seriously a so he put it this way he says in fact the history of the impact of the sermon on the mouth can largely be described in terms of an attempt to domesticate everything in it that is shocking demanding and uncompromising and so render it harmless domesticated yeah yeah
 New Testament scholar Scott McKnight who drew my attention to Lupita's book and to this whole theme of ways that different Christian groups throughout history have domesticated the sermon and so one of them might be like what you named ignore it pretended he didn't fully mean it would actually kind of overlaps with to portray Jesus has ideals here it's kind of an impossible idea he meant them but really just to point out that we can't ever live that way so he's just painting a picture to help you see that you're going to fail yeah and so within Protestant Christian traditions this got joined two of you that the purpose of the law is to show us how far we fall short of fulfilling God's law and that's very common way the Christian democrats lost in the Old Testament and so the teachings of Jesus going to get added a long as a new testament equivalent to the law
 I was given through Moses but I think the question is did Jesus actually intended followers to behave the way he calls them to or is it just a set of ideals that we should merely strive towards is it possible is it possible to live by The Sermon on the Mount and in some ways I guess you could say well know you're never going to believe do it but another since I can't get that picture of Corrie Ten Boom the fat man's hand we get out to her yes that's an impossible moment yeah yeah but she did it but she did it because she heard Jesus calling her to do it from his words in this world and so was it an impossible ideal no one way too kind of paint is too extreme and you can ignore it or under a size is it
 McKnight talks about another domestication strategy it's different is to portray the sermon as an individual ethic
 another words it's about person-to-person relations and it's true most of Jesus teachings are framed in interpersonal ways I don't have something against you get brackets out the threats but if this is the charter for interpersonal relationships for follower of Jesus it does raise the question of will shoot it governed then how groups of people relate to other groups of people and should the value set of a Sermon on the Mount determine how you guys I'll communicate a city a neighborhood should the values like influence public policy what about when nations are being hostile towards each other and lining up tanks to steal each other's resources right if the whole nation try to live out the ethics of The Sermon on the Mount could they still be a nation-state right question like radically forgiving and pee
 making may be on an individual basis that could work but could it work on a corporate level it's right and there are many Christian thinkers through history of us that know no so famously Martin Luther Kind of had a way of thinking about politics and theology that they like the city and the kingdoms of this world are run by an ethic that is in some way at odds with the Christian ethic and that is just an inevitable reality of the present age another strategies that Scott McKnight names would be something called the hyper committed approach
 this is the tradition that developed and special and Catholic and Orthodox Traditions were the monastic movement began and monasteries first begin to originate in the 3rd and 4th centuries as a response to Christianity getting so in mashed in the political economic powers of the day that they were like renewal movements of people withdrawing from the status quo version of Christianity really amazing Stories and they these rocks and communities it really tried to live by The Sermon on the Mount but because they were so Off the Grid of like normal right day to day trade your own little Utopia domestication strategy which is well you know the monks and the nuns yeah like they can do that have arrived but I live in the city I like the blacksmith Branch a good thing there are some people doing that and they can pray for me
 I'm overgeneralizing a little bit but not by much so let me ask you then here's how I'm feeling please tell me I want to know how you feeling I'm feeling excited about being challenged but I'm also feeling very realistic about the fact that I'm not going to be able to fully on board and integrate the ethics of Jesus and so I want to but I grew up in a Protestant household where there was his constant drumbeat of you need the grace of God in your life and so I'm kind of just I guess hoping spirit of God will show up and away and like and help make this a reality I mean those are all of the things that I think should be stirring in her heart stevanus after reading the Hebrew scriptures the way Jesus did I mean the whole story is God selecting of people out of the nation's family of Israel to live by the wisdom of gods and structure
 the three Deals primarily through Moses in the law of the Mount Sinai and the whole story is about how they fail that the possible ideal but it's not impossible ideal God actually called his people to live by his wisdom and Hebrew prophets look forward to a day when God's covenant faithfulness with his compassion and mercy and his Spirit would so transform the hearts of his people that they would actually live the way that he called him to live well so when Jesus touches down announcing king of God is here he is the grace of God become human calling and empowering his followers to do the same so even though you're talking about your present shaped ethic I think that is one of the most beautiful parts of the Protestant tradition is that awareness that the calling to live in reality by the teachings of Jesus is itself a part of
 result of a response to this transformational work that God's doing in the Human family and so it's God's work in us and it's artwork with God and those are not opposite things in the biblical imagination but all the same knowing that we're going to fail and those are the moments where we don't take the person's hand and where we don't forgive them but if we are open to letting Jesus work in our minds and our hearts imagine what could happen
 maybe the stories that we went through that were so inspiring maybe their inspiring because they steamed stove rare but what if they weren't so rare I don't know any other way to hope that those types of events become more common except one idea would be to take a year on the mount and really let it soak into every fiber of our hearts and minds and let's see what happens deal
