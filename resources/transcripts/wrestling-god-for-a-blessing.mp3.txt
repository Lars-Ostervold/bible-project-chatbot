in the Bible the blessing is life multiplying life with the access to abundance and this is the type of world God created one that can reproduce itself life creating more and more life and then God chooses humans out of all the animals to represent him to partner with him to take care of this lightning this is our calling we are stewards of God's blessing and we've proven to be pretty bad at it Adam and Eve fail Noah has his own failure and they got uses Abraham He blesses Abraham and appoints his family to be the vehicle blessing for the entire world but even Abraham struggle and it kind of makes you wonder what's going on thinking trying to partner with humans if you just choosing the wrong people maybe he needs a better hiring process and then we're introduced
 to Abraham's grandson and if you thought Abraham struggle story showed you somebody who occasionally acts like the snake in the car but we get a couple Generations down the line and what if what if the grandson of Abraham doesn't just occasionally act like a snake what if he's like born a treacherous lying snake what have lying is his language from the Moon Jacob is so horrendous is named mean trickster and then story after Story schemes he lies he deceives the man is meant to extend God's blessing is a chaos Monster the whole story is about him trying to grab and sees and skiing his own way to get the blessing that God was from before birth trying to give him as a gift All Along Stories of Jacob's are painful but they're an honest examination of how stubbornly selfish and nearsighted humans giving it has read them you might think why I haven't got given up on that what it's got to do with the guy
 won't believe that God just wanted to see so what God has to do is wound him we have to incapacitate them you might be familiar with the story it's where Jacob wrestles with a mysterious man who turns out to be God himself
 and God punches Jacob in the groin so hard and knocks his hip out of socket out of all the places God could have hit him he hits him in the groin in the part of the body where he can generate his own blessing us very powerful image of God having to both wound and he'll to strike and to bless to get humans to receive the thing that he just Wishes the Bible project podcast today we're in the third movement of the Genesis scroll looking at the theme of blessing and the links God will go to to save us from ourselves thanks for joining us
 all right Tim hello love John hello hello and bless you for being here today on podcast but I'm blessed I'm blessed to have a blast that's right we're talking about a blessing a curse in the story of the Genesis Grill today are we down we are yes and we had a whole really great conversation setting the stage for what blessing is in the Bible and its antonym or kind of contrast word a curse and let me try to do the real quick so I can explain her recap alright blessing it's one of those words that may mean many different things to you because we use it a lot less this meal God bless you when you sneeze I feel blessed when slice going good so it's kind of easy to import a bunch of ideas into it a blessing is but if we look at how the Bible to find the blessing we do have to go much farther then the first page Genesis chapter 1 God begins order all of creation
 and he creates three domains and on the demesne of the sky in the sea he creates creatures the birds and the fish and this is the first time we gets the word blessed in Hebrew is a wreck things very specific just be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth to the blessings about the abundance of life for the birds in the fish creating the potential and then summoning the potential out of Creations like in the plants that make fruit and multiply themselves but now you have living creatures and God shares that life not producing but reproducing ability with a creature that's why God donates the productivity that disseminates out of the Divine love and creativity and
 gifts that potential to another to reproduce and make more and that is was called the plastic beautiful blessing so implicit in this idea of being able to be fruitful and multiply and fill is that there must be an abundance of resources and there must be an Harmony so there's not enough fighting and destruction fighting against this that it's a way to kind of think about maybe another biblical concept which is Shalom of wholeness and completeness but the center of gravity of it is the ability to reproduce Net Life well I like if you sneeze and I hope you're not getting sick and I say bless you like what I mean is that I hope that's not a sign of sickness
 death which is something that actively fight against yes that's right so then God create humans and he appoints humans to be his image male and female and to rule and then he gives them the same blessing as he gives to the fish and to the birds which is to be fruitful and multiply and fill the Earth then he gives them a fourth the bonus blessing which is to rule over which means that up till now God is the one ruling he's the one in charge of all of this blessing being Unleashed and he's inviting humans into a partnership of sorts to say work with me to establish and rule over and creates and stewardess blessing which is remarkable it is so not only discuss donate as it were the potential of reproduction to borrow from God's infinite potential
 and generate life down the chain but now God has appointed one particular creature yeah to oversee how other creatures experience that blessing of multiplication is a creature that itself experiences reproductive Powers because of the gift of God's blessing but also is called to oversee and Steward the blessing of other creatures humans and then God bless is The Seventh-Day Sabbath day day where God does not work everything is now in its full completeness and rest and thriving and that day is blessed day is flourishing and multiplying because it never ends it's The Day That Never Ends that's right the culmination of all of this is that towards a cosmos that is overflowing with abundance in a way that will not end yep that's right yeah the 7th day just within the first narrative in Genesis is a preview
 of God's ideal plan for all of creation and it's a plan that is not realized as you start reading the second narrative that follows the Eden story but it stands there as a testament to God's plan and ultimate desire for all creation is the Eternal reproduction and abundance the seventh day so we get to the second story and we see this blessing performed with new images or God takes a Wilderness and he brings water out of it which then creates a garden and out of the water he creates human plants the human in the garden and says all of this all of this food all this beautiful trees this is yours taking eats everything including the tree of life God's own life available to give the human more than mortal life something beyond that accept
 there is one free you're not to eat from that's right that tree that they're not supposed to eat from however looks like all the other good trays that are a blessing the blessing doesn't appear but the imagery connected the blessing does of fruit trees multiplying many beautiful abundance soul and the blessing and so if it looks like a blessing and smells like a blessing I taste like a blessing is it a blessing and got those know this tree is not a blessing it will kill you it is the opposite of a blessing which is a curse humans don't trust God they take this false blessing and the curse comes in the serpent the creature that deceived them in the first place to think that this thing was worth while eating in spite of God's command not to eat it and then got Chris's the ground which is where the environment from which all of the abundance
 food comes from and right in the center the word curse isn't used but God kind of says look the relationship
 a few Manatee of the multiplication of life is going to be rough fraught with conflict now that you've chosen to take what God defines is death and chosen to make that into your blessing until humans and UPS driving after what they think is a blessing but end up hurting each other abusing each other and specifically in the language right there in Genesis 3 15 and 16 love men abusing other women creating painful environments in which children are conceived so now even the blessing of being fruitful and multiply is now fraught with grief because of humans who don't trust each other or keep hurting each other in their efforts to get their own version of blessing we have now what a blessing is abundance multiplication flourishing it's a gift from God and something humans are meant to Steward and then we have the curse which is the opposite it's when life Fulton on it
 stuff you gave us great image of I put all this effort into this field and I don't get back out of it what I would expect a proportionate return and the Sarah yes curse the blessing is every October we go up the Columbia River Gorge that forms the border between Oregon and Washington and on the kind of North East flank of Mount Hood which is a big volcano that's not far from Portland to say it's the most seismically active volcano in the whole Pacific Northwest is terrifying God bless us anyway so my family and I go spend time on the North Eastern flank of that thing every October and pick apples and somebody else has been cultivating The Orchards and we just Waltz in there and just taking it we take the blessing right off the tree outside to work for that
 what's the analogy breaks down but that's the blessing is just there for us and the curse would be we all in the plot of land and no matter how much effort we put in the Harvest keeps getting apples rotten smaller less and less every year less and less every year the environment so it's the opposite its scarcity instability relational conflict danger and death itself being the ultimate curse and then the other thing with that is that idea of Exile being separate from the place where true abundance that is taking place which is the garden and that's where Humanity finds itself we got the story of God creating blessing giving blessing to us anointing us to then carry that blessing forward us not being able to sting which between what is really good and what is bad not trusting God's word and then
 taking the fake blessing and finding that we are now in curse in an environment curse and then creation kind of devils folds in on itself God allows humans the Dignity of making significant choices and so if humans choose to embrace and unleash curse in the land he left them but only to a point when the curse Unleashed by humans reaches like a the point of no return there are these moments when God will hand creation over to the powers of chaos once again and allowed at the story of Noah yep that's right and at the conclusion of the flood story when Noah gets off the boat God refers to the floodwaters the D creation of Genesis 1 on doing itself God refers to it as a curse striking the land with a curse is the Striking of all life on the land through the collapse of Cosmos
 the ultimate curse is not just death the ultimate curse is for the cosmos to implode cuz no more abundance and no more like that yeah what's happening in that story is that God handed creation over to the curse and the accelerated it as it were to decrease 8 so as to wipe the Slate clean to give creation a new start and through that decreation and Recreation God preserve the righteous Remnant out the other side and that's the Noah story and Noah gets off the boat and he surrenders everything to God by offering a sacrifice which is the key biblical image for surrendering everything over to God, God looks is this righteous Remnant and says I can work with a Humanities that will surrender everything to me and God bless us and said be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and I was a cycle and of course I was going to go to the next
 go to do is go plant a garden and eat of the fruit of the garden and become naked all just like Adam and Eve and unleash a curse on one of his sons and it just all goes downhill again but it's basically just the same cycle that we saw a replay in Genesis 1 through 9 but if we get those core definitions meanings of Chris and blessing in the first narrative cycle then we're going to be set up well for what we can talk about in the rest of the conversation which is after Noah the story leads us to a guy named Abraham and then the story of blessing and curse gets really focused in on this guy Abraham and then specifically his grandson Jacob which is more we're going to also start talking about little bit later so this idea of God appointing a human to carry the blessing happened with Adam and Eve shopping with Noah and his family and now it's going to happen with Abraham yeah his wife yeah by the time you get to Abraham you have a portrait of humanity as a
 fan of divided siblings from a whole bunch of unfortunate stuff that we don't have time to talk about but there is division among the nation's so they can a manatee has divided and filled the land all right but they are not living in Harmony and they're not living in right relationship with the Creator God and so what's a god what's an Elam to do with the humanity lives and Exist by God's blessing they wouldn't know humans would exist if it were not for God's continued sustained blessing but the humans keep taking these blessing gifts and the distorting them co-opting them for false blessing purposes spreading curse that's the blessing so what's another name to do he starts a conversation with this another a new righteous remnant of the wear or he's not right just yet actually he's going to have to become right past the test here he's going to have to be transformed into a righteous one
 has God puts blessing in his hands
so here we come to the calling of Abraham we've been here many times but they're God's first words to Abraham that were told about in Genesis 12 focus in the blessing story and Crystal are here forgot to say Abraham yourself going from your land from your birth family from your father's house to the land that I will show you and I will make you a great nation and I will bless you notice the connection there with those two lines to be a great they only have the word great in an English can meet just like awesome yeah awesome and the Bible great mean great in size or scope or make you a lot of people a nation that consists of a lot of people I will also a x yep that's right I'll also make your name great and you will become a blessing so you're going to multiply and be fruitful and that is God's blessing but then gas going to take your reputation your name and lift up your name and reputation
 so is that who you are becomes a blessing to others so we're back to the image of God that God chooses one and makes them a steward or a vehicle of God's blessing now for others to do except this time it's not humans and animals it's Abraham and the nation's twist Year God says Hey listen I'm going to bless anyone who blesses you if people seek your safety security Good Fortune well-being guess what it meant to make you like the kind of think it's a good metaphor here is sort of like whenever anybody blesses you I'm just going to make more of the blessing that just going to go right back out to them I don't know anyone blesses you meaning black someone means to what this has nothing to do with anything for some reason the image that came into my mind was Chia Pet
 yeah you got a little like a sheet for something I don't know but then there were all kinds of different cheeses grow chia seeds on the stack of it yeah but basically you just spread this mud the little seed mud on the back of it you water it and then just outcomes life like this huge plant in a budding spreading plant it's not actually a good metaphor at all for my blessings to you cuz there's only one see a pet in so that's like the plastic in the life but imagine a Chia Pet that you gets the mud you know the whole seed mad spread all over it and then it can just go around touching things and wherever at leaves a little smudge of seed mud
 then Flats because the cross like make it making up my own little parable
 but the images God's going to pack the family of Abraham with Jewish blessing us with this is going to be coming out of you and then here's the thing when people come and attach themselves to you and do good to you man they're going to get more going to come back at them than they ever imagined that's the you know these people write like it's the person that's like when I'm around this person a man there's an abundance of life like there's just more joy and more optimism and there's actually more like to good that happened thank goodness just kind of happens yep those are pretty nice man you know I'm thinking of a friend we both know I won't embarrass him but a friend who's been that person in my life for a long time and they work in agriculture and so they are constantly just bringing over fresh produce you know and so you get a box of corn squash or something and
 is that like there's always more than we need and so then we give it to her neighbors and then when that friend comes over then he starts talking to my neighbors and now it's like friends with my neighbors and he gets car into the neighbor and it's like that they're people who just are so generous
 it becomes contagious and then when God says and I will bless those who bless you to the attic that image further like what would it mean to bless your friend correct the who is the that's right that's right and you bless them back and it creates this economy of generosity we're all of a sudden it's like there's enough I can share with you and you can share with me and there will be times when you don't have enough to guess what I got you and then you got me I'll bless those who bless you you will be a blessing close ties to our generosity video and conversations are so here's the twist I'll bless those who bless you so the family of Abraham is going to become this vehicle of divine blessing the exponential explode but also the inverse will be true because God is investing the Eden creation blessing in this one family God also is signing God self up to protect this family cuz they're the vehicle of the rescue of the universe
 it's so it's so sorry for that that came out of my mind I will curse that 1/2 in you all the families of the land will discover blessing so if people bless you will get blessed and back at them if people treat you like you're cursed with good looks like a lot of things treat you like you're a curse treat you like you are a curse yeah so that could easily be mistreating someone abusing them it could mean just to dishonor them but it could also mean to steal from Kill to oppress all these kinds of things so I got your back those who try to D create you I will do so with this promise then this family becomes for his anointed as the conduit of divine Eden blessing
 for all the world God chooses one so that the blessing of Eden can go to the money through the one that's the amateur which means a lot just like the humans in Genesis 1 this is both amazing potential and a huge liability because God's putting enormous power okay here's here's a better Parable basically the rest of the Genesis scroll is like God putting a very precious gem into the hands of a toddler and you're watching this like toddler you know carry this like big fat Diamond around and you know they're constantly walking by sewer drains and then tripping and almost dropping it down or you know they'll drop it in the mud and pick it up and then like you know pick their nose and then I have to let you know that that kind of thing but then sometimes I cleaned it off with their shirt and show it to their friends and then like to have a tea party or something
 Infinity Stones from Infinity War but like a stone that can like blue or the true power of Infinity Stones then putting these precious gems into the hands of yeah so the drama of the story of Abraham Isaac Jacob Jacob's sons is going to be basically the story of the family who doesn't deserve the blessing yeah and they actually end up spreading about as much a curse as they do blessing and you can't believe that God would put these people in charge of something so precious but yeah we were reflecting on that in terms of just Adam and Eve being given the image every whatever reason when you get to this story of Abraham being given the blessing of kindness guys legit
 but when you pair that with what God was Adam and Eve it's just kind of like the image of handing the toddler the yeah the diamond yeah I'll send becomes a little bit more clear the idea like the next story after this blessing is Abram goes into the land of promise to him there's a food shortage in the land and what he does is go down to Egypt and lie to the king of Egypt ended up bringing sickness and plagg and curse God he brings a curse upon Egypt by lying and deceiving the King by saying that his wife isn't really as wife and so the first story is actually about how Abraham through lying and treachery spreads curse to the nation's instead of blessing from the first story about Abraham is saying like oh man humans and that's as humans but like this guy like what is going to happen and sometimes you know
 Abram just better than that but he fails just about as often as he gets things right and so we could spend a lot more time in the Abraham story but that's the drama with Abraham is okay so here's the setup is so two more Generations go by after Abraham and the Abraham story showed you somebody who a guy who occasionally acts like the snake in the garden so if there is seeing a beautiful woman and she's good in his eyes and she takes her head that's the portrait and then Abraham is the one lying about right his wife and saying yeah. My wife then he plays the role like of the snake in that story but then other times he gets things right and we support that and our podcast series about Abraham but we get a couple Generations on the lion and what if what if the grandson of Abraham doesn't just occasionally act like a snake what if he's locked born a treacherous lying snake
 what a flying is is like a language from the womb what we got to have to do then and that's exactly what the Jacob stories are all about get to Brian Brian
okay so Jacob Aura in Hebrews name yaakov and his name actually is generated out of the story of his birth and his birth story really tells the whole story the whole story about him so the third literary movement Genesis begins in 25:19. Very intuitive and it begin by introducing us to saying these are the birth generations of Isaac corre I get tacos how you say his name in Hebrew and The Story begins with Abraham's son Isaac and his wife Rebecca and the first thing that you're told is that Isaac's wife Rebecca is infertile not able to have children and so this also happened to Abraham and Sarah has happened to Isaac mom and dad and so what was Abraham and Sarah's response when they were not able to have children well that was one of his great failures with Hagar the Hagar debacle
 so the story of Isaac begins with the sun in the same situation as his dad facing infertility but Isaac does the opposite of what his dad did the story Begins by saying and he prayed to Yahweh on behalf of his wife the kind of Chris's back reflection we go back to me like a man I didn't Abraham and Sarah just do that and in the story it is it says Yahweh received his petition and rivka his wife became pregnant this beautiful but no sooner is she pregnant that were told that there are twins inside of her she doesn't know that's all she knows is that she feels a wrestling match happening inside of a wimp literally she feels the sun striking each other inside of her since Vivid image and so she goes to inquire she goes to pray just like Isaac dead and we're not told how or when or where does she have a dream or a vision
 did you go into some Shrine and hear her voice or something we are told us that when Rebecca parade what God ordered was a four-line Hebrew come
 and the problem is about the wrestling match that she can feel the sibling rivalry that she can feel before she can even put language to it and what two nations are in your room and two peoples will be separated from your innards 1 people will be stronger than the other people and the great one will become the servant of the little one like a riddle the little one yeah Jesus is not innovating talks about God's kingdom creating a upside-down economy where the last or first didn't wear the the master is the servant to serve in the one in charge and the great one here meaning the older one presumably the first born the first boy I have two siblings but what they are
 carnations and every nation and they're both going to be strong but one's going to be stronger than the other and sibling rivalry the exaltation of the late born over the firstborn so couple things here one is we're activating a deep pattern cuz way back in the Genesis scroll another thing we haven't done yet and we will I really look forward to doing the steam one time so yeah God creates animals first on day six human second but then calls the second Comer humans to rule over the First Commerce update 6 then God favors the second-born Abel's sacrifice over the firstborn Kane's not does not dwell sorry to go back to not only is are humans made after the animals in a way that the second born they're made as the second rulers on the Block to that's right.
 points the Elohim the host of Heaven drool over the sky and day and night and then humans to rule over the land yeah they're the second born in that sense and we learn by The Book of Daniel however God's ultimate purpose is to exalt humans to rule over the sky than the land yeah so moving forward from Adam and Eve had Cain and Abel and the introduction of hostility between the brothers when the favored or blessed ones are viewed suspiciously by the non Chosen and it what do you call raised the ire of that raises the eyes yeah right somebody Liar Liar like I think it comes from the same rules irritation anchor so it's a team that's going to get repeated with Noah's Three Sons were Shem who's not the first one is chosen for the blessing and the older yaphet rjfs is going to dwell in the
 what's a sham it gets repeated with the guy named Tara who's the from the 10th Generation from Noah he has three sons and one of the younger Sons is Abraham was just passing then you're going to have it with Isaac and Ishmael Abraham's two sons but the younger second-born Isaac and now here we are here so we're many rounds in to this sibling rivalry so what we're told and this is Keith for the blessing is that it's the second born the God has destined to be the stronger one or the greater one so it doesn't say here that explicitly the best the one destined for blessing but that has in every generation that has been what comes along with being the exalted second-born just a receipt the blessing so what's also being activated here is a cultural practice this just assumed about how in ancient near Eastern cultures cultures around Israel and even Israel itself it was common practice as the father ages the patriarch ages in the house
 called that the first born son would become like the father's replacement an image of a father and inherit a majority of the land with assets and the firstborn is giving those Privileges and so God is in the habit of upsetting that pattern in every generation of the story of Genesis and that's going to be a big tension I work in this story is Rebecca here finds out that God's going to reverse the order and Elevate the second born and other members of the family are going to actively be hostile that program in different ways and that set up the drama of the story so Jacob is named Jacob because he's born second but we're told that he comes out grabbing the heel of his brother Esau and the word heals the word Becca's and so he's named yaakov cuz it comes out grabbing the egg if he'll grab her grab her yeah but it's it's a synonym
 to see if but it comes from the litoral image of tripping someone yeah we're my kids like to do is give me a flat tire behind you and you step on the back of someone's shoe so then your heel comes up out of it and then it kind of tripped you up at the flat tire of the classic like you just stick out your leg diagonally in while someone's walking you know I try and Nick their part of your body if it's wrong to the ground so that significant that is his name refers to the role that he comes out trying to usurp right took to get the one up his older brother and from the get-go is this is right after God's words that said the greater one will become a servant to the little one and so it's as if a member ruling
 one of the aspects of blessing from Genesis one being in authority over so what God just said is hey I've destined that the younger will become the one with authority over the family but then when the second Borden is born he comes out literally embodying a lack of trust in that promise he comes out grabbing his brother to try and accomplish the thing that God said he was going to do for him and there's no better way to describe the plot conflict of the story his name and bodies that he's the whole story is about him trying to grab and seasoned scheme his own way to get the blessing that God was from before birth trying to give him as a gift all along and that becomes a drama of the Jacob story in the Bible story yeah it's like that scene of trying to give someone a gift but for one reason or another there just so uncomfortable with it they just have you ever tried to like give some gas
 or something oh my gosh you did this to me the other day Jacob I'm not really it's not like God Under The Palms at like you know him will take the gas money so that's doesn't fit really but it's like that for some reason in that moment I didn't want to receive your generosity to help cover guess I don't know why but it's I don't know why I don't know why I'm sorry John I didn't mean to do that. But you know sometimes you just want to give somebody a gift for some reason it makes them uncomfortable and they want to get out of receiving it and they want to take it in their own terms I'm just saying that little feeling is what's doing exaggerated in the Jacob story
 he comes out grabbing for the thing that God said he would give him and that pattern is just going to continue in fact it continues in the next door so it was next door is going to epitomise Jacobs ways of doing this in this life I'm into the famous story about how is brother Esau comes in the boys are grown up and Esau comes in and he's a hunter iceborne yeah he's the firstborn and he's a hunter manly ya came out all hairy like an animal that first and now he's a hairy guy and so Jacob is like cooking a nice stew back at the camp and Esau comes back into Camp after hunting all day and what he says is give me some of that red red and Hebrew it's the word read as a dumb dumb and so what he says is give me some of that a dumb dumb Dumb and Dumber Dumb and then the narrator step since its Genesis 25 or 30 the narrator inserts and says therefore his name was called that dumb
 is known as Edo yeah that's right yeah yeah and the word for red is Autumn and the name Adam is he dumb and the word both of those words Edom and Adam either red or spelled with the same three letters as a dumb human this is a little Genesis 3 failure story and so incomes Adam saying give me some of that Adam Adam and yeah cuz ever the scheme vs. okay deal here's the thing sell me your position as the firstborn or it's often called the birthright in our English translations but it's a word play because it's spelled with the four letters of the word blessing just with the two middle letters swapped for the blessing is better and then the word position of the firstborn is the whole raft of course it just tell me
 you're the blessing of the firstborn firstborn right and what he says is hey look I'm about to die I am hungry here so hungry I'm about to die a little dramatic dramatic what is my what is it to me if I'm about to die then Yakko said it's as if he pulls out a little piece of paper with a pen
 sign right here real quick I swear an oath I swore an oath and he sold his to yocco's and then he just got the hill man I trip the hill and he gives the sauce too so the first born a dumb or a dumb the human trades in their right of the first born for the right to rule the right to rule and have Authority for a bowl of food he trades their authority to rule for food and his name is Adam spelled with the same letters as the name Adam I mean come on it being fruit of a tree it's a bowl of hot stew instead of hot stew stew
 who is playing with the vocabulary and images of Genesis 3 but notice there's more creative Dynamics here because it's actually the second born that God has destined to become the authority that that's what God Said to his mom at least and so it says if Jacob is either unaware of what God said about him or he just can't believe it but he spends his energies thinking of ways to scheme how to get the thing that God Dustin him for and here it's called the Becca Laura and then this is matched by a story on the other side and what we call Genesis 27 which is a story in which Jacob and his mom also make up a meal this time not free saw before that that Isaac to steal not the back order but the bereka the blessing and he successfully. That will take a look
 but when is a realizes that Jacob also pulled that stunt he makes a word play and he says what isn't he rightly named yaakov because he yaakov to me he uses his brother's name is a verb and he says he's stolen my becho. And my better all comes together the blessing was be fruitful and multiply for the birds and the fish and therefore the humans it was be fruitful and multiply and Rule here it's as if we are taking those two aspects of abundance and multiplication and authority and rules and they each get broken out into two different stories of Jacob's stealing them from his brother he steals the authority the first born and he steals the battle, which is multiplication and abundance and he does this even just completely ignorant apparently of the fact that God was
 wanted to give these things to him free of charge it's not hard to see oneself in this portrait of Jacob haven't been given a gift and a elected for a purpose and fighting against it to get it on your own terms we're not trusting the God will provide it in the way or manner timing that I would prefer and so I will find a way to get it on my own scheme up a way you have to get it on my own terms and then to the well-known story of Jacob disguising himself as his brother to steal his brother blessing this cool stuff about blessing to this peanuts grow to
so what you can do from here is just you could go slow or we can go fast over the Jacob store but basically you get what the Dickens story is All About Now it's about a guy who doesn't believe the guy that's going to give him the blessing it's so he goes to read his whole life hurting everybody around him trying to scheme and steal the blessing and abundance for himself and instead of just trusting the God is going to give it to him as a gift so the famous story about him dressing up like his brother and deceiving his old blind father and he successful he gets the blessing after all yeah that's getting the Dakota the stories the one we just read in detail or he steals the birthright and then there's another story that will we won't go to the details of but it's very similar premise where Jacob and his mom
 come up with elaborate scheme to convince Isaac the dad to give Jacob a family blessing and also has to do with the bullets too and yeah this story also is an analogy with Genesis 3 it's filled with vocabulary Genesis 3 about seeing or not seeing seeing what is it father can see which Echoes back to what the snake says to the woman which is that in the eyes that you eaten The Forbidden tree your eyes will be opened implying that you're blind to that she's lying now you get the guy who actually is going blind and that it makes him very disagreeable so Jacob becomes like the snake disguised deceiver trying to weasel a blessing out of his father and he successful successful and actually what he says it was Mom first this is Mom's idea first and what Jacob says listen my dad's going to ask me to come up to him he's going to hear my voice and think
 not my brother and then he will feel me and I'll become I get to see her in his eyes and I'll bring upon myself a curse not a blessing so what is Mom says is I'm going to get guy is what he said and what is Mom Rebecca says his son may your curse come upon me and what's interesting in the story is after the story you never hear about Rebecca again she's the only patriarchal matriarchal Genesis that you never even hear about when or how she died and after Jacob leaves his mom in another scene later he never sees her again so in a way it's kind of annoying Lee does bring down a curse on herself that she her son is going to be chased out of town and she'll never see him again because of what she did the plan that she set in motion and yeah what she thought would bring about blessing actually brought about her separator summersun yep it's a good example of what
 that was good in your eyes ends up bringing not blessing but death so as you going to the Jacob story after he successfully steal the blessing the blessing is so rad that he gets from his dad it's essentially his dad others this poem where it says I love the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that you always blessed so he talks about God may God give Jacob The Duel of the Skies the fatness of the land much Grand fresh wine you like yeah and my people groups bow down to you the rule and Authority those who curse you or cursed those who bless you are blessed is like to come to a family blessing Abraham got it from God and passed down yeah that's right but now it's coming through Jacob and so Isaac thinks he's giving this to East on so Isaac was willing to give away the blessing
 for a bowl of food just like Adam and Eve were right but then what he actually is doing unwittingly is giving it to the son that God doesn't it for but the son that got definite for is not getting it by receiving it as a gift to literally everybody is doing the wrong thing in this story but the right thing is happening the right thing is happening but everybody has the wrong reasons for doing what they're doing is a good example of what Joseph says that the end of Genesis which is y'all plans this for evil but God was able to plan it for get from here to Jacob goes into the 20-year Exile halfway to Babylon in the land of his uncle Laban and it's sort of like the deceiver meets his match and basically it's 20 years of them deceiving each other tricking each other and they're both trying to just get as much blessing as they can out of each other that is labor and productivity and out of those 20 years
 deceit and treachery Jacob ends up with four wives who are all jockeying for the most favoured position of the matriarch and that rivalry among the nephew and Uncle Jacob and Laban gets mirrored and X these rival siblings and daughters while become Jacobs wives and it's out of that rivalry within a rivalry that the 12 sons of Jacob are produced it's so it's a blessing coz be fruitful and multiply it is a blessing but the blessing is surrounded by an environment of curse and environment of recent oil grease and 12 abuse and hardship is this contradiction that man is so true to The Human Experience you know even sometimes the gifts that come our way or Rapton really difficult painful circumstances so the question is what is God like Abraham occasionally blew it big-time
 Jacob slack from the get-go whoever he is a deceiver so what's got to do with a guy who just won't take the gift and this culminates in the story of God picking a fight with Jakob in the middle of the night at the store so good as in Genesis chapter 32 and long we could spend a lot of time here so I'll force myself not to but Jacob is sleeping by himself it's the night before he's about to meet his brother Esau again after 20 years and there's this guy a man just told a man picks a fight with him by the stream in the middle of the night right before sun to give me write for Sunrise and what the man says is Jacob is so Scrappy he actually is not going to be able to be there it's like I can't win against this guy so what the guy does is he strikes the hollow of his thigh so hard that it dislocates his
 tipbuzz jerked away from the socket of his thigh you got to ponder and say how hard do you have to be hit and where have your yeah totally I mean this is the hollow of the thigh where is that a specific place this guy punches Jacob in the crotch
 but you get the image here he's punched so hard that is hip socket goes out yeah totally have to say like where would that be well it's on the inside of the thigh so close up that the impact has to be going the direction that it would push the hip out the other direction and this has to do with member the core image of blessing is be fruitful and multiply and on the man's reproductive Anatomy right where is the central location right of the source of the man's contribution to the blessing it's in the right there that's the part of the body that the man strikes and then what the man says to Jacob is Hey listen the sun's about to rise let me go and Jacob says no I'm not letting you go until you give me a blessing and the guy says to Jacob what's your name
 he said yaakov and the man said no no no your name is no longer Yakko never that means he'll grab her rather your name will be struggles with God yes Rafael wrestles with God because you have some Rod struggled with God and with humans and here's the thing I got to give it to you you have prevailed you have a way of scheming your way out of any situation and coming out on top I got to hand it to you that's what kind of thing right here you've been struggling with me you kind of seem like I've met my match a little bit okay so I may be a very helpful image that was going to be my my first Hebrew Bible Professor railu that can he said the pot conflict of the biblical story one way you could frame it is us it's the story of how an irresistible Force meets an immovable object the irresistible force is God's desire to bless
 and the immovable Force at least in the biblical story is human stupidity selfishness Folly and self autonomy and so it says if God has been trying to bless this guy and this guy lives his whole life scheming and manipulating everyone around him to get the thing that God's been trying to give him and what God says here is and listen congrats you've come out on top you have prevailed and so what has got to do with a guy who won't believe that God just wants him to receive so what God has to do is wound him he has to incapacitate him in the part of the body where he can generate his own blessing and very powerful image of God having to both wound and heal
 to strike and to bless to get humans to receive the thing that you just wishes they could receive and so his name one of his name is not going on from the story his struggles with God and he's the father of the people group that will have it away this little story is a parable anticipating what the whole story of Exodus all the way through Kings Second Kings is going to be about it's just kind of developing what this little story is about here is lots of little puzzles in the story and it's here like a riddle that helps you understand the larger story of Jacob and the larger typical story God wounds this chosen one to finally get him to receive blessed to receive the blessing he's wounded because after he wounds him and renamed him and then it says and then the man placed him there and then Jacob says I have seen the face of God so he named the place face of God Danielle and he limps on his side for the rest of his days
 this is a different kind of wounding there's a theme of The Suffering righteous one like Joe or like the suffering servant in Isaiah of someone who suffers because of their suffering then can is qualified to bless others of that was just a different kind of wounding where it's like you're not the righteous one I need you to like get your head in the game and actually be the righteous one and in order to do that I'm holding you yeah I think that's it he's brought this crisis on his own head so to speak he's created this crisis to crisis being like it cuz of this point the story wouldn't hit the stage he's like on the run right he's but he's going to come back to meet his brother but he's pretty sure there's brother is going to want to kill him and so he still scheming and cooking up a plan for how to manipulate his brother when you meet tomorrow and so the night before he goes back to his family land and manipulates his brother you get the story
 it's essentially God saying no more buddy so I can you got to stop the scheming business so what he does to see a Jacob's ability to produce any more touches them in the thigh there's only one child born after the story to Jacob it's Benjamin and it may even be that Rachel was already pregnant in which case this was the blow that ended his fertility and what he learns is that the only blessing he's going to get comes as a gift from God because his own scheming is just going to hurt himself and other people and He will endure through it all right God gives him that credit but it only leads to wounding his wounded for his own sins as it were but yet he still got the chosen one and that's the portrait here and you're right the image of God suffering chosen one that's going to continue to develop in the Hebrew Bible is the suffering servant of Isaiah suffers for the sins of Jacob he takes the sins that are not his own servants but he takes the sins
 of all of his ancestors upon himself so that they can receive right standing with God because of what he does on their behalf that's a little different than what's happening here but we're in the same family of like the wounded service so those are the best kind of the Ark of the Jacob Story the word blessing and curse appears in the Genesis scroll in a high density in Genesis 12 3 and then it's kind of a case in the story of Abraham and then if you have like a little you know you see those people at the beach with a little metal detectors if you have like a detector and you're going over to Genesis Grill I get lot the hits in Genesis 12 3 you get a couple in Genesis 12 that we started with this episode and then you get to the Jacob story and it's
 so we're exploring themes of a whole book here through the story of Jacob and it ends with a wounded sad kind of bitter Man by the end of this day and God has given him many gifts and it's not clear that he is even able to appreciate them by the time you get to the stores at the end of Genesis he just seems like a really crotchety old man and it's a sad he's tragic character I think in the story but he is God's tragic character. Makes him a vehicle of the chosen seed and that's what the story of his sons will go into PayPal so I can set this up is like Abraham was chosen by God to give the blessing and Abraham's mix back we got stories of him being a deceiver and a snake who got stories of him surrendering all and sitting there underneath the great trees of mamre and hosting the angels and he's going to make you go if God's going to attach his mission to bless the world
 through this guy is a mixed bag you know what's that look like for the Nations and for him then to Generations later you get a story of Jacob the deceiver right out of the gate he is just a deceiver and he's trouble but God has attached his plan to bless the world through him and what if someone is just so far gone that from the jump everything they do is cunning and selfish and deceptive and just creates chaos around them everywhere what's got going to do in a Coleman eighths in a wrestling match yeah well God doesn't do is abandon him he actually says I will never leave you nor forsake you and that's what those famous words come from What God Says Jacob when he has to leave his family yeah so what he doesn't do is abandon him what he does do is pick a fight for them and wounded and won't have a severe Mercy
 almost to like get him to stop hurting himself and other people which kind of does after this point but yeah he comes across as kind of a sad Broken Man from here on out and he gives him a new name is identity now is connected to like his incessant character of struggle that God will come and meet and have it in the narrative does it do specify that he walks with a limp now yeah it says yeah then this little story he crossed the stream at Pennywell and he limped on his thigh and you get the sting of death for the sons of Israel don't eat this certain part of the hip muscle or hips in you in the hollow of the thigh of animals too because of this memory right here so the memory of what God did to Jacob Israel is both carried on by the name the name represents this whole theme this is the name of the people of Israel
 is like the meaning of the name is introduced in the story which select it doesn't bode well for how the rest of the story is going to go but it's also memorialized like Passover with the eating habits of the people to remember so as we go from the Jacob story God is going to carry on the promise to bless the world and the nation through not Jacob but through the Next Generation through the sun's the promise gets carried on to them yet 12 sons and the story of those twelve Sons begins in chapter 37 and that's begins 4th literary movement of Genesis and we could continue blessing a curse theme but the words really drop off the metal detector
 like if this very few hits and so what we are going to do is explore another 60 Minutes toy but for now we can draw our Reflections yeah I'm blessing and curse in the shake-up story to close
 pics of listening to this episode of Bible project podcast we have finished the third movement of the Genesis scroll that leaves one more movement it's the stories of Jacob's 12 sons with an emphasis on a man named Joseph and as we read the stories we're going to look at the theme of Exile so Joseph descent to the pit is dissent in Egypt as a slave are all going to be accumulating as images of his Exile going down to go down just to go into Exile just like Adam and Eve went down from the high in Mountain Garden into Exile just like Cain went out of Eden into Exile Today Show was produced by Cooper pelts edited by Danielle Mo and Zac mckinlay show notes are my Lyndsay Ponder Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to do list everything that we make is free because of the generous
