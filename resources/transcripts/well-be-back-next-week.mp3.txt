hey this is John from Bible project and today would have been our 287 episode of The Bible project podcast 287 episodes where we would have not missed a week we even somehow managed to get this far in a global pandemic and release a new episode every week but unfortunately we are mere humans and we have to let you know that our next podcast episode won't be available until next Monday it's an off week a bye week so next Monday will continue in our conversations in the Genesis scroll looking at the third movement the stories of Jacob but this week feel free to jump into our back catalogue and listen to an episode you haven't heard in awhile and if you have I listen to the podcast in our new app I highly recommend it we have an augmented feature within the app that gives you real-time information as you're listening to the podcast links
 do videos links to notes links the scripture as we're dialoguing get the app on Android and iOS in your app store and then click on the button podcast the next theme that we're going to be looking at is a new thing and to prepare yourself for the theme I would suggest listening to any of our episodes on generosity in a series on generosity we also have a really cool story called God and money it's the story of two Harvard Business students of a radical encounter with their Paradigm of God and money whatever you do this week I hope it is Splendid and we'll see you next Monday
