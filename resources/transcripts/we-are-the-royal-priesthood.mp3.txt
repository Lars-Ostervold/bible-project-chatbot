hey everybody this is Tim a Bible project and welcome to the Bible project podcast this week is our last episode of exploring the theme of the royal priesthood in the story The Bible last week we pondered the story of Jesus's Ascension where his body left the Earthly Dimension and where he goes to take up the right-hand seat of God the father and makes Priestly intercession on behalf of humanity even this very moment but according to the writings of the Apostles in the New Testament even though the body of Jesus has left physically in one form it is still present here with us in another way if you read in Paul's letter to the Romans you will discover this phrase the body of Christ which body of Messiah and Paul really believes the collective people of Jesus actually embody the life of Jesus
 right now and I fully understand this we need to see how Paul and also the Apostle Peter we've in language about followers of Jesus as a royal priesthood or as temples of the living sacrifices what do all of these images mean and how are they all connected it's really really amazing so that's what we're going to explore today and even more of course thanks for joining us here we go
alright let's wrap up this conversation on priesthood draw the Bible and so what we want to do is talk specifically about how the people who followed Jesus are now part of this this idea this theme of priests which quick little summary idea of being a priest is working in typically a temple is what you would think of but it's a person who works in the temple which is a holy Place sacred place that represents were God space in human space are combined with God rules in temples are often these images of God that represent God and in some real way and in now we go all the way to the first pages of the Bible and we see that God created a place where you put humans wear his own presence is she creates like eating as like a temple and then he calls the humans His Image which are normally in a place
 we're having an Arthur United but now they are people and which God's own authority and character these things are supposed to be in Body by Humanity as well and so that's the idea of being a priest and the whole story of the Bible can be thought through the lens of these priests who have fallen from that vocation needing their own priests now I can intercessor of sorts cookie come and restore them back to this position of raining and rolling with God and so the priests have some duties one is is worship one is intercession so that the people who don't have this location of being a priest can be reconnected to God we establish a relationship and then flip it over they also they represent God to those people so they represent people to God and they represent God's people this is divine and human mediators and they also are
 theaters of God's blessing his personal presence and life power clearings abundance and so we've got these priests throughout the story of the Bible who know I'm doing this as a reflection of how this is supposed to be all Humanity were doing and all and what all creation is destined for and yeah I could either Sacred Space humans all humanity is doing this but this reflection is is problematic in that it's still run by humans who have our own will and tend to be bail and so this whole story culminates in Jesus who is both the place we're having a nurse connect and the human who his will is completely aligned with God I can truly represent God and truly intercede he's presented as both the temple and the priests the place where God and human are one and the person
 in whom God and human are one of the big Priestly intercession the main event it seems like at least in my mind is the death and Resurrection sacrificing himself which is an idea we've seen established through his Priestly theme of Abraham having to sacrifice his family Legacy Moses offering to sacrifice himself David offering to sacrifice himself beside me and Isaiah of this ultimate Royal priest will also do that there's a steam so that that makes sense of what what Jesus is doing is he's being that sacrifice and the priest but then we read in an axe one where come to disciples and he's showing his like kind of resurrected transform body and teaching them about the king of God and then after around 40 days he is ascended
 into the sky and then we got these new testament writers talking about he's Apostles writing Paul and the author of Hebrews about what that means for Jesus to be extended at the right hand of God which is that he's there interceding on our behalf still and that's the Priestly role so he's so Jesus in The Heavenly Temple which it's supposed to be United with Earth is not yet United which has been represented through the Tabernacle and the temple as trying to kind of get this Union going again is now represented in the person of Jesus himself in his life and now Jesus is sitting in the Heavenly temple interceding on our behalf and then you said at the end of the last episode that Jesus actually is still on Earth in one sense in a sense that his body although is his resurrected body is seated at the right hand of God and his body is also in some way still
 and the New Testament authors talked about this as the body of Christ and when they do they often talk about it in terms of the Priestly duties as a temple or a priesthood usually both
 so let's go back to the Ascension passage in Acts 1 what Jesus said right before he was highly exalted on the clouds was that I'm going to send power from on high and y'all will be my Witnesses then he ascends takes his Cosmic thrown the next chapter is Pentecost and what happens in Acts chapter 2 is on Israel's celebration of the 7th 7th of course Pentecost happened 7 times 7 days after Passover 7 times 7 days after Passover correct is on the 50th chapter 2 they were all together in one place suddenly there came from the skies from the skies where Jesus says something is being sent down by Jesus annoys like a violent rushing wind
 the house where they were sitting there appeared to them tongues of fire Distributing themselves each resting on everyone Wind & Fire filling and coming to rest come now I'm on the 77 okay yeah cuz now we're combining the seven is activating completion of God created work that God comes and rests in creation to rule and Reign correct but then this fire the Wind & Fire the Wind & Fire are activating what we saw on Exodus when the Tabernacle and set up correct fire comes down from heaven yep that's right this wind in that Story 2 when does was on Mount Sinai so it's like what was happening on top of Mount Sinai transfers and goes in over the 10th totally that's right and so it all comes together in the culminating date
 a 4 and they were all filled so being filled resting Wind and Fire live lots of things being activated here terms of hyperlinks to the Hebrew scriptures but for sure they are all King into depicting this group of people as a temple where the divine presence is taking up residence and where did it come from the skies where Jesus is God's Heavenly Temple presents transfers to an Earthly Temple that is a group of people yeah that's right so this is Luke's narrative way of launching that theme in the book of Acts it continues on in different ways but this was a ground-level metaphor or image that the apostles use right on throughout the New Testament so for example of fusions to Paul can talk about when Jews and non-jews come together and give their allegiance Jesus in
 yeah fusions too he talks about they become God's house in verse 19 built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets the Hebrew prophets the Hebrew scriptures and the apostles Jesus the Messiah Jesus himself being like the foundation stone is Cornerstone in whom the whole building fitted together is growing into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom y'all are being built together as a dwelling of God in spirit the mouth. Over laughing are the house the house is the foundation Cornerstone building but notice for those are growing the building is growing and joining together
 what is a human organism development in chapter 4 where he's going to talk about a new Humanity growing and all the limbs and muscles and ligaments fitting together in the body of Christ we talked about the spiritual gifts yeah that's right same the temple is a human the Sacred Space well as a community of humans that are collectively a new human body they are collectively a metaphoric human body which is also a temple television this might seem like a man can they keep their metaphors straight boots go all the way back the Sacred Space and the sacred people who inhabit that space are analogies to each other the space where Garden human are one is an analogy to the people the images of God in whom God and Humanity are one they are different ways of exploring the same reality is this bring us back to that
 praise than when Jesus says where two or three are together and I am in the middle of them so idea of the place we're having dinner with your night is where the people come to unite the same group of people coming together as one human body are the temple overlap of having address of making that point in a narrative activating all these hyperlinks Paul is doing it by painting this Picasso like portrait human is at 1 human or a bunch of humans and the course the answer is yes it's very practically the thing that you needed to go to the temple for now is realized in your mixed right yeah I mean it but it's not as if after Pentecost the followers of Jesus are still gathering in the temple they still find it as a meaningful play so your ass is in
 birth of like the temple is bad or outmoded it's that the temple is a simple than boys do a reality which is better in the reality was encountered in the person of Jesus to her and now through the spirit there is manifesting themselves as an Earthly corporate manifestation of the Heavenly Jesus's body and so it's another simple the first generation before the destruction of the temple in Bay Point to the temple in Jerusalem as a symbol of the Union heaven on Earth and they can point to their own Community they're both symbols well actually I think I'm going to step back from that and I'll say the apostles want us to see something more in the body of the Messiah that is his community cuz they want us to see it as the actual Earthly embodiment of Jesus which is why are they so fiercely protected I don't have Alyssa's here but in 1st Corinthians 3 he starts talking about how the apostles are like these Farmers the plant seed
 it grows and becomes a building yeah what he says is the apostles and leaders of a community of Jesus will be held to a higher standard when it comes to how they LED and tried to grow these communities and then he says yeah y'all are at Temple anyone who ruins the temple of God God will ruin that person so I think they see a more is just a symbol of the same way that they would see the temple is more than a simple there was someone else there was a reality happening but I guess what I'm trying to tease out is granted they still saw value in the temple and as long as it was there that's a great place to convene yeah but the temple is gone it's okay for the moment that they realize the body of the Messiah wasn't just an Israel thing but was as Jesus said meant to include people of all Nations and then the piece of land or the architecture attached to that
 the plan becomes less important to people who live outside Jerusalem and also the activities of the temple can be done now in your own home yes right yes perfect this is where the body of Christ as a temple Shades into or you can flip the coin over and communicate the same idea but now describing the body of Christ at the priesthood as a royal priesthood doing the things that priests it in that space so let's look at some passages where the apostles are working that same
I started Romans 12 which was trying to multiple times in the last year or so. I've given this a text in the translation does y'all's in the city taking the first statement of Romans chapter 12 let you read it for his word I heard you all brothers and sisters all y'all all y'all texting translate I heard y'all y'all brothers and sisters by the mercies of God to presents all y'all's body as a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship and everyone of you together yeah it's plural body all y'all each have an individual body whose writing a network of house churches made up of a couple hundred bodies all y'all had different bodies
 and the punch comes to present all y'all's bodies as a living and holy sacrifice but the word sacrifice of singular thinks first of all where is the imagery coming from spaces yes interceding to sacrifice giving thanks or surrendering at its core cuz not all sacrifices there was right there somewhere thank you that's right so what what is the common denominator underneath both thank you sacrifice and Natoma sacrifice its surrendering it's giving back getting over to and this animal symbolizes me I give the whole of myself over to I give my body give your body
 and so uses doll the Liturgy language it's acceptable to God that's from Leviticus he calls that you're so interesting now standard has spiritual service of worship word spiritual is not the words. It's the Greek word Logic on Logic on logic Logic on it means true and proper I think that's how the new international version translate tsubomi see true and proper true and proper service of worship all of you all's body so each of you have individually have a body and all of them together are presented as one doctor find one unified surrender one unified at Reserve in back of surrender and that is how you do your Priestly Duty surrendering collectively surrendering yourselves
 correct now so question is it this is the culmination of Romans 1 through 11 what does that mean what does Paul have in mind like what what counts as an act of communal sacrifice right that's the question we usually when this pass is brought up and Christian communities people fill in what they think sacrifice would be in for Paul it's all about two tribes and non-jew finding Unity where people give up something sacrificing something for the sake of unity sake of creating this new unified community that isn't divided along the same lines as their neighbors been wrong which is what he says next don't be conformed to this world but let your mind be renewed and transformed so that you can discern what the will of God
 please acceptable perfect well what is God's will 11 to have a unified family of people that consists of people of all Nations they're unified by their allegiance to she saw a notice. Immediately start to talk about is how that group of people can become unified everyone among you should not think more highly of themselves than they ought to think as to have a sound judgment as God gives each member of face we have many members in one body knows the singular body now meaning was referring to hear what I just said y'all have your own bodies like I have a lot of different parts of my own body we all have different members in my one or one body and those members don't all have the same function so we who are many are one body in the Messiah and individually members of one another so he's working the body theme in the new way here and then he goes on to talk about
 spiritual gifts would you even think it's just some other categories of theology but it's all it's all connected connected to being the priests who are surrendering themselves collectively for the sake of unity yep to align themselves with God's will which is to pee at diverse the unified people are restoring the blessings of that are the Earthly body of the Messiah the Earthly body of the Messiah kind of shading into our family discussions but for Paul the Integrity of Jesus's reputation and missing in the earth depends on his followers seeing themselves with all their diversity and differences Theology and opinion seeing them as one body in the Messiah that offers a unified Collective sacrifice to maintain that Unity which is why he goes on you know prophecy serving teaching exhorting leading and then it Cullman
 it's with let love be without apocracy hate what is evil cling to the good be devoted to one another in Philadelphia sibling love so amazing paragraph worth a lot of meditation but it's all one unified stream of thought the uniform of the royal priesthood of Jesus followers is the Earthly body of the Messiah thank you Jesus is in heaven and Heaven as a royal priest and his Earthly body and that's the same idea of being amateur God and it's not a different idea out of different idea but it's an active way of thinking about it and it's a way to honor the fact that God is the true image of Jesus is the truth now we are extending notice also the priests are also the sacrifice
 yeah I was noticing that y'all's body's not only are we of the temple and the priests were asked to be a sacrifice sacrifice which against think back to Abraham and Isaac Moses David in their stories and then this video series their acts of self-sacrifice in these high places are the key narrative images of total self surrender to God so yeah it's like Jesus is sacrifice as the true Royal priest the true image of God it doesn't then kind of cut us out of the equation was like oh okay well yeah yeah now it's done Jesus's death on the cross wasn't the last sacrifice that needed to be made yeah you know and I looted to that kind of mystery and when I in the last episode with Paul's with a statement about how he's feeling up in himself or completing in themselves to suffering actually
 finality to what Jesus did to reconcile Garden manager is death but that act evil was overcome and Reconciliation was made but that act needs to be imitated and implemented continually by all of the bodies of Jesus's followers who are collectively the body of Jesus it continually sacrificing itself is a very powerful ideas I mean this is like really Bedrock Concepts to for conceiving of the the mission and purpose of a local church and for every local church to consider what does it mean to act in unity with all of the other expressions of the body of the Messiah that are around me man and that protestantism that's not what I think coming from Catholics perspective would say and this is why Protestants really need to eat some Humble Pie and
 think how the concept of church Unity really has any Integrity I don't know I don't have answers here I'm just saying this is a real issue in the history of the church that's a real issue here now and of course yeah and you know I'm I'm I'm coming from an American environment that's politically charged right now and there's there's a very clear this Unity along those lines along those lines yeah was in the community and feels like overwhelming yes it does all the bodies bring one Collective unified sacrifice like that feels like a pipedream feels pretty insurmountable right now I suppose it probably feels about as insurmountable as Abraham and Sarah thinking of how I could have a kid or right I mean
 that means image of total surrender means coming to the end of your own resources and stepping out in an act of radical trust into an unknown reality trusting that God can bring about a new creation I don't know more personally I'm in more in the state of lament right now both of the state of the church and its lack of Integrity but also its inability to say anything prophetic to the world because of its to see you today and I think Paul knew that that's why Unity is such an important scene here anyhow it's kind of depressing I want to like be inspired when I read this and then I'm like yeah boy and Paul is speaking in corporate communal terms right here you know so yes individual acts of love and self-sacrifice to bridge the divides that separate parts
 search that's a part of this but Paul's thinking and very corporate structural language share of all y'all's bodies coming together and speaking very corporate terms to do something corporately you're in need of a bit of unity before you can come and sacrifice our current ways of thinking about what it means to be a part of the people of Jesus and dreaming up new realities that could communicate this mission to the world but this is a part of the royal Priestly calling of the body of the Messiah Thursday body of the Messiah this unified witness and self-surrender was also pretty hairless pretty instrumental Bowl in some ways he wasn't asking for something simple hear no you're right you have these steps
 house churches divided along ethnic cultural boundary lines and he's asking them to integrated together when I read the New Testament I don't feel like I'm a Christian
 exactly been quite serious I basically feel like I'm hardly Christian yeah I mean it's intense and I know that's a part of the point is like to it begins by recognizing that fell in many ways to live up to the story and that there is a covering for that you know but I should have a friend who put this reason why he's just like if my Christianity becomes completely aspirational am I really hate Christians think about is running really I don't know a lot of stuff on this day in I know it's a healthy place to be I hope a year from now I can feel like I've made some yeah I mean the cups the current events have exposed the disunity and actually I think
 in a way deeper into a lot of at least from what I've seen and this is this is American politics and what I'm talking about but also the pandemic I think his actually created this this dividing wall pandemic and then you got all the discussion around a race and justice has become a massive and is in that one the church has for the most part of the dominant White Church in America has had a very active role in perpetuating racial segregation even though there are important very important exceptions to that they haven't been able to turn the tide on Main Street in Louisville and so is that where all the bodies all the bodies they can't even agree if it's an issue so when there's not even enough Unity to agree.
 there's something we need to surrender then how would a unified surrendering ever take my ass I guess you're right and I think that's true of social justice issues but it's also shoot True Justice really practical Health stuff like does it matter how many people are dying does it help by doing this for that should we do this or that like there's not even an agreement now I like those basic kind of any among followers of Lord have mercy upon us have mercy upon us
so we're supposed to be the pre Apostle he spent a lot of time with Jesus and he talks in chapter two of the first letter he talks about Jesus and 2:4 he talks about him as a living stone that has been rejected by humans but his choice and precious in the eyes of God we're stepping right into the context here the paragraphs before and after this are all woven together so tight we talked about Jesus as the temple by Living Stones series activating stuff from The Book of Daniel and the book of Isaiah anyway so just like Jesus is a human Temple Livingstone Force 5 all y'all also are living stones portal being built up into a house of the spirit spiritual house by which he doesn't mean
 a non material house which means as a house in 12 I got spirit that is a holy priesthood to Temple and it's a priesthood offering up spiritual that is Holy Spirit empowered sacrifice is acceptable to God through Jesus Christ he doesn't say here that the house that is the priesthood is also the sacrifice it's more that y'all at the temple and the priesthood offering sacrifices that makes sense where in Romans they were kind of all the same yeah he doesn't turn up the volume on the priests offering themselves as sacrifice here it's priests offering sacrifices in the verbal kind of the matter what kind of sacrifices does he have in mind exactly go on the talk about here it's on the book of Isaiah the Stone Temple theme in the book of Isaiah comes down to verse 9 and he says but y'all are a chosen race
 strange thing to say especially to a community of made up of multiracial people for God's possession so that you may announce the Excellence of the one who summoned you out of darkness and Into The Marvelous Light which is that Priestly duties of worship one of the Priestly duties yeah to make noise or funnel noise up to increase the honor of God all those phrases chosen race he's actually gotten from the book of Isaiah from Isaiah chapter 43. We don't have time it's such a cool I-43 the whole paragraph for 16 to 21 is really cool read it and then take a walk with a cup of teetotaler
 it recalls The Exodus and then says I'm going to do a new thing a new Exodus but then when he talks about is using the Eden creation narrative from Genesis to about the desert that God still loves with water and grows a garden and then the garden is My Chosen rice my chosen people the garden is I give Street Thanksgiving know the water's grow a garden in the wilderness and they and they give drink to My Chosen People which is revoking the Wilderness narratives after The Exodus and these are the people I formed for myself that they may Proclaim my prayers it's a new Exodus people who sprays cool and then those other three royal priesthood holy nation God's Own possession are all taken from the first moment that amount of this real Mount Sinai Exodus 19
 turn on the people and so one of the sacrifices were roles that they play is price but one of the other things yeah what are Peter and what he continues to go on the talk about it through the letter is a community of mutual submission and honoring lifting up others is more important than yourself back room stuff back to Romans 12 now he's making it Concrete in 24 Century Asia Minor culture for what that kind of community would look like but it gives you it gets you a picture I like this to go throughout the rest of the New Testament and you look up sacrifice language you get a statement like this in Hebrews 13 I'll let you read this this great line 1315 fixing through Jesus there for that is continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise worship in the fruit of lips that openly profess his name and do not forget
 do good and to share with others for with such sacrifices God is pleased sharing sharing your stuff doing doing good one in Cove have people sharing and serving of praise worship and then surrendering what belongs to you and giving it to others that is a sacrifice to God in the temple surrendering an animal to be sacrificed is giving something that's your isn't giving it to God yeah but now it's like this re-envisioning that sacrifice for something underneath that the surrender to God is actually surrendering something to somebody else that is you're surrendering to God your transformation of the image so Peter he writes in a different way but he use a similar metaphors but it's all the same base
 the idea here is what positive thing about me really comes back to Unity yeah Unity achieved through sacrificing for one another for the sake of than being able to continue Jesus ministry is healing and restoration of all creation words and poetry and art sand song fruit of the lips of the sacrifices that are here transformed into acts of service and service and sharing with people who don't have what I have and humility and loyalty yes what was what is 12 as a role so let's say after hearing these words with so you got a Priscilla who is still living in Rome and Dee's house churches are still fractured and Paul has been arrested and executed
 Define arrow and how would Priscilla wake up one morning and repulse where it's about present all y'all's bodies one of them might be that she notices the in this one House Church like there's these these Gentiles who are just so angry cuz it's maybe a Jewish merchants and he always wants to make sure that everything's kosher all the foods kosher Yeah Yeahs on the on the Lord's day when they got there and he thinks it's stupid and he doesn't want to get the cursor up session and so Priscilla might first offer a long prayer to God on behalf of these two followers of Jesus in conflict and take up their concerns before God but then she also might go get involved and try and mediate a compromise of this would be a priest Royal Priestly active interceding and mediating and trying to reconcile people I think these are the kinds of things that fall would have in mind for any rights to rindal y'all Surrender Your Body
 as a unified sacrifice or making sacrifices that are acceptable to God I think that's where our imaginations are supposed to go that's helpful to make it more concrete the big vision of this unified body feels overwhelming but just a simple active Okay I can make sacrificial recently and it's a Priestly thing to do maybe it's just to help with one small little conflict but that could be my contribution think of the priests the categories of representation where are there people or circumstances in my neighborhood where I could be a representation of the generosity and love of God and so inserting yourself into those situations and with generosity and love is a boy of mediation representing God
 purpose and concern into that situation at the Priestley act just like in that little imaginary scenario Priscilla's involvement in the conflict is also a Priestly a Priestly act bringing the concerns of my church Community or neighborhood before God like Moses up on the mountain interceding on behalf of the people it's a very powerful set of images to allow let's soak in our imagination to think about this just the daily calling of the church
in last book of the Bible in Revelation there are four times in the book where John evokes that phrase Kingdom of priests Royal priests and then in the last paragraph has like the narrative Vision he brings all the images together so in the opening lines he talks about how Jesus and 1:6 he loves us and has liberated us from our sins by his blood and made us into a kingdom of priests who serve his God and Father and that little line is repeated in chapter 5 in the throne room this is when the lamp is opening The Scroll of God's purpose is for history and there's a group as acquire around him this is all happening in the Heavenly Temple and they saying that you have made all these people that you purchased from every nation a kingdom of priests who serve our God who will reign on the earth image of God created Humanity to be his image
 do the idea would always to have become a whole people who are priests people education and then when that doesn't happen and it spiraled out of control and he selects Abraham and Sarah says I'm going to restore the blessing through your family but not just for you but you guys can be priests basic like in the sense but for all the nations idea of when Moses is at Sinai and got invites everyone up to be Kingdom of priests correct it's this echoing of like this is where this is all heading the kingdom of priests and then in the Revelation that's what we do we see hope in the last again paragraph of the narrative Vision in revelation 22 this famous image he sees coming out of the city that does the unified have an interest he sees
 Panama City coming down to earth in chapter 21 now he sees the river of the Water of Life flowing from the Throne of God and the Throne of the Lamb cuz he sits at the right hand of the one down the middle of the great City on each side of the river stood the tree of life we talked about this for a river which I guess I didn't really realize is also a street in the river is that also a street what is that happened down in the middle of the great Street of the city cuz there's a river down the street I would really be like a loser area surrounding a river I think this is activating the the highway Motif from the book of Isaiah verse three no longer will there be any curse on doing Genesis 3 and the Throne of God and the lamb will be in the city and his servants will serve him there's that word sir
 what is the word work the corresponding word the match what he says that Adam and Eve to work the garden and take care for it and hear it's two servants will serve his workers will work his worshippers will worship our this is the word the Greek word why is it serve here cuz we talked about it's worship and work the same words to work to worship and serve salt one Hebrew word there will be no more night is going back to Genesis 1 verse 2 The Darkness will be no more night they won't need the light of a lamp where the light of a sun will just need the day one life Genesis one right that emanates from God's Own Self last sentence and they will rain the servants the Priestly servants will reign forever and are you won't need that a the Sun but doesn't mean there is no sun huh it's in visiting as it's the whole story of the Bible is retold just within the framework of the first day about the darkness containing the light
 providing all the lights necessary they will reign forever it's about the installation of a human as the cosmic royal priesthood but it can never just be about that one it's about that one's Earthly body unified new Humanity that is really capturing their vocation as the royal priesthood and then this is a moment where it all comes together again haven't Unearthed are one and the Royal priest and his priesthood are all together in the same place thinking about drawing in many ways the sacrifice theme is a much as as as much as team in this video on the high place like Abraham and Moses David all are going to in this video series will have their own high places for self-sacrifice Jesus and then in this video Once Jesus is exalted into the heavens but you still have
 people who are up on the eye place what's fireplace just bought it on my street my home my family but it's just giving us an imagination I'm to see myself as ongoing on the Mount Moriah sacrificing needing to surrender the thing that I think I can't live without to discover the power and love of God my calling as a royal princess Unity of God's people and the will of God can be experienced through sacrifice again for this video recalling Eden the ideal the roles of the priests Jesus and his Ascension Cosmic world peace in heaven doing those things is Earthly body called the do those things until the reunification of heaven and I think that's just creates a nice tight three movements working through a core set of Maltese and makes sense by itself
 there's some pickups for how it fits with everything my mind. I think about that more difficult with you thanks everybody for joining us on this episode and if you listen to all the way through this series on the royal priesthood way to go out that's it for a conversation topics we're going to be exploring to biblical Scholars who have done important research on priesthood in the Bible and especially the figure of milk is attacked in the Book of Genesis and the New Testament letter to the roost recited to share those with you we're also going to do one question in response episode on the series Today Show was produced by Dan gummo or show notes are from Lyndsay Ponder and a theme music is by the band tenth power project is a crowdfunded Endeavor in Portland Oregon we are making free resources to help people experience the Bible as a unified story
