we've been tracing the theme of the sea dragon in the story of the Bible sea dragons an ancient symbol of disorder and chaos and death Christine how when God's creatures succumb to the Sea Dragon the Sea Dragon consumes them making them also chaos creatures yet the Bible anticipate the coming King who will defeat the dragon once and for all the gospel authors to pick Jesus as that King in today's episode we look at how Jesus confronts the dragon and it's not in the way his followers expected he will allow agents of the snake to take his life and he will die because of the sins of his people and for their sins for the ways they partnered with the snake can become agents the snake chaos and death in the land he will allow that death to overwhelm him because he knows that he's the son of the father and together that they are the author of all life itself
 do for Jesus. Victory over the power of the Dragon he will first surrender to it this sounds so counterintuitive that Peter one of Jesus's disciples rebuked Jesus and Jesus response is get behind me Satan when Peter says this is not going to happen the voice that Jesus hears speaking through Peter is the Satan cuz that's what he calls him so this is for sure another moment where's the snakes taking the opportune time speaking through Peter you could crush the dragon by Smashing there in the man that Jesus says it's the voice of the same tempting him evil chaos and death are scary things we want to fight back with violence we want to destroy chaos we want to bring death to the dragon but Jesus says take up your cross and follow him to defeat death we have to be willing to die and that's because the fear of death is the only real power the dragon actually has
 the power of the Dragon get us so afraid of death that we will fall in line under the powers that have the power over our life and she's assist less. Version of Life Go and Let it go the way of the Dragon Witch is back into the dark chaotic ocean which it came today to Mackey and I are talking about the life of Jesus and what it means to have victory over the dragon in our lives I'm done calling the new listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 okay temp on here we are here we are Jesus running Dragon we've covered a lot of ground yes we have and here we are that's coming to the climactic moment where Jesus is going to have a victory over the dragon of some sort we've been tracking with the story of Jesus in the last conversation we were looking at ways of the Gospel authors portray Jesus as the one who has come to have victory over the cosmic chaos Dragon ice dragon in one sense is just the reality that there's disorder in the world that God actually brought order to when he created the cosmos and he put it in his boundaries but then it's also a way to talk about how both humans and Spiritual Beings can go in League with that disorder and then use it to intentionally fight against God and
 bring the world into more disorder when we talked about that Dragon we're talking about the snake in the garden with talking about Goliath we're talking about Nebuchadnezzar were talking about corrupt evil violence the worst that humans can do to each other and the worst that like the cosmos can do to us yeah that's right would kill us what does pretty bad I'd I spend most of my time actually trying to avoid that situation yeah getting killed by the universe's I think this is the stuff of nightmares yeah I'm laughing cuz of text was so uncomfortable it was cool to see how Jesus you know confronts this in in the form of the Satan in the wilderness the creature in the wilderness who tries to distort God's word in Jesus just as like them I'm going to be faithful to God's word and then also that Jesus
 is described as the one who could shred on the sea and rebuke the sea which are images very clear images of God ordering the cosmic chaos which is the sea and its image of treading on the sea and going out is the image of God going out to slay the dragon and he was Jesus going and doing that and then he sent his disciples and gives them Authority and the disciples realize they have the power to to subdue chaos and who knows what else they experienced and she's like yeah what you doing you are like stomping on scorpions and snakes yeah totally Luke chapter 10 and so the stories about begins with God putting in motion a creation that's ordered but they're still chaos out there and he wants humans to partner with him to subdue and Rule yet and instead the humans Rebelle in League with spiritual forces become the monster that
 God wants us to rule over and now here we have Jesus teaching his disciples how to reverse that but the monster still loose yes it is very much so especially now that somebody is on the scene who actually can threaten it and resist its power resist its Allure so we started and our last conversations with Jesus test in the wilderness that are framed as his victory over the alluring voice of the dragon that says listen if you really have power you don't have to trust your father
 to provide you what you need by his wisdom you can just take the wheel man
 make your own food make him work on your timeline for the delivery you and listen I have this great way for you to gain your authority over having a nurse just do it my way I'll show you how to gain power if you do it my wife that's his third test and she says Nope we already know how the snake guides people to gain power cuz it started with cane if you need to achieve what is good and if it cost the life of your brother you know sometimes to make an omelette you gotta break some eggs even if the egg is your brother he missed the exit brother and then he Revival and the rest of human history is just that on replay so Jesus resist that urge and so we're told the slanderer finished every test Luke chapter 4 and left him until the right time the right time
 Jesus walks out of that going cast so I did the right thing but really the conflicts just like ramp it up
 so he's mounting his assault so to speak on the reign of the snake the rule of the snake and he knows he knows that at some point it's going to lead to the ultimate conflict and the fact that he knows is actually a major theme in his teachings surrounding why he calls himself the son of Adam but the son of man so in a passage in Matthew chapter 16 comes up next we should say so we're switching from Luke to Matthew in Matthews account the first resistance Jesus gets from any of the religious leaders isn't until chapters 9 and 10 after The Sermon on the Mount even and everybody's like who is this young preacher I loved hearing him but Jesus it begins to describe and be aware of the Gospel authors tell us that there is growing resistance among the powers of his own people
 read Matthew chapter 16 the steam room to read Jesus can read the writing on the wall and he knows the snakes after
stop Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came into the District of caesarea Philippi which is way up North still Israel well yes although the area that he's going to in particular was co-opted by some puppet King's under the Roman Empire one of the sons or grandsons of Herod the tried killing this baby that's why it's named Philip I after the name of that King it's near the source of the River Jordan and there's this huge cave up there that was a big Greek and Roman are like Shrine and Temple to I forget which deity but that's provided the waters and there's a big town and City around Etc Phillipi so Multicultural polytheistic you know center of culture and there he takes them there and asked his disciples who do people say that the son of
 Adam is so that's my translation here instead of me instead of man but man means Adam here when Jesus uses that title so well maybe John the Baptist you know he was pretty cool other say Elijah others Jeremiah when the prophets that's interesting Jesus says who do you all say that I am
 Simon Peter answered your the Messiah the Son of the Living God how blessed are you Simon son of Jonah because Flesh and Blood did not reveal this to you but my father who is in heaven so many things going on this is an important passage for a lot of reasons but when Jesus says who do people say the son of Adam is butt who do you say that I am this connects to a big steam in his teachings were son of Adam was one of the main ways that Jesus described himself kind of shifted from using the phrase son of man trying to use more consistently what the phrase means which is a son of Adam because that's what the phrase actually isn't Hebrew been a dumb so you are the anointed one the son of the Living God you're the snake crushing season woman you're the servant of the Psalms of David
 so that's right Simon flesh-and-blood didn't reveal this to you cuz earlier Jesus said when people start rejecting him he says that my true identity is known to the father and I make known who my father is and you are making know who I am but not you know whatever you were revealed at the babies but not to everybody else so Jesus is tapping into that that he's developed this crew of disciples that really know who he is
 so what he says is I also say to you that you Simon our pets R Us you're the Rock and Upon This Rock I will build my community assembly and the gates of Hades the grave will not be able to overpower my assembly this rock gates of Hades yeah lots of things going on he names his friend Rock and then says on this Rock I'm going to build my Assembly Building is like temple building language and rock is Jerusalem Mountain of God Lamb of God rock is also and Hebrew the word Eben which is rhymes with the word stun so that Daniel thought yep back in our conversations about Daniel so Jesus is going to build something
 upon this confession of his identity he's the Messiah and he's going to be building he's building something on the Rock here we go back to Sermon on the Mount of building the house on the rock. Jesus if you listen to me and my words but somehow this house on the rock that is the Assembly of his followers the gates of the Grave since the gate I know many translation says the gates of hell but it's the Greek word holidays which means the grave death death won't be able to overpower the building of people that I am creating founded upon this confession of who I am what are the gates of what's that mean the gates of Hades are at the Underworld the realm of the Dead the way in the way it's the entrance to
 is describing the power of death is a force to consume everything and everyone comes in through the gates and those Gates words that mean that the gates won't have no power over it yeah that's right I've got an assembly I've got a crib I'm out here doing my thing and you are Peter and you're describing me as the Messiah is true that's really who I am but where's we're going to see it's true in a way that Simon can say it but not really understand what he's saying where Jesus is going is basically that you're right and I'm going to build my new creation community on it and I'm going to die
 if you just going to say what no you're not you just at the gates of Hades will not cover power is it exactly right to keep reading so let's hold DSS in our minds let's go down and read verse 21 this Matthew 16:4 not time Jesus began to show his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders Chief priests the scribes to be killed
 and then to be raised up on the third day and then Peter the same guy who just said unify took him aside and began to rebuke him
 sang no way Lord this is not going to happen to you
 but he turned and said to Peter get behind me Satan you are a stumbling block you're actually an obstacle in my path now
 for you are not setting your mind on the things of God but the things of Adam so her other boss for Adam so apparently death is actually not the it is an enemy Jesus is for life and the gates of the Grave will not be able to overpower me and my community but the way to gain victory over death and its power is to allow it to kill him but then somehow be raised up through it but be raised Vindicated yeah that's right and we talked about this in a previous conversation with her about Jonah Jesus add I'm going to give you a sign the sign of Jonah and Jonah was three days in the belly of the chaos Monster that's right because of his own sins for Jonah was
 have his own scent but for Jesus's he says because of your sins like your sin will be to kill me and that will be the sign is that you're going to kill me and I'm going to let you and then I'm going to be raised from the dead and this is you know we talked about this in Isaiah to so when Isaiah asks of God I want your arm going to come meeting what are you going to come and yeah your power threat to slay the chaos dragon that time here it's in the form of Rome and we learned that the one who knows God's arm is this suffering servant who will have Victory through that he will allow agents of the snake to take his life and he will die because of the sins of his people and for their sins and evil for the ways they partner with this
 can become Agents Of The Snakes chaos and death in the land he will allow that death to overwhelm him because he knows that he is one he's the son of the father and together that they are the author of all life itself it has no power so with the first time the Jesus response to Peter and to say the gates of the Grave can't overpower at that could go to Waze Peter just said you're the Messiah and he said yeah that's right that's has no power I mean you could say you're going to ride over here. You're just going to your living forever and we're going to go smash the dragon interest loans this mess with heads will smash them heads and then the next scene is Jesus saying. I'm going to let them smash my head and Peter says what and then when Peter says no this is not going to happen The Voice the Jesus hears speaking through Peter is the Satan cuz that's what he calls him
 so this is for sure another moment where the snakes taking the opportune time as it were speaking through Peter you could come to rule over the cosmos and over crush the dragon by not giving up your life by Smashing your enemies and Jesus says the voice of the Satan tempting him dialed yeah it's a wild pretty abrasive thing to say
 I was like Jesus there beside be like we could probably say this in a more constructive way Jesus
 words calling your dear friend the Stayton cuz he wants you to not die just like in the normal relationship that's like a good thing to desire for your friend to imagine a scenario where someone close to me who has the best intentions but just doesn't get it is actually making a plan or pleading a case that is like going to take us into chaos death if you do that they just don't get it because they're the Paradigm of like how you fight against chaos is probably more normal and in that situation just straight-up common Satan
 if that's the intense yeah you can flip it you can try and empathetically enter into Peter's point of you to say I like Jesus you're really awesome I love you Miss following you I really believe in this kingdom of God dream bringing healing to so many people it was back up to that last part you said because it sounds like you're going to like let him kill ya and maybe we don't have to do that part yeah that's not how kingdoms are founded it's actually the opposite of a little scary that's the tension really we're all the way back to the send monster whispering and Kenzie are saying listen God I'm a free I'm interpreting the cane store here God must not care about you he's down for your brother he loves his offering not yours
 if you really want the good life for yourself I think you're going to need to get that blessing from your brother he probably needs to go and then you'll have a good life that you want and if we envision that the founding of our lives or our communities the old for the only way to experience the good life even if it might involve disadvantaging or at the expense of another it's that like that's the way of the Dragon the chaos way there's not enough
 if you want to make an omelette got to break some eggs and that's what Jesus is exposing Harris the way of the graves the gates of the grave and the way of the Satan that overcometh of a comment you can't ya typical like battle against it the intuition of let's just go Crescent snakeheads somehow isn't the right strategy yeah but if you surrender to it you let it you expose yourself to its danger in an act of surrender and generosity trusting that even if you lose that ultimately God's kind of me you're going to live
 this exchange between Peter and Jesus gives us just the window of the confidence but also the trust the Journey of trust that Jesus ventured out into and trusting that his father would vindicate him even if it meant giving up his life
 but why couldn't of Jesus just battled against Satan and just like that is a victory like if you just went and just chopped off the Serpent's head like David held it up through the body into the field like alright guys were done with have the cosmic peace now yeah that's a good question wrong with that strategy yeah I think there is something about maybe this is sweet need to take the biblical story up, too it's big Cosmic frame but remember we're outside of eating this is all happening outside and the place of seeing God entering into Union with God going to the endless banquet table
 is we're not going to find that outside of Eden that's been paradise and so Paradise is actually reality isn't the biblical story line whereas we live in a version of reality that's thoroughly compromised cuz it's subject to the powers of the Grave the gates of the grave and the cast Dragon so what Jesus needs to open up for us it's the way the way to Paradise were to let the power of paradise out here and apparently the way to fully enter into the kingdom can only be by letting this mode of existence that were in die
 I guess that's intuitive on one level on my body mode of existence yeah mode I'm in an I exist in this body and is very clearly dying very clearly aging and dying okay but Jesus didn't need to do that but I suppose didn't need to what a different mode do you need a new mode well I mean the plan is that he became human he entered into the realm of the snake in being born and why not a mortal human woman. In that mode take out the snake in the Mortal human mode to well that's what he said he did by letting it kill him and then
 being raised in Eternal mode of existence is there something about being raised like he needed to go through death to be raising the new mode not necessarily because he had to undergo that transformation much as he needed to show what else look for a human to undergo a transformation is ultimately I think what you were saying is we need a new mode yeah that's right and to do that we need to surrender our current understanding of what not just the good life but what life is literally what he goes on to say after he says to Peter you don't have your mind on God's interest but Adams Then he said to his disciples if anybody wants to come after me you must deny yourself take up your cross and follow me whoever wants to save your life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it
 the death is actually death is like the Gateway it's the Gateway in the Gateway into you get this cast dragon all they can take from you which is your life
 but in reality God has like God has a greater claim on your life cuz he called you into being he's the one who called you to exist so what the chaos Dragon take what it wants to take a quick and I'll take all that because you don't need that anyways yeah what in fact that's what probably holding you back is this thing's stuff that you think is actual life but that's not really like and is that maybe that's part of the key is and maybe we'll get into this in the letters but this mode of existence is so co-opted by the dragon that we can't beat the dragon in this mode like you have to let it get Stripped Away what it's going to look like a death it will be death death is the way you give the dragon What It Wants you're saying all to mately we're all still going to die ya even follow Jesus like you're going to the dragons going to have its last slash at you
 Jesus definitely means that it also Common Sense also common sense is telling you all of us that were dying and we're going to die so why not laying down now whatever form of eternal life and New Creation life that God's going to gift us with its means as policy as you're right we will look at the flesh-and-blood current mode of existence cannot inherit the kingdom of God I just try to bring this back to the the biggest theme of like me to we both are cuz there's this thing about I'm supposed to subdue the Earth as God's image so this is impulsive me of me like I want to go team Dragon I want to fight the dragon I want the dragons place on dragons head let me at it and the disciples you like what we're doing it like we're seeing Darius Dragon it's a thrilling but then when it gets to this moment it's like okay
 you really want to fight the dragon you want really want to know what the true battle plan is to win you're actually going to let the dragon take all they can from you and the only way that makes sense is to realize that I think what you were saying this mode of existence that I'm in is so tarnished by the way of the dragon that like any effort I'm going to have to like fight against it it's going to get just mixed up and turn around and I'm going offline on the dragon again you know that's right like I'm going to like that suddenly I'm fighting for it you're with it and it's so confusing and it's happening I mean this is my this is my experience right like the only that's right and that's really why the difficult to see and get your hands on deceptive portrait of the snake in the garden that's so on purpose cuz hard to
 right hard to get your hands on it and all the sudden you think that you're being independent doing what you want but you're totally doing the will of something that feels like what you don't want to do and how did I end up doing that right it's a simple as Peter just be like Jesus maybe you don't need to go. And it's like all said my keys please the dragon I'm going to go stop on that scorpion over there and then I like the next thing I know like I'm the Scorpions something on someone else like how has it happened and it seems like then the logic here is saying the ultimate Way Forward is to be stripped of all of that and you know how you do that you asked me to let the dragon at you and you let him have every last thing even your varied what you think is your very life and what ultimately will be your very life
 and you will be left with what you actually need yeah we'll have enough left so two things 1 the only reason why you would let the dragon have you and not try and resist and fight or fight other people just because in Jesus the way Jesus is framing it cuz he sang I'm going ahead of you I'm going to go overcome the snake by letting it kill me but it actually can't kill me cuz I I as he says in John like the son I have a life in myself just as the father has life within himself so the snake can't really kill me but man if I open the way back into Eden on your behalf then I won't let the snake take your life either kill you or the current version of you that you call yourself but that's all he can take you might put you know I mean that's death but you can also find yourself
 thrown in a dungeon right you find yourself Alliance during the Lions you can find yourself with like losing friends and family losing your job your home these are the things that we are trying to protect yep without the dragon can come and take yes that's right and if you loosen your attachment to those things and see them as a gift of God's generosity that comes and goes but ultimately this is backward to Jobe the conversations about job if I come to realize that the ultimate good that I could ever gain his intimate Union with the source of all life and being
 is that one Wills that I should live and wants me to enter in the union with him
 the last star is the ultimate like what more would I ever want and let it go what else is death but like letting go of all of the things that I think will give me the good life only to realize that they're dying and fading and breaking and letting me down to you know maybe another way into this is to think about your battle against the chaos Dragon usually start to become a battle trying to protect things to protect your own life on your own terms so you think you're battling the chaos Dragon you're really just battling to protect what you have and in doing so you actually can easily become the Dragon for someone else really well said that's right we become each other's cast dragons as we try to protect the good life for me and my crew yeah people I care about the way I think I need the good life I have this vision for it
 it doesn't mean suffering I mean absolutely not and it means like Security on my terms and especially once you've had it then it just like you fight to keep it and you think I'm fighting against chaos because I feel like hats was coming to take that from me and I guess it cast us yeah that's right but how are you going to fight against that chaos without becoming the chaos brothers that's right and then they'll be a bunch of people that were somehow affected by my efforts to secure and protect what is mine and maybe they got hurt or maybe they just want to get some of the good life too and then the way that they respond to me I might see that as a threat and then I am right and then we start like knocking up against each other in our efforts to secure the good life and I guess the dragon just laugh
 cuz we're just introducing each other to have the dragon the last because he knows that when we go to fight it we just we're going to get confused and we're going to actually help it feed the dragon which is this consuming us consuming order consuming life so how do you fight the dragon yeah what if I was able to look at the little round the order that I build buy my own wisdom praise God for it see it as a gift but also not become so attached to it that I'm willing to do something that I can discern will actually damage myself for another person cuz ultimately I know that this is not what I'm hoping for this is just a sign and a gift these people this job this home this income stream whatever it is I'm trying to protect in ways that might hurt me or the people what if I loosen my attachments to it because ultimately I have to
 wait about all of it cuz I'm outside eating and my body is returning to the grave but my Essential self and this is yeah this is crucial my Essential self God has willed that you and I exist I don't know why we don't hate you and I don't have to exist since like there was a long time and which you and I did not exist like most of History the God has willed it so that I come into being out of the nothingness and if I trust that he will will that I continue to exist even though the current mode of my existing is going to return to the dust than that really changes your perspective for like a freeze you and I guess that's a vision of New Creation
 that's why there's no snake in the new creation that it can't have power and you power there cuz death is no longer of a motivator and the same creative power that God used order creation and a way to think about that is sling dragon in a way that same power can then come after the new drag which is a much more beastly confusing Dragon because it's it's also Us in League with like spiritual evil the ruler to the sky and God has the power to destroy that Dragon too and that's the hope for Jesus did
in Jesus trial scene in Matthew chapter 26 we looked at the number of times over the years but if there's at least a reading this context of our conversation the chief priests is the principalities and Powers the human principalities and powers that he's standing before though when he was arrested in Gethsemane and Luke's version he says to the guards coming to get them Jewish guards this our belongs to you and the powers of Darkness
 so in this trial Jesus season self on trial before the human on the Heavenly powers of the Dragon
 they bring false Witnesses noticed after use deception to get him and the high priest says to him I make you swear on us before the Living God that you tell us whether you are the Messiah the anointed one the Son of God and Jesus said to him you just said it but I got one more thing to say to you from this moment onward you will see the son of Adam sitting at the right hand of power coming on the Clouds Of Heaven Steve is quoting from Daniel 7 he's a Vulcan the whole scene so if Jesus is the Divine son of Adam ascending up into the heavens to the right hand of God of the right hand of God to share and Rule but if I pull up the scene what are the other players not seeing and what's happening to them there's only three players in that scene at the end of seven
 the beasts the four beasts is the son of man and Daniel's watching it whatever is it in Ancient of Days on the front page of the Beast trampoline trampoline but then Concord and thrown into the fire and then son of man who's on the land of getting trampled and gets exalted up
 so if Jesus is the son of Adam and if his father is the one sitting on the throne that he's going to us end up to that only leaves one other slot for Kaya Fest and the chief priests and Sanhedrin the leaders of the people so In This Moment he's saying the only solution you guys can think of for how to deal with me is because me and he's like that's like snake strategy 101 very creative very creative ever since has been the move just the movie The Snake yeah you want to know how to secure the good life here outside of eating well
 but then what he says is the moment from this moment on you will see the son of Adam sitting on the right hand they're about to give him a crown and a cape a robe and scepter and that mock enthronement is in reality you're actually handing me at the keys to the cosmos that's what he saying I don't need the version of ruling the cosmos that you guys think is worth killing somebody for we talked about Daniel 7 Daniel is looking at the Beast their gnarly he's looking at the Ancient of Days in the fire and then I'll send you looks over and the son of man is riding the class and the beasts are slain and we didn't see was how he slay the Beast yeah that's right and now we get here Jesus on trial he saying you're about to see me right up in the clouds you got to see that moment son of man riding up in the clouds and if we reveal can Daniel 7 the Beast
 explain then yeah but we're going to watch is yabbies slay him slay him yeah and I guess they're that's the radicals like Rebirth of our imaginations that Jesus is like it's inviting us to that when you see Tower exercise through violence in our world it feels like that's the most powerful thing that's the power of the Dragon to get us to be afraid so afraid of death that we will fall in line under the powers that have the power over life and Jesus says that you're actually not realizing your true Royal identity as a son or daughter of God and let that version of Life Go and Let it go the way of the Dragon Witch is back into the dark chaotic ocean from which it came the moment you kill me
 you're spilling your decision to live and die by the power of the Dragon you're also put the seed of life in the belly of the Dragon oh that's right but in this instance you are trying to kill somebody you can't kill me. It's almost like when high priest says tell us whether you are the Messiah what Jesus is saying is like you just have no idea what kind of conversation we're having right now yeah you want me to confess my identity but you really haven't come to terms with my identity really who I really am I like beat her in that way you think you know who I am by saying I'm inside but it really you don't understand how this works you know I'm just thinking about again this is the theme of the Dragon Yeah Austin were talking about with talking about spiritual evil here but using I love you you starting to face the power of the Dragon what's the power of the Dragon
 the dragon is chaos and the ultimate power of chaos that we dread in death death and when the store the battle begins that's all put in place an order in the dragon exist and it represents chaos and death but it's out there and its own realm and you don't have to worry about you have access to life and so the power of the Dragon is muzzled and we are told to like subdue it and then both the sky rulers and the human rulers the side actually let's use that power let's use that power because we need to rule on our own terms and we don't have the power of God we need some sort of power the power of death that's going to work pretty well that motivates people sure does and it gets things done by brother he's getting God's favor and not me I'm not fix this
 yeah it's right that group of people they are threatening our prosperity
 or in a more subtle ways of just like how you know my my friend isn't doing the things I wish you would do in my life like maybe I can like manipulate this friendship through scarcity and like you know in some way that way it's kind of threatening relational chaos is it where I am at my nigggas by cutting friend off so I just won't talk to them silenced that's based I don't know ways that we use the power of the power of the dragon or the fear of death the fear of isolation the fear of being alone fear of not having enough yes we can activate that threaten it many different ways to use as a motivator 2
 create what we feel like is order in our eyes yeah but in reality we are becoming agents of the Dragon so we make those choices really powerful inside
 I always thought of the Satan as being the ultimate power but it feels like what the theme is communicating is the ultimate power of evil is just the dress it's the dragon and when you use the dragon you're using the power and its field right Sinister but the power in and of itself can just be the creature playing out in the ocean that we can learn to subdue and yeah you don't have to use it you can rule it you can rule it what he says to the cane yeah you don't have to let it be the thing that ruined see you or another person if you look at Satan Through The Eyes Of Jesus you don't see the Monster you see a creature with the costume on and your kind of like that's a little silly cuz you're not the dragon I know the Dragon
 but I put them out there I made the boundaries I know like that does not why you putting on that costume you think that's scary and we're like yeah it's pretty scary huh yeah cuz we're like it can take my life and she was like yeah but that's all I can take it can't take you because it's but there's a bit more life yeah you are more than just the flat bag of bones
 apparently following Jesus and trusting his victory over death and his Vindication on to Resurrection Life and claiming that future and identity as my own this is absolutely crucial to gaining any victory over the dragon in my life as long as I fear it I'll just keep perpetuating its way at the end of Matthew when Jesus makes his Great Commission he says all authority in Heaven and Earth has been given to me that's his Claim by powers of the Dragon is no more when it comes to me that has no Authority has no authority over me I have authority over it and then the next thing is so I got an idea let's build a family of people who were learning to live by my teachings doing what I commanded you and Go Make Disciples baptizing them but living by my commands is to go read The Sermon on the Mount it's just like a lesson and how to
 get right relationship to your possessions of your relationships to your own moral choices and three ladies beginning to wean yourself off of the ways of the Dragon the one way to think about The Sermon on the Mount yeah it's very difficult but that's apparently like actually living that way becomes a live option if your fear of death is no longer the biggest motivator in your life so the apostles will reflect on this as a right to the first century church and they use at the Muny claim which yeah the snake imagery or Dragon imagery comes up a few times so we can look at some of that but especially Paul the Apostle thinks about the great victory over the dragon he's taking the costume off and he just call it what it is he just called it the power of death the Ultimate Enemy you know he holds the costume up thank you
 this is what you've been afraid of yes yeah that's right so that's what we'll look at the picture of the Dragon in Paul's letters whatever podcast you in the back of another employee reduction here on our show going to do self huge role in me finding Bible project I was in a season of really questioning what even is the Bible but like so many other resources that I was Finding we're kind of either deconstructionist or not really addressing the real questions that I had and so listening in to Tim and John conversations felt like questions are actually being addressed it's like opening a five-hole me where I'd never seen before I say I think through Tim being interviewed on a different podcast and I was like I need to hear more of this
