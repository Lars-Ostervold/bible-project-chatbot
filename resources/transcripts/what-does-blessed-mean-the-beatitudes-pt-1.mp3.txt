welcome to Bible project podcast in today's episode We Begin The Sermon on the Mount looking at the very first word of the sermon the word blast and with me is co-host Michelle Jones Times show how are you doing good how are you I'm good to Michelle would you say you are blessed with what do you mean by that I mean it's it's not baggage but I feel like it's one of those words it's lost its waiting list if I got to stop using that word really yeah because I just don't really know what it means so I've just shine away from it would feel awkward because it's such a Biblical work pretty much be Biblical word other than amen we are going to notice with our translation of sore on the mouth is we messed with this word we don't begin the translation with blessed are those who we translate it the good life is for those who why did you mess with such a common translation through actually that's what today's episode is all about
 what did Jesus mean when he said blessed I'm going to send you away to talk to Tim about that okay thanks for joining us there we go
here we go. We're getting into it because of the Blessed blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled blessed are the merciful for they will be shown Mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you kept the nine
 I was going to call him tonight and blessings but my goals in the next 30 minutes is too kindly convince you that the word blessing does not at all communicate well let's talk about Jesus was trying to say cuz I don't even think I fully know what blessing mean I got we're doing a video series on the real priest and we got this whole setup a Adam & Eve in Eden are like priests in the cosmic Temple and there's a bun dance they walk with God there's enough for everyone they are meant to rule that is organized their lives in such a way that there's flourishing and then you have a line we say all of this is. This is the blessing and that's a Hebrew word blessing Imagining the verb is Barrick Barrick the noun is better, isn't that the word at play here no
 that's why I just said over the next 30 minutes my goal is to persuade you that the word blessed or blast is totally unhelpful here are the key questions that I have come to appreciate the most in unpacking what Jesus is doing in these nine first of all what's the Greek word in Matthew's gospel and what is the Hebrew or Aramaic word know cuz he spoke Aramaic that Jesus said that the translator here in the Greek let's remember this is going to be really important multiple times The Sermon on the Mount the only form we have it in is in Greek and Matthew's gospel yes however it's a summary of what Jesus went around saying in Aramaic cuz he spoke Aramaic spoken Aramaic and why did he speak Aramaic cuz that's the language of today up in Galloway
 and down in Jerusalem but he would have also been fluid in Hebrew but it's a cousin language to its cousins medical language does Hebrew which was spoken as much as it was the language of their sacred Traditions right they would read the Bible in the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew and there were Aramaic translation in Greek translation Greek translations are Mac so anybody who grew up in a bilingual contacts gets this some real life use this other party life use that and if the specialist are very close languages yeah it's just a part of life so we're going to be doing is looking at often at the Aramaic or Hebrew words underlying the Greek words of a gospel to understand what is this word mean in the Greek word that represents what Jesus says here it's a Greek word makarios makarios very difficult to know how to translate stuff
 first word is repeated nine times in his opening movement so here are possible English renderings to get us around the idea how fortunate
 oh how happy
 oh how flourishing
 oh how blessed each one of those captures something of what Jesus is trying to get across was really fortunate for us though how fortunate are we are blessed early because we know exactly where this word comes from and what it represents so makarios is standard Greek word used in the Greek Septuagint to Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures and it consistently translate Hebrew word used throughout the songs and the wisdom writings of the Hebrew Bible and it's not the word blessing it's the Hebrew word
 so we can look at two examples of it that occur in someone and Psalm 24 OK Google translations are going to translate a blast which reveals our problem this is a problem not just in New Testament create this is a problem in Old Testament Hebrew how to render this word in English so someone begins ashrei is the one who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of Sinners or sit in the seat of mockers rather this one's Delight is in the Torah of Yahweh and on the Torah and meditate day and night oh how Australia is such a person
 the person is like a tree yes yes planted by streams of water Perpetual fruit every season no withering leaves everything this person does prosper without knowing let's just pretend we don't know about Australian sky but the Australia is someone who is not mixing it up with people who are trying to create evil impression in the world but instead is someone who is the lighting in God's instruction the lights in the will of God revealed in scriptures
 but they're not just a book a bookworm it is a tree that doesn't adhere to the seasons to what you would think it's a tree that's just constantly bearing fruit in the spring in Springfield that makes sense here comes the summer the bumper crop the winter comes should just treat me like normal and not just keeps paying for it so that someone is a quick look at home to some to paint a picture of all the nations of the Earth in their kings who are violent arrogant corrupt and at war with each other and against God and God's response is known to is bye bye man appointed King who's going to bring Justice to the land forever and ever amen to King from the line of David
 and the last line of Saint to is ashrei all those who take refuge in this King
 that's a little different than the flourishing tree person is someone different in there's a whole world out there of violence and arrogant and chaos but got the an appointed King I think I'm almost like how protected to be ashrei by taking refuge in him means related to Security Disability safety not fruitfulness opposites I'm just saying Australia can describe both fruitfulness in abundance which is typically a sign connected with blessing but then here at the protection safety and stability and the person who safe and stable how Australia's that person that's what kinds of people are Australia and who and when do you use this word Australia a 45 times in the Bible is 45 people called ashrei that's a very
 manageable amount of times 26 times in the Psalms 8 times in the Book of Proverbs so you could say this word is them literature work it's the word that comes from Israel's with diamond song traditions and it's etymology comes from a word meaning Prosperity Good Fortune happiness flourishing yes come to Solomon yes with their big entourage she can spend some time in his courts and after she's hung out there long enough she says are your people ashrei are your officials who stand in your courts and get to hear your wisdom of Solomon it was flourishing time yes what's the common is whatever something I forget the line as common as Stone just let me just find a word Queen comes into the courts of a king surrounded all these Court
 where is everyone's happy there's enough food safety and she says off how Usher a are all these people but they get to be a part of your kingdom
 okay
 maybe I can't think of the word maybe we need to bring it in to him cuz I just have never in that context you dumb this down and be like hey you remember when we were in Prineville and we went to that skate park across the street from the Parker kids are playing in and we were really impressed with the skate park yeah where did this thing come from it's perfectly designed look at they thought of everything they like this is wonderful I sure those kids over there and get to skate in the skatepark everyday that's an appropriate use of Ashura okay that's right culture would call that being hooked up in Prineville got the hookup at work in each of these examples it's one person who's looking at the
 set up of another person the circumstances of another person and saying that looks nice that's the good life this is the Hebrew word you say when you want to hold up a certain set of circumstances as somebody whose experience things but goodbye everyone has their own version of the good life and if you made your Creed yeah it would be a trace of the wine and then fill in the blank and the blank what would be the Portland ashrei Australia is the one who has a cup of mild coffee in the morning mild bright bright is third-wave coffee for word is the one who can work at three-quarter time job and then gig on the weekends and evenings as the one who can eat amazing cuisine
 in your neighborhood is the one who can drive 30 minutes to Epic nature hikes Mountain by sure as the one who's 1 hour from surfing in 1 hour from snowboarding
there are a lot of different views about what it looks like to have the good life in fact right around the time of Jesus there were many wisdom teachers talking about what's a good life look like to read some of those wisdom teeth I have with me Bible project scholar been hurting I been thanks for being here you know is I'm thinking about these Biblical word stuff and really helpful to see how other folks were using the same word and text from the same time frame to read for us a passage of a Jewish bride written around the second century BC the wisdom of Ben Sira sometimes it's titled Ciroc or sometimes ecclesiasticus great let's read the passage in chapter 25 is going to repeat this word astray over and over and it's really interesting listen listen here to what he says now he opens it up and it says there are nine whom I would call
 Trey 10 my tongue proclaims ashrei is the one who rejoices in his children Australia is the one who lives to see the downfall of his enemies as the man who lives with a reasonable wife see it in Lilo view of female intelligence through all of his writing is very clear he is the one who does not sin with his tongue
 afraid is the one who never has to serve an inferior
 wow hang on good life is for somebody who that is long as there's somebody who's always below you and Status yes right away is the one who finds a friend of Ray is the one who speaks and people listened attentively
 greatest is the one who finds wisdom and none is superior and then the one who fears Yahoo
 it sounds different than little Proverbs but there's some flavors and it's real different than the Sermon on the Mount it sounds very first bound in terms of like you know this guy's Comfort yes but notice how different perspectives are still using ashrae to describe their vision of what it means to have the good life okay here's another one will go to the Dead Sea Scrolls here now the Dead Sea Scrolls come from a community called The Essence living down by the Dead Sea Australia's the one with a pure heart who does not slander with his tongue ashrei are those who adhere to the laws of Torah and do not adhere to the distorted pass
 Australia are those who rejoice in wisdom who do not have outbursts foolishness which way are those who search for wisdom with pure hands with pure intention and action Integrity yes shreyas the one who attains wisdom and walks in the instruction or Torah of the most high are using ashtray to give a perspective on what they believe human flourishing is really looking like doing these sources we just read we see Ben Sira and we see the qumran community at taking this Eden vision of goodness in the Hebrew Bible and you know they're they're sort of morphine it into their context there this this idea of the blessed life and it's like well what would we in our world called The Blessed Life point being ashrae is about identifying the way of life
 is that leads to blessing or that is in the blessing that blessing that Jesus reshapes and redefines in The Sermon on the Mount that sucks. That's like it's a framing word and Jews are we friends that from I want to say anything anybody's ever seen before Jesus but it's there's also flavors from everywhere else
okay I'm in the studio with Dan and apparently he's got an idea and I've been putting together and I was just thinking about how Tim and John were just saying but it was a good life version be for everybody but I'll try version I think we should talk of people Randall call Leah she's at work I have no idea if she's going to pick up Hannah didn't tell her about this this morning but it just kidding me okay
 hello hey what's up
 babe what do you think your definition of a good life is
 built with people that I love meeting new people traveling the world
 helping people it's all people based on what's underneath you
 yeah of course I'm patient speaking right now but I wouldn't have you busted a million times over and over and over a good life for you
 are you taking me to Italy just give me a dog
 is that how you define the good life so what's going on
 what I might put it in the podcast but I haven't started yet maybe I should have started with that
 just cut out the part about Italy and the dog
 okay bye I love you I love you
 hello Rick McKinley okay so let's just say you are a guy who would describe yourself as having the good life what does that look like say you in your relationship that you like what you do for a living a long time ago I remember you saying if you could have any job in the world you would drive a bread truck fresh bread you love the smell of it go to bed without any anxiety cuz like the worst thing that can happen is bread gives burn clothing shelter Maslow's pyramid of hierarchy of needs
 okay Michelle we've been talking about the word ashrae the word that you use when you want to give your opinion about who's in a blessed state right now Jesus use the word makarios which is the Greek for a stray and so you can translate with Jesus says As how fortunate are those who know how good is life for you yeah let's say I wanted to pray for you and ask God to give blessing in your life please and thank you. Your welcome I wouldn't use the word astray I would say our father in Heaven call rooke Michelle broke me a route. Tim's going to explain to us what the word Baruch means and we'll see that while the word Baruch is not in The Sermon on the Mount the idea is in there but in a sneaky way okay let's go back to Tim as you turn your attention to the Hebrew word Baruch was pause on us right so
 is the word that you use when you want to highlight that God is the one who has brought about abundance and Safety and Security in someone's life so people can pronounce blessing on each other what I would say if I were talking about you I would say the truth are you bye. You are in a state of blessedness by God and that's what many people think is underneath what Jesus is saying here but it's different here refers to the concrete manifestations of abundance Safety and Security that come as a gift from God so God is the source of all blessing that's what Genesis one is about he blessed the creation and he bless the humans God bless the creatures thing be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth God blesses the humans be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth and have exercised responsibility over it and then he gives them the super sweet
 way better than skateboard park from God in the Hebrew Bible humans don't have the power to create a state of blessedness in each other's lives but not how you think of it humans can pronounce blessing on each other but when they do that what they're doing is praying for God's got to do it the last day of oryx claiming that God has done it that's right it's a blessing comes from God and when you see somebody in a state of abundance security you would call them Baruch blessed you are blessed by God but that's not a stray stray is what happens when two people are walking by somebody who is in a blessed date and one person wants to teaches other friend like what the good life is and he'll point at the Blessed ones and say and that person's ashrei
 I want to be like that person oh how I spray is that person that they are in the state of
 okay essentially Australia is in the eye of the beholder who is Jonathan Pennington play putting it away is a description of a state of happiness or privilege Fortune that's on someone that's being observed by another by a bystander who isn't the one providing or bringing about the blessing in the Hebrew Bible one never praised become a stray you would never ask to become a shred you ask to become blessed right Baruch means God has given me the gift of favor in abundance and I'm going to stay a blessedness but when I want to convince you that a certain state of blessedness is actually the good life I use the word ashrei it's a wisdom word that's aimed at persuading The Listener to see that a certain way of life is the Blessed ideal state
 when you call someone a shred you're not pronouncing God's blessing on them you're not saying a magic word that makes them enter a state of fruitfulness but it do you do that when you say Baruch yes what are least you're praying bless them if I say may you be blessed by God I'm praying that God will give you safety security in a bun but if I say ashrei are you I was raised that way of life that leads to that flourishing there's a fortunate ones what's important about the word blessed in The Sermon on the Mount is it makes it sound of the reader like Jesus is pronouncing God's blessing that's what Jesus as he gives these Beatitudes he is not praying for the community these things he's identifying that from my vantage point this situation is a marker from someone who is Farooq the logic of each of these things is
 Jesus is going to save us are these people because in reality they are the ones receiving yeah the blessing so two people could be walking down the street look at someone and go over there and they are you back you up wait what's interesting here is Jesus is pointing at things that you wouldn't cost right that's right no one will go up there maybe I can look at that guy he's like laying on the side of the road without any money yesterday you'd be like rationally not saying look at that guy correct why is blasting is the blessing to take the first one example ashrei are those who are impoverished in spirit which is we're going to see means without any power social influence know they're not fortunate I want to be sure of the good life that's not that's not the marker of the life of gods above why does Jesus say
 said they are powerlessness is a desirable state of life because they are being given the divine blessing of the kingdom of the Skies they are the ones that I received the state of blessed us there's something about a state of powerlessness it is it is it a vehicle of God's kingdom blessing standing in front of him Yeah Usher a are those who grieve why is Jesus holding up that the good life because they will receive the comfort that God will bring when he brings about the creation that's the blessing in the first line and it's a Twist super twist and then the blessing is in the second one are The Afflicted
 because they will inherit the land what is the blessing except for Abraham and Jesus on the mountain ragtag group of people you saying king of Gods happening through me this is happening and it's happening through you too even though you can't see it that's why the fact when you look at your situation it feels like the opposite of God's kingdom coming and bringing Baruch so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to reframe your situation because it's happening within you that's right yep it's Jesus's commentary on what is happening on the ground in the actual moment he says the words yeah which is a with a bunch of poor impoverished and sick powerless people but they are the ones that he has chosen to receive first his message for Israel
 why did Jesus choose because there's they actually are the privileged ones there is a fortunate Sons why because there's a surprise coming. Got a surprise in store it's starting right now and it's will be fulfilled when have an interest be night the game's going to turn upside down. The function of these nine sayings their reversals their apocalyptic revealing of the upside down or truly right side up nature of God's kingdom and what it means to be a part of it you have to believe in the great reversal for this to make it happen I believe Jesus saying the kingdom of God has come near the logic of these nine sayings depends on Jesus has claimed he is bringing the kingdom of God on this Earth as it is in heaven and the kingdom of God brings total reversal of our value systems and our estimations
 who are the fortunate ones and that's the work that these nine things are doing
you know this whole thing about shrey versus Baruch it really wasn't Landing for me until the very end there or Tim pointed out the two lines in each Proclamation surprise perspective on the good life is in the first line ashrae are those who mourn and then the blessing is in the second line for they will be comforted what parts of my life I need to re-examine yes like when I feel overwhelmed or sad or full of stress or I feel like I'm missing out on my dream it doesn't feel at all like the good life but then Jesus stepped in and asked us to flip that perspective and maybe when I feel beat up that's the exact place where he wants to start with me to bring the kingdom that's good word and that's it for today's episode we got through one whole word another another
 go through all nine but three at a time so next week we'll go over the first three how good is life for the poor in spirit how good is life for those who mourn and how good is life for the meek will look at all three and new ways including what does Jesus mean by being Meek blessed are the meek a whole bunch of reasons to that way of phrasing in English this going to lead our minds down a totally wrong path Bible project is a nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus and everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you thanks so much for being a part of this with us hi this is Cooper here to read the credits Dan gumel is the creative producer for today's show production of today's episode is by producer Lyndsay Ponder managing producer Cooper pelts producer Colin Wilson Stephanie Pam is our consultant an editor Tyler Bailey is our audio engineer and editor and he also provided the sound design
