in the Bible the dragon is a symbol of chaos and disorder it's a way of thinking of an impersonal force that actually feels very personal a Relentless power that almost feels like a creature today we look at how the Apostle Paul talks about death and this same kind of way and we begin with Paul's letter to the Romans big Shadow inspectors of evil in Badness in Romans are the twin towers of what galston and death and sin and death personified they backed up on us the capture and trap us they deceive us so often it's our fear of death that drives us to become dragons ourselves but Jesus offers us another way those who are in the Messiah even though they made their truest selves and p.m. are held in life and love of God in the hope of Resurrection the Apostle Paul tells us that Jesus will destroy
 every enemy of God and The Last Enemy to be destroyed is death and that enemy already met its match when Jesus rose from the dead and so what if we really believe that death will be defeated what if we didn't live by the fear of the dragon and that's why the Last Enemy really is the thing that has the ability to put in our flesh bag and drag him back down to the dirt today to Mackey and I continued on and the theme of the Dragon in Romans and 1st Corinthians and John Collins new listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hey Tim a John hi we're doing it really doing it talk about dragons in the Bible that is what we're doing out of any set of conversations I worry that I described it to someone that I think you're going to listen to me for 15 hours be confused as a good experience I don't know well not being you therefore I can observe you from outside of you I experienced it as persistent question asking to get clarity and then us constantly restating what we were learning and coming to Greater clarity about which has been my experience of every seam conversation that we had all right well this one it feels more so and I think this is why it is so obvious kind of re-upload everything great we're talking about a Mythic cultural symbol yes to see Dragon to see Drive
 it's already were in this realm of the Bible where it's like okay is this thing real what is it representing this engine symbols used all the other cultures why is the Bible using it so there's this whole category of like using the Mythic in the Bible that you also are now talking about Spiritual Beings have the power of Spiritual Beings who are very real in the minds of the biblical authors yes and many people could put those in the category of the Mythic right of like the same category as just using symbols that are very real but it's really just symbolic of evil and darkness they are actually creatures just like the sea dragons on a creature sure things are the creature it seems like the Bible actually at least what I'm understanding is Extreme those separately
 but at the same time talking about them combined that's right yeah where the spirits of evil can become the dragon in the threat and I was where our confusion kept pressing into it lead to Clarity eventually I think so that there's a core symbol of the Dragon which overlapping and it's symbolic meaning with the chaos Waters means disorder and nothingness out of which the ordered World. Call the password and that principle the possibility of being a creature who can sink back into the nothingness through death that's a relived reality of All Humans of every as long as he has been around and that reality and that danger is referred to by the symbol of the chaos Waters and with a dragon but that symbol then gets applied to two sets of creatures
 biblical story about the biblical story both sets of rulers and up using death as a weapon against each other and when they do that they take on the costume of Minnesota glad we achieve that Clarity and that metaphor of the Dragon is a costume that a creature can put on that's really helpful for me and then become itself a chaos creature yeah which is right not the dragon but is the dragons like letting loose the power of the Dragon yeah yeah and yourself which then in some way is becoming the dragon to the degree that have been with cloth is can shut up to say hey Pharaoh your the sea monster that's right then there's just the issue of the problem of evil why did God put the dragon in the chaotic ocean is why didn't God start with a world that was perfect so I mean God separates
 chaotic ocean in orders at and that's great but then he puts the sea monster in its electric what's what are we supposed to learn by that liked is that God saying I'm going to put danger or is it and putting danger in or I'm allowing the reality of death to still be something we have to push back against and then how does that relate to God just kind of telling Joe but look the sea monsters real and like you're going to have to deal with it and I alone am the one capable of saying that that's an important part of The Judds beaches yeah so anyways yeah and so is that part of the conversation then is really getting to the core vision of reality that these symbols are expressing
 and it's really a pretty sophisticated worked out philosophical view of existence in God and the nature of reality and
 to the hills off of terms how would you say it the biblical authors take for granted that God is reality and uncaused cause and source of all being in reality God is not a being God is the source of all be a God doesn't exist God refers to existence big deal that's why is Genesis 1:1 starts the way that it does it doesn't begin with the chaos Waters because they even just saying that doesn't say in the beginning the cat's water in the beginning God said to the water because I'm just that way of phrasing it opens you up to the possibility of world is there something that precedes God or transcends got the chaos Waters so the biblical at their start in the beginning Elohim Gracie Barra Elohim in the beginning God created and that's their way of starting off with that Clinton so for God to share or donate it
 dense to something that doesn't sustain its not the source of its own existence that is a creature or a creation means that that thing that is other then. Depends on God for its existence cuz it was called out of nothingness and then the plot line of the biblical story is God wants to share existence in such a way that the freedom that God has to enjoy the community of his own being a trinitarian Christian and I am what that means is that creature is God will grant it an analogous kind of freedom
 to go on a journey out of nothingness back into Union with God's own life and love and freedom which means that creature always lives under the possibility that it could choose to go its own way and embrace its own nonexistence and that possibility of sinking back into nonexistence is what symbolized by the dragon karbar your PNC Legend called it. Nick take the nothingness and I was his way of referring both to spiritual powers of evil not that they don't exist but they are a force Dragon creation back into the nothingness so anyway I've kind of been also trying to read and read more in the history of Christian philosophy to understand these things cuz I I've become convinced that the biblical authors are doing really heavy duty philosophical work primarily through narrative poetry and symbolism and where is in the western tradition
 good morning abstract of discourse but they're doing the work and I think that's super interesting in but that's maybe as a whole lot of podcast well I thought we might see them doing some of that work here where in the New Testament letters and so is more discourse happening and we're going to look at how the early Apostles talked about the drag stip the threat so first we're just going to take a quick Famous Last Words quick look at Romans and then maybe 1 Corinthians what we're looking for is where Paul deliberately or explicitly draws on the dragon imagery with snake imagery from the Hebrew Bible and then works it into the picture he's painting in his letters
so I won't try and summarize Paul's letter to the Romans I tried into videos part one and two and I feel really great about those summaries so what is interesting is that in Romans call doesn't refer to the devil and he only refers to the Satan in one place in the letter to the Romans the big like shadowy specters of evil and Badness in Romans are the twin towers of what all sin and death and sin and death take on a role in Paul's letter their personified they backed up on us they capture and trap us they deceive us and where he gets in the crescendo with an arc of Romans 5 through 8 is that these powers of sin and death have been conquered through the Messiah life death and resurrection and for those who are in the Messiah so that was true of them is what
 you have him they are no longer under the power of sin and death even though they may die physically their truest selves and being are held in life and love of God in the hope of Resurrection
 so that's just an interesting thing to know at the end there's a crescendo like a high point in chapter 8 review brings the letter to a climax of where is that at that point than the letter and this is kind of famous section in Romans chapter 8 the last lines in Romans eight verse 38 for I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present, nor things to come your powers nor height nor depth nor any other created thing is able to separate us from the love of God which is in Messiah Jesus our lord yes or no notice all these powers powers and creature powers creatures and times so present or future nothing that happens now or in the future so what happened through Jesus just create a line which now that it's been crossed and no going back or God has made his crucial move that has determined all reality
 neither death nor life life can't separate you from the love of God the interesting thing to say
 pictures of a whole Angels principalities nor powers of three words that he uses for Spiritual Beings and principalities and Powers disease are ambiguous terms and Paul Walker sometimes he'll use them to refer to the Imperial powers or the powers institutional Towers in Israel Temple power structures that killed Jesus but he refers to them the way of the Hebrew Bible does which is to see the mirror in the blurry line between human power structures and spiritual power structures so to use our category of we've got the dragon that represents death and Chaos so it's representing what we would call power up our or a force is personifying death as something that is out to get you in can get you yeah and so by us saying that that's the Dragon for a spiritual being
 Angel to decide to Ally with the drag want to drag creation into chaos then they are using the power of death yes and so the power of death kind of becomes there's a union of sorts of the power of death and what the spiritual being is doing and then then that turns us one more thing about the devil you know the Satan we're thinking about the spiritual being so allied with death that he can hear the teasing apart anymore and it's just useful in this point in the letter to the Romans to know that he hasn't named demons the devil or Satan
 up to this point in the letter would he talk about his sin and death has Cosmic Powers they've trapped us all in that have been what do you say disempowered but here he does list death and spiritual being separately they are separate categories in his mind and so does that fit what we're saying which is that sin and death we would say okay that's the way to talk about the dragon yeah yeah okay so watching this so Romans 9 through 11 and 12 to 16 kind of the next two movements of the letter and Romans 16 is where he signs off and he starts commending for example Phoebe to Mom certainly carry this letter and performed its reading and interpretation for the Roman house churches he says hello to all of these people we talked about these lists in the past
 near the end he has a first little greeting and then he attaches a look like a PS the PostScript after that but Romans 16 verse 20 is this little beautiful statement at what he says is actually I'm going to back up and go up to her 17th cuz there's 20 is the conclusion so he says no I heard you brothers and sisters keep your eye on those who cause I'm a switch that and Ivy divisions and who put obstacles in y'all's way that are contrary to the teaching that you've learned the people who want to split up the house churches through sectarian in a theological ideas keep away these people don't serve our Lord Messiah but rather their own bellies
 with smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people everyone has heard about y'all's obedience so I Rejoice because of you but I want you to be wise about what's good and innocent about what's evil so surprised right there you can just hear that you didn't vocabulary coming out there there's smooth talkers who there's people driven by their hunger and their hunger drives them towards deceptive words you're referring to that one very common typical image for the test test is food food test in the Garden of Eden through this archetypal and it's about desire to using food but it's talking about our desire for
 our going away in their desire for control on our own terms of our there's a whole bunch of people that have eaten from the Tree of knowing couldn't and they are going to trick you and it's going to be hard to know if they really represent Jesus Messiah the way the apostles represent him or if they're got a different program so then he says I want you to be wise about what's good and innocent about evil which is also the vocabulary wisdom about Good and Evil Kelly calls that up so what he said then in verse 20 actually makes perfect sense in light of all that what he says is the God of Peace will soon crush the Satan under your feet May the grace of our Lord Jesus be with you
 the first 20 extra doesn't stick out like a sore thumb from the line of thought we're in the garden in this kind of Mama's imagery and so to crush the snake kind of fits but look at very intentional we're doing the god well first of all the God of Peace it sounds funny to us to be like the peaceful God will crush his enemies most likely our translations there it's called the genitive raised at the park regrammer but when you say the something of something that of in Greek can have a lot of different meaning more than likely it doesn't mean the peaceful God means rather the God who brings peace how will he bring peace stuff like rushing this so the guy who brings peace will soon crush the Satan under y'all's feet plural yeah and that's some heavy-duty theology going on
 Bodwell Crush under y'all's feet we've been waiting for the seed of the woman who's going to crush the safe and in a way we're supposed to have seen the Jesus did that yeah I mean this whole thing earlier is like there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God revealed in the Risen Jesus who overcame sin and death in the devil so apparently even though you say no power of Jesus the Stayton can still influence these networks of ostriches in Rome and the Christians were part of these and you need to trust that the victory that Jesus had over the snake using death is a victory that will be true for you too and notice it's in Genesis 3 15 the promise was that it was the seed of the woman who will crush now it's God crushing but through
 Bealls ft you're all the seed of the woman and I think that y'alls is referring all the way back to his language back in chapter 12 and 13 about the community of Jesus followers is the body of the Messiah so that the messiah's victory over the snake he's the head of the body and there will be a what do you say not like Jesus needs to conquer the snake again cuz he's risen from the dead snake have no power over him but he has a lot of power over us cuz we are afraid of dying which is why we do about the terrible things to each other so there needs to be a crushing of the Satan under our feet or my feet or your feet or the god want to bring peaceful carry out so notice also that the Stayton opposer is in the place of the snake as we
 is Genesis 3 15 as a template if it's the seed of the woman crushing the snake under his foot here it's God crushing the Satan under y'all's feet for the body of Christ feet so he's very intentionally kind of swapped out the players in the three slots in an important way if you put this together with Romans 8 policies death at this Cosmic force and the opposite of God's will for his world which is life and goodness in order and deficits opposite and then pause my death is technically separate bowl from angels and principalities and powers and Spiritual Beings but Spiritual Beings can put on the costume of the dragon and then use the dragons power for its own ends
 and that's what's happening with the snake in Genesis 3 and I think that's what Paul caused the same yep yah are category of Satan a spiritual being who like I said this in so much use the snake so much as in Union with the snake so that the crush Satan is too crushed snake is to defeat death that they get bundled together but like you said and Romans 8 there pulled apart that what scene is just a spiritual being using damaging death as a weapon or power yeah that's why I was excited to show this to you because I think it is not just a helpful image for us I think it's actually a real cat to go away for how at least Paula thought about these things you know it also make sense of why say 10 or the Diablos can put on other costumes like Peter and his letter 1st Peter 5 calls the diabolus a roaring lion is prowling around
 is a dragon a snake or a lion in the Hebrew Bible's Way of understanding and linking together chaos creatures you know that those are just different costumes with all talking about a spiritual being using death as a weapon to deceive us and destroy us I like the costume metaphor is there a reality here though as well that would miss spiritual being has adorned this costume enough he has become actually like you know that Satan is now yeah Inseparable from Death like so you can't destroy death without destroying Satan yeah interesting it seems like that's definitely how John the Visionary about the apocalypse there's used all together
 so that the same way and place where death in the grave are destroyed is the place where the dragon and his Beast minions are destroyed in the Lake of Fire so I think ya weather Paul sees them is in separately fused it's actually really old question that many early church the election debate it too sick which means they didn't see the apostles fully getting closer to that question seems like it seems like there isn't full closure but there's yeah but certainly the way the symbolism works the fact that you can describe the Diablos devil the seat on a poser as a dragon in this is a good example where you just put the Satan in the slot of the snake of Genesis 3:16 but Paul's not alone and in doing so actually sounds really helpful in essay buy a new testament scholar Michael state is a long title called Paul at the ball
 please give Victor and the cosmic defeat personified evil in Romans 16:20 an important note that Michael Faith makes in the essay he knows that the imagery is all drawn from Genesis 3 15 the actual language of crushing it's the Greek verbs contribo actually comes from the Septuagint of Psalm 74 and Psalm 74 we talked about many hours ago or maybe episodes ago but it's the song where Babylon is coming destroyed the temple and it's in smouldering Ruins and what the poet ass is God you are a king from of old you crossed the heads of Leviathan and you smashed the heads of the Dragon not words smashing in the Greek Septuagint is the same bird that probably uses so he's for sure drawing cuz it's just us three of the words strike or
 yeah something else yeah it's different in the Septuagint so Paul's has Genesis 3 15 on the brain. He's using the language of a dragon slaying Psalms them and then he swapped out the players in how he refrains it that's a wonderful example of Paul how his mind worked scripturally in terms of scriptural hyperlinks but in order to do pastoral guidance and theology for the house churches that anyways it's so difficult inside so they let us turn our attention now to look really important passage impulse Theology and thought that's a whole 1 Corinthians chapter 15
so 1 Corinthians is a letter that kind of feels like a laundry list cuz he literally he's working through a series of topics in response to things that the Corinthian house churches that he founded many years ago they actually wrote him a letter and he's heard reports about problems in the church and so he just starts working through the topics and the last one he says for last is his treatment answering a bunch of questions and confusions he's heard about the church about the resurrection of the Dead in Jesus's resurrection from the dead so it's is a longest most detailed treatment about the topic of Resurrection in general and about Jesus's resurrection in its meaning so way way more than we can do here but just to note in opening what he says is Hey listen the resurrection is Central if you follow Jesus as the crucified and Risen Lord of the world then
 leaving that he rose from the dead and that the resurrection of the Dead is like the turning point of history and that it's your own future this is really crucial and if you're not if you don't want to embrace this hope that you really not embracing what Jesus like was all about your on some other team so that's how it begins well I guess I should also say he's responding to a whole bunch of people in the churches and coronets who sings that the idea of the re-creation Andrea animation of our bodies in a cosmic spiritual but yet still material or physical form is just a ridiculous idea I've never seen it happens doesn't predict that so it's really a counter-intuitive thing to believe but it's the core of the Christian message of the
 keto lemon Jesus arose from the debt so it begins this paragraph going to look at starting in verse 20 and he says but now the Messiah has been raised the firstfruits of those who are asleep so what he's noting here is that if you read the portrait of Hope from the Hebrew scriptures from Israel's Traditions they're coming the day of Yahweh is coming we made a video about that and he's going to set all things right hold accountable all wrongs that have been done the bring ultimate Justice and that is going to feel like bad news for a lot of people and power structures and Spiritual Beings however it can also be experienced this goodness depending on how you respond to Cosmic judge and so the day of Yahweh is also going to bring about a new creation
 and a new recreation life that's depicted as rising up from the dust which humans came out of the dust in Genesis 2 and so being asleep in the dust is a key image in the Hebrew Bible for Tess waking up from the dust is Takeya just like a new creation in the middle for a new creation is like a harvest uses its image of the first fruits which is the whole field is about to ripen maybe there's some plants that ripen like a day or two before all the others and it's a sign that like it look pole feels about to turn and so you take those first fruits and you come offer those few initialize you come off for those to God as a thank you gift it's Temple can you bring them into the presence of God and so he calls Jesus's resurrection as the firstfruits of the resurrection of the cosmos which is what it goes on to say he says or sense
 buy a human Came Death
 buy a human also comes the resurrection of the Dead
 which other yes please what do you mean through a human came that buy human came back to set of ideas that he didn't work out in Christine's but that he has worked out in his letters to other churches specifically in the letter to the Romans primarily because that it in Romans chapter 5 by that he means that humans embraced death by choice because they were deceived by sin that's how it works in Romans five and six yeah so I guess my bike Came Death what he doesn't mean is that the death was introduced into the cosmos what he means is that humans became subject to death that's a nuanced because you can read that and you can think okay there was no death until the humans right until they made their decision to rebell and then now God's perfect world has been disrupted
 what is a problem. I understand that so here were saying you know we've been talking about the dragon exist out there before the humans before the humans are on the scene the dragon represents death but he's contained is an ordered world that's good the dragons contain so here since by human Came Death not like created death or Beyond was the originator of death in some way but like at least that is that what it says in the human story so here he's just doing a base value reading of the Genesis narrative that humans are elevated out of the realm of dust and non-being and put into a garden with an opportunity to never die and they forfeited that opportunity the Exile from Eden into the realm of death that's what Paul is is referring to and he works it out in detail and runs 5 and then he works out of another iteration the Romans 7
 like what that one means yeah but what he doesn't mean is creation began perfect and there was no death or disorder and then once Genesis 3 happened only then does death into the possibility of death into the biblical story that's not what you saying what you saying is creation was good he takes for granted the 7-Day narrative the Creations good but not perfect and the dragons out there and says the chaos over that says the darkness but humans were elevated to this opportunity to transcend and partner with God in the subduing of all this order and death but they blew it and so death came by means of the human thank you for that clarification that's good and it took me a long time to figure out the tall was working but it is understanding cuz the way he's praised as it could lead you in a couple directions depending on how you think the Eaton Storyworks 21 by human Came Death
 by human also comes the resurrection of the Dead Jesus he restated the same idea but in different language for different end for as in Adam all die so also in the Messiah all will be made alive so there was a cosmic significance for all Adam noticee swap the word atom in forgiving which they reward for him and so interesting because in Hebrew the word human is Adam butt in Greek yes two words two words Securities transliterating the word human in the Greek letters Hauge Adam into Adam
 for as in Adam human all die so in Messiah all will be made alive Cosmic disruption and Cosmic Recreation but then he clarifies but each in his own order cuz Jesus rose from the dead and New Creation like we're not it's not eating everywhere clearly so then he works it out here's his understand that the sequence of how New Creation comes he says each in its own order first the first fruits the Messiah then those who are of the Messiah that is coming then comes the goal and it's the Greek word tell us from which Jesus uses this word when he says be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect and some of the tale is the completion the goal then comes completion then comes the completion and what's that when he that is the Messiah hands the kingdom over to
 the God and father when he has put an end to all Rule and all authority and power because he will reign as king until he has put all enemies under his feet The Last Enemy to be brought to an end is death The Last Enemy The Last Enemy so the Messiah overcame the power of death in the resurrection over himself over his own black body and being in the resurrection so you can think of the Resurrection as Jesus defeating Spiritual Beings who have co-opted evil his fight against Satan I've always just imagine that Christus Victor is Jesus Lang Satan and that's one way of thinking about it but also the dragon still has power over me right now
 cuz I'm going to die yeah I'm dying so another way to think about it is that he was confronting not just Satan but the power that Satan was using yes yeah that's right. How is he was using is the power the power of death and we think about Jesus Victor of the power of death we said he showed that power. Doesn't have any power him but then there's this hope that that's something that he will finish off of death will be brought to an end and I said I'd realized what I just said a minute ago I miss I misspoke I got to represent Paul spot Paul would say if you are in the Messiah
 then what's true of him is true of you right now which is why in the fusions he said y'all were dead and your sins and now you're met live in fact right now you are sitting on a Heavenly Throne next to where you rent this is an efficient and really I feel like I would have noticed if that's your future which means in God's economy he is the one who was and is and is to come if it's your destiny then it's true of you now because it ends already through the Messiah so in that sense I am not under the power of the snake the power of the snake I guess does have a hold on my bag is flashing bones that is dying but he doesn't have a hold on me the truest me the New Creation Day
 that poor raised from the dead and that's why the Last Enemy really is the thing that has the ability to put hooks in our flesh bags and drag him back down to the dirt and it's The Last Enemy I think it passed thought cuz it brings to an end this stage of creation that God called good but it's not the tell us it's not the goal I mean this is so as it's taking me so long to internalize this on a personal level but that's for the biblical authors reality transcends what we call the material world that what we exist in is real but it is also only partially real
 and that Ultimate Reality is the union of Heaven and Earth in a transformed mode of existence that's what's real and and that's how Jesus exist right now in that form yeah and that mowed all the Last Enemy can do is drag down my flesh bag which is the mode in which I exist right now but it's not the most real man that's a mystery but it's the view of reality underneath the storylines that he's trying to share with us and so I can try to understand that and I'm packing it I'm just trying to paint the bigger picture in with you calling to see if we just let that kind of sit and then we think about okay with him what is the power of death in that story it's something that if I'm
 already United with heaven then the power of death really doesn't have any power over me yet it still seems to yes and so there's this complexity and it was making me think of how we just listening to an interview with this guy who he's the writer behind this web, called wait but why are the best photo and he just wrote a book on his kind of history of all Humanity in many ways he's a great thinker but he's also his kind of each Roz and Ali simple comic style so I can explain her and she was talking about where does kind of true power come from in terms of like authoritarian Kings and so he had this parable about this King call King mustache mustache like ruled in this Kingdom where Free Speech was always allowed you could say anything and you would never get punished
 but King mustache comes into power and he makes us new edict hey anyone who makes fun of my mustache is going to get killed and he said there's this moment where you know imagine him giving this edict and everyone's there listening and they're like oh okay we can make fun of his mustache but that's only like his authority to say that my constitution of the land that you can say whatever you want so if someone would have just said no way we're going to make fun of your Moustache or mustache look silly then the question becomes will like his guards like going to rest that person and kill that person or not the true power is been in are we going to give us authority to King mustache or not enough stuff didn't actually have the authority the Constitution did and I'm just thinking about that I'm trying to understand the difference between okay the Satan isn't death itself he only is using the power
 and if Jesus came and said look that's done with the power of death is not an issue anymore I mean it's going to feel like it but like trust me ultimately like I've got this under control and if someone comes and goes no actually you can't trust that the power death is real and now you're just stuck with a choice of like am I going to you who am I going to believe who I believe is who I'm giving authority to which that Authority actually becomes a reality you know what I mean absolutely yeah I constructed but none the less real reality rights it is in our minds and then shapes are lived and built environments
 and institutions totally yeah and these are the manifestations of what Paul calls in this passage every rule Authority and power that the Messiah will put an end to in his coming and I noticed here in this passage he distinguishes again between death and the rules Authority and power that's in opposition to the new creation so in a way what death is is the ability I have to return you back to the nothingness from which you came yeah but you scared yes it's an immense power that we hold over each other maybe you know
 but I'm just a creature that can use the the dragon to the power of the Dragon so the way the biblical story works is there are forces that are very difficult for us to see but that exert influence over our views of what's good and bad and that get us to embrace our own ruin thinking that it's good that's like that it's fundamental Richard of the snake is in the Eden story, so instead of just coming to like Zapped us what the Satan does uniform the snake is get us to embrace our own self-destruction and think that it's good that's the portrait and so that's something Paul's understanding then of all of the ruling Authority and Power
 and the way Human Society structures themselves around deceptions and distortions of what's good and bad but death is like the engine cuz it's the only real power that a person or an institution has to get you to do what they want breaks
Satan he doesn't have the power of death but he's still trying to use it to Satan is not death Stayton use his death as a to the same way that humans use it as a credible and so that's what's a wild about us going back to the beginning of this passage it's about the belief in the resurrection and that becomes the center of how do you slay the dragon you believe and you said this a number of times and so I can think of this kind of letting you believe that the power of death isn't the final word you believe in the resurrection and that belief is how you slayed the dragon in another words even though death is going to have influence over us right now we're not giving it the final authority of being in charge and telling us what to do
 exactly right yeah that's right so that's certainly why he ends the way he does later on when you finish this line of thought and 1st Corinthians 15 and he paints a portrait he says you do on the day when we were perishing are closed with the imperishable when the Mortal puts on immortality then we'll sing a song by paraphrase you and he creates a three-line poem that's adapted and Blended from to Hebrew Bible text about that he's changed the wording to make a new Little Pond and the song goes like this death has been swallowed up in Victory
 where oh death is your Victory where of death is your sting it's a ton song it's what you saying over an enemy who just lost a game this is like the group cheer you know for an enemy that's lost it's like man you came out here on the field with a lot of swagger and where is your Victory now this is so rad this little plan to tell him that he creates and I'll just know one of the lines he borrows from Isaiah chapter 25 which we talked about many episodes ago that's where I like there was a blanket or like a covering yeah it's on the mountain of Yahweh there's a huge feast yeah and there has been a blanket blanket covering Humanity yeah he rip that open called death and then God's Walla Walla Walla is it up and then using the word swallow Isaiah for the poet who wrote that part of Isaiah
 is using a key word from the dragon slaying the dragon story but is that the hallway all of dragon it swallows up everything and that's why it's so threatening yeah so now the Dragon Gets swallowed up the death of death of getting a taste of her own medicine which is what is happening in with Pharaoh in the waters which is love and that's right by the water is what is the realm of the cast Dragon death eats itself yet that's right another cool thing here is he says we're of death is your Victory he used the Greek word Nike bk4 what's the Nike brand comes from and then second line where oh death is your sting York enthroned it's your stinger so referring either to like the sting of a scorpion tail or the sting of like venomous venomous bite so he's actually he's alluding to the victory over the dragon right here with this language of swallowing up in the sting
 Dragon talking about death like it has a stinger tail or venomous bites so good so the ability to look my own mortal death the death of My Flesh bag that's going to return to the dust and to look at that reality and to say that has no power over my imagination over my values over what I think is good and bad all of those things are determined by my truest self in Destiny which is already raining over the New Creation in partnership with the Messiah the Impalas the ology so you can sing at Aunt song that Beth this is your your help so powerful they are these are great ideas talked about the fact is I'm woke up this morning and anxious about all the stuff that's going to happen to them and think about if they're going to die am I going to die if I get rules to me it rules my imagination
 yeah that's rules me very hard and think it's back to like yeah what are we letting rule our imagination what are we giving power to because that will become a real power so I'll God has defeated death that can still have power over us when we let it so you mentioned how there was this like that cursed Bowl thing oh yeah the Aramaic incantation ball was this way for you to say I've met the Sea Dragon find you tonight made death and Chaos like come on you with a curse on your enemies and in some sense it's like how are you really have to do that but another since it's like You Can't Rap someone and you can't wrap their imagination and yeah right and you can do that to yourself to like you can just start to bike tell yourself like wow. That is the final word that does have power you come with kind of curse yourself in a way like just met the Sea Dragon take me
 and it feels like when we were at Romans 16 all kind of feels like is reversing it it's not a curse as a blessing may the God of Peace Christian the new your feet like yeah that's good he's flipping the script and he is blessing a new vision of reality into being and they're not in their minds but it's not just about believing a new idea it's that the way we believe things really are yes will shape the choices that we make and I imagine being the kind of person who like you're interested you're like whatever you're just frustrated and you can be the kind of person with your imagination is shaped as such a way with your like just want to know where you can be the kind of person who is like extending blessing like like I want to be crushed under our feet to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs May the God of Peace crush the dragon under your feet
 can you just cut me off I hope or just in our community today or amongst us yeah I'll be the kind of person is kind of like hoping for the dragon to like destroy your enemies that we kind of want the power the dragon a little bit just even in our words or thoughts yeah or are we like in her next and the blessing of snake Crusher and Paul is doing these other fathers of Jesus in Rome that he hopes to meet one day he wishes a blessing on them I like that John so hopeful Vision a reality that the dragon is crushable in fact will be crushed and you can participate in the disempowering of the Dragon
 by your choices that you make today it's good because it gets down to the foundation which is what story am I believing a living living in or am I allied with Resurrection Resurrection when and while it seems almost impossible to live that way you can almost imagine at least in like one small situation I think I could flip the script I can like beginning to try to live that way it is going to be as much making choices and following through on them that will help us flip the script then just saying an idea that I think I believe but our choices also come from our magic to friend yeah it's a symbiotic symbiotic that I Diaz give birth to ways of living and ways of living expressed ideas and
 friends on sticks and we're also not mine was trash bags we are a combination of both and if Paul says in verse 57 thanks be to God who has given us the Nike the victory through our lord Jesus Messiah yeah man.
