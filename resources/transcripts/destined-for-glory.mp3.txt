welcome to the midweek episode of The Bible project podcast of John and this is Tim today we get to talk with Haley Goranson Jacob we have been doing will reach out to a scholar whose book I discovered while John and I are working on the video idea everything video topic so I actually found Haley's work which is a book called conformed to the image of his son reconsidering pause the ology of Glory in Romans it's a souped-up word and theme study on the word glory and Paul's letters and then specifically to the ramen we talked about going before we have in one of those words that we don't use in normal everyday English
 Glory which is often associated with either how God glows like a light bulb radiant but also got status reports so we talk about this in the podcast there's actually a lot of really important well-known statements to Paul's letter to the Romans that have the word Glory all have sinned and fallen short of the glory the glory of God yeah so I will Haley did this book is the a revision of her actually a PhD thesis done at the University of st. Andrews what does a study of the word glory and Paul's letters then and second temple Jewish literature and then she lands back at the letter to the Romans and provides some just unique inside they gave me I was just like you can read the same text for 20 years and all the sudden ask a new question and boom things unfold in ways you've never seen before so I learned so much from her but that I said if we should reach out after all we're really doing
 for Haley spend some time with us so let's get into it
 Haley thank you for joining us today on the podcast we are excited to hear you talk more about some of the ideas that I got to read about in your book and then got excited about it John and I have talked about it John and I have had an ongoing conversation about the steam of glory and the image of God in the human Colony has kind of been a subset of all of our hard work over the last couple years so when I came across your book I was like yes this like right down the center lane of things that we both care a lot about but first tell us a little bit about yourself maybe where you're from Haley and how you ended up in biblical studies and what you doing right now okay well as quickly here from the accent I'm from Minnesota originally
 town called mazeppa 600 people so moved my way from there and was eventually at Crown College in Minnesota and so did biblical studies there yeah just kind of made my way from there to various places throughout the United States doing different Adventures Seminary on Massachusetts Gordon-Conwell Pastor to church for a couple years in Cooke City Montana and then yes sometime in Scotland's doing PhD work and now here at to Whitworth University in Spokane tell us about your how you got hooked on biblical studies I'm always interested to hear that story became a Christian when I was twelve and from that point on I just had this overwhelming desire to read the Bible and was just it was an insatiable desire and so when I went to college I wanted to go to be able to take just a year of Bible classes and then my goal is
 go on to pre-med and eventually I'm to be a pediatric oncologist so the Bible classes that I took at Crown College in Minnesota Galatians class so it we got to the part where pulse talking about Abraham and the coming of the law 400 years 30 years later and it became the Bible just kind of became a life to me it was like this new thing where the Old Testament and the New Testament Blended to make this beautiful narratives I really never seen before and I was really just hooked from that point on so I changed my major stuff around here I am so it sounds like it was Paul's letters the first got you excited about the scope of the overall biblical story and that's what you're saying
 your education graduate school was kind of focused whole Bible but through the Pauline letters was that the story continue to focus on Paul and as I continue to focus on Paul and I think as shift have happened in scholarship my professors throughout the different years have been attuned to that and have been emphasizing more and more the Old Testament echoes in reality issues and have helped to concrete's to make concrete this larger biblical narrative and so I got more and more excited about seeing these Old Testament echoes in the New Testament and then eventually even the creation narrative in Paul's letters on a textual level but then it was also K what is this actually mean then for Christianity what does it mean for when we talked about what the gospel is or what salvation is how does the creation there to fit into that so those types of questions have kind of been trained in me
 I've been trained to ask those types of questions now so that's a perfect lead-in to your book which I came across conformed to the image of his son reconsidering Paul's Theology of Glory in Romans this is the end results of your graduate work if your doctoral thesis is that right yeah all right so every book kind of generates out of some questions that usually go pretty deep or yesterday so what led you to this topic and why why did you dedicate so much time do it what movie did you or months those first two months of the PHD I was in st. Andrews Scotland and so how it works for the PHD programs there is you submit a large proposal and then if there's a supervisor there who wants to work
 with you with that proposal and you accepted and the idea is that proposal then gets whittled down into something that's actually doable so my proposal was to carry on this discovery of thinking through creation Echoes and Paul and so I think I actually propose something like looking at all the Genesis one through three echoes in Paul's letters as if that would take me to three to four years that would that's that's a lifetime of work but thankfully in the process my supervisor there was Tom rights and he was just excellent to it's helping me kind of sift through what are the the more critical things that I wanted to look at where the questions that were grounding everything and so I just kept going back and forth so many new outline after new outlines slowly very very slowly whittling it down to more and more specific details until kind of one day Romans 8:29 just landed in my lap as
 she's kind of a heart and soul of what at least many in the Protestant Evangelical World here in the United States think of as the kind of goal of Salvation and part of my my goal with PhD work was to write something that is going to have an impact on the church I didn't want to write something I was going to put them in a bookshelf for five nerdy Scholars to read here and there but actually something that is beneficial for the church at large and so Romans 8:29 kind of fell and it had everything I was wanting to think about and so just picked it up and ran with it when I was in high school I was asked to talk about my favorite chapter in the Bible and I didn't have one so I asked my mom what's your favorite chapters about what you said moments after the Bible and it is a beautiful chapter and means a lot to a lot of people but when we get to this idea of Glory such a Bible word
 that doesn't mean anything to me yeah I think that I would just skip over it I think I would just do just buzzed out and then mind yeah yeah let me just read I'm just going to read the second verse is that you spent a lot of time working on and then first you had a helpful way of introducing the reader to different traditions of interpretation of this passage that every it was really helpful for me I'd like you to see if you could come Sunrise explore those for our audience but I'll just read this is Romans 8 28 through 30 Paul says and we know I'm reading from the English Standard Version
 and we know that for those who love God all things work together for good
 for those who are called according to his purpose
 for Those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son
 in order that he that is the sun might be the firstborn among many brothers and Those whom he predestined he also called and Those whom he called he also Justified or declared righteous and Those whom he justified he also glorified is a famous text to talk about a lot of things all the power words of Paul in Theology and of controversy about policy ology attracted your interest here what do you think are those kind of the main driving Point here and how have different people understood what the main point is here but yeah for me what I really focused in on north of the primary question I was asking is that middle part of Romans 8:29 what does it mean to be conformed to the image of God so much of that the controversial words are before and after it's mainly that foreknowledge predestination justification but I wanted it really just focus on that
 little bit that we kind of Overlook or take for granted conformed to the image of the Sun and what I started looking into it I became quite frustrated actually every commentary that I would open it would say something like this it would say one day when the Lord returns we will be made like Christ isn't it wonderful that one day will be made to reflect Christ will be like the Son of God God will make us like his son Allelujah and I just wanted to say yes Alleluia amen however what does it actually mean to be made like Christ if that's even if that's even what Paul is getting at yeah kind of let that frustration then fuel where I went with it but could occur to anybody thoughtfully reading cuz if you wanted to say to be like Christ he could say that but instead of uses the image of God language from Genesis 1 the image of the Sun
 significant when we recognize that larger biblical theology that's Paul's working with introduced us to maybe some different ways people have taken that so people to be made like Christ you had a good survey of like it means moral Holiness or it means exaltation and glow like light bulbs yeah so there's a handful of options that many have understood it to be one would be it refers to the the time when we're physically resurrected so to be conformed to Christ or to the image of the sun would be looking towards the day of Resurrection when we receive our new bodies when we are reunited with God in that physical form fully redeemed on every level and soon otherwise it would be a very much a future understanding even beyond the second coming right after post-resurrection.
 should I text physical Redemption is one of the ways that people have understood it another way is to understand it as sharing in the sufferings of Christ now as we think about what does it look like to be a Christian how did Christ live his life it was a cruciform life it was a life of suffering of self-sacrifice and service and so for many when they read that first it's as if Paul is saying we should share in the sufferings of Christ now and there's a lot to that in fact I think it's actually a significant part of a pulse getting it but it's maybe not the entirety or went to reframe it in a slightly different way the main way that people think about it is this moral sanctification and this is especially popular with in the you know you're kind of typical Church culture in the United States we have language of Holiness of sanctification of straw
 heading to be morally righteous or morally pure and so when we read it it's as if Paul is saying to us one day we will be made morally Pure or holy morally Sanctified perfect and upright sin the way that Christ is as if that is somehow the goal of our Salvation or are entering into the Christian life is to be Holier Pier that's by far the most common way that people have thought about it future version of what would Jesus do and it eventually all become the kind of person who will just do what she says would do perfectly that's the way I would read this from my tradition to be conformed to the image of Jesus
 goes his moral uprightness his Perfection his disability and all the ways that we think of how we should be like Jesus inside when we think of isn't it wonderful that one day will be like Christ it's only natural to think well yes of course will be like Christ in the way that we think of Christ as which is to say perfectly holy pure morally upright specific new assets Paul had in mind and you think this phrase conformed to the image is deeply connected to that last phrase and verse 32 be glorified an awesome story and pulse mine that he is assuming that we're going to know but that seems like many of us don't know yeah and this way in connecting this question what does it mean to be conformed to the image of the sun many people will connect it to being glorified that's at the end of 8:30 the issue
 do with that is what we then think of Glory as saying another unclear thing exactly I think the word glory is just meaningless to me like it just comes into the brain as well I mean now if your high schooler what did you think of maybe you didn't grow up in this group I don't I don't remember I don't remember what I thought but I do know you mentioned our Tim you talking about the glowing do the light bulb kind of thing that definitely comes to mind some sort of beaming Ness
 you still remember what Gloria meant to you like high high school or something I think app until I started to PhD I thought of Glory is as what most people think of it as as a combination of two things one would be something to do with light Radiance or light imagery the other is the presence of God so you put those together and I think I would think well in and thanks also to many of our hymns that we sing and have sung throughout there's hardly a Hymnal that exists where every him doesn't have the word glory in it and when we think of it for humans it's always one day when we die when we enter into the presence of God's we will then receive our Glory we will come and take Lori there almost becomes a synonym with heaven in the terms of some place we go to like we enter Glory the Glorious Place So Glorious be
 will be on the Glorious Place yeah that's true it isn't a lot of hymns and so for me it's in the category of words like Hallelujah and Glory it's just kind of like that's the phrase just to get us into the glory is it part of the Christian has language that we have if we don't really stop and think but even when the best examples of the words not used but it is an Amazing Grace the verse where it has and when we've been there ten thousand years has a lot of grounding is it biblical examples there's a whole section of your book is just a really helpful study of the concept and word glory and throughout the Bible is really helpful thank you for that. I don't know how many nights you stayed buried in California so talk to us about the range of meaning of Glory in the Bible
 in Jewish literature and and and and Paul how we think of Glory in association with God verses glory in association with humans so we all understand perfectly well when we say we give glory to God it's the sense in which we extol God we praise God we honor God but glory is also used as a possessive of God something that God owns or possesses or come give out or can display and that's where it becomes getting a bit more tricky until we have versus like the heavens declare the glory of God what does that actually mean or the world will see the glory of God revealed the psalmist in those cases expect that the sky will just light up with the radiance of the sun literally filling the entire
 give the globe I mean it's poetry right it's meant to create symbols the symbolic language that creates Visions in our our minds of Something Beautiful Something magnificent in conversations that John and I have had we bought through some of the at least biblical examples where the word Glory can refer to something a creation of physical part of creation that could be called the God's glory meaning it's some it's a physical manifestation of his beauty is Powers creativity and John you came up with my favorite example ever which was your bedroom has a junior high like where I come into your room you had a better way of describing it and I did remember when I talked to Lori and what really helped me was you talking about the literal meaning or the heaviness of heaviness yeah but I still was trying to understand
 what makes me important what makes me significant what would would be this outward appearance of who I am and for me I was just imagining like when you come into my room I want you to see the things that I'm interested in and the music I listen to and it's tell a story about me and this room is my glory physical manifestation of you more about that yeah I think that definitely alliance with how glory is often used of God but of course the other way that we think of it and no props even better is the Shekinah Glory the times when the glory actually is visible and is revealed in these what we think of as steel FANUC Revelations write where there's fire
 there's the brightness we think of the times when Moses is shown the glory of God and his face shines or when God comes in an indwells the holy of holies in the Tabernacle and then in the temple when Solomon dedicates it or in ezekiel's vision of the glory of God leaving from the temple that is very much the presence of God revealed in this visible manifestation of light and for that reason it makes perfect sense to think of Glory especially glory for the future for humans in heaven as the radiance of God the presence of God it's not unfounded in the least bit in fact it it's used quite often throughout the Bible but you want to help us see the Paul makes a distinction when he talks about human Glory
 he's got something a little more specific in mind me that's not the best way saying it when we think of Glory forgot it's very different than when we think of Glory for humans do for humans when we look at how glory is used throughout the Old Testament in particular it's almost always a sense of Honor or a sense of status a sense of power not a single time in the Old Testament is a human said to have Glory or to be glorified such that they're made to shine with the one exception of Moses in most face Exodus 34 but if that's going to be our example of what we can expect someday in heaven then it's just our faces I should be shining not or if I remember correctly the word glory is never isn't used to describe Moses in that story it's another verb it's like the verb to it's a verb for horns to horn or spikes or Cheyenne
 it's a strange verb I'm specifically using through the Greek text primarily so I think for the creek and it is more that he is glorified so that's the only time that a human is said to shine we're all humans don't shine a lot there's slight bioluminescence yes we do we glow we just we can't see it anyway that's the humans in the Bible these other things for people like Joseph in the story of Joseph and his brothers, he Reveals His identity
 to them he says Don't Be Afraid just go home and tell my father of the glory that's been given to me or we have people like Daniel and his three buddies Shadrach Meshach in a Bendigo they deny the King's food for the week and just eat vegetables and water at the end of it they are lifted up as being better than anyone else in the kingdom and Daniel is glorified and is given a position of rule over the kingdom those are the types of examples when humans are glorified in the Old Testament and I think that's what Paul is working with primarily for human Glory which brings us back to Romans then this is why people who noticed that connection and this is why you draw the connection to being conformed to the image of the sign is connected to or forget to use they even it's the same point as being glorified
 it's the way that they're kind of constructed it's to be conformed to the image of the son AKA when all is said and done the Lord of fight so different language for the same event yes you brought up Tim the image language is connected to Genesis 1 and that is connected to status and Rule right which I wouldn't have picked up if it hadn't been for this project in and talking because from what you said Haley like from from a typical Christian American Christian perspective is generally The Narrative is you've been blowing it get saved and now you can live a morally upright life and then one day fully realize that which is untrue but if that's the only story than you read something like this and you think okay this is about being morally upright but if the story is that God put us on this flight Space Rock so that we could rule the world with him then
 there's something more going on here yes so it's being conformed to the image and being glorified are the same and Paul's mind he's got some story some deeper connected storyline that you think is actually underlying the whole of like Romans 1 through 8 he's working from a deep kind of below the surface story so talk to us about that yeah I do I do think that there's something deeper their ultimate Lee comes down to how Paul thinks about what does it mean to be a human and how does he think of Jesus as the new human that the new Adam when he rises from the dead launching this new creation this new Humanity he's going back to a new version on some level of Genesis 1 and what does it look like to be made in the image of God when we think of Genesis 1 of course we have the creation of humanity in the image
 God and of course we've wrestled with that for 2,000 years what is the Imago Dei refer to and of course it can be many things at the same time the text us give us a pretty good hint as to what the writer was getting at and stats in the language that follows which is be fruitful and multiply fill the Earth and have dominion rule over the fish in the sea the birds and the are the things that creep on the ground in other words Gods coming creating humanity and saying I'm giving you a job to do in fact your created to fulfill this vocation here's what you're meant to do you're meant to rule over creation you're meant to represent me the Creator God to the creation you're meant to be my hands and feet and to rule with Justice and equity and love and all the things that we're eventually going to see
 The Narrative Christ doing but of course humans have failed at that vocation which is exactly what Paul gets at in Romans 1 and I think where he launches The Narrative of what God has done in through Christ he begins with here's what humans were meant to do but they instead exchange the glory of God this is Romans 1:23 they exchanged the glory of God for the images that represent human beings animals Birds fish reptiles and that then has launched them into this world of sin and death and Injustice and chaos and Brokenness until the Redeemer comes and shows as reveals that's what does it look like to be a true human
 in Romans wine to wear change the glory or one of our words are Glory words of the immortal gods for images there's our image word but instead of the glory being a human image its images resembling the things were supposed to be immense Birds animals it's exactly the list of creatures in Genesis when they were supposed to rule over is that inverted creation over there we haven't seen the glory of God here and what's it referring to is it referring to his rule or is it like more of his Shekinah Glory or what do you think is happening here I think that for the most part Paul uses the word Glory throughout Romans very consistently and he uses it almost entirely as the sense of Honor or
 so in the question of Romans 1:23 the glory of God that they exchange I think it's that sense of rule of having that Dominion or rulership over creation that God has given to them twice was not a glory that's intrinsic to us as human it's the glory of God the rule of God the kingship of God yeah God has gifted to humans to live into the wrong thing but me and how much more tragic is it that it's like God handed you his rule has ability to do with him and then we exchange that for like yeah that's right sounds great let the creepers rule over asking about it the glory of God's moral perfection or light inmate doesn't make any sense here
 how do you exchange that it's not mine to exchange more like ignored or yeah but you're right because you can't I can only exchange something that I possessed yeah and I possess glory of God only if it's been given to me as a guy his ass mark x clear to me than it ever has been before the words to use maybe is to they abdicated his throne and they're giving rulership its external to them they're brought into this environment but they can choose to say no thanks they can have to keep the throne and elect to have something else instead of talk about another important piece the word glory in Romans is Romans 3:23
 it was on like the list of verses to memorize Sanilac top 5 yeah one of the sound bites about the human condition for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God which again I assumed his glorious and his moral perfection and I have not attained that moral perfection what do you think Paul is fine but we've already talked about I think he's simply restating what he already said and 123 now he's putting the Sim language on it he's calling it what he didn't call it in 123 which is to exchange the glory of God's and worship idols we call idolatry idolatry is the basis of sin and he's simply restating it because now he's carried on in the other things that he saying in Romans and has kind of come round to summarizing that to say look Jew and Gentile we have all participated in this
 form of idolatry we are all guilty of it we have all exchange the glory of God we've all fallen short of it or lost it does the dents Greek phrase the glory of God but in both of those passages what it means is the glory God has given to humans that's what it means that's what you're saying that's a lot of people but it's just kind of vocational functional sense of it so we were called to a vocation and we chose to ignore it or we chose to reject it and Sarah buy weed rejected what does it mean to be fully human what does it mean to be the image bearers of God walking the earth I think that's really cool. I want to just say Okay glory of God that's all Paul means but I got to imagine that he also in that word means also not just the glory that God's given us but the glory
 he has the honor and the awesomeness it could be like we can receive glory honor and status in the favor of sharing a God's rule because it's something that is like you said Haley intrinsic to God's write the fact that he gives it to others means that he is the ultimate source of it yeah it lies underneath us but at the same time that's not the main Nuance when we talked about people exchanging God's glory or not attaining falling short of it yeah yeah you're right so different point it's it's more specific it doesn't take anything away from the glory of God in fact I think it actually feels it out more if we think of falling short of the glory of God is not attending to some sort of brilliant lights well that doesn't make any sense whatsoever but if it's also this kind of moral or wholly standards that were somehow trying to achieve then I think that reduces with a Biblical name
 what if it's about as if being wholly is the endgame being wholly is close to the end game but we're called to be holy for a particular purpose in other words what is it looks like to be wholly to be wholly looks like living the human life that we've been called to live as God's Representatives on the Earth completely separate things it's just fitting that moral uprightness or Holiness within the larger Narrative of what the Bible is told us about what it means to be human Matthew the next question that I have back to Romans 8 in Romans 8 we're celebrating call celebrating the moment when we are going to be conformed to the image of the sun which leads up to the last statement of being glorified sharing and God's glory being on a status and honor and Rule why does he say conformed to the image of the Sun as a
 close to conform to the image of God cuz he has the image of God praise in Genesis 1 what is using the fridge image of the son I think this connects to how you understand Psalm 8 and how important that is to Paul to talk a little bit about that the image of the Sun what what's loaded in there for Paul that we are being conformed to whose Glory or image it is that we are sharing it because of soulmates but even beyond that when we get if you think specifically of Romans 5 food Jesus is as the Son of God he is not only the Son of God who is the long-awaited Jewish Messiah come to redeem God's covenant people but he is larger than that she's more than that he is the new Adam he is the representative of the new Humanity that's hugely important for Paul as Paul thinks about
 what does it mean for us as humans to be justified or saved or to be redeemed as humans the only model that we have is the person of Jesus Christ his humanity and so for Paul to say conformed to the image of the son I think he's thinking they're of not just Jesus as the third person of the Trinity or as the Messiah but specifically as that sun in Messiah who is also the new Adam the new human and that's the case because of how important soulmate is to Paul and to the rest of the New Testament writers really so soulmate is see no just a song that we say often and scraps don't think a ton of out button soulmate it's saying essentially they said the psalmist is asking God why have you thought of humans why do you care
 so much for us to Simply are on the earth and all we do is bad things why have you crowned us us mere humans with Glory and Honor why have you crowned us with glory and honor and why have you given us mere humans dominion over the birds in the air the fish in the sea and all that creeps on the ground Lord our Lord How Majestic is your name praise God for what you have given to us mere humans and that song is essentially a commentary on Genesis 1 26 to 28 instead of the image language being used it's the crowned with Glory language that's being used and then the same language is there of having the dominion over the fish in the sea the birds in the air and everything that creeps on the ground so soulmate is about Humanity at Large
 and what Paul and the writer of Hebrews does is to look at Psalm 8 in to say Jesus Christ is the son of man who has been given that Dominion who has been crowned with glory and honor and now rules over all things in other words Jesus Christ is the ideal perfect human he's the one that we were all meant to be like but failed to be like and so soul mate is is in 1st Corinthians 15 where Paul is using the new Adam imagery he can place it was Psalm 110 Lord my Lord the Lord said to my Lord and sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet the writer of Hebrews uses it fairly extensively in a passage to say how Jesus is the greatest human to exist so soulmate is hugely important and with that being in the background we know then that Paul is equator
 Jesus as the human the new Adam to the son of man of Psalm 8 who is the ideal beautiful picture of what Humanity was in Genesis 1 26 to 28 Echoes I think what a lot of a lot of people feel but actually can't lie saying Christian culture may be as much as wouldn't is just like I really just seems sometimes like we're just bumbling Harry sapiens just like you know what is it are we really there's something more going on and it's a storm is coming like yeah there's a calling that is way more important than you would anticipate for yeah how how can ridiculous we are and thank God for Jesus 2 p.m.
 with me I found myself pondering was a section where you explored how Paul talks about followers of Jesus ruling exercising their Glory rule stats in the present moment he talks about in Romans day it is stuck out to me before but the way you frame that question how do we rule the world in the present according to Romans they said really I love how you how you put it also hugely important because what we think of Glory typically is something in the Future No Matter How We characterize it other than the suffering one especially for moral perfection or the physical Resurrection body that we might have for entering into the quote glorious presence or Radiance of God they're all in the future they're all post Earthly life This Side of Heaven and actually what Paul says in Romans 8:30 is that it's already done this is the the beauty of grammar in a way I'm in 8:30 it's not we will be cool
 besides it's he has glorified it's done it it's an accomplished fact those who are in Christ Our glorified which is to say then they are conformed to the image of the Sun but of course Romans 8 is tricky right because Romans 8 says it's not only the chapter we're literally every theology kind of comes to roost but it's also difficult in terms of thinking through the time elements so Paul says we are adopted and he also says when we will be adopted and he says we will be glorified and he says we have been glorified and so there's this what we refer to as now but not yet there's a sense in which for those of us who have been redeemed in Christ we live into that future reality in the present what God will do at the return of Christ he's already launched that program
 and we threw the person and work of Christ get to live into that new reality now so we are already glorified if this understanding of Glory is correct anyway we have already been replaced or reset on that Throne of Glory we've already been given the Crown of Glory and Honor we have already been called to rule over the earth now in Christ yes so I think in Paul gets at that in Romans Ace and very sweet of a whole new way to think about cuz right in the paragraph before the verses that you focused on is the chain of groaning syndrome and say the creation is groaning and believers who have this glorified identity in the present we are grounding cuz we're in these bodies that like hurt and get sick and die along with creation and then inside of our ground
 as we cry out to God we discover the spirit is groaning and the spirits interceding and intercession language is imagery of somebody in the throne room of got the presents crying out to the one on the throne on behalf of somebody outside the throne room yes was so helpful that just put together all these images for me that it's actually a glorified Jesus followers who suffer imagine the suffering with Messiah is an important element here is if we exercise our rule by crying out to God to bring the creation
 yeah but I don't know how to pray for that and so this I find the spirit of this groaning God is praying in through the groanings of his glorified people and somehow that's our way of ruling the world is to share and its suffering and groaning that is so beautiful and profound but the way the way you package that helped me see that in the in the new way and I'm guessing you didn't quite say that in the book but it seem like that's where you are leading entirely and in fact we often don't know what to do with those few verses on the spirits in the intersection and the groaning we kind of skipped over at we can give a sermon here and there and on what intercessory prayer might look like but what colors don't know how to do necessarily has to tie it in with the surrounding context the creation groaning and then I got the purpose is coming to fruition for those who love him being informed to the image were made like Christ and then glorified were shining someday like it how did these
 we characterize I'm like we typically do but yeah I do think that Paul and Visions is that redeemed humans in Christ will participate in the sufferings of Christ which is to say they will rule over the Earth in the way that Christ ruled and the way that Christ ruled is through self-sacrifice through suffering and when we truly enter into that world of suffering we enter into something that's far beyond what we're capable of comprehending you know we just came through Easter and we woke up on Easter morning to the news of the the bombings in Sri Lanka at we're now 350-plus persons are proclaimed Ed how do we wrestle with that its evils like that that we wake up to and we think I don't even know what to pray and we grown because we don't have the words but the spirit does tend a spirit can intercede on
 our behalf for us for these issues of Brokenness and chaos and evil and pain and suffering going on in the world when we even think of like of the Gospel of John as far beyond Paul here but the gospel is John Jesus is constantly saying my time for Glory has not yet come the entire second half of the Gospel of John is what we refer to as the book of Glory Glory is just literally everywhere it's like every other verse Glory this is Lori that you will see my glory my glory will be revealed and then eventually Jesus says my time has come or the time has come for my glory to be made known and when is that Glory made known in the Gospel of John it's made known when he is lifted up when he is on the cross it's the revelation of God's glory God's power God's honor God's character God's Dominion as king and Creator being revealed through the greatest act of self-sacrifice and suffering
 soap for Paul I think when he thinks of us and what it means to be human and to be redeemed in to be re glorified to participate in the glory of the new he envisions are entering into the sufferings of the world because we enter into the sufferings of Christ who ruled through suffering through self-sacrifice so it's not a sense of domination it's a sense of dominion via self-sacrifice and I think that's what Paul is getting at with the groanings Creations grilling and it broke its longing for the children of God to be revealed because when the children of God are revealed their re glorified they're fully entered into that Glory they're fully entered into what they were meant to do for creation in the beginning to help be in to thrive and flourish into all that it was meant to be the spirit than grounds with us and intercedes for us in the Brokenness of the
 I think that all makes a whole lot more sense of Romans 8 at large and what Paul does elsewhere is worth many cups of tea in the Long Walk ya thank you for that Haley you mentioned you have the season in pastoral Ministry and she think about your students how would you encourage a local church to imagine that calling invocation in the specific neighborhood what would that look like was the name of the town you grew up in I like the name it's called what what time do your imagination when you think of a group of followers of Jesus in the neighborhood or in the city embodying that glorified conform to the Son of God type of ruling I Envision them looking around and having eyes to see through Brokenness true pain not looking for somebody
 evangelize not looking for somebody who doesn't go to church but they want to go to church those are perfectly good and find things to look for but I don't know what that's what it means to rule or to be glorified in this way I think what it would mean for the church is to look at their neighborhoods and to see the suffering because every neighborhood has some form of suffering right even the most privileged of us in the United States have some form of suffering going on but to look at the neighborhood in to see what forms of suffering there is is it poverty is it issues of race is it health concerns is it you know you think of Flint Michigan a lack of clean drinking water is it there are so many issues that have riddled our broken world and every single neighborhood has them and so I think it would be a matter of the church truly assessing those areas of Brokenness
 pain and suffering and thinking through the ways in which they can bring the love of God into that neighborhood where they can bring Mercy where they can bring Grace where they can bring some form of redemption it's not always going to be spiritual Redemption physical Redemption is just as much something that we've been called to as much as the spiritual Redemption aspects and so it's getting away from hyper spiritualizing everything and thinking of it as simply I'm a Christian now my job is to make others Christians and to quote carry out the gospel in that way but rather I'm a Christian therefore God has called me into a life of using my own body for the Redemption of the world around me in a physical and spiritual way that's when he gets out in Romans 12 right
 he he goes through all of this significance theological waiting is of the letter that we spend all our time on Lenny has this massive therefore in 12:1 therefore I urge you I entreat you I plead with you present your bodies as the sacrifice of worship don't be conformed to the world around you to the patterns of this age the present evil a she doesn't use the word evil there but it's that's what he thinks of this a jest don't be conformed to the patterns of this world but rather have the eyes to see what God is actually doing in the world around you and then enter into that join that work of redemption attitudes Jesus entirely of being The Peacemaker and suffer hunger
 but to be me again in the sense of kind of like man is almost pathetic like you but I know it's entering into suffering or something so beautiful there it is beautiful to have been committed it's not how we think of ruling came through I quit Paul's doing in Romans right if we think of the first century Christians in Rome the Roman environment there is nothing for that culture that says that self-sacrifice or suffering is good it is the opposite of a virtue which is why Christian stood out so much right so when Paul says think of Glory or those who will be glorified to receive Glory that context is about honor it's about status it's about rule except with Paul's doing is to say according to the
 that Jesus Christ has ruled our rule is going to look very different than the world's rule around us we will rule but it's not going to look like our neighbors think it should look it's going to be the opposite and that's actually going to be what attracts people to Christ you have a wonderful way of rapping nothing to your accent all day thank you for the effort you put into writing this book I know books like this are a huge amount of work and there were probably many late nights and you're wondering what why am I doing this more people will hear about it and learn from you too but thank you for your hard work I learned a lot and I was personally inspired and it's really fun to hear you talk about it in person thank you for taking time to talk
