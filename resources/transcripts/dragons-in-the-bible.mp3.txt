today we begin a brand new steam study and it is on the chaos dragon dragons they are not just in the Bible they are all over the Bible all over all the different parts of the Bible there's several different words that have Guapo's used to describe dragons or chaos monsters in the Bible today will take a survey of those ancient words naka-kon on Leviathan these are all ways of referring to the same type of creature we first meet the chaos dragon on page one of the Bible it's called a ton mean it's surprisingly it's created on day five as part of God's ordered creation it's good but what this noxious going to start doing this I'm not good stuff this makes us look with new eyes that's the name of Genesis 3 of Genesis 3 21 attempts Adam and Eve be a dragon sounds a lot like Daniel
 and the Revelation these authors have a coherent way of thinking it's just different than the with the biblical authors are doing is that they're actually deploying well-worn images and storylines of putting those images in the service of the more unique set of ideas and claims about God and reality in good and evil in humans and I talked about dragons in the Bible I'm done calling your listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey John hi hi we're starting the new theme yeah this is a good day. These are good days when we start new projects and we're going to be tracing a theme throughout the story of the Bible from first book to the last just kind of what kind of what we do we Define this team and this theme is the theme of of dragons in the Bible which is not anything I learned in Sunday school Bible College any sermons I've ever listened to and Stephanie Bible studies I've ever done yeah I don't think that I've ever dragons in the Bible we have the right book yeah that's right I thought that's fancy wake me up in that I'm dragons yes dragons there they are not just in the Bible they
 are all over the Bible all over all the different parts of the Bible you're just depends on what translation you read whether you will see them or not but even well as we'll see you there are some texts is just there right there all you have to do is read that part of the Bible which young people may not so we're doing theme conversations we are prepping condensed however many hours this conversation takes you into a video and also some other material you know that we'll make through Bible project but I'll just podcast series is kind of where we found head we trace a theme and usually I try to pick themes where it appears in the first pages of Genesis repeatedly throughout and then culminates in the story of Jesus and then Tess important role in the final book of the Christian Bible which is the Revelation and Dragons qualify qualify
 so let's just quick and this opening conversation I guess I just want to make the case that there are dragons all over the Bible there be dragons Ohio baby dragon all over and the first ones that you meet and certainly that ancient writers of the Bible would see right there and did see right there is on day 5 of the first story in the Bible about the seven days of creation day 5 as an explicit mention of the great sea monsters
so just a feeling they 5 to remember on the six days of creation first three Gods separates B dark separates the waters above and Waters below and then they threesomes the dry land of the waters days four five and six, long and in the same order. Phil's each of those rounds with inhabitants the lights above the separate light from dark and then on day five the waters above in the waters below the waters above the sky dumb so he sets the birds in the air and they fly against the face of the waters to bath and then in the waters below what we told Genesis 1 verse 21 is God created the Tottenham and every living thing with which the water swarms and moves about according to their kinds and all the wings of birds Courtney their kinds and God saw that it was good
 so the big question is in Genesis 1:21 what are the tiny name name is the singular tanning and then this is the plural taneem taneem on it so it's tiny name as the great creatures of the sea so that could be just you know some catfish whales giant squids those are crazy those are crazy that's why all this here in Oregon this winter like within the last month January 2023 there's been a large number of Wales washing-up dead on the organ sure there was a huge sperm whale that washed up at Fort Stevens State Park and then numerous gray whales more parts of the Central Coast
 I was being sarcastic about it is that I've seen one I think it was probably a calf once the beach gray well maybe like the size of a minivan it's been unbelievable I've never smelled anything I think we talked about this but do you know like it was in the 90s or something out here in Oregon coast they try to blow a whale up beached whales Majestic the incredible and I mean just if you haven't seen one washed up yeah then the only time you ever see one is part of one
 hey Lourdes back because you don't really know what the rest of it looks like and if you're in a boat maybe you know but you could easily gain an impression that there's more to this thing you ever saw if you're sketching the rest of it in your imagination that's right so great creatures of the sea The New International Version open the category of that that's just what it could be talking about the English Standard Version same words to praise great sea creatures are the Old King James just straight-up went for Wales just great whales translated The New American Standard and the new revised Standard Version both translate the great sea monsters ok now monster I got a whale anymore I'm thinking of thinking of of sea monster
 dinosaur House of alligator sea serpent sea serpent so maybe long so that may be what you might see come up out of the water with a gray whale like the back is just one but you might think the next one is another like I was the coils of that sing another one then with a huge dragon head yeah so the question is what do we do with whales King James should we go with sea monsters or should we go with sea creatures so let's just do a quick little survey of the use of this word tan mean I mean in the rest of the Hebrew Bible what we find our two Psalms that explicitly recalled a 5 Psalms 104 in Psalms 148 are explicitly structured and reference the 7-Day creation narrative and when they get to the creatures of the sea
 in Psalm 104 verse 24 how many are your works oh yeah you've made all of them and wisdom the Earth is full of your creatures the great and wide sea is a big sea shells pretty large animals move without number living things small and great we probably still can't remember the amount of creatures in the sea now it's not possible no it's pretty wild for just one little Blank Space Rock
 you know that's mostly ocean yeah mostly ocean 70% explored this wild
 they're the ship sail for 26 Leviathan is there that you formed and then it's the Hebrew word let the heck to play deform to play deform to play created the Leviathan play play that's not how I would describe a monster well remember on day 5 God made the tiny name and all the other stuff and God saw there was good and good love is on what is that word if we're not rebuilding out the vocabulary instead of turning memes Psalm 104 so I'll just tuck it away Leviathan or Hebrew word here livyatan so our English word Leviathan it's just spelling in English letters in Hebrew word Livia ton OK Google 40847 when it recalls day 5 it just you
 is the word colony mean that's in the deeps of the abbess is in the second Temple. Israel return some excellent Babylon round and 500 BC and then they Ezra Nehemiah rebuilt the Temple of the last all the way up till 70 AD after Jesus was called the second temple. And a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible was produced by a Jewish Scholars because Greg has become the lingua Franca yep and to make the Hebrew Bible available to greek-speaking Israelites Greek translation was produced and it both of these places if you look up both of Psalms in the old Greek translation Psalm 100 for 100 4811 bison are translated with the Greek word dragon from which we get our English word Dragon so ancient Jewish readers found dragons right here
 in the Psalms and in Genesis beer truck on the Greek translation of both of these words struck on and in in the Greek language the dragon was merely a sea creature or none of it conjures up all the everything yeah I mean the Greek myth and lore you've got Titans in the all the famous dragon slaying stories I think of land creatures creatures oh okay yeah so the rock on can refer to sea dragons
 or would be an example of a popular sea dragon in what Greek mythology mythology ancient world dragons were primarily associated with the see if you look at the ancient Aramaic commentaries and translations of the Hebrew Bible also produced in the second temple. And later they're called the guitar gums if you look at the targum of Genesis chapter 1 on day 5 what you find so if example there's a targum called Target near feed he isn't Aramaic translation but very almost like a form of commentary very expensive they identify the monsters
 darken a CD says and the Lord created the two great monsters Leviathan and behemoth
 and these are the two and jump monsters from the speeches of child and yeah so there's other second temple Jewish text S for Route first Enoch that also mention God making Behemoth and Leviathan and a 5.3 L saw actual monsters on day 5 of yeah that's my point got it and Greek readers dragon dragon fruit they were good monsters but they're not bad once that that's like we're doing the word survey about the now we've got two words you got to undine which is he was fourteen times in the Hebrew Bible we look at a couple live yet on the Leviathan 5 time from Hebrew Bible but then we lost got one more word
 tickets connected with Tony and Olivia tan and that is the word Nosh snake with gets translated it's the word for the thing that I have me in the garden so I'm just going to hear the whole bunch of passages I'm just going to mention him cuz we're going to dive into these deeper Captain future conversations Psalm 74 it's a poem that's recalling when God created Cosmos verse 12 Psalm 74 yeah God is my king from of old who works Deeds of Salvation in the middle of the Earth
 you divided the Sea by your strength so that's day that you did too but I didn't see you broke the heads of the tiny name in the waters you crushed the heads of Leviathan you gave him as food for the creatures of the Wilderness body Kratom to play all over the table okay great wonderful notice how tiny name is in parallelism with Leviathan in the sea and it's a creature with many heads that got crush
 had yeah just heads with the multi-headed sea monster yeah this is a true monster Isaiah 27 verse 1 in that day which is a future together to this rat text will talk about this later you always going to punish Leviathan The fleeing nakash okay and is described as a no cash with his Fierce and mighty sword he's going to punch him indeed Leviathan twisting not he will kill the tiny know who lives in the sea is that there's a mall that together so Amos 9 verses 3 through this good so you always so angry at his Covenant Partners Israel for worshipping other gods neglecting the poor allowing Injustice and oppression that he says I'm going to hunt you down
 even if they hide on the summit of Mount Carmel on a certain amount take them out there if they concealed themselves for my eyes on the floor of the sea and there I'll come in to knock us and it will go bite them or you can flee to yeah and there's no depth of the ocean you can fit for you down there God's got them so if you're on the mountain you're up and God's territory of the right I don't need run around but down in the Seas he's got agents down there and want meaningful way is an ancient person going to go hang out in the bottom of the ocean. It's poetry who is interesting on Jeremiah 51 Nebuchadnezzar
 the king of Babylon has devoured me and crushed me
 this is Jeremiah who lived in Jerusalem when Babylon was being besieged by Nebuchadnezzar armies and was taken
 so he described Nebuchadnezzar as having a mouth that can eat and swallow Jerusalem
 he sat me down like an empty vessel he swallowed me up like a ton in is filled his stomach with my Delicacies and then he washed me away meaning Exile vomited me out here is being described as he knocks a monster swallows up Israelites and then vomits on that bomb it's them out sounds like story I know in fact is he kill 29 the set of Oracles of Israelite Prophet Ezekiel against Pharaoh the king of Egypt and 29:3 says this is what the Lord God says I am against you Pharaoh king of Egypt a great time seeing that lives in the midst of the rivers you say the Nile is mine
 I have made it
 but I will put hooks in your jaws and refresh up at 2 mean going to make the fish of your Rivers cling to your scales on a hall you up out of the rivers and all the fish will clean your scales and he says I'm basically puts carcass on the land and all the animals you can eat you
 bananas again it's a king it's a Tyrant King the Pharaoh in Imperial King who like conquerors other nations and plunders them like Nebuchadnezzar so you can soak humans kingdoms can be like to see monsters you so these are all examples where there are three words are all mixing and matching together here there be dragons there be dragons
 this makes us look with new eyes at the natash of Genesis 3 that we may now that's a land creature so when you said Genesis 3 you mean the story of Adam and Eve in the garden who all the sudden this character shows up and it's Josh Straley snake yeah yes yeah and the only for an ancient reader whose Minds have all these connections already in the only thing you would know to link it back to
 what the heck is a couple things you would know to link a back to and this will go into this and we have done in previous podcast series like in the firstborn series we did a long meditation on the relationship of the humans in the sky rulers human land ruler Sky rulers and then the snake hear the knock off the last thing in Genesis in the two chapters that come before that you would associate with nakasha are the Tottenham of devices Genesis but like you said this one is not a sea creature correct its own the land on the land yet but I'm just saying the word association knock off a stunning Leviathan these are all ways of referring to the same type of creature a monster of the deep
 well it's good Monday 5 but what the snobbish is going to start doing this I'm not good stuff so if I was if I was an ancient who liked these words were all melted together like what what passage is that in a miss or it's like all three of them are all synonyms of chapter 27 on the sea so if those words are all a bundle and I'm reading Genesis 3 and an Akash comes in my mind I almost imagine this like a dragon a dragon I slithered out of the ocean on to the land it's still kind of Dripping and scaly and Fierce and it's like a
 so what did God say exactly like a beast coming up out of the Sea Beast coming up out of the sound a lot like Daniel and the red lawmakers have a coherent way of thinking it's just different than all so interesting when the snake will win The Knockouts doesn't sing and God curses Tanaka what God says it's because you done this cursed are you more than all the cattle more than every beast of the field
 on your belly you will go and eat dust all the days of your life so I yeah I feel like what I've been taught is the snake was a lizard that turn into a snake lost its legs not slither
 yeah so I think it's evocative many ways because Isaiah is going to meet snakes that are throne room courtiers of God in the Divine throne and Isaiah chapter 6 in a vision in the book of Isaiah chapter 6 in Prophet Israel and he sees what he calls Sarofim with wings surrounding the Divine throne and the word seraf is the word snake another word for saying yes venomous snake really burned for talking about how the Venom feels like a bite you in the Torah and the numbers scroll and other places is the word seraphine snake Okay which were very common way to imagine creatures in Divine throne rooms in the ancient world gyptians to him all the time
 so he was going to be a challenge we have is we have these conversations is symbolic imaginations merge visual symbols with their meanings which means that different-looking visual pictures can you vote the same exact idea and so there's going to be biblical passages and we're going to look at other ancient texts that use similar images and create an actual literal picture in our minds of like wait I thought that one had feet that don't have wings and we're trying to do something that is working against the grain about symbols work so the most important thing about these symbols is the ideas what they represent and the visual images in each individual context will differ so you're saying whether it's a creature in the sea whether it's a creature that scrawled on the land where there is a window
 in the sky these are all the all have a central meaning of connected meanings and the reason why the visual descriptions differ from passage to passage or text text is usually based on the kind of unique context of each what's happening in each one so for example the nausea in the garden is it's a doll and creature clearly the land creature can I have can I imagine it having crawled out of the sea well it somehow related to that tiny the tiny name of day 5 or if it's a wayward son and he just was like I might go cruise up on the land but remember that example stuff in the 7-Day creation narrative the main imagery is of the dark house Waters that represents the Rival of not God's arrival but the Rival of creation the disordered nothingness begin yes
 just water if dark Waters Waters were a common symbol in ancient cosmology for disorder and will be called nothingness and the main visual binary in the 7-Day narrative is out of the waters come the dry land and the garden order and wife order and life in the Dryland Garden is the opposite of darkness and the water's in the Garden of Eden story which begins in Genesis 2 verse 4 it inverts those two images for instead of beginning with a disordered Waters from which land emerges it's exactly the opposite it's disordered wilderness
 from which bit of waters a marriage to plant a garden so both stories end up with the garden but one is land out of water and the other is water out of land and the fact that both of stories are next to each other we're back to it again Michael which one is it which one happened and they're complimentary ways of thinking about the same reality okay so you're saying when we're introduced to the tane and in Genesis one we're using the framework of too much Waters and there's the there's the sea monster and there it's actually part of God's good Christian would talk but it is in the water but it's in the waters we get to Genesis 2 and we're telling the story of creation again not through too much chaos water needs to be ordered but too much Wilderness that needs water to plant a garden yes and then the creature we meet is a snake to snake which are associated with the wilderness
 okay cuz we're out in the wilderness they're going to be crawling around in a rock and come out and get you did yes. This happened to me a few years ago I was on a trip with my family down in Palm Desert area Palm Springs California I want to trail run wild in the Hills South of Palm Springs and it was a switchbacks up a steep steep hill and then I just hit one and just heard the rattle the rattle rattle snake rattle like my body just like
 it was wild why I felt it for hours that surge of energy is eternal in me and some buddies will go and hunt them that you've told me about it we're like trying to get that adrenaline we go find them under rocks and I'm down by their heads and get them
 I never saw it I never saw it I found or I could locate the rocket was under and could see the den and that was all just locked in place hoping I hope it's not close enough to want to strike little see me as a threat anyway so it's a Wilderness creature yeah it's a sneaky hidden dangerous Wilderness Wilderness creatures in the waters of Genesis 1 is the symbolic equivalent of what the na hosh is sneaking out of the Wilderness in the garden motor vehicle in both cases if the chaos creature so when discussion will be having throughout this series as what to call the video so it begins life is just calling it the chaos dragon and I don't know if we could just call it the dragon because it can be a sea dragon warrior
 Wilderness dragon dragon like in modern imagination is a very specific that's Rapture that's right that's horrid and gold in the cave and this seems broader chaos creature is kind of the broadest terms Associated creature and also Lions which restaurant that's a different species altogether in the Psalms lions and snakes are two ways of talking about the same type of creature definitely fits in the same kind of slot as the town in the end of Genesis chapter 1
 so that's a quick survey of the Hebrew Bible there's a lot more passages and we'll look at a lot more but I was just trying to help us want to build in our mind the set of associations and ideas so these are maybe before we move to the New Testament so these are creatures associated with Realms where humans don't fully belong at home or at the ocean LOL yep you can go travel out there but you're in someone else's domain the domain of the creatures these are creatures of the threatening to human life if you get too close to him you know like maybe a whale's isn't probably going to try and crash your ship and last year they have the sailor in the wilderness man stuff will hunt you down
 I think about this we you grew up not far from and we in the Summer's like to go and explore the San Juan Islands and just the island chain in northwest corner of the Avengers coronavirus Wales out there orca whales can work out and I've seen a few pods out there you know when you'd see those creatures and they're very intelligent and they hunt in packs or you just think like everything videos of them like flipping seals around each other it's not my round know that's you're in their territory and we getting these little like hard-shell you no motor boats in life anyway so they're not going to hurt his feelings associated with they belong in a round that's not for humans they're dangerous the maybe not out to get you meet lions are snakes might be protecting themselves
 there is semi hidden there obscured scared I never saw the snake you know when I'm met one and now yeah and your imagination how big was that snake exactly where those fangs dripping with Venom imagination is there they're nocturnal they hunt at night higher than the brush to make their noises at night and if you see him during the day very rare and it's not likely to be your last moments is it well we'll only be seeing the food less at Saucer King David
 that's where is meditating on that's what should evoke in our imaginations semi-hidden hard-to-detect could be out to get you you're not entirely sure you're not sure when it's around it's not and it's in a realm that really isn't like your home that is the cat creature that creature so if we're just looking for the repetition of monster reptilian type of imagery then you won't meet very often in the New Testament except just a handful of places so that's a good example where you when you get to the New Testament these teams are so developed and connected and then in second temple Jewish literature explored that when you get to the New Testament
 you don't actually need to talk about dragons all the time to be talking about dragons to the bricklab when Jesus goes out in the wilderness to be tested by the set on the adversary the address Terry or the Diablos you're supposed to call your mind then Akash of Genesis 3 about the Wilderness there's a creature out there yeah and you tested in relationship to food and in relationship to power and Rule and Authority that's all the things about it if it's in the wilderness and it's you know the status on the accent however and Luke chapter 10 when Jesus sends out a group of seventy disciples to go in Paris and he goes out and he says like it announced the king God heal sick
 invite the poor into your tables and then come back and tell me how it went so Luke 10:17 it says the 70 returned with Joy saying Lord even the demons are subject to us in your name so you in like dark spiritual forces will likely leave and leave people alone when we just say your name
 and Jesus said to them yeah you know I was watching the satin fall from Heaven like lightning like when the kingdom of God Vance has the elevated status of the adversary is brought down to the land so interesting I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy snakes and scorpions you can stomp on we didn't read this in Genesis 3 that against sound like
 what God Said to The Knockouts in Genesis 3 which was you going to go on your belly you read that and one day there's going to be a seed from the woman at the ascendant who's going to crush you on the head while you strike him on the hill so you're going to get stepped on by a human while also getting a strike in on that human and it seems like Jesus does alluding to that saying like Hey listen I did some snakes dumping out in the wilderness and I sent you out in my name and so you have my authority to start putting some pressure on that snake's head but he joined snakes and scorpions and he Blends that with demons yes that's exactly right so chill Powers yes that's why I have been thinking in those terms I've been thinking about like you know God when I think of all the creatures that God created I don't think of Spiritual Beings so a sea monster and let thinking when I should be
 book about sea monsters a spiritual being we should definitely see Spiritual Beings as a part of God's creation book called the host of Heaven okay well I guess I'll be up there the creatures that are in the sky in the sky yeah so the question is what am I supposed to think when I think of the tiny and this will be our next conversation cuz then I mean the Leviathan These Are Spiritual Beings in the imagination of the their gods to bless the form that category in our next conversation but Jesus fix it for granted that Spiritual Beings in Rebellion against God can be referred to with the imagery of snakes and scorpions and so this helps us make sense of why at the conclusion of Paul's letter to the Romans seal say
 Romans 16 Verse 22 God of Peace will soon crush the Satan under y'all's feet the grace of God be with you 3:15 brain but in the place of the seed of the woman's crushing the head of the people following following Jesus who crushed the Sutton under their feet not interesting and then the most famous dragon in the New Testament possibly in the whole Bible is in the Revelation the apocalypse chapter 12 the last book in the Bible and it's a symbolic dream Vision that he has and it's a woman clothed with the Sun
 the moon under her feet and she wears a crown of twelve Stars so that really means something she cries out in labor and gives birth, but then he sees a huge red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on seven heads and his tail Swept Away a third of the stars of Heaven through them down to the land in the dragon stood right in front of the woman about to give birth so that you could eat her child when I
 it's about the seed of the woman whose versus the snake through the woman's being born vision is a dramatization of Genesis 3 15 stops daily between the women in the snake in the seats think she gave birth to a son a male child who is to rule the nations with a rod of iron Bible trivia
 what was that from this from Psalm to ruling the nations with a rod of iron but her child was snatched up to God and to the throne
 and the woman went into the Wilderness to a place prepared by God to be there for 1260 days
 what's half of 7 years and now there's a conflict in the skies with Michael and his angels Waging War against the dragons and dragon has has a nose Waging War but not strong enough no place for them was found in heaven so the Great Dragon was thrown down that Serpent of old who was called the diabolus and the set on the Flandreau SD hablas men that's the times the adversary he deceives the whole world he was thrown down his angels were thrown down with him and I heard a loud voice and Heaven saying now salvation the power of the kingdom of our God the authorities has Messiah has come for the accuser another term now for have the accuser of our siblings has been thrown down the one who accuses them before God damn night
 so the Satan the Devil the serpent dragon
 yeah okay so whatever that means it's somehow bringing all the themes together yeah in a way that supposed to make you feel satisfied
 in some way it's somewhere I'm so there be dragons that was my main point here yes loud and clear dragons in the Bible I have many questions good so then I guess we're going to just go back through and really just start digging into all of these occurrences ideas but not the next step Next Step we've been trying to build up an association of ideas feelings images around the chaos creature by looking at all these texts when I next want to do is try and do like a time travel and get inside the mind of an ancient Israelite an ancient Babylonian and ancient Canaanite and what ideas stories experiences came into their minds when they heard stories about a deity slaying or confronting sea dragon
 building of Kingdom on a mountain over the nation's as a result was a widespread cultural story in so many ancient cultures so what the biblical authors are doing is that they're actually deploying well-worn images and storylines for putting those images in the service of the more unique set of ideas and claims about God and reality in good and evil in humans but they're doing it this language is a cross-cultural language in the ancient world of mountains and Dragons to do a survey of the dragon-slaying combat myth in the ancient world cool that'll help us see how these images pop even more uniquely in in the biblical story
pics of listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue discussing the dragon will set some contacts for how the Bible thinks about the dragon by looking at how ancient Israel contemporary neighbors also had a crack and meth the dragon is a symbol for chaos disorder anti creation so we're going to look at is the dragon combat meth in ancient near Eastern culture and literature and their this monster is primarily a sea dragon today's episode was brought to you by our podcast producer Cooper pelts associate producer going to be under lead editor Dan Gumball editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey mixed this episode and Hannah woo provided the invitations for our annotated podcast in our app additional music and sound design for this series were written and composed by Bible project staff Bible project the crowdfunding nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to
