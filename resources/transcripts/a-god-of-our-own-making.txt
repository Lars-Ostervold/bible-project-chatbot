Jon Hi, this is Jon at the BibleProject. Last week we began a new series 
looking at two important verses in the Hebrew Bible. It’s in the book of 
Exodus 34:6-7, and it goes, “Yahweh, Yahweh, a God compassionate 
and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loyal love and faithfulness, 
maintaining love for thousands, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin. 
Yet, He does not leave the guilty and punished, bringer of iniquity to 
the children and their children to the third and fourth generation.”
 Last week, we looked at this tension in this verse, how God is both slow 
to anger but also full of justice. This week we’re going to unpack the 
narrative in which these verses are found. God has just rescued His 
people Israel from slavery. Now they’re out in the wilderness and God 
is establishing a covenant relationship with them at a mountain called 
Sinai. Moses goes up and down the mountain to meet with God seven 
different times, mediating this covenant relationship. The covenant terms 
are summarized in famous Ten Commandments. The first of which is to 
worship Yahweh alone, and the second, not to create any idle images.
Tim Exodus 24 ends with Moses going up the mountain to kind of seal the 
deal, to tell God, like, “Yeah, the people are going to do it, we’re going 
to do this, we’re going to be your covenant people.” So he goes up. And 
the whole thing is the people just said, “We’ll accept these vows. We’re 
going to get married. It’s going to be awesome.” This is the very next thing 
that is going to happen in the narrative. Exodus 32:1 is where the story 
picks up and it’s where everything starts to go terribly, terribly wrong. 
Jon Down at the base of the mountain, Israel decides that they’re going to make 
an idol statue. They pull together all the gold that they have and they create 
a statue in the image of calf, and say, “This is Yahweh.” They’re breaking the 
very first covenant vow while Moses is still establishing the relationship.
Tim The point of the golden calf narrative is to say God’s purposes have 
always been to work out His plan in the world through a covenant 
people. Problem—that covenant people from the moment He married 
them have not wanted to be married to the real Him. The people A God of Our Own Making Character of God E2

00:02:00  2through whom God wants to rule the world are unfaithful from the 
beginning. In Jewish tradition, in Jewish interpretation, Jewish scholars 
view the golden calf story as Israel’s Genesis 3 kind of fall narrative.
Jon This brutally honest story about the origin of the covenant relationship 
between Israel and their God sets the stage for how Israel will continue 
to wrestle with God throughout their entire story. As we take in the story, 
we’ll see how, just like Israel, we try to remake God in an image that suits 
us and these attributes of God of been compassionate and gracious, slow 
to anger, abounding in loyal love and faithfulness, they’ll begin to take 
a new shape and a new meaning. Thanks for joining us. Here we go. 
 Okay, here we go. We’re talking about Exodus 34:6-7, two verses in the 
Hebrew Bible that are quoted and re-quoted in different ways more than 
any other part of the Bible by biblical authors. Again, with us is Tim, of 
course, and then also along with us for this whole series is Carissa.
Carissa  Hi Jon.  
Tim Hello.
Carissa  Hi Tim. 
Tim Here we all are in our separate homes. Again, still quarantined.
Jon Still quarantined.
Tim Or whatever term. There are so many different terms. Staying at home.
Jon Sheltered.
Tim Shelter in place. Anyway.
Carissa  Hibernating. 
Tim Totally.
Jon So we’re recording this in April—the world has stopped—but these 
conversations will come out in the fall and we have no idea what fall 
is going to be like. But you do, you listening to this. So don’t spoil 
it for us. We talked last week when we read these two verses. 
Tim I’ll just read them again. Exodus 34:6-7. “Yahweh, Yahweh, a God 
compassionate and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loyal 
love and faithfulness, a keeper of loyal love for thousands, forgiver of 
iniquity, transgression, and sin. Yet, He will surely not declare innocent 
the guilty, visitor of the iniquity of fathers upon the sons and upon the 
sons of sons to the third and the fourth generation.” Exodus 34:6-7. 00:03:00
00:04:00
00:05:00  3Jon The first part of that verse is really nice and quotable. Tim, you 
actually showed us too that the first half of the verse is the most re-
quoted part of these verses. Or I should say the first of the two verses 
is the most requoted, and it’s those five attributes of God. Those 
five attributes are what we’re going to get after in the subsequent 
episodes. The God goodies as you put it, these really lovely attributes 
of God that you would want in really any friend or companion.
 But then the second part of these two verses gets intense about God 
He won’t clear the guilty. Like, “Don’t get so used to the fact that I’m 
a nice guy. I’m not going ro clear the guilty. And not only that, but 
I’m going to be that way for every generation that follows.” There’s a 
consistency. We talked about the consistency to God’s character there.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. So there’s these balancing halves. There’s God’s 
overwhelming generosity and mercy and loyal love. This is about His 
eternal commitment to stick by His promises. However, that doesn’t mean 
that He’s just going to overlook or ignore generations of His covenant 
people that violate the covenant or rebel, or act in ways where they don’t 
deal faithfully with God and neighbor. So however many generations 
rebel, He will bring justice on them, but eternally for thousands. He 
will always respond with mercy and compassion, implied, not stated 
explicitly, but implied if any of those generations, or any people in 
the generations turned towards Him. I think that’s the basic idea.
Jon Cool. What we want to do in this episode was jump in to where in the 
narrative of the Bible this proclamation about God takes place? 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. Why does God say these words to Moses when 
Moses is like hiding in a cave on top of Mount Sinai? How did he get 
there? And why is he there? And why is God saying this to him now? 
Jon Moses is on top of a mountain in a cave?
Carissa  Should we talk through just the broader narrative of 
Exodus? What’s happening in that whole story?
Tim Yeah.
Jon Good. I like the idea of the opening scene. Like, how 
did they get there? Then let’s back up. 
Tim Yeah, reverse engineer?
Carissa  No, it’s a good question. Why in a cave with 
Moses asking, “Show me your glory?”
Tim Yeah, that’s right.00:06:00
00:07:00  4Carissa  Taken out of context, that kind of feels like, “Oh, can I do that?” Or “Why is 
he doing that? I think it’s an important question. What’s the literary context?
Tim Yeah. It’s the goal that I the reader go find the mountain, cut a hole 
up in and ask God to show me His glory. Is that the point here? I don’t 
think that is the point, actually. Oh, because there is somebody who 
tried that in the Bible. His name is Elijah. He went to the top of the 
same mountain and asked God to put on the same show again. And 
God did not cooperate that time. But that’s a whole nother story.
Jon Wait, is that the story where it’s like a whisper and stuff?
Tim Yes, yeah. There is a storm and a wind or earthquake but God wasn’t 
appearing in any of those things. He appears the opposite in that 
story of how He appeared to Moses. And what He tells Elijah is that 
he’s being relieved of his duties and to go anoint his replacement. 
But that’s a whole other story. This story is so awesome. 
Section Break
Tim So Exodus 34 is the final chapter. The immediate literary unit that the scene 
is in when God says these words is in a three-chapter episode that goes 
from Exodus 32 to 34. And it’s the famous golden calf story, where Israel 
makes golden calf. But why is Israel making a golden calf at the foot of 
the mountain? To understand that you need to go broader than to a whole 
section of Exodus that began at chapter 19 when they came to Mount Sinai. 
But why are they at Mount Sinai? To get there you have to go all the way to 
chapter 1 of Exodus. Now I have made it way too large. But I think it’s helpful.
Carissa  Here, I’ll summarize really fast. Okay. At the beginning of the book of 
Exodus, the Israelites are in Egypt. They’re oppressed by foreign rulers, 
God hears their cries and promises to bring them up out of Egypt to be 
with them. And there’s that huge emphasis on knowing Yahweh. And 
that’s what He does. He brings them out in a miraculous way through 
the water, so that they and others wouldn’t know that he’s God. Then all 
seems to be going well. And this is when they come to Mount Sinai?
Tim Well, there’s a couple of hints. There’s a couple of hints of 
like they’re grumbling in the wilderness on the way.
Carissa  Yeah, there’s grumbling. And that is interesting because 
the people grumble and God provides, and they grumble 
and God provides. Almost like it’s foreshadowing.
Tim I mean, they don’t do anything too terrible, they just don’t trust the 
God that just delivered them. There’s some stories where they begin 00:08:00
00:09:00
00:10:00  5to introduce complications leading up to a bigger complication. And 
it’s only after you get into the story and you see that it all went terrible 
that you go back to those earlier parts and be like, “Oh, yeah.”
Jon You’re speaking of the Israelites leaving Egypt. 
This is Passover week right now, isn’t it?
Carissa  Yeah, for us.
Jon Real-time?
Tim Yeah. We’re in the 24 window of the Passover. That’s right. 
Jon This isn’t going to matter so much to people in the future but 
it’s really interesting that people doing Passover are having 
to do it during quarantine and figure that all out. Huh?
Tim Yeah.
Jon It makes it more visceral to where like...I actually read someone talks 
about how they’re praying for the plague to not hit their house.
Carissa  Yeah, that is interesting.
Jon That’s part of the story. Thank you, Carissa, for that. Can we even 
back up even further? Because in the book before, in Genesis, God 
chooses this family that ends up in slaved, and Moses is going to 
talk about that. Like, “God, you chose this family, you promised 
to make this family a great nation that will bless the world.”
Tim That’s right. These people that you rescued is the descendants 
of Abraham that God made a covenant promise to. You’re right. 
Because that’s going to come up in the golden calf story. In a way, 
what, Carissa, you just summarized is the first half of Exodus. And 
it’s kind of the first main block. It starts in Egypt. You go out of 
Egypt through the wilderness to the foot of the mountain. 
Carissa  Like maybe up until Exodus 19, and then Moses goes up on the mountain. 
Tim So what’s interesting, and the story actually signals this, that the 
beginning of Exodus 19 is the beginning of a new kind of large literary 
unit that set at the mountain. Because Exodus 19:1 begins with a summary 
and a date, actually, which are often ways that literary units begin is 
with a date introduction. So Exodus 19:1. “In the third month after the 
sons of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt...” That’s chapters 1 
through 18, “...on that very day they came to the wilderness of Sinai. 
When they went out from Rephidim...” that’s the wilderness that they 
were just in in chapters 15 through 17. “...they came to the wilderness of 
Sinai and they camped in the wilderness in front of the mountain.”00:12:0000:11:00  6 They’re going to camp at this mountain for a year and they’re going to 
leave this mountain not in the end of Exodus, not in Leviticus, not until 
Numbers 10. So they’re going to be here for a lot of text in the Torah. 
But specifically, chapter 19 on through the end of Exodus 40 is one big 
literary unit of the first kind of main thing that happens at Mount Sinai. 
Carissa  And that seems like the really significant things in there are the 
Ten Commandments and the tabernacle instructions.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. What God says right after these words to introduce Exodus 
19 is God says, “Hey, listen. I redeemed you. Listen to my voice and keep my 
covenant. And if you do that, you’ll be my special possession, a kingdom 
of priests to all the nations.” So we’re back to that promise to Abraham 
here. What we learned is, oh, God is going to enter into a covenant with 
these people. I wonder what that’s going to look like. And what you just 
said, Carissa, it looks like the Ten Commandments is like the most dense 
form. And then there’s going to be about...I forget the number. I think forty-
two commandments to follow, just in this scene in the book of Exodus.
 So God gives the Ten commandments and forty-two more. I’m pretty sure 
it’s 42. After that, at the end of chapter 24...think of it like a marriage. It’s 
sort of like God proposed to the family the moment they camp out, and 
people say, “Yes, we’re going to do it.” “Ten commandments?” “Yes, we 
totally will do it.” So Exodus 24 ends with Moses going up the mountain 
to kind of seal the deal—to tell God, like, “Yeah, the people are going to 
do it. We’re going to do this. We’re going to be your covenant people.”
 So this is the scene at the end of Exodus 24. Moses went up the mountain 
in verse 15 of Exodus 24 and a divine cloud covered the mountain. And 
the glory. There’s the glory of God. It rested on Mount Sinai, a cloud 
covered it six days, and on the seventh day, God called Moses from 
the middle of the cloud. And the eyes of the sons of Israel to their 
eyes, the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire 
on the mountain. And Moses went into the cloud, as he went up the 
mountain, and he was on the mountain forty days and forty nights. 
Jon That’s a long time.
Tim Dude, it’s a long time. Forty days and nights. 
Jon These are important numbers, obviously. Seven and forty.
Tim Also, the cloud covered it for six days, and then on the seventh day, 
he went into the cloud. We’re told in that same verse 16 that the 
glory of God was resting up there. Do you get it? It’s a good one.
Jon Like God rested on the seventh day, you mean?00:15:0000:13:00
00:14:00  7Tim Yes. As if the glory of God Sabbath on this mountain, Moses 
wait six days, and on the seventh, he goes up into God’s 
rest on the mountain. That’s totally what’s going on.
Jon He goes to rest with God in the mountain.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. It’s like we got Genesis 1 on the brain here. For sure. 
So he goes up. And the whole thing is the people just said, “We’ll accept 
these vows. We’re going to get married. It’s going to be awesome.” This is 
the very next thing (00:16:00) that is going to happen in the narrative. 
Jon Oh, yeah. Now they got forty days to rethink it. 
Tim Totally. That’s right. What follows is seven divine speeches. 
Jon Can you imagine, by the way, if you were like in a wedding, and 
it’s like you did the part of the ceremony, and then you take like a 
forty-day break to decide if you want to go through with it?
Tim Totally. That’s right. The camera shifts from here and it goes into the 
cloud. And the cameras on Yahweh and Moses in the cloud and Yahweh 
speaks seven times and he reveals the blueprints for the tabernacle. 
In a way you could see this whole section is God says, “Hey, let’s get 
married.” The marriage ceremony. And then Moses goes up to get 
the plans for where Israel and God are going to move in together. 
They get married, then they are going to make plans to build a house 
together. Exodus chapter 32:1 is where the story picks up, and it’s 
where everything starts to go terribly, terribly wrong. That’s the kind 
of the narrative context. So it may be worth reading just the opening 
sentence of Exodus 32. You, Carissa, do you want to do that?
Carissa  Okay. “Now, when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down 
from the mountain, the people assembled about Aaron and said to him, 
‘Come, make us a god who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man 
who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has 
become of him.’ Aaron said to them, ‘Tear off the gold rings which are in 
the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring them to 
me.’ Then all the people tore off the gold rings, which were in their ears 
and brought them to Aaron. He took this from their hand and fashioned 
it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf. And he said, ‘This 
is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’ 
Now, when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it. And Aaron made 
a proclamation and said, ‘Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.’ So the 
next day, they rose early and offered burnt offerings and brought peace 
offerings, and the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.” 
Tim Dance party. 00:17:00
00:18:0000:16:00  8Jon We talked about this, Tim. I think we ( unintelligible ). That 
wordplay, it’s talking about something more than just...
Tim Well, the core root of it is the word root of Isaac’s 
name. Yitzhak, which means to laugh.
Carissa  Like to jest around. 
Tim Yeah. 
Jon NIV says indulge in revelry.
Tim Totally. It’s not child’s play kind of scene. It involves physical 
touching. It’s the kind of play that involves physical touching. This 
is interesting. There’s a story in the book of Genesis 26, where a guy 
named Yitzhak, whose name means ‘he will play’ or ‘he will laugh’.
Carissa  Isaac. 
Tim  Mm hmm. And he lies about his wife. He goes into a city and he’s afraid 
that somebody is going to kill him and take her. So he says that she’s not 
his wife. That’s his strange way of protecting himself. But then the leader 
of the city looks out a window one morning, and we’re told that Isaac was 
playing with Rivkah (Rebecca) his wife. It’s his name. But you know, he’s 
not just like telling a joke. That’s the point here. It’s like snuggle time.
 So whatever the people are doing, there seems to be something. Either 
they’re having a dance party, or you can look at a bunch of other uses of 
sahak. It seems like there is some kind of sexual connotation. And that’s 
certainly how this was understood in the history of Jewish interpretation. 
Jon One thing I never noticed before...I can’t believe I didn’t notice 
this. I thought they were building a golden calf to replace 
Yahweh. But they’re here saying, “No, this is Yahweh.”
Carissa  Yeah, they called it Yahweh.
Tim No, that’s totally right. That’s right.
Jon I never saw that. 
Carissa  You know what’s really interesting about that, too? Is that it seems like it’s 
a reflection on the Ten Commandments, which they just heard Yahweh 
speak from a fiery cloud, both don’t make gods before me, don’t make 
them out of gold or don’t make anything in the image of an animal, like 
a calf. But then also, what about don’t take up the name of Yahweh in 
vain or to the empty thing? It almost seems like this is an example of 
taking the name of Yahweh and appropriating it to this other thing. 
Tim Oh, yeah.00:20:0000:19:0000:18:16  9Carissa  Do you think that’s right? 
Tim Interesting.
Carissa  It just seems to go through the Ten Commandments so clearly 
made me wonder if that one is connected in this way.
Tim So the first thing you drew attention to was don’t have any other gods, it 
says, “Before my face.” This is from the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20. 
“Don’t make an idol or any image of anything in the skies above on the land 
or the waters under the earth.” What it doesn’t clarify is are these images of 
Yahweh that are prohibited only or is it images of other gods too? Well, the 
next line is “don’t bow down to them, don’t serve them for I Yahweh I’m a 
passionate God. And then don’t carry the name of Yahweh your God in vain.”
 It doesn’t explicitly only address issue of other gods. The idol could 
represent Yahweh or it could represent other gods. So that’s the first 
thing. Because you’re right, Jon. What they saying is that this golden 
calf is Yahweh. And then Carissa, that’s interesting about carrying the 
name. We just had this conversation with Carmen Imes in real-time 
recently. And I guess whenever this releases that won’t be have been 
recently. What she’s advocating is the phrase “to carry the name” 
means when God’s people represent Him by having their name upon 
them, so to speak. But this is almost an inversion where it is they are 
acting as if this piece of metal is also now a carrier of the name, which 
is of course idolatry. I think that might be the inversion of it there. 
Carissa  That’s interesting. 
Tim Yeah, Jon that’s a good observation. 
Jon Well, I mean, it’s much worse, it seems like in my mind, to say, “Okay, well, 
Moses is up there. We’re tired of waiting. Let’s just create a new god.” 
And for whatever reason, that was always the template in my mind it’s 
what they’re doing they’re creating a new god. But what they’re doing 
is they’re saying, “Okay, that’s taking too long. Let’s create this idol that 
is Yahweh and we can just get started. Let’s get the party started.”
Carissa  Almost just let’s do it in our own way. 
Jon Let’s do it in our own way.
Carissa  Same God but let’s do it the way we want to do it.
Jon And God gets really mad about that. And I can understand, but it seems 
less understandable than creating a new god for some reason to me.
Tim You’re saying His angry response is less understandable if they’re 
making a totally different god. Is that what you’re saying?00:22:0000:21:00  10Jon It’s less understandable if they’re making a god for Him.
Tim To represent Him?
Jon “We’re on Team Yahweh but we want to just get started. We just want to go.”
Tim Interesting. 
Jon So the best thing we know how is create the idol and then we can 
start the revelries. It seems like it may be an obvious...help me out.
Tim I was having the opposite response, thinking, “Oh, yeah, this actually 
explains better why God’s response is so severe.” What happened was, 
God came and he appeared to the people. We didn’t talk about this, but He 
invited all of them to come up on the mountain back in chapter 19 and 20. 
He said, “Listen, I’m going to show up. It’s going to be intense. And when 
you hear the ram’s horn blast on the third day, the people to go up onto the 
mountain. The ram’s horn blast and the people stand back and they’re afraid, 
and they shudder, and they say, “Moses, you go.” So Moses goes up alone. 
 It’s clear that the people have a relationship to Yahweh that’s uncomfortable 
for them already. But now we’re 40 days into it, there’s a storm up there. 
And that storm up there is Yahweh somehow? And now Moses has 
gone? This doesn’t make any sense. I think that’s the image here. 
Jon “So let’s do this on our own terms.”
Tim Yeah. The idea is, I don’t know how to handle smoking mountain fire 
God who calls our leader away, and now He’s gone. You know what we 
do have categories for? Idols. Because these are gods that we can make 
and we can handle them and we know how to feed them and throw 
parties for them.” This is like, “We know how to do this. This is normal.”
Jon Well, how much more intense is this story then for...I mean, if you’re 
saying, “I want to follow Yahweh,” how easy is it to suddenly go, “But 
I’m going to do it in a way that more understandable to me?”
Carissa  That is easy.
Jon That is super easy. 
Tim You’ve done that already today? 
Jon I probably have done it today. 
Tim Me too. 
Carissa  Well, I don’t know, Jon. I think there are other things, there are other literary 
clues in the text that this is really bad and egregious because what they say, 
“this is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt,” 00:25:0000:24:0000:23:00  11the whole book up until this point is all about Yahweh saying, “I’m going 
to bring them up, I’m going to dwell among them so that they will know 
that I’m Yahweh.” So it just seems like part of the plot that what Yahweh 
really wants is for His people to know Him. And then they do the very 
opposite thing and use the same words for it. I don’t know. It seems like a 
reflection on that and also a reflection. I thought this was really interesting. 
 When Aaron says, “Tear off the gold rings in the ears of your wives 
and bring them to me,” that same word “gold rings in the ears of your 
wives” are what is used for the tabernacle construction. So these are 
the things that the people are supposed to be using to build the place 
where God dwells. And instead, they’re building this other thing.
Tim Yeah, that’s a good one. 
Carissa  So yeah, I think there’s more. Oh, and the feast, burnt offerings and peace 
offerings are three things that God says right after the Ten Commandments 
to do for Him and to build an altar for Him. So these are like intentional 
repetitions showing they’re doing the opposite. So it seems like there’s more.
Jon They’re going to build an altar but in front of the calf.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. It’s a contrast between the real Yahweh 
who’s unpredictable, and scary, an other, and He reveals 
Himself to us in the wilderness. There’s all these things are 
kind of stacking up. And He requires that we trust Him.
Carissa  Yeah, maybe that’s the biggest thing. 
Tim You can’t pin Him down, this is Yahweh. And He trumped on Egypt, 
all right and protected us, but they don’t have a handle on this 
Yahweh. And this is the first time people make an idol in the Bible it’s 
of people wanting to replace who God really is with some version of 
Yahweh that is more manageable. “Okay, now I can work with this 
Yahweh. And let this be the Yahweh that will lead us out of here.”
Jon Show me one spiritual community that hasn’t 
domesticated God in some way.
Tim Oh, totally. I mean, that’s surely the point here. The point of the golden calf 
narrative is to say God’s purposes have always been to work out His plan in 
the world through a covenant people. Problem. That covenant people from 
the moment He married them have not wanted to be married to the real Him.
Jon Mid ceremony.
Tim Mid ceremony. This is important strategy in the storyline of the Torah and 
the Prophets to say that all this is is the Adam and Eve story design pattern. 00:27:0000:26:00  12The people through whom God wants to rule the world are unfaithful from 
the beginning, which then creates a plot tension. Whatever God’s going to 
have to do, He’s going to have to now not just fix the world, but fix His own 
covenant people. And this is like the plot tension driving the Bible here.
Carissa  So maybe then, Jon you’re right, that when we look at this it’s supposed 
to be a reflection on us. It’s like the human situation. This is what humans 
do. So then we have to keep reading to see how God responds.
Jon Yeah. Well, it’s funny because when I read it as terms of their 
creating another god, I kind of felt a little removed from in a way. 
Now that I’m reading through that lens, I’m like, “Oh, man.”
Tim In Jewish tradition, in Jewish interpretation, Jewish scholars view the 
golden calf story as Israel’s Genesis 3 kind of fall narrative. Listen 
to this. This is a line that developed about the golden calf that I 
thought was fascinating. This is in the Babylonian Talmud. “There is 
no punishment that comes upon the world that doesn’t have at least 
one twenty fourth of a part of the punishment for the golden calf.” 
Jon I’m confused. What does that mean?
Tim Okay. Let me read a parallel saying. This is from a book called Midrash 
Rabba on Exodus. “There is not a generation of Israel that doesn’t 
suffer at least a particle of punishment for the sin of the golden 
calf. In other words, in Jewish tradition, what happened here...
Jon It’s like original sin.
Tim Yes, exactly. Exactly right. So any generation of Israel, or in the Talmud, 
any generation of humanity that something terrible happens, at least one 
little tiny bit of that is because of what happened at the golden calf. 
Jon Yeah. It’s the way we think of the fall narrative in Genesis 
3. Behind everything is that first inclination.
Tim Yeah, that’s right. To replace the real God with a God that I can handle and 
that ultimately is made in my own image. It’s my own fabrication. Actually, 
there is a meaningful interplay here with Genesis 1 and 2 because the 
creature that they make is not an even a human. It’s an animal. Something 
less than human. So they are making the thing that they say is superior to 
them and will lead them and what it is, is something that actually should 
be ruled by them according to the image of God. Right? The animals.
Jon Yeah.00:29:00
00:30:0000:28:00  13Tim Meanwhile, the one human that is faithful to God is up there, and he’s 
going to come down glowing when he comes down. Anyway.
Jon Well, speaking of which...
Tim Speaking of which camera shift in verse seven and it goes up to Moses. 
And really what it is, is Yahweh. The camera goes back up the mountain, 
and it is Yahweh who says to Moses, “Go down the mountain at once?” 
This is good. He says, “For your people have corrupted themselves, your 
people that you brought up out of the land of Egypt, they have quickly 
turned away from the way that I’ve commanded them. They have made 
for themselves the golden calf and bowed down to it, they’ve offered 
sacrifices to it, and they have said, “This is your God of Israel who brought 
you up out of the land of Egypt.” Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these 
people, they are people that have a stiff neck. So then...” This verse 10. “...
give me nuah’.” It’s no as name as a verb. “Give me rest, that my anger 
may burn, and I will destroy them and I will make you a great nation.”
Jon “You” referring to Moses?
Tim Yes. You, Moses, singular, I will make you into a great nation. 
We’ll start over. You’ll become a new Abraham. This thing about 
Noah’s name is the wordplay. Because when you give somebody 
rest, if you’re giving them rest from distress, that’s a good thing. 
But give me rest like I need a break from you. Go away. In fact, 
that’s how most English translations translate it, don’t they? 
Jon I need some alone time.
Tim I need some alone time. New American Standard has “Leave me alone.” 
What Moses goes on to do is not leave God alone. He starts to intercede 
for the people. What he ends up doing is bringing rests to God but 
by interceding for the people. It’s very, very interesting. Carissa, you 
brought up, I think in this episode, that Moses objected five times to...
Jon Oh, that’s the last episode. 
Carissa  It might have been the last. But yeah, that he resisted five times. 
When God first spoke to him and called him to bring the people 
out of Egypt, yeah, five times he says, “No, I can’t do that.”
Tim Where was he standing? He’s up on this mountain. So Moses, last 
time he bargained with God on this mountain, it was five excuses to 
get out of having to lead the people. Now he finds himself standing in 
the same spot and he engages in five acts of intercession. In chapter 
32, all of 33, and then 34 he intercedes five times. This is so cool. We 
don’t have time to go into it. But he kind of incrementally gets God to 00:31:00
00:32:00
00:33:00  14forgive the people. And he works in steps towards the ultimate goal. The 
two verses that we’re looking at Exodus 34:6-7 come right in between 
the fourth and the fifth acts of intercession. Isn’t that interesting?
Carissa  Yeah. Do you think that they’re part of God’s response to 
Moses that when Moses is asking...he’s interceding but he’s 
asking to know God, that this is God’s response?
Tim Yeah, that’s right. The fourth act of intercession is “Show me your 
glory.” Because what God just said is, “Listen...” Earlier, he said, “I’m 
not going to go with you. I will forgive the people. I will continue my 
covenant with them.” He finally gets God to say that after his third act 
of intercession. But what he says is “But I’m not going to go with you. 
I’m just going to send an angel. An angel will lead you up.” And Moses 
says, “No, your glory has to go with us or else the whole plan falls apart 
because your presence is the only thing that makes us different than 
the other nations.” And then he says to God, “Show me your glory.”
Section Break
Jon  So can we pause? I mean, it is strange, and we’ve talked about 
this interaction with Moses and God before, but just to put on the 
table again, Moses is trying to convince God to be faithful. Well, 
God is saying, “I’ll start over with you, Moses.” So in that way, 
it’s kind of him being faithful to His promise to Abraham.
Carissa  Yeah, He uses the words from that promise. “I’ll 
make you a great nation” from Genesis 12. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. Well, that would involve, in this case, destroying 
all of the tribes of Israel. Which, you know, I guess if God only 
made His promise to Abraham, you’d be cool. But He then also 
said Isaac and to Jacob, who’s the father of these 12 tribes, 
“This is the seed through which I’m going to do my thing.”
Jon So it’s just weird that Moses has to be...five times he has to do this with God. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right.
Jon There’s something really important here that I don’t fully 
appreciate, which is to be the intercessor did Moses’ role.
Tim Well, in this first act of intercession is the foundational one. The first thing 
Moses says is, “First of all, don’t do this, God. Don’t destroy the people 
and cancel the covenant. First of all, the Egyptians will hear about it and 
your reputation among the nations will really...your ratings will go down 
big time because they’re going to think that you’re inconsistent.”00:36:0000:34:00
00:35:33  15Carissa  He knows that that’s something that God’s concerned about. Because 
even through the whole Exodus, he says, “So that the Egyptians 
would know that I’m God.” So now He’s bringing it back up.
Tim Yeah. You showed yourself to be a certain way to rescue these people. 
And now you’re just going to destroy them? I haven’t thought of this 
until our last conversation. He wants to prevent Yahweh from being 
viewed as inconsistent. Don’t you think that’s what’s underneath it?
Carissa  Yeah, that’s interesting. He doesn’t want the Egyptians to 
say, “With evil, with ra intent He brought them out.” 
Tim In other words, he doesn’t want people to think, “Well, Yahweh 
nice in some moments, but then He will destroy you in the next 
moment and for no good reason,” or “Yeah, He changes how He 
deals with you.” That’s one reason. The second reason he says is, 
“Remember, Abraham, Isaac in Israel that you made a promise to, 
you swore an oath, saying...” and then he quotes the promise that 
He made to them. A multiplied descendants, give them the land.
Carissa  You know what’s interesting about that promise, though, is that you 
know how God had said to Moses, “I’ll make you a great nation” from 
Genesis 12, He made that promise just to Abraham individual when 
he was telling him, “Leave your people and your country.” And now 
when Moses is saying back to him, “No, remember your promise was 
to Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Jacob’s other name, and it’s all about the 
descendants.” So he’s highlighting a different part of that promise. 
 He is highlighting not just the context of when God says, I’ll make you 
a great nation, Moses is just when Abraham’s leaving his family and his 
people, which is kind of what God’s asking him to do. But then Moses 
is saying, “No, the promise is for all of the descendants. You said you 
would give them the land and they would inherit it forever.” That’s from 
Genesis 15 and 20. Or maybe more 22. So it’s like a different aspect 
of that promise that it’s made to all the descendants, not just me. 
Tim That’s right. Jon, we have talked about this part before. That what Moses is 
doing is he’s asking Yahweh to change what he said he’s going to do in this 
moment by remaining faithful to what He said He would do and in the past.
Jon Right. 
Tim That’s an important part of this here is that he’s actually not getting 
God to do something that God didn’t want to do already. He’s 
asking God to change in relation to judgment or punishment in 
order to fulfill what He said He was going to do earlier. That there’s 
something really important in the tension between those two in this 00:39:0000:37:00
00:38:00  16very moment. It’s as if God’s purpose to work in the world through 
humans signs God up automatically for these kinds of situations.
Jon Yes, I get that. And I think I’ve even said a bit irreverently, like, what a 
dumb move for God to partner with humans. But let’s run with that. My 
expectation would be then God would say to Moses like, “Yeah, I’m used 
to this. This happens all the time, Moses. I’ll tell you what I’m going to do.” 
And just cut to the chase. Why this back and forth and intercession?
Tim Yeah. Well, maybe we’re to this portrait of Yahweh as a being with 
complex emotions. I don’t know. I mean, He’s hurt, He’s angry. This is 
the same Yahweh that comes out, especially in the Prophet Hosea, 
where he talks about being like a wounded husband and a wounded 
father, who’s just like an emotional wreck over his kids. I mean, it’s very 
passionate, emotional language that God uses to describe Himself. 
 But also actually, we’re leading up to the moment when God’s going 
to say...Exodus 34:6-7, and the first two words in that that Carissa and 
I are both doing it individually, compassion is a deep emotional word. 
Carissa, you’ve done more work on it than I have up to this point.
Carissa  Yeah. It’s like the compassion of a mother or father for their tiny child. 
Jon This is the story really portrays a very emotive God.
Tim So here’s what’s interesting. God responds to Moses’ first act of 
intercession by saying, “Okay, I won’t destroy them.” That’s what 
Moses accomplished in the moment. “I won’t destroy them.” Actually, 
this was a scholar Harman ( unintelligible ) who pointed this out. 
God doesn’t tell Moses what the people have done yet. Moses is up 
there interceding for the people not actually knowing what they’ve 
done yet. All he knows is something terrible has happened.
 So Moses goes down, and then he gets angry. So God was angry, Moses 
intercedes but Moses still doesn’t know. When he goes down, and he sees 
what they did, he gets angry, and he shatters the tablets. He grinds the 
statue into powder and makes the people drink it. Which I think I actually 
understand now what’s going on there. We won’t go down that rabbit hole. 
 Then what he does is he calls the Levi it’s to himself and tells them to arm 
themselves with swords. And then he sends them to go out in the camp 
and execute, presumably, all the people who were the instigators of the 
idol, which is three thousand. So some people feel a contradiction there. 
Wait, I thought God just said he was not going to do that but then Moses 
goes down and a bunch of people die. And then after those three thousand 
die, Moses says, “Oh, man, you guys have committed a great sin. I’m going 
to go back up to Yahweh, and maybe I can atone for you, guys, sin.” It’s as 00:42:0000:41:00
00:41:32  17if he has a sense that this isn’t over yet. There’s still more interceding that 
needs to be done. Isn’t that interesting. It’s not a one and done thing. 
 And then what Moses goes on to intercede for I think then what goes 
on is then on behalf of all of the people who weren’t the instigators, but 
they were the ones...you could call them they were accomplices to the 
crime. I think it’s the three thousand criminals as it were that die. And 
then an acts of intercession, two, three, four and five, he’s interceding 
now for the accomplices who looked on and didn’t do anything to stop 
it or something like that. And this is the moment where Moses offers his 
own life for the sins of the people. That’s intercession number two.
 After that, God says, “It’s okay, Moses, I’m not going to kill you in place 
of the people, but I’m going to send an angel because I can’t be around 
these people.” And then acts of intercession three and four, are Moses 
saying, “No, you have to come with us. We won’t leave the mountain 
if you don’t come with us.” And then that’s when God says, “Okay, I’ll 
go with you. My glory will go with you.” So then Moses says, “Show 
me your glory.” And then we’re finally to Exodus 34 verses 6 and 7. 
How did Moses get into that cave on the mountain with God saying 
these words? That’s how we got there. This is a complex story.
Carissa  Those five acts of intercession, though, they’re all for different things. 
They’re not the exact same thing. Which kind of response to your question 
earlier, Jon, I think that it wasn’t just a back and forth of Moses asking 
the same thing over and over and there was one thing God said yes, 
another thing God said yes, and another God said yes. Five times. 
Tim It also shows Moses as a savvy diplomat. The story is creating him under 
a role, is creating a need for a certain kind of person. If God is going to be 
married to people who faithfully represent Him, they’re going to blow it. So 
what we’re going to need now in this covenant relationship is some kind 
of prophet intercessor figure who will mediate this relationship between 
God and His people. And Moses is kind of like the prototype of that role.
Jon Does that mean that that’s kind of what we want in a pastor, a 
good diplomat with God, who can intercede in that way?
Tim Oh, got it. No. Actually no. I don’t think so at least. I think this is a part of a 
bigger strategy in the Torah and Prophets to show what kind of deliverer and 
messianic deliver that God’s covenant people need. It’s essentially a part of 
the Messianic message of the Hebrew Bible is creating a need for...seed of 
the woman, the prophet like Moses, the true king from the line of David, the 
ultimate priest who will mediate the covenant between God and His people.
Carissa  Yeah, an intercessor who gives his life like Moses does.00:45:0000:44:0000:43:00  18Tim That’s right. The role of a pastor and a shepherd is to imitate Christ. 
That’s how Paul puts it. So in that sense, they are to be a kind of 
mediator, but they are mediators that imitate the mediating work of 
the ultimate mediator, so to speak. So maybe I should go back on 
that no and just say kind of. That’s kind of what a pastor is. But at this 
moment in the story that we’re in, what a pastor is doing is imitating 
what the ultimate intercessor Jesus did—continuing that work.
Jon And what’s ringing in my ears right now is Jesus’ 
statement of “Father forgive them”. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. I think the reason why all of this matters for understanding 
these two verses that we’re going to study is that all of a sudden, Exodus 
34:6 and 7 actually becomes a commentary on Yahweh’s behavior in this 
very story. This whole story is revealing that Yahweh is a certain kind of 
God with certain kinds of character traits. And what these two verses do 
is boil down the character traits that you’ve just seen operate in the story 
of the golden calf, which is He will deal justly and fairly, and with people 
who abandon Him and hate Him to his face, He will deal with them it for 
however many generations continue that behavior. But His ultimate baseline 
and His deepest heart and purpose is mercy, compassion, and forgiveness, 
which He demonstrates. He demonstrates both verse 6 and 7 in this story.
Section Break 
Jon There’s a couple loose threads maybe you can speak 
to real quick. In the last part of the verse...
Tim The generations thing?
Jon Yeah, the generations thing. What’s the word? Something 
the iniquity. He will deliver the iniquity.
Tim He’ll visit...
Jon Okay. He’ll visit the iniquity on the third and the fourth. We haven’t 
talked about this, but the word “generations” isn’t there in...
Tim Hebrew.
Jon ...in Hebrew. But kind of we put it there because that’s what it’s talking 
about. And to us, the third and the fourth just sounds weird. Maybe in 
Hebrew it doesn’t. But what is this thing with the third and the fourth? 
I think in the last episode, I asked, why not the fifth and the sixth?
Tim Totally. Yeah, that’s right.
Jon What is this about?00:47:0000:46:00
00:48:19  19Tim This is cool. To say three, even four is actually a Hebrew turn of a phrase. It’s 
a figure of speech. In the beginning chapters of the Prophet Amos, he starts 
rattling off all these nations around Israel and the terrible things that they’ll 
do. And he’ll say, “For three sins of the Moabites, even for four I’m going to 
do this. For the sins of the Israelites, three, even for four, I’ll do this.” There’s 
a couple of times this happens in the book of Proverbs where there’s a riddle 
that uses this three, even four. You guys know what I’m talking about?
Carissa  Yeah. Proverbs 30. Yes, it’s used three times.
Tim Oh, yeah, this is great. Proverbs 30:18. “There are three things that are too 
amazing for me, four that I don’t understand The way of an eagle in the sky...”
Jon Oh, yeah, I remember talking about this. Years ago we talked about this. 
Tim Yeah. “...the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the 
middle of the sea, and the way of a man with a young woman.” 
Jon Three things, even four.
Tim Three things, even four is a poetic figure speech meaning however many 
or many. Which makes perfect sense here. However many generations 
repeat the sins of their ancestors, I will deal justly with them and bring 
them what they deserve. Contrast that with the opening line of verse 7. 
“He keeps loyal love for thousands.” So it’s a contrast. For thousands of 
generations, He will maintain covenant loyalty. And for however many 
generations to the third, even the fourth, He will deal justly.” But His 
ultimate purpose is for that eternal loyal love, but not at the expense 
of justice. I think is what the three, even the four are doing here. 
Carissa  I have a question about this verse, the contrast between three and four 
or the third and the fourth and then to a thousand. I understand the 
point is that the scales tipped for God toward His graciousness, that 
we can count on that as a part of His character. Even for an unfaithful 
generation or person, we can always appeal to His graciousness. And 
that’s kind of what is happening in this narrative. I also wonder if the 
extending of the love to thousands of generations also has something 
to do with intercession. Like the third and the fourth, it’s like however, 
many generations continue to sin. But extending to the thousands 
sometimes it doesn’t seem to have to do with the people’s righteousness. 
Like the Israelite people down below who just made the golden calf, 
we don’t really know if they have turned back to Yahweh, right? 
Tim Yeah. 
Carissa  But we do know that Moses has been an intercessor for them. And 
the reason that God forgives the people and goes with them isn’t 00:50:00
00:51:0000:49:00  20because of the people. He makes it really clear that it’s because I 
favor you, Moses, so I’ll go with the people. It just seems like another 
piece of the puzzle or maybe of the plotline or the pattern, that 
there’s this one person who will be favored, and that will extend 
this chesed or this grace or lovingkindness to everyone knows.
Tim Good. In other words, God can work with at least one faithful 
representative. And if there’s one of those, their righteousness or their 
covenant faithfulness can cover for the sins of the many. Because what 
else is the story except one righteous intercessor up on the mountain 
whose faithfulness covers for the sins of the many? Carissa, thank you. 
That’s a really good way of putting that. Jon, that is significant for you.
Jon Well, yeah. I mean, I was sitting there struggling with this whole 
narrative of Moses interceding and how it makes God look, I 
don’t know, wishy-washy or unsure of Himself, or whatever, that 
makes me feel uncomfortable. But when you look at it through the 
lens of God needs an intercessor, a righteous intercessor...
Tim Or more humanity needs an intercessor. At least God requires 
one. He’ll only work with a faithful intercessor.
Carissa  Or He’ll show His love to others based on His love or His favor for one.
Tim That’s a better way of putting it. Well said.
Jon Yeah.
Carissa  He does this with Abraham.
Jon He just needs one.
Carissa  Yeah, a real good one.
Tim They need to be really good.
Jon And that’s what you learn. You learn how important this 
one is. And Moses becomes such a great image of that 
one. In this story, man, he would shine, literally. 
Tim Jon, that’s really important. After his last act of intercession is 
when he goes down the mountain and he’s glowing with the 
divine glory. And he has to now cover himself with a veil just like 
God’s glory will be covered with a veil in the tabernacle.
Carissa  Is that the same word? 
Tim It’s a different word for “veil”. 
Carissa  Okay. Same idea though.00:52:00
00:53:00  21Tim But the same theme. Moses in this act of intercession actually comes to 
be almost indistinguishable from God in certain moments. I think this is 
a design pattern actually linking all the way back to the image of God. 
When humans are fully charged and operating at full covenant capacity 
the way they’re designed to be, they become true images of God, which 
for sure is contrast with this golden calf. What a pitiful replacement?
Jon Of being the cool statue of Yahweh yourself to making one.
Tim As opposed to the image that God has made already of Himself, 
which Moses is at his best, which is a superhuman. So, yeah, if 
God has one faithful intercessor to work with, He will allow them 
to stand in the place of the many. Carissa, that’s right. That’s how 
He can keep covenant faithfulness to the many even when they 
are not all faithful to Him. That’s what the story is telling us. 
Carissa  Yeah. 
Tim What kind of God would relate to a group of people that way? 
Well, a God who is compassionate and gracious, slowed 
to anger, abounding in loyal love and faithfulness. 
Section Break 
Jon So we’re going to get into each of those five words: 
Compassionate, gracious, slow to anger...Is that one word?
Tim Slow to anger. It’s two but still compound phrase in Hebrew.
Jon Compound phrase. Slow to anger, abounding 
in loyal love, and faithfulness or...
Carissa  Truth or faith.
Jon Truthfulness, faithfulness...we’ll get into it. We’re going to do a deep 
dive into each. Both you Tim and you Carissa have kind of taken your 
own to research and write. So the first one, that God is compassionate, 
Carissa, you’ve been looking at that. So that’s what you’ll lead us 
through this attribute of God of being compassionate and really 
we’ll look through the entire story of the Bible through that lens.
Carissa  Yeah, right. Looking forward to it.
Tim It’s exciting. It’s good stuff. It’s great how you can see now why this story 
is foundational for the whole rest of the Old Testament story. Oh, Exodus 
34:6-7 gets quoted one time in the New Testament too. It’s a good closer. 
In the opening movement of chapter 1 of the gospel of John, come on now. 
John knows what he’s doing. In John 1:14. He says, “The word...” referring 00:54:00
00:55:42
00:57:00  22to Jesus before He was named Jesus. The word pre-incarnate Messiah. 
“The Word became flesh and set up a tent among us, or dwelt among us, 
and we saw his glory, the glory as of the one and only from the Father.” 
 So these two words here, “setting up a tent” and “seeing his glory” 
they’re specifically of Moses up on the mountain with Yahweh getting 
blueprints for the tabernacle seeing God’s glory. So we saying the 
one that Moses met on Mount Sinai became human. That’s his claim 
right here. Then look at the rest of verses 14.  He says, “Of that one 
and only from the Father, he’s full of grace and truth. For from His 
fullness we have all received grace upon grace, for the Torah was 
given through Moses, grace and truth were through Jesus Messiah.”
 So this little phrase “grace and truth” is actually, in Greek, one 
of the most common ways the Greek Septuagint translated 
the phrase from Exodus 34:6. Covenant love and truth. Full of 
covenant love or loyal love and truth. Grace and truth.
Jon Truth being the faithful attribute?
Tim Yes, truth being trustworthy, truthful and grace, meaning generous in 
His covenant love. The words that John has chosen are connected to 
two of the five attributes of God in Genesis 3:4-6. Isn’t that cool?
Carissa  Yeah. 
Tim It’s like Jesus is the incarnation of the God of Exodus 34:6-7.
Carissa  The connection to the God’s glory dwelling in the tabernacle at the...we’re 
just kind of like the culmination of the whole Exodus story that the people 
build the tabernacle and Yahweh’s glory dwells there. It’s just interesting 
that that’s exactly what John’s saying is happening in Jesus. With all 
these attributes, He just embodies Yahweh. He is the glory of Yahweh.
Tim In other words, if John were to talk with somebody who said, “I don’t 
understand how Jesus of grace and love what He has to do with the God 
of the Old Testament, whose like wrath and anger,” I think he would just 
be dumbfounded because like, “What?” He wouldn’t know what to say. 
His point is the full-orbed portrait of Yahweh is the same God is revealed 
in the person of Jesus. So either I’ve misunderstood God of the Old 
Testament, or I’ve misunderstood Jesus, or I’ve just misunderstood both 
if I think that there’s some big disconnect between them. All right. 
Jon All right. 
Carissa  That’s awesome. 00:58:00
00:59:00  23Jon Thanks for listening to this episode of the BibleProject podcast. We’ve 
got a lot of ground to cover in this series. We’re going to go through 
each of these character attributes of God. But we want to let you 
know that we’re going to begin to collect questions right away for 
the upcoming question and response episodes during this series. 
 So if you have a question and you’d like us to consider it, please 
record yourself asking the question, keep it to around 20 or 30 
seconds, give us your name, where you’re from and email it to 
info@bibleproject.com. And extra credit, if you transcribe the 
question for us, it saves us a ton of time. Again, email is info@
bibleproject.com. Next week we’re back with more in this series.
Carissa   God is actually depicted as a nursing mother, which I think the image 
is really, really powerful. A mother holds her baby eight inches from 
her face and looks into their big baby eyes and sustains them with 
her own life. So this is what God says He is like, but even better. 
Tim This brings up a bigger issue that God’s self introduces here with a 
word describing a deep emotion. It has been challenging throughout 
Jewish and Christian tradition and people trying to understand the 
nature of God because emotions are so much a part of the changing 
physical mental state of a human, and thinking of God as an adaptive, 
changing emotional being. If you’re really trying to fill out a robust, 
comprehensive view of God’s nature, in as much as we can know it, 
people have had to wrestle with what seem like two opposite ways 
of thinking about God being the unchanging and unmoved or is He 
genuinely moved by emotion, and how those two go together. 
Jon We also want to let you know that we’ve recently launched a prayer 
list on our website. So if you’d like to partner with us in prayer, each 
month, you’ll receive an email update with prayer items of things going 
on at the BibleProject that we’d love for you to lift up to God for us 
on our behalf, and be connected to you in that way. As BibleProject 
continues to grow, we’re expanding our vision to reach a global 
audience, and the need for prayer is ever more apparent. You can learn 
more about joining the prayer team at Bibleproject.com/prayer.
