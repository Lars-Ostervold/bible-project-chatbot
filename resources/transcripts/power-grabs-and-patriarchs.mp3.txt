we are tracing the biblical theme that were calling the firstborn it's a theme about messy family Dynamics and power plays in the theme about how God's Bert's typical power structures by choosing the least expected to have power if you've been following along you've seen how this thing works out in the stories about him and he came to table and Noah's Three Sons today we get to Abraham and his relationship with his nephew Lots Abraham has the firstborn status with lots but he doesn't use his status as a means to gain more power instead he let lot decide which portion of land to settle in first which makes us wonder why is Abraham able to act with such generosity the Deep assumption is that God said he's going to bless me I don't own any land yet but if you choose the land God said he blessed me so I know those be some for me to from Abraham we move on to the stories of the three generations that come after him and at least
 where is the theme of sibling rivalry gets turned up God has a blessing for everybody but he's going to bring it through one family that families constantly in all these cycles of rivalry hurting each other to get the thing God wants to give it all of them and God will actually turn that rivalry into the vehicle through which he brings the unity that will restore the blessing to everybody these stories are full of deception and deceptions within deception the stories are full of people who don't trust in God's generosity these stories are also full of God acting in surprising ways and it keeps us wondering why does it have to be so messy following the god revealed in the story more than likely is going to start a person up for many rounds of this tension of waiting for exaltation that doesn't seem to materialize that's a part of what it means to have one's heart and desire shaped by. Today too
 Jackie and I look at the theme of the first born in the family of Abraham I'm drunk Collins and you listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 so we're in the middle of a conversation on the theme of the firstborn we're in the middle of our conversations but we're at the field very beginning of the Bible looking at a theme about status and power and how God disperses his generosity and how he elevates people and we're calling the theme of the firstborn because in the ancient world your estate your power and influence father's a father or a king or Prince or Duke or Earl know whether probably some equivalent in real-time Queen of England just died yes that's right I don't know how she became quite she's been Queen for a long time yeah but usually it's Kings and now it's a king again and it makes me wonder what it
 how that happened but anyways I don't know how it works either many but how it works is the logic of the firstborn yeah that's right yeah there's a logic of succession that can be tweaked and adapted but it is still alive logic of succession whose first winner of the Royal the Royal Scots and family members that are so so into the British royal family fascinating to me with that but I would be upset with it if we had it here in America Federal family LOL the firstborn how does your power and influence its status get transferred on and then who gets me in charge who gets to be the one calling the shots and in the biblical story it's not just who's in charge because of the shots but also there's this theme
 of the snake Crusher where God wants to deal with the source of evil and destroy it and so he actually says from the seed of the woman a child from Humanity will come someone who will crush us wounded Victor and so not only is the biblical narrative interested in who gets to have the power in any given family it's more interested in where is this lineage of the snake Crusher going to come from you go throughout the specialty of Genesis but then the rest of the Hebrew Bible that lineage is really what drives the impulse for what characters are on the stage at what time and this is the theme of God choosing continuing to choose one out of the many and it's about the continuation of this lineage of the lineage of a future deliver from the snake election
 election as we talked and that theme of election is closely bound up with how God chooses her who God chooses and this is where it connects to the firstborn is the most obvious thing for God to do is to choose the first born to be the vehicle of his Blessing what's Nick Rushville come from and because that's the assumed cultural backdrop for any reason not to waves and it's the cultural backdrop in terms of ancient Israelite culture so when we drop into the biblical story that's the default option. That's how people operate there for that's how God would operate and the twist in the surprise of the biblical story of the theme of the firstborn is it is a surprise because of that assumed background and the reason why God wants to crush the snake is for everyone for all Humanity by choosing one lineage it's too
 bless all of humanity and this brings us back to this theme of God's generosity it's wide and deep enough for everyone and so the problem becomes do I trust in God's method in timing for how he will disperse his generosity those ideas are implicit in the Garden of Eden story with the snake in the adamantium out of money and then we look how they become explicitly in the first story of sibling rivalry of Cain and Abel Genesis 49 we looked at how this theme is really uniting all of Genesis 1 through 11 together should hang out the whole Human family is trapped in this spiral of family feuds sibling rivalry is to keep spinning off lineages
 that lead to violence in Greater ruin in the Human family because people don't trust that God will provide for them status blessing honor they don't think that it's going to come to them and so they take matters into their own hands what came does yeah and it's usually out of Envy yet either at Envy because you deserve it you think you deserve it not giving it to someone else this is Kane being envious of his brother Abel or it's envy and that you actually are the second or third born so ham who's the third woman Noah who thinks man I want to be in charge and I can maybe make that happen in my own devious ways strange story of him and his father and the nakedness in the tent and a few very closely follow the hyperlinks it's a story
 of the youngest son trying to exalt themselves to family alpha male position and what God does is choose the middle child sham to be the vehicle of this blessing taking the story forward so we were talking about this theme in I think he's worked 2 streams on what that's helpful but the core idea of power and responsibility and status and how God wants to elevate everyone but in his own time in his own way of all the god in Genesis one is a guy that wants to share all that stuff with human with the power and yes with his images of humans and why does it go awry why can't that just be the end of the story. Shares it will you receive it we share it with others and yeah there's a garden and it's good that's right and what happens at least in like the Cain and Abel story is God
 favor to a second born son who offers a really really special gift as a sacrifice and what it leaves the older brother can wondering and the choice that God says you have is if you do the right thing here you will also be lifted up and exhausted but it's you got a choice now buddy and that's a buddy that's what I say to my kids what I'm trying to have a serious conversation but that's it it's Cain is left in this moment of wondering is there exaltation and honor for me to
 have you ever accidentally called your wife buddy yes and you end up, hey bud
 and then we look at each other and seriously I know you're not going to call me back anyway root of canes and security and implicitly that something like that that's underneath dams the moves of him makes to write and so I think it's interesting to stay here cuz we're going to see this played out in both ways I think in the generations after Abraham is that the problem is twofold one is that the first born is envious that God will choose the second born or the lake cover but also the conflict comes when the second-born feels like I got a raw deal that I'm the second born sure tries to figure out a way to get power on their own terms create or acquire get that honor status blessing
 on their own terms the pattern of cane pattern of him yeah that's good good Clarity like you're good at understanding and explain yeah there's the cane pattern and ham pattern
okay so starting let's go back real quick just to get the big picture starting with Adam and Eve there was a genealogy that after Cain killed his brother Abel God provided a third born son Adam and Eve Seth and in Genesis 5 we get a genealogy that goes from ten Generations from Adam to Noah and ends with Noah and his three sons then you get story of the increase of human violence in the Nephilim got purifies the land with the flood then you get another genealogy have Noah and his three sons when I get off the arc and they have 70 descendants that are 70 Nations that's Genesis chapter 10
 and God chooses one of those three lines it's the line of sham ten Generations that become 70 Nations Generations from Adam to Noah Noah's Three Sons produce the 17-nation three son that was three times the connection that's wrapped in the middle child sham of those three sons and then will you get then the story of Babylon and scattering Babylon which is like the flood up a new type of flood of God D creating what humans have made good in their own eyes and then out of that scattering God preserves that line of sham and you come back to it and in Genesis 11 you get another genealogy that takes you now from ten Generations from Shem to a guy named Tara with three sons it was just like from Adam to Noah Noah have three sons now we're going from Noah's son Shem
 to a guy named Tara who has three sons and the three sons are named not Corcoran and Abram later on this Abraham design cycling happening with the generations so that's ten Generations from Adam to Noah and his three sons become parallel to the ten Generations from Shem waiting to the three sons they include Abram and just as God chose him from Noah's Three Sons know God's going to choose a room for a month plus $0.03 so lot more to explore their but it's just kind what's kind of macro level for how Dennis has put together your like dang man that's so the stories and I guess it's just good to point out because when you're actually just reading through the stories of Genesis it can feel
 difficult to follow some kind of logic or overall pattern but it really is there Sky notes look for so when you get to Genesis 11 well you're just told is that skyterra had three sons and the name of the sons are off from knock or and her on so what is interesting here is that the name order is usually that order Abram not for her on and what we don't know is if the name order indicates birth order cuz it hasn't always this far didn't when we learned of Noah's sons correct yeah there is actually a salmon him so all we know is that Abram is the sun's chosen of these three to become the vehicle of the blessing because at the beginning of Genesis 12 got the Lord said to Abram
 so I think that's significant in that for some reason even though Abraham is one of these three the narrator doesn't want to go so we don't know his birth order make it clear we know that Abraham's brother her and becomes the father of a son named lot and then her on ties and then Abraham and his brother not home or they get married and then they moved with their dad halfway to the land of Canaan they moved from Chaldeans and they moved to a town named her on and they settle there he and his brother and then he leaves Abram is the one that got calls to go to Canaan but his brother not horse stays there where he was and this is where April's going to send a servant to find a woman who's in the family for his son to marry this is where Jacob goes when he's exiled is to these relatives right here is you have the stuff about one Sone chose
 among the three but the narrative doesn't focus on their birth order it's really interesting because it's been really important until now so it's it's the first cycle where it's not highlighted that it causes some conflict or videos by its absence has one Abram and says come here and he leaves his family and he goes but there's no sign of hostility or anything like that but you have flag that the story of lot and Abraham stories of them are ripping off of a hostility a lot is a nephew so he's not a brother he comes to be like a stand-in for his brother especially when it comes to Foos gets the first choice of the land which is the interesting thing about that real quick so first of all what God said is leave your land leave your relatives leave your father's house
 and go to the land I will show you and your ID and Abram went forth that's the Lord spoke to him and lot went with him and interesting Abram went as the Lord spoke to him next week God said do this he did that and then you get this little short sentence of the end and locked went with him so much like except lot of them little deviation from the word of God is going to cause a lot of tension in the family in the next three of the lots of relatives and he supposed to leave his brother yeah yeah and it's implied that you would leave now you could say a lot is Orphan cuz it's Dad right Abraham's brother died so a lot of stuff so is this a noble act but it causes trouble in the story so let's talk about that trouble so in Chapter 13 Abram and the whole crew come back from Egypt cuz I went down there and the famine and that's all
 but when they get back it turns out that lot and him times past and they both built up big flocks we both have lots of possession and the land was not able to sustain their migrating with their herds in the same land like it's just not enough grass is bumping into each other too much yet there is Strife there's hostility between the the Shepherds of Abraham in the Shepherds of Law and so what Lots says listen. Listen let there be no hostility between you and me your Shepherds in my shepherd look we're brothers recalls a brother so yeah I mean that in a traditional culture where your extended family is Wade tighter web Social Web it's very common to call your uncle your nephew your cousin your brother but it's certainly ironic in this sense cuz Abrams actual brother
 staff died and lock becomes like his brother Robin standing so whatever time does is he's generous
 it says listen isn't the whole land in front of you listen if you separate from me you go to the left I'll go right you go right I'll go left and so lot lifted up his eyes and he looked and here that's really interesting riffing on the steam of trusting God's generosity thank you are you from here is just like this kid there's enough thank you thanks I like I don't have to try to fight for what I think I need like make the first move is going to be enough that's exactly what's happening is really important because of this a baller move this is a generous yeah the deepest emption is that God said he's going to bless me and I don't own any land yet but if you choose land got said he blessed me so I know they'll be some for me too
 the first year that we have of I mean it's a big issue is whether he is the firstborn right so he's like the first born in the story and it's a story of the firstborn I don't need to have a power-play here there's enough happening in school so he becomes the first false story but the story also highlights his moments of trust in this is one of them he's leaving his family in the first place and this becomes on a good start he's got a roll and this is after he lied and deceived that's why we skip that story I think he's also maybe kind of you know
 so don't try and create our room don't try and create my own blessing and see if they're like I did down and eat you up. So this is the next door a so listen we're brothers got said he blessed me he's going to bless you choose your land and I'll I'll go find what God has for me so look at Lots just a little little characterization your lot lifted up his eyes and he looked
 he saw all the Valley of the Jordan just streams of water everywhere this is before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah that doesn't happen for a seven more chapters that's what the narrator says in the story goes back in you know what it looks like it looks like the garden of Yahweh you know it looks like he looked and he saw a well-watered Eden Garden and he looked at the fruit of that land you know that land is like Egypt to Egypt is going to be another Garden of Eden by the end of the scroll fertile valleys of Egypt chose for himself all the Valley of the Jordan and he journeyed to the East and so the brothers separate
 so last time somebody looked and saw the garden by the water and toes for themselves it didn't work out what are you referring to I'm referring to Adam and Eve at the tree there in the garden in the garden they see what are good choice here as echoing the poor choice and because this choice of going to put him in Sin City yeah and it's going to end up being a really bad situation for him in this kids starters this decision ends poorly and it begins with him lifting his eyes and looking at the Garden fruit land that he chooses for himself on the other hand he just stayed put in the land of Canaan which is where God said just go there and I'm going to hook you up but you got to wait okay so you said put a lot was like I'm going over there
 exactly Moose's tents far away know the Lord said to Abraham after lot separated now you lift up your eyes a lot lifted his eyes where he saw what was good now. Says you lift up your eyes and look from the place just right here where you are
 look up north looks Southwick East request all this land I will give it to you and your seed you know you and your seeds I will make like the dust of the land the other Mama ya-ya the dust of the land oh it's see how far but the exactly right so this is exactly what God made Adam out of Genesis to so I think it's a little echo of the sprays from Genesis to like you are the seed of the new Adam that I'm going to burst through the sea is a woman so your lineage is the seed of this new dust of the earth if anyone can count the dust of the earth then give me number so get up you know about the land
 but I'm going to give to you and so it burn walks about where it's a chance we're a broom could pull rank on his nephew and two is the plot of land that he doesn't know where and what exactly he just knows that got set up and get this land and he's super open-handed and he lets his nephew go first it's been Abraham's like you choose and then I'll go and then Lots like over there looks really nice and Abraham looks up over there too and goes well you're right he actually you know what I'm going to go over there and I can change my mind cuz I can't cuz I'm yeah I'm the older but said he just like you chose that beautiful and over there you're right that does look beautiful I'm going to stay but yeah that's the story interesting story about it's the theme of a first born or sibling rivalry even though it goes well it's a
 but it goes well because of Abraham's generosity and it's about a uncle and nephew not the older in the younger brother of school so yeah let's just pause and meditate on how powerful of a story this is on what is possible when humans are open-handed with the mutt that they have been given that's what the story is about and we saw the opposite of this in the stories of cayenne and ham and that's important here this tragic stories but this is really beautiful portrait of what happens when you really truly believe there's enough for me and for my siblings
look up so Abrams story also involves not just the promise of a land for his future family but of the future family like many descendants that they would be fruitful and multiply its like the Eden blessing for Adam and Eve so a big theme hear the obstacle to this is the fact that Sarah his wife was unable to have children and so in Genesis chapter 16 is a story that we've reflected on many times over the years so I just want to summarize that but it's a story of how both of them become impatient with God's timing and so they do to one of their slay in Egyptian slave what is good in their eyes and the language used in the store here also Echoes the language of Adam and Eve at the tree so it's a failure story
 and whatever does he marries and then he impregnates this Egyptian slave and she gives birth to Abraham's first born son smell and right from the get-go Sara sees this slave wife as a rifle and so in a way she becomes like a first born but if these women it's she's the first wife rights and now there's a latecomer wife and God gives to this Egyptian slave what he has not given us area and that becomes the source of division and conflict at this part of the story knows our creative way the story is developing and exploring us for many angles yeah so what happens is Sarah oppresses the Egyptian so that the Egyptian and her son flea don't know if she still pregnant she pleased and what happens is the Angel of the Lord comes to Hagar and provides
 a little Garden of Eden for her a little spring of Water by tree in the wilderness
 so he provides Eaton blessing also for that latecomer
 who has been oppressed by the firstborn so just all of a sudden Sarah becomes like the cane figure and Hagar becomes the abelseth figure they got kiss the blessing to even though Hagar and Ishmael will not be the chosen wide we don't know this right now will you Donuts yet so what cancer story so far is God provides a little Eden blessed actually we should assume it because doesn't got a busy say explicitly like I will give you a son to Sarah he does after this after this that's right okay so after Hagar goes into the Wilderness God provides a little Eden stream entry out there and says he go back I'm going to make you fruitful and multiply and you're going to get the blessing but your son is going to live in conflict
 with those around him and so she goes back in chapter 17 right after that God says Hey member you know I'm going to bless you and you'll be fruitful and multiply Abraham yep to Abraham and changes his name this is where you from Abrams Abraham and so when God says you're going to be fruitful and multiply then he specifies and he said listen you pull this move Hagar trying to produce at the center on your own but it's through Sarah that a royal lineage like lineage will come from her and then crushing see the woman and Abraham falls on his face and he laughs and he says yeah right like you know Sarah being as old as she has enough time and then what he says is I already have a first born
 he says old let Ishmael be the one who live in the more you already have one instead cuz I got to work with Sarah so is the lack of trust moment and God says nope it's through Sarah I think the logic here is ishmael's the product of the unknown of a rivalry between the two wives and then that rivalry Sarah was like the address of first wife and the mistrust that Abraham has right for God's blessing the product of a rivalry in the mistrust that turns into a rivalry what God says I'm going to provide a son through Sarah and he will be the second born and is that second born that will carry the line of the royal lineage of a Crusher in the blessing so it's like the wives and Sarah's kind of the first come wife but she'll give birth to the second born son and it's the first born son through
 s there late Comer y n e that's really clever in version of it we're just kind of turning the same over from all these angles but it's the same basic idea but what God also make it really clear is just like you smell is the firstborn and I'm going to give the blessing to the second born through Sarah but God says I Will Bless just mail to he will be fruitful and multiply in the supposed to remember can arrange that if my brother is exalted that's it I mean I don't choose the other it means I'm working in historical sequence and you you to your smell will get the blessing so that's how this thing works out and Abraham's generation and so when Sarah finally has a son named was pretty happy with Ishmael being his first born it was Sarah who wasn't down and then it was the fat
 that like he was going to have another kid again God said nothing to give you another job right if so later in Genesis and chapter 21 when Sarah finally does become pregnant she gives birth to
 Abraham second son Isaac and Sarah is the one who once again becomes jealous of the status or irritated with your smell and the slave mother Hagar and so when Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian doing something here it says mocking is The New American Standard Bible translation Isaac name means laughter it from last Sarah laughed when they said when they heard the laughter that he left and then what Sarah sees is Ishmael the firstborn relating to laughter her son laughter and some way and was verbs that describe what he's doing is causing laughter
 which could mean making fun of something like that but she's tect so she X-Files the slave woman and her son so that rivalry becomes really tragic it so what God does is once again Hagar and her son are out wandering in the wilderness they think they're going to die and for a second time God provides water in a tree in the wilderness and promises that they'll have the blessing even though they are not the chosen lineage a blessing for the snake rushing seeds so I think what we can meditate on here is that this is a story about Abraham and Sarah in their struggle to trust God's generosity and specifically just a struggle with his timing which is similar to what team struggled with and sometimes Abram get that ride other times he and Sarah really don't
 and what God does compensate for the pain and ruin they caused by blessing the people who are hurt by their lack of trust God's blessing but he also doesn't walk out on Abraham and Sarah like he stays committed to them being people that he's going to provide the seed through even though it really feels like they don't deserve it by this point in the story interesting way of exploring theme yeah cuz it's upset Abraham you made a good call with God's generosity with lots and then when it came to trusting in God's generosity for him in terms of an air like I pushed him too far with the land but he didn't trust God with this leader of his family because I mean he's just like yeah I can trust God there's lots of way and I'm looking around just left it laying around I'm getting real old and now there's no kids I got to take matters in my own hand
 now as soon as we're talking about seed and heirs were in the realm of the steam of the firstborn and by taking another wife having a first born child from that wife it creates a rivalry between the wives Abraham's down with the Sun but then his rivalry with the wives and then becomes a rival with also between the Suns yeah but there's none both front and I guess what I don't fully understand maybe help this land more is God could have just said let's use Ishmael and that would have been kind of a you know God using the second-born wife or the second wife the seed of the second wife and that fit the theme of like I'm going to choose the latecomer and elevates but instead it's like no let's invert again and now I'm going to actually choose the first wife that have second son
 yeah yeah cuz the second son feels in a way like should be the favored son because it is of the first wife and I've always thought of Isaac as the more important son in a way so it's some way he is the second born but I'm way he is of the first why not ask the same question myself the most satisfactory kind of set of Reflections that I've come to is even though you smell is the son of the oppressed Egyptian slave Isaac is the son that truly is a gift of sheer God's creative view active Grace and power creating life out of non-life in the in the womb of Sarah whereas you smell is the son that they produced by doing Limited in their own eyes since my hunch is that it's the Sun that they could never point you and say
 we did that it's the sign or what you says look what I made with the h o yeah that's exactly what we made
 thank you if that's a good reflection rather Isaac is the son that they look at and say I like we always did look without it but what that means is this overlooking of you smell what kind of a God says I'm not going to overlook him so I think that's probably because show you there's enough generosity that it's hard to predict God's method yes that is true it is unpredictable it forces every generation to stay live with God right oh I get it. You can always choose the second born the second and here's the second wife okay I get I don't get it that's good that's good you can't predict the particular way God will enact his purpose but you can trust that the Deep desire underneath God's purpose is good it's a blessing everyone but it will sometimes look like it's not good and that
 what puts all these characters are almost inevitably always looks like it's not going to the Next Generation the next generation is the story of Isaac's two sons Isaac and Rebecca and this is the most famous 1st born second rivalry in the Bible I think Jacob and Esau a few and they're twins and their and their their rivalry is happening in the moment of birth itself because Jacob is depicted as grabbing at his brother but clinging for the position of his brother he's going second but but he's holding onto the heel he's grabbing the heel
 so for a month longer meditation on the Jacob stories and really a lot of what will sunrise right now we did all series of conversation on the Jacob story as we went through the Genesis crawl in our journey through the Torah before so it'll be hard I just want to condense the theme right here, so you have Isaac is the second born son to Abraham of his first wife and then he marries Rebecca who is the relative or a daughter of Abraham's family that he left back back in the day so I can married and Rebecca gets pregnant this is Genesis 25 and she can feel that there's like a wrestling match happening in their womb
 bread machine freaks out about it and she goes to pray to God what's happening in her stomach and what God says to Nations this is Genesis 25-23 two nations are in your room two peoples will be separated from your body 1 people will be stronger than the other and the older will become the servant of the younger so from the beginning God stated purposes this is not going to go the way you think know by this point Genesis you kind of like well this is kind of what I thought would happen but not for the characters in the store so you know God's purpose from the beginning
 so what's really fascinating is a depiction of Jacob right after this is of swindling or scheming his way to get the right of the firstborn by his own plan and this is Jacob is making stew with him and his brother comes in famous story and I was like I'm so hungry I'm going to die Give me the give me the address to do and Jacob says happy to give that to you along with them the right of the firstborn of hunger what is it to me you know and so V and the Hebrew word for the right of the firstborn just called the Beck Laura weird the horse first born so Becca Ross the right the first one
 then we flip it over in another story that's going to happen in Genesis 27 is Isaac is hungry Wednesday and he brings in Esau and says he saw with me a specialist if you make me a really special meal that I can take and eat I'll give you the blessing the eating blessing that God passed on to me
 we're supposed to be thinking of these two things separately I know we jammed on this and the neverland it for me the deck Laura and the thing which is spelled with the same letters but flipped around the middle better to better off, can I make a clear distinction and relationship between the two
 well where are they synonyms for clearly related to related the parent swindling store is swindling to get Jacobs swindell's to get the Torah and he and his mom Swindle to get the data is my assumption so maybe they need some of the according to the right of the firstborn the heritance like the double portion that the first one sent the the other one other thing that God is going to choose a family where the Royal snake Russian King is going to come from in terms of authority
 in other words together God bless the human and said be fruitful and multiply rule the land are so Authority power and responsibility and abundance are all packed into the blessing of Eden and so that I think they are implied abundance and Rule and responsibilities of a package deal but it could be you could in the logic of this you could give the abundance to one son where the blessing goes with another son right so once I get the double portion but the blessing of the royal king fascinating is I think Isaac thinks that he can just like
 give the blessing away for food so which shows that his is kind of like his son has been in His image cuz he gives away his firstborn right for food here so like father like son I think if anything it's the Isaac I think it's portrayed here is being flippant and he doesn't seem to Value it cuz he'll just exchanged it for food but I think the real question is so when Isaac says I'll give a blessing
 why should God care what Isaac thinks and what Isaac's out to the gods have already said what his purpose was within the poem ruling would go to the younger ones and Isaac is seen here is pricing for the purpose. It and we know the one who's already been selected and it's the younger one as Paul says before they do good or bad yeah God made us mysterious Joyce and what is the clay to say to the Potter why did you make me this way what the clay is I trust that you will make me into something beautiful to
 happens is that Rebecca and Jacob come up with a plan to Swindle where do you think that's actually supposed logic there is isn't a logical little bit like Disney say like God can just discard certain mugs well he holds that open as a conditional possibility what if God were to just choose one mug and discard another what if God were to do that and he never finishes that sentence and then he goes on a Long Trail to show that Those whom God doesn't choose we're always designed to be incorporated into the blessing given to the chosen ones interested which is Israel in the nation's okay an open-ended question that he doesn't answer and then you realize until it comes around to the very end when he says therefore God has assigned all disobedient so that he may have mercy on all and restore
 Israel and the nation's 3 Resurrection that's what's confusing is that whole thing comes out of how he dealt with pharaoh to correct the words with Pharaoh I mean he does get destroyed yep that's right the point is for Paul to Jacob and Esau story isn't about choosing one it's about choosing one to become the vehicle a blessing for the many yeah which puts the nachos in the test they have to choose and here he saw when he realizes that his brother has swindled him he responds just like came back to the language is exactly the same he wants to harass his brother which means murder and that's what came did to his brother murdered him so what's important here and the clever twists here is that the second-born Jacob you already know he's the one of those are for the beginning chosen from the beginning
 but he consistently lives and behaves as if if he's going to get the first born right or the blessing of his own terms he's going to just going to be by his own wisdom and then when the story we don't know if he knows that he was numb all we know is that God said that to Rebecca so it could be that I that doesn't know and he's just doing what is natural yeah that's a possibility but Rebecca no sin so she threw a counter deception get the scheme she knows and she's the one that instigates the counter deception with Jakob yeah but either way Jacob is depicted as grabbing after the thing that God has destined Tim to receive yeah but he lives as if he at is only going to get it if he does what it takes you into even if it means betraying your own family members and we're back to
 that theme except now instead of lycaon the firstborn wondering if their blessing for me it's like the chosen second-born acts and lives as if he wanted him but they're not really interesting so you can be the chosen one but choose to live as if you're not and hurt people in order to get the thing that God wanted to give you all along the perfect story of Jacob so it's only the first time Jacob act generously in his own my story is way back it's the night before he's about to remit Esau twenty years later and he heard that you saw is coming before hundred men and your dad he's on his own at this point he's got four wise and all their kids in a bunch of animal okay so I mean yeah and he's like my brother is coming last I knew he wants to kill me and so
 it isn't just 32 he lines up his family in groups and he lines up his wives and all their respective kids in the order most disliked to his favorite wife at the last sweet protects is Joseph and vote for him yeah but basically he's offering up his wife and kids as if you're going to start killing people off in my family with this crew as well if he strikes and kills me at least he'll strike a smaller group first and then after he makes up plan is the strange story of God picking a fight with him in the middle of the night and Jacob's life give me the blessing to this stranger
 and he's like dude you've been struggling with humans and God your whole life buddy and it ends tonight and he just smashed him in the crotch and it dislocates his hip and weird and then the stranger gives him a blessing and you find out the strangers God and then the next morning with Jacob does is he moves his vahlkamp to the front so that he's the first one to meet brother. Change of heart the first time he actually acts trusting God to be generous in to save his wife is the night after you get smashed in the crotch like God Is Not What a wild story
 yeah and how does this connect to does it connect to this theme I mean because he he asked for the blessing of God and then asks he still wants to give me the blessing to him but it's precisely by wounding him that finally put Jacob in a position to receive it legitimately from God here in a way he's always had it yep and he's always had it but God doesn't let him know you know exit is not entirely true but that takes us down the rabbit hole in the second story and you can go to start earlier podcast episodes. Has said actually appeared to him before and dreams God bless you. Jacob consistently acts like he's going to have to do it by then power so the night before he meets his firstborn brother
 is when all this happens so Jacob walks up to his brother and he says he saw us as what are all of these animals why'd you send me like dozens of animals and he says I want to give you a blessing imma give you back the blessing but I stole from you and what he saw says this is so rad man what he saw says I have enough brother but I don't need your gift I have much my brother so easily becomes the generous DeGeneres Abraham that was like listen I can trust what I have I'm good I can I have enough you can keep your blessing you clearly wanted it really bad really really powerful studies in human nature in psychology
 okay we're in like flying high mode over Genesis generation but maybe let's let the Jacobin
 is a story cuz the story of Jacob's sons is about all of Jacob's own flaws just like ratcheted up to with the volume at 11 + x 12 cents time okay the last cycle of this first born rivalry got inverting the blessed one is the story of Joseph and his brothers who are the sons of Jacob Jacob Jacob has 12 12 sons and one daughter and in Genesis 37 Begins the story of those children so justify we dedicated many episodes of working through the Joseph story in our Series where we went through the Torah and the movements of Genesis on so-so Movement 3 of The Fourth Movement of Genesis for deeper dive feel free to go there we just want to summarize briefly how the inversion of the firstborn happens in this
 and it's once again it's a Twist always with a Twist yeah there's 12 kiddos right there's 12 kiddos and the first four sons that Jacob has are from the wife that you've never really liked know they are so we're kind of jamming with the the Sarah and Hagar actually born into what turns out to be Jacob's first wife likes is on favorite away but it's the wife he doesn't love cuz he didn't want her to be creative so what Joseph does is actually take one of his last Sons Joseph who's the 11th son
 and Joseph makes him the exalted favored Son by giving him the special coat Technicolor Dreamcoat and then that's the Sun that has dreams about being exalted as the ruler of his family and the ruler of the universe with the Stars he becomes a dream about being an exalted image of God ruling even over the stars for Sarah Genesis has one thing on her neck and some brothers who give into the snake and who act like an who don't like that dream and so it's Joseph's older brothers that devised a scheme to First murder
 and then they decide to just throw them in a pet and then sell them into slavery into slavery in Egypt and so Joseph becomes the able type figure yeah but he survives the pet he's not murdered but his brothers lie like snakes and get Jacob to think that he's been murdered to buy showing him a bloody Clue game cup turn bloody story becomes about how God preserves the life of the chosen son chosen of his father pulled him out of the pit was amount of the pet you go spend further into a pet down in Egypt that he calls the prison he end up in prison in Egypt and from there the deep pit down and Egypt God exalts The Chosen son of the father precisely through his suffering he meets people that become the way that he's elevated to become the second and place ruler over all of Egypt
 that he is wise rule is able to imagine a plan to save Egypt and all the surrounding countries in the midst of a famine so it is precisely his suffering that leads him to his exaltation
 to a second-in-command place over Egypt second only to Pharaoh come Joseph is really suspicious they have to go to Egypt because there's a famine in the Joseph is now in charge will behold the son that they abused they fell off into slavery is now the one with the power yep so Joseph can got to scheme to match their old scheme where he lines it up so that the brothers were put in prison and they're put in the position to betray one of their brothers and leave them in prison wants to see if they'll still betray brother John Joseph
 they're going to do now what they did decades ago to him and they don't just tell the truth and so Joseph does another round of testing his brothers Joseph gets the brothers to bring down his little brother Benjamin and he puts Benjamin a position with the brothers could take money and run and leave and leave a brother his next the next the very youngest son in prison and what happens Judah the fourth born of Leah the first wife of Jacob he steps up and he says listen to take me instead we did wrong to this kids brother long time ago and that's coming back on our heads we shouldn't have done that and I give my life in place of my little brother and that that moment Joseph knows like these are these brothers of changed near reveals himself so what's interesting is the whole conflict is resolved when
 the fourth born of Leah
 offers up his life as a sacrifice in the place of the favored younger son really interesting and then you should go on to the end of the book of Genesis what you learned is that for the rest of the history of this family is going to be too prominent Brothers in rivalry with each other for the rest of the Torah and the prophets what's the line of Joseph and the lion of Judah and specially when she leave the tour and go into Joshua Judges Samuel King's most of the main leaders and kings and judges are all figures that come in either from the line of Joseph and Judah there often a competition with each other and then would later when the kingdom split after Solomon's rule it's Joseph and Judah
 all through the story of kings and about the northern kingdom in the northern kingdom is Joseph of the two brothers who give up their lives for the blessing of the many brothers they become the heads of Clans to become rival Brothers cuz it says that he's going to bless the line of Joseph but he's going to bring the Royal future coming King from The Lion of Judah so the blessing of abundance gets put on Joseph the blessing of the future rule does every split up and the one right in the bed I saw the blessing and then the rest of the Torah and Prophets is about how
 that split between Joseph and Judah just goes right down through the history here and I never get along and none of their descendants get along and then Ezekiel has this weird dream what God tells him to pick up to steck's and to write Joseph on one and Jude on the other and then to make the two become one and when God restores the new creation replant Eden and restores Israel with the nucleus of a new Humanity he's going to reunite the brothers the brothers the older brother and the younger brother Joe will become one this is really interesting so man. I just want to see the rest of the day so but it's another example of God's has a blessing for everybody but he's going to bring it through one family that families constantly
 in all the cycles of rivalry hurting each other to get the thing God wants to give to all of them and God will actually turn that rivalry into the vehicle through which he brings the unity that will restore the blessing to everybody through those few Rivals and so the theme of the firstborn and that God doesn't always choose the one where you would think I was a bit should have the authority in the status of the power that's been cycling when we get to the 12 it's like everything comes to this match duration where it's like it's so sophisticated is 12 Brothers the very first is it Ruben is the first I mean he's off the map he does what hand did he sleeps with his wife out of the running so you've got the 4th and 4th of the first wife and then the eleventh yeah of the last wife to Bear children and
 either of them are the first born and the in the blessings kind of split between them when you think of them together there is a first-born second-born kind of rivalry between them because one is older than the other and one gets the Royal Line while the other doesn't and so a man so fascinating and it's all comes down to though God wants to bless all of humanity and if you do what is right you will be exalted that's what he tells to Kane and the Temptation is to go man I don't like the situation I meant I don't have I don't have what I need what I deserve doesn't feel like exaltation to me feel like exultation right now that person has what they don't deserve what I need to do something and so we could call this theme like you know
 coveting the theme of reading and desirable Covetous but it's coveting status and power and authority in abundance and abundance and it's been given to somebody else that I don't think deserves it and that I think by cultural normal practice and if I say to someone else hey you choose and I'm going to trust that just feels so counterintuitive and scary and stupid but maybe there's not enough The Strangers Jesus saying blessed are those of low social status the meat for the unimportant they're the ones that will inherit the land he says
 how do you do nothing you're the ones who inherit it all its yeah following the god revealed in the story more than likely is going to set a person up for many rounds of this tension of waiting for exaltation that doesn't seem to materialize sorta like that's a part of what it means to have one's heart and desire shaped by this God I guess like Jacob the stuff that needs to do we need to shed some some scale some sneaky scale setup so that we can truly receive the thing that God wants to give to everybody but each in its own way and its own time and that's hard for us isn't it
 powerful stuff man oh okay so next we're going to jump into the ex's school and talk about this theme when it comes to two brothers named Moses and Aaron then some brothers that come from Aaron name the dog and obviously when I was all right and then about a first born son that God calls Israel Israel and he says that is a threat to the king of Egypt who is enslaving and depressing and murdering his firstborn son thank you for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we are diving into the Exodus scroll to continue the theme of the firstborn Israel is God's firstborn but they're not the ones in power anymore in the opening pages of Exodus with Pharaoh has blessed Joseph is gone and a new Pharaoh as brutally enslave them and so this becomes a contrast portrait
 leader who looks at it immigrant group and all they see is liability and potential conflicts and so what the tragic irony is that his fear of conflict is actually what he goes on to create through the actions today's episode was produced by Cooper pelts with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Dan demel Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza and a woo provided the annotations for an 82 podcast in our app
