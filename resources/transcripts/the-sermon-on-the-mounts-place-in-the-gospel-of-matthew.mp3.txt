The Sermon on the Mount is a selection of the most well-known teachings of Jesus found in the gospel of Matthew today Tim and I look at how The Sermon on the Mount fits into the structure of Matthew and with me is a co-host Michelle Jones time she'll by John did you know that there are five Big Blocks of teachings in the gospel of Matthew and that the sermon amount is just the first one right why do they come first and how does it fit with the other sections I guess we need to understand The Sermon on the Mount in light of the whole with Matthew temperature this way The Sermon on the Mount shouldn't be taught word understood or red and isolation The Sermon on the Mount is one of the means available to Jesus for bringing the kingdom of God on Earth as it is in heaven
 today on the show how The Sermon on the Mount fits into the entire Gospel of Matthew thanks for joining us here we go
the one really important thing about understanding Sermon on the Mount is to recognize that it is the first of five big speeches that Jesus gives in The Gospel according to Matthew and that the sermons isn't the only thing that Jesus teaches but it just the first big speech in Matthew Jesus and that's on purpose there's five speeches in five big speeches that all have identical conclusions so Matthew really wants to present Jesus as teacher as a teacher figure he talks more than Matthew than he does in the gospel of Mark for example the server is not the only teaching yep but not the only we need to read The Sermon on the Mount within the context of all of his teachings cuz there are some things that he says here that will get unpacked or expanded by another story or another teaching later on
 and the other piece is that The Sermon on the Mount comes right after a very carefully crafted introductory movement to the story of Jesus that consist of what we would call Matthew chapters 1 through 4 Matthew once before has been very carefully designed to tee up Jesus doing and saying the things that he's going to start doing in the rest of the Gospel of Matthew chapters 1 through 4 has the same as birth stories not with that the Magi coming and Herod killing the children in Bethlehem and you know these these types of store is John the Baptist arrival and what school is you know we have four gospel accounts three of them Matthew Mark and Luke are all based somehow connected to a lot of the same Source Traditions which is why they read system lurline and so what schools you can actually see where Matthew or Mark or Luke have made their choices for how to arrange things by looking at the differences with the other ones and so Matthew has a unique shape that's different than mark
 look for John for example Matthew chapters 1 through 4 there are seven times in Matthew chapters 1 through 4 where the narrator stops the story and says that just happened in the story that was an order to fulfill and then he produces a quotation from the Old Testament 7 x 7 x The Narrative stops and says Jesus did this to fulfill the order to fulfill in through the prophet and then he provides a quote 7 fulfillment that that abounded kind of literary unit and of introduction is the seven quotation c o which Mark something in patterns of 7 is very common way of rounding out a round number in Hebrew thought from the 7-Day creation story it's like a classic formula the introduction ends with Jesus Is Back
 and then a statement that he after his baptism in testing in the wilderness starts to ring around the Villages of Galilee with a message and the message is given a one-sentence summary by Matthew which is hey everybody change directions or protect is the classic English translation but change direction Go a different way because the kingdom of the heavens has come near that's Matthew summary of Jesus's main message and then it says Jesus went around teaching in the synagogue on Galloway was that message announcing the good news and healing all of these sick people who are coming to him
 and then Matthew says and Jesus all the people coming to him and went up on the mountain and sat down and said then you get The Sermon on the Mount Zion and it ends with Jesus go around announcing good news Kingdom there's a very clear concluding movement to the story that happens in chapter 26 on to the end of the Gospel so now we're going to the back end of the gospel and that begins with Jesus is Passover meal then his arrest in his trial and then his execution death than the empty tomb story and then the resurrection sighting at the end and that whole sequence has for fulfillment quotations the same exact this happened in order to fulfill the same strategy but also provides the climax towards which the whole story has been going so if you just read the introduction and then kind of the climactic conclusion
 it raises the question well how did Jesus get from announcing the arrival of God's kingdom around the village of the Galloway to ending up in the upper room of a house in Jerusalem on Passover saying I'm going to be killed tomorrow how do you get from one to the other and that's what we call the drama at Matthew chapters five through 25 which is like the main body so intro
 which is the first four chapters in Matthew its origin stories of Jesus 74 filmic books and it goes from his birth genealogy birth to him being tested in the wilderness and getting baptized by John the Baptist
 and there's an outro of Matthew
 which is the last three chapter 26 27 28 his last week basically the Passover week last, the last few days two days even leading up to his death and then the resurrection so what you're saying is we think of those is like the outer frames Matthew
 and the whole main body of Matthew is in the drama it's Jesus teaching and doing his Jesus thing and somehow it's going to get him arrested that's right yeah but Matthew has a uniquely done because he is brought together some of Jesus most well-known teachings into these big speeches and collected them in the five big speech 5 collections of speeches
 and Jesus talks more and gets shorter speech is okay outside of these but there's five big speeches that are distributed throughout chapters 5225 and really strategic locations and he's Matthew has given each of them and identical conclusion for when they end and so these five speeches are the first The Sermon on the Mount chapters 5 through 7
 second speech is in chapter 10 makes up most of chapter 10
 open called the missionary speech of the standing speech is where he commissions the apostles to go do what he's been doing Georgia cities preach the kingdom is near come there and then here's what you should do is instructions so the third speech
 is what we call chapter 13 and hear Jesus goes not to a mountain but to the Lakeshore and then gets out on a boat is it was determined on the shore and then he teaches all of the Kingdom Parables the kingdom of God is like a mustard seed Collective here right there for speech
 is most of what we call chapter 18 that's where the disciples come up to him and began asking him questions about like who's the most important in the Kingdom of the guys let's get to it and then Jesus goes on the office this long speech about essentially like the value system of the kingdom of the skies and how it's totally upside down from our human value systems so children which were like at least of the lowest social rank in their culture are the black that most highest most valuable members of the kingdom of heaven and forgiving your brother 70 x 7 that this makes famous Parables I saw its fourth the fifth collection
 is when Jesus gets in Jerusalem and he's been there most of a week already and he's been in so many conflicts with the leaders of Jerusalem that he gives a long set of speeches that are about as long as a Sermon on the Mount and 1st at 7 Oracles of Doom and cursing and then I did not spend of predicting the destruction of Jerusalem while the end-times kind of stuff and what we would modern readers often talked about as Parables about the timing of either the destruction of Jerusalem or the day of his return and okay so the five big speaker box and then what happens is that the speeches are set in the context of narratives usually the speeches are preceded or followed by stories that I have all the keywords of that speech
 being explored so he's set the speeches during pillars yeah like pillars with surrounding narratives that are exploring the idea is either leading up to a speech or after a speech and every one of the speeches ends with the same exact phrase when Jesus finished thing these things and then that's the way out of the speech uniquely those five big speeches in Matthew begins with the spray is when Jesus finished saying these things or instructing the 12 or saying his Parables but that's it when Jesus finished Jesus finished cuz it's five times that Matthew says when Jesus fed and those are all after the five main collection the teachings which are 5 like pillars that organized the whole body
 now it's real quick here the selection and organization in 25 speeches cuz Jesus offers more speeches he teaches more teachings but they're not marked with that phrase in a Jesus finish saying these things are any of them as long as any of these almost some of them are almost as long as they're not marked so the Rays becomes really important phrase in the location of these five okay and so Scholars for quite a while going back almost a hundred years to scholar Benjamin bacon who proposed that the organization of the speeches and into a group of five is a part of Matthew strategy to present Jesus as a new and greater than Moses he's Israel's teacher because the five Scrolls of the Torah associating the five speeches of the new Moses that is Jesus with the five Scrolls of the Torah associated with Moses and Israel great teacher cuz of our Scrolls of the Torah Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers
 are all kind of the contribution of Moses second temple Judaism missed calls off and called the Torah Moses swen of the five of something that's very like Torah territory associated with teaching when Moses finishes his last speech Deuteronomy includes and when Moses finished saying all these the phrase and Matthew is like the toy and his teachings on the Torah are like the main focus of the body of the speech which is all about I didn't come to dismiss or do away with the Torah and the prophets I came to fulfill the Torah
 so even the first speech of the five is all about the Toys R Us has his relationship to it so the organization Matthew is very intentional five blocks of teachings collections of teachings that are setting not only the structure of Matthew but also doing some kind of theology in a way yellow headlights heavy-duty look this this guy Jesus is giving a new Torah it's a Messianic Torah I'm a part of conversations when we talked about this Jesus mean when he says I came to steal of a toilet with her but the design of the Torah itself is showing that Israel consistently failed at being the Covenant Partners the god recruited them to be through Moses on Mount Sinai and so Moses himself anticipate the day in his speeches in the Torah when God well what he says they circumcise the heart transfer
 warm the heart of Israel so that they can truly live by God's Will and be God's covenant Partners In Jesus is saying in The Sermon on the Mount that that's what I'm here to do and Matthew this presenting Jesus as the new Moses is doing that is a new Moses doing the thing that Moses hoped would happen so it's not like Moses is bad Jesus it's good it's Moses hoped for something and that's the message is Torah and Jesus is here saying I'm doing the thing the mostest hope for
okay so Michelle The Sermon on the Mount is the first of five teaching blocks in the gospel of Matthew and here's something really interesting it has a lot in common with the fifth and final teaching Block in Matthew the last block is the one where Jesus confronts the scribes and Pharisees right right the one where he's been awarded you scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites for you shut the Kingdom of Heaven in people's faces her Timberland some insights about how these two blocks of teachings the first and the last work together he learned it from Professor Jonathan Pennington who teaches at Southern Seminary in Louisville I think it's called Little do for those with Southern cred08 Louisville Louisville all right let's hear from Jonathan Pennington from Lowville this is Jonathan
 highlight in terms of the structure of Matthew that the first teaching blocked but we call The Sermon on the Mount Matthew 5 27 and the last teaching block chapters 23 and 25 clearly parallel each other very intentionally a couple ways that we can see that is first of all Matthew 527 The Sermon on the Mount starts with a series of blessings a series of statements from Jesus about the ways of it happening the world that a chord with God's coming Kingdom that are going to bring his life they're going to bring you Shalom and a last is gorse chapter 23 has a series of seven woes what are the opposite to Blessings the opposite of the statements of Jesus they're saying that if you lived these ways that these are not going to result in Shalom this is not going to result in life for you and that way it's just like someone it's just like the Book of Proverbs here's one way of living versus another and that leads to the other parallel between the first and the last teachings of Jesus and Matthew that's the each of the men with
 series of Parables that present to his two ways of living The Sermon on the Mount chapter 7 ends with the broad and Narrow Gauge the true and false prophets the wizened elders men of you're probably familiar with those be made out of seeing that the last two scores chapters 23 to 25 ends also with a set of three Parables the 10 maidens the story about five who were prepared for the return of the the groom at 5 if you weren't the story of ten talents were where people are given different amounts of bags of gold or talented and they respond differently according to their faithfulness and then maybe most famous leave it at the parable Jesus gives at the end of the last teaching and chapter 25 the sheep and the goats two different people who respond differently in terms of how they live towards other people in the world based on whether they are following the ways of Jesus or not and so the point is Chapters 5 to 7 + 10 + 23 + 25
 are part of a beautiful elaborate structure of Matthew and to read The Sermon on the Mount well you really need to read it as part of the whole of what Matthew is teaching
 all right cool that's the structure and Matthew have some of them outfits with in Matthew now we're going to spend the next number of hours many hours as many hours as episodes of conversation just going line by line through this first block of teachings famously called The Sermon on the Mount and as we do well you'll show us how it connects to other parts of Matthew but really going to focus on the sermon so we'll do next is well actually talk through the structure and some of them out in a unique way
 it's time to turn our attention to the Sermon on the Mount itself how does sermon is structured so how do these 100 versus work as a collection what we're going to learn over and over this year is that The Sermon on the Mount has three main parts and introduction
 amazing body
 and a conclusion
let's start with the introduction the opening of The Sermon on the Mount
 tell about the surprise identity of those who follow Jesus it's only about 10 15% of the entire sermon but it sets the stage who is God working through his kingdom
 and then we move into the main body of the sermon
 now looking at a chart the main body is really almost the entirety of the sermon makes up like 80% of it there's a lot here all about this greater righteousness that Jesus is Calling his followers to The Sermon on the Mount ends with the choice
 we going to do which path are you going to take this is the conclusion and like the introduction it's short about 10 50% of the sermon surprise identity of those Jesus is Calling a greater righteousness that he's inviting us into and the choice he puts before us as he concludes
that's the big overall map of the structure of The Sermon on the Mount next week we begin at the beginning the introduction
 who is God working with to bring about the kingdom of the Skies
that's it for today's episode Hold on Till the End of the credits for a full reading of a Sermon on the Mount next week we start in the introduction on The Sermon on the Mount the surprise identity of those who participate in God's kingdom and John what is the very first word in the first sentence of The Sermon on the Mount person says blessed are the poor in spirit for the first word is blessed exactly next week we're going to look at what Jesus means by the word blessed we're going to read 9 sayings that are called the Beatitudes use of the blessed and blessed but my goal is to persuade you that the word blessed or blast is totally unhelpful here Bible project is a non-profit we exist to experience Bible and unified story that leads to Jesus and everything we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you thank you for being a part of this with us by this is Cooper here to read the credits Dan gumel is the creative producer for today's show for.

 how good is life for the poor in spirit because theirs is the kingdom of the Skies how good is life for those who grieve because they will be comforted how good is life for the unimportant because they will inherit the land
 how good is life for those who hunger and thirst for right relationships because they will be satisfied how good is life for those who show Mercy because they will be shown Mercy
 how good is life for the pure in heart because they will see God how good is life for the peacemakers because they will be called children of God
 how good is life for those who have been persecuted on account of doing what is right because theirs is the kingdom of the Skies
 how good is life for you when they insult you and persecute and speak any evil lies against you on account of me celebrate and Shout for Joy because your reward is great in the skies because this is how they persecuted the prophets before you
 you are the salt of the land but if the salts becomes on salty with what can it be made salty again it is useful for nothing except to be thrown out and stepped on by humans
 you are the light of the world a city that is set up on a mountain is not able to be hidden and they don't light a candle and place it under a basket rather upon a candle stand and it will shine on everyone in the house in the same way let your light shine before people so that they can see your good works and they can give honor to your father was in the skies
 don't suppose that I have come to do away with the Torah the prophet I have not come to do away with them but to fill them full because truly I tell you until the sky and the land pass on not one. Or one squiggle will pass on from the Torah until all things have taken place there for whoever undoes one of the least of these commands and then they teach people to do this that person will be called least in the Kingdom of the skies and whoever does the commands and then teaches people to do this that person will be called great in the Kingdom of the Skies
 because truly I tell you unless you're doing what is right far surpasses the scribes and Pharisees you won't be entering into the kingdom of the Skies
 you have heard that it was said to the Ancients you will not murder and whoever murders will be guilty by the court and I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be guilty by the court and whoever called his brother good-for-nothing will be guilty by the Sanhedrin and whoever says fool will be guilty of the fire of gehenna
 therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your offering there before the Altar and go first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering settle matters in a friendly way with your legal opponent while you are with him on the way so that your opponent doesn't hand you over to the court judge and the court judge to the officer so that you are thrown into prison
 truly I say to you you will not come out of there until you have paid back the last coin
 you have heard that it was said you will not commit adultery that I say to you that anyone who goes on looking at a woman in order to cultivate lust for her he has already committed adultery with her in his heart
 if your right eye causes your downfall tear it out and throw it from you for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into gehenna
 if your right hand causes your downfall cut it off and throw it from you for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to go off into Gahanna
 it has also been said whoever sends away his wife he must give her a certificate of divorce and I say to you that anyone who sends away his wife except on the ground of sexual immorality he makes her the victim of adultery and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery
 again you have heard that it was said to the Ancients do not break your oath but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made
 and I tell you do not swear an oath at all not by the sky because it is God's Throne not by the land because it is his footstool not by Jerusalem because it is the city of the great king and do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black
 but let your word be yes yes or no no anything beyond this comes from the evil one
 you have heard that it was said and I in recompense for an eye and a tooth in recompense for a two and I say to you do not resist in kind an evil person but whoever slaps you on your right cheek turn the other to him also
 if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt let him have your coat also whoever forces you to go one mile go with him two to the one who asks of you give in the one who wants to borrow from you don't turn away
 you haven't heard that it was said you will love your neighbor and you will hate your enemy
 I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be children of your father who is in the skies for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and he sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than others do not even the nation's do the same
 therefore you are to be whole as your father in the skies is hole
 be careful about your doing what is right don't do it in front of people for the purpose of being seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in the skies
 so then when you do ask generous giving don't signal with a trumpet before you like the Hypocrites do in the gathering places and Alleyways for the purpose of being honored by people truly I tell you they have fully received the reward but you when you do acts of generous giving don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your generous giving is done in a hidden escape and your father who sees what is done in a hiddenness he willfully reward you
 and when you pray don't be like the Hypocrites because they love to pray while standing in the gathering places and at the corners of wide streets for the purpose of being visible to people truly I tell you they have fully received their reward
 but you when you pray enter into your inner room and shut the door so you can pray to your father in Hidden escape and your father who sees what is done in Hidden has he willfully reward you
 and when you are praying don't use meaningless repetition like the nation's because they suppose that they will be heard on the count of their many words so don't be like them because your father knows what you need before you even ask him
 therefore When you pray do it this way
 Our Father who was in the skies may your name be recognized as holy
 may your kingdom come and may your will be done as it is in the skies so also on the land
 our daily provision of bread give to us today
 and forgive us our debts just as we also have forgiven those indebted to us
 and don't lead us to be tested but Deliver Us from the evil one
 for if you forgive people their transgressions your father in the skies will also forgive you
 but if you will not forgive people then neither will your father forgive your transgressions
 and when you fast don't look gloomy like the Hypocrites for they make their faces look disfigured so that their fasting will be visible to people truly I tell you they have fully received their reward
 but you when you fast anoint your head with oil and wash your face so that your fasting won't be visible to people but to your father in a hidden way and your father who sees what is hidden he willfully reward you don't store up for yourselves store and wealth on the land where moth and Nibbler can ruin and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves stored wealth in the sky where neither moth nor Nibbler can ruin and where thieves can try again or steal for where your stored wealth is there your heart will be also the lamp of the body is the eye so then if your eye is genuine and generous your whole body will be radiant
 but if your eye is bad and greedy your whole body will be dark if then the light that is in you is Darkness How great is the darkness
 no one is able to serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to one and despise the other you are not able to serve God and wealth
 because of this I say to you do not worry about your life being what you will eat or what you will drink not even about your body what you will put on isn't the living self more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air how they don't sow seed and they don't Harvest and they don't gather into Barns and yet your father in the skies feeds them aren't you all much more valuable than they
 and who among you is able to add an hour to your lifespan by worry and about clothing why do you worry pay attention to the Lilies of the Field how they grow they don't labor and they don't weave cloth but I say to you all that not even Solomon with all his honor clothe himself like one of these
 now if the grass of the field which is there today and tomorrow is tossed into the furnace is closed this way by God won't be much more clothe you all who have so little trust so then don't worry saying what will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear for clothing for the nation's they constantly seek for all these things and your father in the skies knows that you need all that
 rather first of all seek for his kingdom and doing what is right by him and all these things will be added to you
 so then don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow can worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own do not judge so that you will not be judged because with the Judgment that you judge you will be judged and with the measure that you measure it will be measured to you
 why do you see the speck in the eye of your brother but you don't proceed the beam in your eye or how can you say to your brother allow me to take out the speck from your eye and look the beam is in your eye
 hypocrite first take out the beam from your eye and then you can see clearly the speck in the eye of your brother
 do not give what is Holy to dogs and don't throw your pearls in front of pigs so they don't trample them with their feet and turning around they will tear you apart ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be opened for you for everyone who asks will receive and the one who seeks will find and to the one who knocks it will be opened or what person is among you who when their son asks for bread will give him a rock for when he asks for a fish will give him a snake
 so then if you all are bad but you know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in the skies give good things to those who ask
 so then everything you desire that people do to you so also you do to them for this is the Torah and the prophets
 enter through the narrow gate because wide is the gate and Broad is the road that leads to ruin and those who entered through it or many
 how narrow is the gate and constricted is the road that leads to life and those who find it are few watch out for illegitimate prophets who come to you in the clothing of sheep but inside they are wolves who snatched
 by their fruit you will recognize them do people gather grapes from Thorn bushes or figs from thistles similarly every good tree produces good fruit but the disease tree produces bad fruit a good tree cannot produce bad fruit and a disease to tree cannot produce good fruit
 every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire so then by their fruit you will recognize them
 not everyone who says to me master master will enter into the kingdom of the Skies but rather the one who does the desire of my father in the skies
 many will say to me on that day master master didn't we prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty acts in your name and then I will confess to them I have never known you go away from me you who act as if there is no Torah so then everyone who hears these words of mine and does them they will be like a wise man who built his house on a rock and the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and they fell upon that house but it did not fall because its foundation was on the Rock and everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them they will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand
 and the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and they fell upon that house and it fell and it's falling was he
