everybody this is Tim a Bible project and Welcome to our podcast we're in the middle of a series where we've been talking about the theme of priests and priestesses in the Bible and up till now we've been exploring the expectation of a coming Royal priest through the storyline of of the Hebrew Bible and in this week's episode we get to Jesus Jesus I saw himself as a royal Priestly figure most people often think of maybes a prophetic or the Royal identity of Jesus the king but he actually presented himself as a priest is just that we don't often have the eyes to see that that's what he saying and doing are we going to look at the story where Jesus heals a paralyzed man but then does something very Priestly he forgives the man's Tim and only Priests of that in ancient Israel going to look at the fascinating story of Jesus goes up to a mountain with some disciples and he starts glowing
 like Moses did I Mount Sinai and he starts to look like he's closed with the clothing of the high priest we're also going to tune into Jesus's arrest and trial before Caiaphas the high priest he began to ask Jesus a question about whether he thinks he's the high priest it's like a showdown of the anointed high priest we're going to look at these stories and whole bunch more thanks for joining us here we go
 we're talking about theme of priests the theme of the priesthood I think that's why I first thought of the word priesthood because it is talking about the office but as like a is an idea I think that's it and it's been a great conversation if you're jumping in right now this is episode 5 so there's a whole whole great conversation we've been recapping along the way I just want to really quick Creek at this time at the blitz yeah oh boy I never once we set timers yeah that's on page one of the Bible is introduced as the climax of God's creative work and God appoints these images who will embody and represent his own power and creativity and Rule and presents in the creation so that they will rule it on his back
 and be his presents the word image is the standard Biblical word used for idle statue that would be set up in the middle of a temple or sanctuary in the ancient near East this helps us understand one part of the human role which is to be God's presence in the Sacred Space the way that statues but also holy sacred humans were in those holy spaces in the song This is a way of thinking about the image of God that one layer of that role is a Priestly layer priest or figures who stand as a Gateway between having a nurse they represent God in physical form to people and they represent people before God and that's one core part of what the image of God is humans are called to be priests in the Sacred Space that's represented by the Garden of Eden but they are ushered into the fall in rebellion and their exiled from the blessing and life in abundance of Eden
 raising the question are humans ever going to gain access again to Eden and if so how is the putrid mess of rebellion and evil that they're creating going to be dealt with so that they can get back into the in space we meet a character named Abraham whose key to got the plan to restoring the blessing of Eden Wood blessing is a key in Motif and God tells him that time he's going to bless his family line and those who bless him will be blessed so that all the nations of the Earth can be blessed the first person in the story who blesses the line is Abram is not just a priest but also a king in free Israelite Jerusalem a guy named milk is a deck and their Abraham experience is God's blessing of abundance and eaten through this Royal priest in Jerusalem and it's awesome it's really great and it reminds us of the dream of one day not just him but all nations experiencing that blessing Abraham also ends up one of the time in Jerusalem
 acting like a priest having to surrender the wife of his son to God because of his own sins and so these two events in Jerusalem the Royal priest Abraham meets there and Abrams and having to cover for his own sins by offering the life of his son become an important image of the Priestly role that will need to take place here in Jerusalem to bring the blessing of God all the nations as we go on into the story we meet all these characters of Moses and Aaron and Moses was called to be one of these image of God Royal priest types but he's stubborn and unbelieving and God's promises and so his brother Aaron gets introduced into the mix he will be the priest of Israel but he turns out he's a lousy priest right from the beginning Moses and Aaron are doing things the wrong way together and then right when Moses is invited up into the high sacred place on the mountain where he is
 the image of God and seeing a new Eden that he wants to create in the tent what is his brother Aaron doing will be the high priest he's down at the base of mountain creating a false image and leading is real and idolatry and from that point on the line of priest through Aaron in the line of Levi for Israel is pretty much just a failed institution the way the biblical authors are presenting it and this creates the need for someone else who's not from that line will be like that Abraham no kids attack new Humanity type of figure that we're looking for when were introduced to David he is introduced as this one who will become the face. One Facebook priest and we're told that God is going to build him a family that will be faithful so the story of David we watch David establish go to the very City where El where milk is attack was a priest-king and he reinstates the milk is it a type of King priesthood David becomes a royal priest
 he recreates Jerusalem as the new Eden gets eaten Gifts of food and worship son every seventh step and it's awesome and God makes to him an even greater promised and Abraham that through his line one particular descendant will come to restore God's kingdom to the world and bring it into the nation's the David Fales all of his descendants Spell creating the need for someone to come to be that new Royal priest open up the way back to Eden David in a poem that we call someone 10 reflects on all of this together and anticipates a future figure that he calls his Lord who will share and God's rule over the world who will Vanquish the enemies and the seed of The Serpent and the serpent and this figure is called a priest forever according to the line of milk is a deck and so that's what the Hebrew Bible is anticipating a notch
 traditional naan levite priests can Google open up the way back to Eden Thoughts with the story so far well done how long does it take 5 or 6 that's great I just you know I was picturing the whole time was one of those RSA Drovers hates him yeah well I thought we just hop in the book of Isaiah real quick to just look at a couple things that'll launches right into the story of Jesus as the book of Isaiah opens in chapter one we're not going to read it I always say that and we end up reading as we're not going to read it but it's a description of Jerusalem as the anti Ethan Isaiah chapter one ends describing Israel planting their own Gardens the gardens that they have devised and worshipping false gods there and Injustice that's terrible and so has a has this vision
 we looked at before in chapter to where he sees the mountain of Yahweh exhausted up and all the nations streaming up to it like a river going against gravity a new house of Yahweh we worship God and His justice of peace that's the opening vision and you're like yeah let's get some of that going on so the book is just Recycling and spiraling with that basic hope of naming what's wrong with Jerusalem in the present-day and aiming at that future goal as you go throughout the book a figure gets attached to the how Drew slim is going to be purified and restore it and it gets its attached to a seed from the line of David as a chapter 11 is a really important Point here but this figure has a strong Royal identity in the earlier part of the buckets the line of David new rules and such but as it goes throughout Isaiah this figure takes on the title of the servant ends in son Passage
 it's hard to tell whether this figure is a king or a prophet where priests cuz they do all all of those things and for long times has puzzled Scholars like who or what is the service is it a new Moses is that a new David what is it and I've come to the conviction that the point is it's all of them that all of these figures prophets priest-kings makeup narrative images in the Bible of which the servant is the Mosaic the takes up the Moses story The David story The Abraham story and those characters become images were all brought together in the servant so I just want to look at a couple of passages one is from the famous suffering servant passage in Isaiah 52 and 53 in verse 13 of chapter 52 God speaking he says look my servant will prosper he will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted just asthma
 we were astonished at you my people in Israel being Israel so also his my servants appearance was more disfigured than any human and his form was more disfigured than any of the sons of Ben us he will sprinkle many nations Kings will shut their mouths so I counted him because what they have never been told they will all of a sudden see them what they've never heard they will come to understand sprinkling is that the Priestly thing the sprinkling of the blood on the altar okay totally right so there's the speaker called God's servant who's going to be lifted up and exhausted but then immediately told he's going to get worked over his appearance is going to be more disfigured oh that's a that's not because he's just ugly
 eating that sprinkling the blood having people be shocked at him because he's so beat up and somehow that exaltation by being beat up is the way that he sprinkles the nation's is come to sacrifice us for what the priest does on the day of atonement when he goes into the holy of holies such a good example of how hyperlinking where what the priest does High Priestess on the day of atonement is now associated with this Royal Prophet priest but also verse 14 this disfiguring or suffering of the servant is compared to just as many people are astonished or shocked at you Israel yeah it says if Israel suffering in Exile becomes all focused in on one representative figure
 who will go through and exiled as moment on behalf to cover for the sins of the many remarkable stuff yes who sacrificed himself is sacrificing himself and so we think the moment of Moses on Mount Sinai here and then also have David at the very end of the book of 2nd Samuel which we haven't actually read that story in India together we need to and he makes a huge mistake brings disaster if there's a disease spreading through Jerusalem and he offers his life in the place of the people for advice for his own sins and so the servant is doing the Baby Moses stuff
so this figure comes up again and Isaiah chapter 61 in a passage that was very important to Jesus this is a passage Jesus reads from in Nazareth so it opens up a speaks and says the spirit of Yahweh God is upon me because he always has anointed me so that word anoint never mention this to the word Messiah means anointed one there only two figures called anointed one in the Hebrew Bible David was an accident this is a hyperlink to that because when David was anointed by Samuel we were told the spirit of God Came Upon him so this is the David figure but also the only other figure that's called the anointed one in Israel's life in the Torah is either a king or the or the priest by priests is also called the anointed one and there's no offices
 called what's that it's too often. To the characters of two offices that can be referred to as the anointed one the king in the high priest which in the narrative once they split Israel's life there different but the whole point is that they're not supposed to be different or supposed to be together like in milk is it at core like David or the image of God so this figure is an anointed one by godspeed You brings good news to The Afflicted and this is the this is the Year of Jubilee that Jesus excuse me with the Jubilee year was announced with by blowing the horn on the day of atonement launches the beginning of their religious year for their liturgical year 3 this servant Spirit anointed one servant keep speaking he says I am here to Grant's to everybody in Zion who's grieving and morning I'm going to give them a Garland
 instead of Ashes mixed cool necklace then he says this I'm going to give them the oil of gladness instead of morning she's going to I'm going to give them a mantle of Praise instead of a spirit of fainting he's going to give them anointing and new job with a metal so they're going to get new cloaks new new clothes and new oil so here's what these new newly anointed newly clothes people will be called This is first three they will be called Oaks of righteousness that Yahweh has planted so that you may be glorified he's going to plant a forest of new trees and these trees will lead God's reputation to be you know exhausted Glory
 that's awesome they're going to rebuild ancient ruins Rays up for more devastations the rebuilding becomes a motif and Isaiah of restoring Ethan is rebuilding the ruins creation rebuilding the ruined City look at verse 6 and you all that is these people that this anointed one is going to give new clothes too if he says y'all will be called the priests of y'all way you will be spoken of as the Ministers of our God you'll eat the wealth of the Nations and in their riches you'll burst why does it go from what was that third person is second person if they they they and then but you skipped right here in here in just 5 yeah yeah it is here it's the servant yeah that's a good point he's talking about this plural group that this anointed one is
 find a speak to and they're described as day and then in verse five it shifts to you and you think about that more I know the answer is that the servant sees themselves as doing something for a group of people that will then take on his character trait he's an anointed Royal priest and so they are going to start acting and dressing and like priests are they will be called all the threads together here and there going to be a feast big faced you eat The Wealth of Nations Isaiah but these are the texts you know the Jesus grew up on Jesus reads from this text today that he launches his public Mission which tells us he did believe that he was on the scene to do something that he uniquely and only he could do but as a crucial part of his mission he started these groups of people that
 is it wouldn't send out to represent him so he did he wasn't like a loner what like The Lone Ranger he saw himself as a royal priest who was creating a community of people that would share in his role and then go out and so that's essentially you know this so much and he Revival but all these threads that come together to create this figure that the Hebrew Bible tells us we need to restore in open the way back to Ethan for the new planting of the garden and it's all of this is Jesus's I activating my name when it comes on to the scene all of this is sitting there waiting to be activated when Jesus comes on to the scene so reliable not a thing that you're tired but that's a launching pad into the into the gospel it's cool to see this passage come to life and new ways
 amazing how hyperlinked things really are yes it's like just this core vocabulary and ideas and when you read this passage kind of pop it up. It's just like wow this is all seems really cryptic and random please follow these ideas yeah and it's like a really beautiful way to explore these themes and to then project for like where this is all heading how many themed videos with Med Center in this one Tom spirit Spirit of God anointed one the favorable year of the Lord that's all about our Sabbath good news to The Afflicted yep that's right and then these the planting of the Lord in the Oaks of righteousness that's Eden imagery like Temple and area of Life 3
 where trees yep ruins and devastations and ruined cities is exile and restoration imagery and then priest separate out and kind of study independently through the biblical story together we can make sense of that make sense of it yeah but it's all interconnected it's a unified story even though it's not a straightforward linear story Symphony metaphors makes a lot of sense as you got this just beautiful movement Steppin Steppin Stone the Hebrew Bible is anticipating is preceded woman and a big part of the role and identity of this coming one is a Priestly roll opening the way back to Eden on behalf of all Humanity to restore the location of the image of God
 we're going to see is the Jesus was fully to and end all of this and Austin some of the odd cryptic things that he says to describe himself or him doing this poem and Isaiah 61 is doing is using scriptural imagery that's bound up with the set of Royal priest themes to describe who he was and what he came to do so I thought we could touch down on a few texts and just kind of show this at work and it all comes culminating up to the moment where Jesus the Royal priest stands before Caiaphas the annoyed that I freeze in The Showdown off anointed ones and one perhaps we could call it his ordination
so this is a story we've looked at multiple times to Jesus goes to the Jordan baptized now in baptism I mean this was John the Baptist was doing this kind of like what you call it the movement Israelites back to the Jordan River where they've crossed into the promised land kind of Crossett re-enter it and this is all connected to the biblical theme of going through the waters the chaos Waters out into life and so how common was this practice oh well it was a standard ritual symbol that most Jews did pretty regularly don't give themselves in a river or more often in little self-made or created pools are called mcboat which is just means a little gathering of water and but yeah before you would or you just do it
 your hands as your hands and renewal kind of symbol and yeah it was a fixture in the daily weekly. Something you would do often you do often what's unique about what John's doing is that he's doing it at the Jordan River and he's saying that he's launching a new king of a Godless man and the gods about to come do anything that's kind of the charged atmosphere so when Jesus comes to identify himself with this movement something unique happens when he goes into the waters it's a Mount Sinai Moment Like Mount Sinai happens to the heavens open a cloud appears and the voice comes from the sky and God's presence comes down in a bird-like form and there's this we have to make a video about this I think you know how to read the gospels of the whole section on their God speech combines three
 Hebrew Bible hyperlinks viewer my son quote from Psalm to about the seed of David the beloved one says what God called Isaac and that story about Abraham and Isaac we looked at Genesis 22 the sacrifice and then in you or with you I am pleased is a quote from the opening line of the first servant poem in the book of Isaiah we read from the third suffering serve the phone so the seed of David who will do the The Isaacs thing which is to cover over the sins of the people and Isaiah 42 that Royal Priestly one who will give up his life is all packed in here so dense but the fact that the spirit comes down upon him when he gets the oil poured on his head the spirit Came Upon him and so Spirit empowerment comes synonymous with annoy
 Haitian ceremony of the Priestly Duty again priest is not separate from King the whole idea is that they're actually ideally supposed to be joined in the attack model and so just as baptism through these hyperlinks in the spirit I think is all being portrayed as his anointing seen to be the Royal priest that's a good example real saddle I think it's right there now you know you can just kind of kind of see it next door next chapter of Mark chapter two this is the story about the paralyzed man Jesus is hanging out and house all these people crowd around and this poor guys want to get there paralyzed friend is paralyzed legs in front of him so they rip apart the roof to do some holy vandalism to get the guy from Jesus Jesus verse 5 C's their face and then he said to the paralyzed man I thought some remarkable little detail that
 relates to the paralyzed man on the basis of the faith of his friends where's a long walk sometimes it's a community's face surrounding someone that can release God's power on that person's behalf if they don't cops have the face for themselves or the ability to move their body or the ability to exit powerful being made in just a few words what's interesting is that very clearly this man the needs of a physical restoration what Jesus says to the man is your sins are forgiven which out you know my trying to imagine the scene part of me can't imagine that the guy would be like that thank you Jesus but if you noticed that other issues too but I think they just think about it differently to be paralyzed is to live outside of eating because of the sea
 signs of humanity and since my people are so actually remember and they were ham story for the blessings of eating to be released he had to surrender all for his own since surrender the life of the sun's so forgiveness of sins is really keyed into this restoration to the the power in life of Eden so seems like Jesus is dealing on that level here in the narrative quickly shift and we're told that some religious Bible nerds are sitting there eating their reasoning in their hearts are they licensed professional audition and the priests all become kind of a collective character in opposition to Jesus and this is one of the first opposition stories but if I'm a scribe am I am I doing that on the side or is that like my
 what about your Bible teacher in the synagogue system that is overseen and connected to the Jerusalem religious establishment if you had like a church denomination that you know trains and commissions pastors to local parishes or churches kind of a part of the centralized than every one of those pastors represents and is accountable to the denominational headquarters yeah that's kind of how this would work good with the scribes are describes local Representatives City and town Representatives that represent the Bible Institute so they're sitting there listening to the say that and immediately they say he's blaspheming which means he's he's saying something that brings God's reputation into disrepute and he is
 more than that he's stepping on God's toes he's saying and doing things that are only appropriate for God to do and that's exactly what they say they can say who can first give send the one God knows how they used to the wording of the Shema right there the one got so this is fascinating cuz it's Jesus just as your sins are forgiven could be taken to mean by God God has forgiven you but that's not his role well first of all this is two things so one is there's a perfectly good way to get your sins forgiven you go to a priest and you go to the library you go to the temple that's the first shocker is Jesus is making available here up in Galilee in this house this thing that is realistic posed to get through the official Channel and Priests here so that you know it's just like going over to my neighbor and saying hey you know your mortgage is done
 and then their lender will give them a call and be like and who told you you're sorry that guy don't listen to that guy does a great example example even would be something where you really do have to go somewhere special to make that happen oh yeah that's right the DMV for non-american listen to that's the Department of Motor Vehicles so it's sort of like just saying I grant you a new license yes you're like you're not the person this is not the place yet so that could have been at it's just Jesus is claiming Priestly Authority but that's not the conclusion that the Bible nerds draw they see Jesus as infringing on God's reputation cuz they say who can forgive sins but the one God so even what they recognizes when the priest is there pronouncing the Forgiveness of sins it's not the priest for giving it's the precinct
 your sins are forgiven by God and they see Jesus taking on Divine Authority with this Proclamation so Jesus is the way of all this and it says what's the problem here why are you saying last night so he creates a little puzzle for them he says which is easier to say this guy your sins are forgiven or to say get up pick up your mat and walk obvious anybody can say for any coup can go around saying God forgives you there how would you know if he's actually successful at that yeah that's right yeah this is the moment of like how who authorizes you to give me a new license yeah and then you would pull out your DMV credentials or something but can you show me it was the actual he says but I want you to know that the son of humanity has Authority on on the land to forgive
 send and he says to the paralytic get up pick up your mat so first of all notice he doesn't call himself king or priest uses the Daniel way to talk about so I noticed what he says it has Authority on Earth so Jesus sees himself as a figure on Earth who's the Earthly representative of God's Heavenly Authority and the what does that but a royal and Priests let's is the image of God let them Rule and in this case Jesus exerts his power and Rule as the image of God or the son of man through this Priestly at the son of man is a Priestly King I think so a layer of the sun of man's identity Dan even look up Daniel that a scholar Crispin Fletcher Louis that we've interviewed before he kind of alerted me to that so Jesus is asserting not just Priestly Authority but
 age of God and sword of God as a human being in God's place in our God's bath what God does not mean the heavens yes on demand this is a Priestly activity
 let's go to Mark chapter 9 through this is my disciples who are going to die before you see the kingdom of God coming with its power at school wonder when that's going to happen will six days later implication on the 7th Day on the 7th Day Jesus Took Peter James and John had went to a high mountain of course they went to 11 stay and he was metamorphed the creek for metamorphed in front of them and his closing became glowing and extremely white and then Mark has its detail more white than any laundry machines but I could ever get them why
 I wonder if he's probably had some sort of had something a natural form so it's really interesting so we talked about the Priestly garments Yang white linen gems and gold gold shiny whiteness to pre's that's what I figured on top of the mountain when he's up there for seeding doing Priestly stuff on behalf of the people even willing to offer his own life for their sins and so here it's as if they're the disciples are getting a glimpse of Jesus's real identity which is this exalted Royal priest image of God figure that Moses was like on occasion you know right but that apparently Jesus is just as his identity Mark also tells us that Elijah along with Moses appeared and they were talking
 all kinds of stuff there Elijah and Moses both wrong Mount Sinai post me God in the clouds in the fire what's interesting here is that Jesus is depicted as like a you know a new Moses but I think by putting having Elijah and Moses their it also is making a claim that he's not just a new Elijah and a new Moses he is the one that Elijah and Moses on the mountain encounter God as Fire on the Mountain but now Jesus is the one radiating with light and power and he's the one they are seeing and talking with that makes sense yeah this is some like Christopher Nolan and his storytelling tell Moses his glowing because he encounters the one who is the source of fire and light Jesus is right here the source of the light in the fire of Christopher Nolan
 my mini messes with I can just you know you have this picture of Moses going up to Mount Sinai meeting with Yahweh and now this other seen its Moses up on a mountain meeting with Jesus transfigured and he's Jesus is the one radiating Jesus the one radiator hose connections I do I just watch Inception again so I just noticed you could we make three Tabernacles you'll get your own you'll have a special Tabernacle just for you but you should also have a tabernacle and then Mark I love this Mark stepped outside the store I need tells the reader he didn't know what he was saying they were terrified
 and then there's a link back to the listen to design pattern in Mark's gospel replace the baptism scene another Cloud came over shattering and the voice comes repeat the the anointing this is my son the beloved one but there's one tweak listen to him actually this is a quote from what Moses says in Deuteronomy 10 you always going to raise up a prophet like me listen to him and you should listen to him so this is a Avenue Moses the most searched thing is all of a sudden then next verse all at once they looked around and it's all done and if they were coming down the mountain Jesus gave them orders strict orders don't tell anyone what they saw until the son of man rises from the dead so there's something that they just witness that won't make sense to anybody until his death and then is Vindication from Death then the story will
 make sense and so what else is this but another one of these rich Dent stories painting Jesus as well not just the image of God and the royal priesthood will give up his life but the one who Moses met when he was being an image of God giving up his life so that's the Inception piece that you were getting that they're right well Moses on Mount Sinai was giving his life for the sins of the people in the presence of a radiating Divine one and now Jesus is the grating Divine one who's going to give up his life is there yeah so began the point of bringing this up is this story assumes all of this cool stuff about that the Royal priest okay do more more Jesus Jesus goes to Jerusalem and he throws down he rides in on a donkey just like Solomon did when he was in Throne of David is declare
 King over Jerusalem any rides in on Donkey so Jesus activates all that and he just begins a week of Showdown lots of Bible disputes in theology disputes but they're all they'll have political Freight to them so there's one story where Jesus kind of pics the Bible in the Bible debate and it's a pretty sure those story at Cinemark 12:35 started to say as he was teaching in the temple how is it that the scribes say that the Messiah is the son of David David himself said by the Holy Spirit quote the Lord said to my Lord sit at my right hand until I put your enemies Beneath Your Feet Jesus then picks up again David himself calls this one Lord so in what senses
 he his son and the large crowd really enjoyed this one times he quote Psalm 110 110 was important to Jesus
 but he's also pointing out something interesting the David the most a royal authority figure in the Old Testament call someone else his horde now he's come to turning up the rhetoric like how is the Messiah the Son of David I don't think the Jesus is saying the Messiah doesn't come from the line of David actually here I'm going to let Ben witherington bring some clarity from the commentary on the gospel of Mark he says quote is Jesus repudiating the davidic origins of the Messiah some have suggested this but it seems unlikely since elsewhere he doesn't repudiate the title son of David suppose some people called son of David and he accepts it but wetherington he may well have repudiated certain popular Jewish Notions about the davidic Messiah for instance that he would be just a normal God empowered human being like David himself
 it's best to say that Jesus is refuting the adequacy not the accuracy of assessing the Messiah by means of his davidic to send the point is that in Jesus view the Messiah is more than but not other than the son of David I think that's truly right so he's saying that yes of course he comes from the line of David but the fact that he is exalted to share in God's rule how could he merely be the son of David that's right Jesus wants to define the role of the Messiah the identity of the Messiah by his relationship to God primarily not simply to David his dependency from day and to make the point quotes from Psalm 110 which is this exhaust see the David who's the new Melchizedek priest-king who embodies God's rules he's checking in on how this lineup
 David idea is connected to this milk his attack priest king ideal those two ideas can emerge and we're looking for someone who is Ultimate priest-king who is from the line of David but isn't merely that's right son of David is more some more this is Jesus making this point from the Hebrew Bible and so are you know you could just say well he's Jesus you know he can say what it means cuz he's Jesus but I think he's actually tapping into what we've been tracing that the Revival is telling us that this figure something more going on at this figure
okay so this all leads us up to The Showdown of the two anointed ones in the trial of Jesus before Caiaphas but the high priest so there's two moments in Jesus trial that is one highlight year the first is he gets arrested in the garden where he surrenders his will to the father's will and then he's taken into the Sanhedrin kind of the key power Brokers so first what some people are trying to do is actually make some kind of legal case against him if they can you do verify so some people get up and start saying what they heard Jesus teaching and they were given a quote here we heard Jesus say I'm going to destroy this Temple that is made with hands and in three days build another Temple made without hands so this is what he said in their minds this is damning evidence that he's a threat to the temple remember all the way back to that promise to David
 they all raise up a seed from your line and he will build my house that raised the question of life is that and the building and this building we have here as a second version of it but very clearly Jesus has thinks that the seed of David in the house that will be built is you just has made without hands something else sounds to me like a family what other kind of house is there in Hebrew if there's a physical house or the warehouse coming household family member David said I want to build you a house to build you a house meaning of family family yeah so in Jesse's mind the temple building has and this is after Jesus performed to start in the temple shutting it down the sacrificial system in declaring that the building would be destroyed so Jesus has in mind a more enduring house that he's here to build that doesn't consist with hands
 I incidentally that little phrase made without hands comes from Daniel chapter 2 the describes the meteor that strikes down the statue of four metals it's a little phrase it said never The Rock flying out and it says it was a rock cut without hands do is cut with us anyway Jesus just doesn't answer anybody and so finally the high priest Santa page 38 comes up to him and says listen tell me are you the anointed one cut to the chase the anointed one do you think you're in charge here that's red and then I noticed you quit being the anointed one with being the Son of God so he's not just saying do you think you're like another the average price is going to take my job are you claiming to be the the image of God no kids had a priest-king
 Jesus says I am in Matthews version Jesus is a little more Jesus says when you say that I am but the key thing is what Jesus says next it's his second quotation from Psalm 110 combined with Matthews version makes it super clear you say that I am but I tell you from this moment forward you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the Clouds Of Heaven so Psalm 110 just sitting at the right hand of power sitting at the right hand yeah that's right sitting at the right hand and then son of man and going on the closet Heaven that's why I know 77 and response is exactly what the scribes was back at the at the house he says he tears his clothes and he says blasphemy and to everybody in the room Jesus did something worthy of death cuz this is what SEALs the deal for their yeah so he's
 I'm just saying I'd like another priest this is as Jewish he revived alive okay as you could say I'm that one that Moses met on the mountain I am the one that David talks about in Psalm 110 I am not one that Daniel had a vision about that it goes to the right hand of the human that extends to the right hand of God yeah the roads lead back from those passages to the image of God of Genesis 1 the ideal vision of humanity that humanity is for I am the ideal human and as the ideal human I am anointed as the king and priest to make a way for everyone else but he did say that he just said it in his own way in the very bottom there anybody listening if you want to go next level on
 the depiction of Jesus as a priest in the gospels Nicholas Perrin New Testament scholar at Wheaton eye has book called Jesus the priest too short and to-the-point this is his kind of comment on the trial scene of Jesus great ice is all along Jesus has been hinting at his own identity as the Royal Priestly son of man in flat contradiction to the high priest on tenure marks account is a tale of two competing Priestly powers and now and Mark 14 Jesus finally comes into a confrontation with Caiaphas declaring his Doom an unmistakable scriptural terms Daniel 7 and Psalm 110 share more than a few themes subjugation of God's enemies Divine rule judgment priesthood Daniel Son of Man is a Priestly secure and an exalted stacker. 11 office Sakura Saku.

 I know kids back both text present visions of a Priestly figure in conflict with God's enemies who proves ultimately Victorious for Mark Jesus is this Royal Priestly son of man The Milk Pail Kids that I can't type either David who displaces and judges Caiaphas why is kind of biscuits so take me to do some translating on the Fly there yeah I know he's he's riding milk is a deck in his identity I'd David David David David who will displace and judge to say that Jesus is the son of man and his attack is to say that Caiaphas is like the king of Sodom from Genesis 14 or the Beast the piece of Kingdom stuff of Daniel chapter 7 really the son of man is exalted over the Beast and the Beast want to Genesis 14 is the true king
 in contrast to the greedy king of Sodom who just wants to get rich off Abraham. One just came to be in the moment but yeah he's a contrast from start to finish the gospel of Mark we can do half a dozen more texts but this is like literally a red thread the Priestly identity of Jesus's apostles are in this is why I love you so much Temple and Priestly language to talk about Jesus's followers cuz if my identity is shaped by the one who did this on my behalf so that he becomes what I am so that I can become what he is it means those followers of Jesus we will take on a Priestly layer to our identity and you see that it work and an accent in the apostles to so the recession in a little bit and then I think this just has huge implications for you than what we think about what the mission or significance of a local group of his followers is in the world
