hello Tim hey John and that means if someone else here with us yet yeah yeah I'm Steve Atkinson John good to be here for Euless l c u l a r project and here we go it's the end of 2022 and we wanted to just take a step out of our normal can talking about bible stuff and reflect on the year so far with the journey has been like and celebrate with all of you who listen to podcast about the really cool stuff has been happening yeah we did this last year and the Year Steve you were with us knows a lot of fun so it again thank you once a year once a year that's all we need of you guys just go back and run everything give the people what they want you back so
 let's reflect on the year it's been a wild year it's been wonderful year 2020 to try to process process it for this year they're really marked us was releasing the app yes we release that at the very beginning of this year 2022 so this time last year we're hustling to get it on the App Store we've never released a nap would never done anything like this we're going for it and and we get it up on January one so that not only does the app release but a whole new reading experience that goes with it would release that we've been called a journey to the tour the reading Journey yeah that was a big project so many people on our team work so hard to release that into the world is there on January 1st and then really amazing to see all the interaction with it if these are data guy
 what's actually at that scary that you're calling me the damn about the room I know the data guy and Dad where we're currently at is 685000 downloads which is exciting than 170,000 active monthly active users and but I'm excited about the yeah because it's a great place to house all of our content so you can watch all of the videos they are the podcasts are there and they're set up and grouped in a way I think it's a lot easier to find than some of the other platforms and so makes me think Steve for years early in the project won't be as you because you've been a cheerleader for the project for so many years before you came on into leadership and I remember one of the consistent themes you would bring up and talking to patrons are sharing it with people is people wishing there was
 it's like a One-Stop shopping center for all the content in one convenient place in the website did that in certain ways but does the app finally satisfy the desires of your heart satisfied satisfied person because it doesn't it it does how's everything and it's right there and it's on our phone and at some of the data suggests more and more of our content is been viewed over the phone over any other device and so super excited about that these kids and their apps app isn't everything we wanted to be and we got a long ways to go so excited about this first start in the fact that we continue to receive Patron comments from folks are talking about how much they love the app and so when people ask where can I find a pipe gas where can I find it just so encouraging to say download the app you can find it all there yet so something that is not we don't celebrate a lot is that all the contents there it's also a
 when you watch a video or listen to podcast we have a feature that kind of gives you the notes as you're watching Alyssa as you listening or watching which is cool and so that's that's my supervisor so the app was a big splash big project the reading Journeys that we created and it's kind of a kind of interactive reading experience was through the whole Torah like 1/4 of the bible really says a quarter of the Bible by page count yeah we have the New Testament is is about 1/4 of the length of the whole Bible if you had three parts. So I think of it like the three parts of the Tanakh Torah prophets writings New Testament yes so he should join and we divided the five strolls into three parts eat or in Genesis for so it was a big that was a big part of what we were
 making and releasing and it was the first year where we spent a whole bunch of time releasing something that wasn't in video form write a lot of content that wasn't in video form it was in the app where you could explore theme while reading through that part of the Bible talk about that because the big vision for the app is not only is all the contacts that's about like as you need it when you need it but the big dream of the app is that you can learn this the skills these literary skills that we boring you can learn them while while interacting with the Bible so you're learning the skills while you're reading the Bible and in like a really painless way like that that's the idea is like in there you're exploring if you're you're interacting and a really cool wet that's a big
 big project that were undertaking and the journey through the Torah tracing a theme was kind of like a big swing at what could that interactive Bible be like how could you redo the whole Torah also learn these biblical themes at the same time learn how to see one section of a of a Biblical scroll and just follow one where did idea through that section and that's what we're trying to help people develop the awareness and skill for how to do that so it's kind of like you could take a class on themes in the Bible or you could read the Bible and we're trying to combine those two until you actually learn how to trace a theme as you actually read through those kind of the big idea so we learned so much and it was so rewarding to get through the Torah and next year as we think about how do we interact with the Bible within the app
 we're going to go for like smaller wins that allows to try a lot more stuff like reading plans or skill development ways to access our content and interact with that because what we're doing with this interactive Bible is really knew like I don't think it's the study Bibles there is digital Bibles native digital Study Bible which by that I mean like you could this what we were talking about in terms of like Maps they did Xander our product leave for the app can I give us this metaphor where he talked about how it used to be Steve you you you talk about the like the maps that used to have in the car. We're just called the Thomas Guy Thomas guy and then you would drive off the page and you then had to go to page
 Sadie Sevyn. So pick it up so your shower traffic not dangerous at all like like a AAA and the print the real old days but I thought you wanted a map if you're going to take a big road trip you can go to AAA and they would match the entire trip so you to have these books and it would be highlighted but a page can only contain so much content so you flip the page and then there was the highlighted route and then came along MapQuest it was a wet yeah the red line that traced your route put in my to directions and it's like you're still it was magic and I would I love to was someone would start to give you directions and then you said don't worry
 you can get there you've never been there trust me I've got this special PCS software so what MapQuest wasn't was just a digital version of an analog map right to scanning a map and here now you have a map on your computer it was a brand new thing that'll up native and then from there Google Maps has gone just a street view Google Earth view look up businesses know what to tell you what Lane to get into drive about it's been this Edward of process where it's not where they started when I do I get excited cuz I think we've got a foundation that we can now build on yeah so the low-hanging fruit for us right now is just get you access to our content while you're in the Bible and we're doing that and there's some interesting design challenges they are but it's fairly straightforward the big
 design opportunity is the Google maps of the Bible because when we talked about structure right and you look at their literary design design section or a paragraph yeah you can get really complicated especially when you just try to think about abstractly or talk about it but when you can start to see it scale of Zoom like a text level and then zoom out and see it at the movement level and see if the scroll level and collections of Scrolls and be able to see all the stuff that you point out
 how cool is that going to be pretty cool to be pretty cool so next year we're going to we're going to just keep going at what are some small wins to learn how to do this right because cuz it's a really cool what we are working on in the in the air to come the fact that we poured so much energy into the app also had other implications for the other content we've released throughout the year yeah our focus on the journey we we thought that we could come to rely on our back catalogue and put the team's focus on on Journey going to the app with themed videos we've already released and we will end this weekend releases many thing but use this year we did however put an animation studio on a special project
 which we haven't fully this is the sound of me rubbing my hands were working on the mega mega series that is so awesome yeah it's going to become a eat but next year you'll start to see it come out at the end of next year but we were able to put our animation team largely on just like this big ten part Mega series on a really important part of the Bible and really cool and the level of designed it keeps just going on a blessing a curse was released Beautiful video on the theme of busting a eternal life which we did in the doodle style of our very first video I haven't Unearthed in that work together
 the Furby always makes an apparent look for the Furby love the doodle style so yeah the big idea there was a ton of life is a gift from God that can begin now and then as of the release of this podcast been unreal time it's going to be another thing video called the firstborn will come out this week which is the last will be first to what did I say I was just glad you're clear on that what do we have in store for next year was coming out as well so we we want to put out more content than we did this year and
 so we've got four theme videos coming out next year it'll be tracing idea from you want do you want to say what they are going to be I have this my mind being awaited you ask me the question but I think you know the United yet which is the theme of the the word the Christ origin of the word Christ about somebody who gets oil poured on their head and then the land and yes so good the city the city and the last but definitely not least the chaos dragon dragons first I'm hearing is that revelation
 the sea dragons on page one this clearly miss her so many heads in Psalm 74 cast of the cast Dragon listen to the podcast even listen for a while you just grabs the chaos dragon turns into a staff floor anymore we're going to do so if you remember visual commentary videos weed we started on those and we paused on those for this year for this year but we got more coming out so we're rebuilding that and we're going to do more of those yet and the origin of the idea there was my friend Brian Russell from
 he said hey you guys going to do a video for every chapter of the Bible and no chapters of the Bible and then we went away and thought about it when I like maybe 30 commentary just trying to figure out how how would we do that and he will be super used for women reboot those over also going to be doing a scrollable Content next year are you going to matter where well I am aware of it but I didn't know that it was called that until this moment we'll Steve's super cap on the scrollable revolution that's what the fuck did you know more people are Googling and Tick Tock than on Google absolutely last week you know how Fax work nowadays I yeah yeah yeah
 but YouTube shorts you the YouTube algorithm actually rewards short-form content now that's more scrollable Instagram stories Facebook has their own thing and I and it's a different type of media then we do these five minutes plus you know dance beautiful really cool explanation Edition videos what you can't just put on YouTube shorts or Tick Tock it's got to be it's in portrait mode meaning you're holding the camera vertical you have a couple seconds to grab someone's attention and then make it relevant this kind of a tone and a methodology to just that type of media so we're going to be releasing content in that form of media starting next year as well John is the the hope that in this Global content cuz you can't communicate all that you want to communicate with the catch someone's attention
 and then have them go to the website or to yeah that would be one thing but the other thing is what can you teach in a minute in 60 seconds you can do some cool stuff you can keep some cool ideas and then you string a bunch of those together and all the sudden you are just
 a Seminary graduate and pissing me off more of it and if that weren't enough we also have a full on my Bible classroom about a project classroom is in full steam ahead we slow down for the covid. Couldn't feel more during a flag but we started filming with covid protocol and then we're able to in the last half of this year keep going to be filmed actually five classes 2022 what well and we leased or 1 2 3 4 we released Noah to Abraham which is it a class in Genesis that Utah yep Genesis 6 through 9 6211
 you can do having an earth Witch is Genesis 1 and 2 you can do Adam to Noah yet just us three through six 235 235 know that Abraham yeah you got it yeah we really start of biblical words how to study biblical words that was a mini class actually shorter dr. Carmen irons came and did an overview class of Exodus crawl that was awesome and that's out and then yet to be released from us sitting here but going to be released by the end of the year is a class and overview on 1 Corinthians switch the one you know by the one we Americans say first
 and it's definitely not as first letter he says in the letter that it's a second letter so anyway doctor Lucy peppiatt came and taught that class and so those are classes we released but as far as the classroom audience Steve I know you get to hear a lot of feedback and also kind of our data analysis to John first I thought the Pagoda as I looked down and realized that over 110,000 people have actually taken a classroom class at the 110 people in classroom 110,000 oh wait what am I getting under 10,000 people to put this in perspective we were recently at a football game at a large Stadium capacity 70,000 to imagine everyone in that Stadium plus will be a major league baseball player job with their phone or laptop open taking a course on classroom
 Ohio State play football hundred thousand people Ohio State plays football is it these classes I think the shortest one is maybe three hours is that right yeah yeah it's short form has three but the standard lengths we are going for is about 12 to 14 hours of session time with lots of interactive stuff built in in between those sessions are realizing all of those hundred and ten thousand maybe don't complete their entire course but there have been 697000 sessions completed rid of that barrier to entry for a lot of folks that this type of education would not have been possible in the past it's so super excited about that yes and it's a really cool
 platform that we've been able to build because of the support of our patrons to be able to build exactly what we want speaking which where are the rating on it the platform yeah and one piece of feedback that we're getting his people want to do it on the phone and we're like oh it's the classroom product people do it on their laptops we build it for laptop screen and no people on the phone and people want to be able to like switch to just audio walk around you know like if you want to skip around to the sessions that they want not go through course the way it's designed and so we're adding those features into classroom plus a cool new feature called interactive slides which is make the whole experience way more elegant when you were working with your notes and and all of that is going to be accessible within the app we're going to put the classroom in the app with your doing on your phone
 and I can slides go at your own pace however you want to go in the first class to be releasing the app is going to be in January and it's going to be Adam to Noah in January it's going to go so
 that's a lot of content that's a lot of stuff we're making and releasing so much stuff has been fewer videos than in previous years over all this is the most content we've ever released in one year is like where I'm at you now 55 language is 4300 video is localized in those languages and on those YouTube channels collectively it represents 1.7 million subscribers YouTube channels and we are releasing a web site in Spanish by the time it will have been publicly released probably release right now and
 now that's just one language but what's cool about that is we built the infrastructure to like make that language happen but then also make it so that any language is now way easier than the guys have told me that each language is about 80% there because of the infrastructure that's been bailed to be there's a Spanish that the Prototype yeah yeah excited as I think about the hole look like station effort and in our Global Focus team I think and I think he has participated in this but earlier in the year we did a a language advisor Summit and man to capture in words what it was like but we had real quick to our language advisors are like the point people for each language they're both
 I have skill in the Linguistics and language and also they have some form of theological education to lead the content charge and understand the cultural contact yes but that again thank you so sweet we are we did a zoom Summit of all of those people all over the globe and there's people from all over the world and share this passion yeah that are part of this Mission and I was getting emotional during the call and then the Highlight for me was when the Russian language advisor in the Ukrainian language advisor prayed together close out the meeting it was so powerful and yeah I was man yeah yeah that was a
 but I experienced these moments regularly in this project but that was definitely one where it just feels like man this is just one little corner of the spirit is up to among his people in the world and we are just so privileged to be able to participate in it and you know for those of you listening you mostly he talked about the video Bible nerd content stuff that we're making but for those of you who are a part of our Patron Community I mean this is It's really an amazing story that's being told and look the localization teams and Ministries in 55 languages and growing those all represent culture groups of followers of Jesus around the world who are unifying around wanting to share this content
 is so cool man so humbling to inspire an exciting yeah yeah thank you for bringing that up Steve you bet I didn't you mention our patrons to him and and I'm so encouraged and I tell you everyday but it's probably 5 days a week I read Patron comments and there's one common theme that runs through all of them but this one that made me laugh was from a patron because I just tell preciate it is honesty he said I'm 67 in the Bible has always been something I secretly didn't understand or like it was always a stumbling block to trying to know Jesus during the past three years Calamity has hit and forced me to search to find spiritual help the Bible project has been a huge part of my three-year Journey reading the Bible through three times and finally having it makes sense to thank you and Shalom wow
 and encouraging and put another way this person just last week send something into to the Bible project videos and podcast if open the story of the Bible for me in a way that I never imagined it's like I went from seeing through a keyhole to an incredible 360-degree Panorama my 1100 for the word has grown exponentially thank you bless you all of these comments were it's like something is unlocking for people and we were talking I think it was yesterday even Tim about this idea
 never want to lose sight of the fact that it's not us it's not Bible project GS is what changes people yeah that's where the transformation happened and we're just excited that at this moment in history we can be a channel but we're not to living water and so well people using these resources things are being unlocked the transformation happened outside of what we are and done so encouraged by that yeah well yeah I'm just every year that goes by with this project in you know I feel like we kind of stumbled Upon Our mission the language of our missing a couple years in about helping people experience the Bible as a unified Story the least Jesus and not since we're talking about that yesterday I was thinking about the leads to Jesus means a lot of things actually his mind is as you reading in a part of the Bible it's like how does this fit into the bigger story but actually but leading to Jesus also is the language
 of like you're on a journey to a person the word became flesh yeah and when you encounter the person that the whole story points you to the story is so valuable and beautiful but the goal is not to just enjoy the story it's actually to encounter a living
 the living Jesus and that's exactly right there's something that win lots of people have that kind of encounter through scripture
 amazing things happen in the wife of people and then threw their lives in their communities families and neighborhoods and what a what a journey to get to be a part of pointing people you know Jesus Through the biblical story really amazing thank you for your support and I'll have to make this content the point isn't the content while that's it's it's a vehicle in at this other place yeah we're something mysterious happens it's just absolutely beautiful and so our job is to be faithful to that what which is making this content that helps lead people and I'm done so that's exciting to me what a privilege
 you know you get picture in comments Mega email then and I get to see some of them too and they're awesome did you know
 that is Patron comments on a website forget the update real-time update real-time hourly project.com give and you scroll down to see you can even just go to the main landing page and just scroll down people are saying and it's the end of supporters are saying and then you click more comments and then yeah real-time just want it so the most recent content is engaging and interactive has made me fall back in love with me in the Bible love you love what you doing so if you want to see the
 impact it's having on people you can just go and scroll through those address if your patron of this like go and just let me know what you've heard of building a really cool we homeschool your children will use these lessons each morning I've been going through a journey reclaiming my face and about project has been a trustworthy source to find out where I can find safe and carefully think with your concept this is a gift to my journey at school how amazing it would be as encouraging to them because we think of our patrons is being a group of people that are in this with us and so vital to what it is that we're doing and to be encouraged to read those I know for me there was one that's the last one already but it came in it was most days were my airpods wouldn't sync with my laptop and I was just frustrated and then
 I did send it changed everything my name is vitaliy and I live in the Ukraine I'm 30 years old and work for an IT company as you may have heard about everything that is happening in Ukraine I decided to email you and say thank you thank you for your work and everything you do is because of your videos app and plans I became closer to God and he's helped me overcome a lot of panic help others to be calm and most of all trust God it's hard to do living in the reality of what we are in wow in that something until I hope it's for patrons that they feel just as connected to this because as we talked about this idea what we were referred we use the word Patron because all throughout history it's a pastry instead of funded movement of the gospel and I just so grateful for all of you that are in this with us and support one thing we talked about is we go at the pace of the crowd so since the very beginning is Project Loon
 I said we want to make content and now we're making technology and we want it I we we love it and we want this to be an experience that don't you understand the Bible and Jesus and we'll go at the pace you wants to go and what that's actually meant as we've done you know fairly fast fast and Far Beyond in the finishing our eight-year-old project and every year the project grosz and we grow with it and in fact through covid where we you know anticipated while there's a global pandemic maybe things are going slow down I didn't use the opposite 2022 is actually the very first time we saw a slow in the graph about project and it was a really cool exercise to than half
 say okay what do we slow down with how do we slow down with the crowd and we we have we have gases why things slow down there's just been a few things that have happened in the world economy if I can get him to do it in general he wasn't history the project one of the first times that we had to rethink what priorities we want to focus on in light of the resources at hand we could actually ended up being really great conversation specifically it was really the months of may be February through June where we saw kind of a dip in and it was it
 noticeable and that's what made us think okay wait some things slowing down here and we need to pay attention to this but it was so it was a good thing until I met I don't want to miss leave there's no giving in 22 will be more than twenty one but it's just much slower rate of growth and then Kostas the piano based off of historic growth and so we just have to plan as best we can and then when we look at what's happening we have to do absolutely anything for me to it was it's been a great year because it just brought us back to Our Roots where we talked about this from the very beginning that we believe the God is going to provide everything we need to do what he has called us to do and we need to be faithful to what you guys are probably heard me mention George Mueller more times than you would like but ASA to hear on the faith for me that he was all about caring for Orphans in England and this idea of the grace of giving and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with going out in soliciting and doing super proactive
 fundraising work but we just have felt like what we feel called to do is to trust that God's going to provide everything we need to do what he is calling us to do and so in the middle of that time. We're giving with dipping your resisting the temptation to start picking up the phone or knocking on doors and say okay what is it what is George Mueller do in these moments and a house full of Orphans no food he went in the closet and pray and came out and set the table and I think that's where we want to be at this idea what is God calling us to do is to make this content and to help people experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus so we need to be faithful to the what and live within his provision so it was maybe in June late June early July a group of us on the team just started to get together Wednesday mornings and pray for God's provision and what I love about that is when I pray that people will give receipt
 provision coming from God and just trusting him but he will provide everything that we need and I believe sometimes what you need is less and so we're set up for this next year there's things that we want to do and actually have plans beyond that and we're going to continue to trust that God will provide everything we need to do what he is called us to do and you saw that in real time you guys had that experience like you could go out and go man we need an extra of however much and be so nice if we had it let's go make some phone calls and see who can write a check but then you guys just got together and prayed for you to pray for specific numbers of people but you like suddenly things are happening in fact there was one in particular Friday Friday is when I got the word of it they may have come in earlier in the week but a patron sent in the first-time gift a very significant gift and we were super encouraged
 a couple days later sent him a gift bit wet like 4X back yet and it's like wow and we immediately sent them an email saying he was going to close and they said absolutely not felt like I was calling me to give and it is just been so fun to get to witness that I'm I'm weak enough as a person that if I'm actually out actively soliciting I can somehow say it's God's provision but I attached myself to that a little bit but when you pray for God's resources and then just basically do what he was calling you to do in our case it's make these resources or the content win the gifts come in there's only one set of fingerprints on it it is so beautiful to see how God continues to provide yeah yeah you know I'll just take a moment to name my gratefulness to your leadership in this area Steve in history of the project and I even before we started
 this project you Steve had a huge influence on you John about this financial model and way to do a nonprofit Media Company idea which was to lead with creating things and if people find it valuable then they'll get behind it and we can trust that that's what God is leading us to make next based off what has been provided already and so I just want to name coming in at the end of this year how grateful I am for both of you and for Steve your heart your heart beat for this to me it's an embodiment of The Upside Down vision of the kingdom of God that you lead from a conviction that there is enough even when it doesn't seem like you live is if there is enough and
 how there is enough for what it is a recalled to do and that's been our experience in history of this project and I'm just grateful for both of you and your leadership and not and just prefer patrons for you all to know that character of the people who have so much influence a trust for what's happening here because of that the set of values that are we didn't charge him we don't know how fast and hard we're going to go in 23 quite yet and we're ready for anything and I feel like we've never been so ready and so organized and it's so kind of so full of like really clear strategy and vision than we are right now
 the growth of the scholar team him you've been growing you all know Chris says she's been on the podcast a lot but there's more Scholars meeting growing in the Paradigm I'm so that we can make more content the growth of the tech team some amazing amazing talent coming out of the woodwork from all sorts of places people walking away from really fantastic jobs Tacoma work with us are content teams are more organized have more Vision I'm more excited than ever just everything is just kind of dialed in and now we're just like God what he wants to do how hard fast you want to go and so here we are and we're excited yeah yeah yeah the end of your eight thinking back this was just an idea when you shared it with Steve I think if you tell the story of the years you smile
 like I'm happy for you to have this great idea I hope that works my wife for you in any way I can I'll tell her real quick that's the first 90 second to that first video and I looked and I said wow that's amazing I'm in what's your plan and he said I want to make these for every book of the Bible put them on the Internet and give them away for free and that something lit up inside of me and I said okay I'm really am and then I said how are we going to pay for this he tried to explain that if you build it they will come inside I was thinking there's no way that'll work there's no way that will work and I clearly didn't have any idea but what I love about this model and is if we are making content and it's finding a home and its leading to this unlocking I think it is going to we're going to have the resources to do what it is we need to do I get home
 started in 2014 I think is certainly exceeded my expectations but so excited about the future and what's ahead and I know it's an overused phrase but I really feel like The Best Is Yet To Come like we're just getting started yet for those of you who listen to podcast we love you guys we loved the community that's come around podcast and we love hearing from you is like we get to do with the Cuban are episodes resending your questions and your feedback so thank you all for being awesome and so engaged and the sexier the podcast is going to be awesome and stuff, the podcast but it's the end of the year of the moment to just pause reflect be grateful be with your family if you can and and then let's go out and next
 yep. Like a plan yeah so thank you thank you everybody will be into next year but a grateful grateful for you grateful to the gods generous but keep us all alive from the project thanks guys
