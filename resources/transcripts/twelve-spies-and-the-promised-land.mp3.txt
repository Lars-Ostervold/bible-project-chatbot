The Book of Numbers is the fourth scroll in the Bible in Hebrew it's called through the Wilderness and that's exactly where we're at Israel wandering through the Wilderness on their way to the promised land Wilderness constitute a test for it whether Israel with trust Yahweh and bring about little Gardens of Oasis a refuge in the wilderness and whether they're going to obey God's word and you can already anticipate where that's going to go in the next three episodes we're going to read about three testing stories all of which intensified and build on each other the first test is for all the people of Israel it's a well-known story of the 12 Spies were commissioned by Moses to do with scout out the promised land and bring back a report go see what the land is like whether the people who live in it are strong or weak few or many how is the land where they live is it good
 where is the bat that when we read texting stories in the Bible it's wise to remember the first test the story of Adam and Eve at the tree of knowing good and bad the narrator is clearly using vocabulary of that choice that lay before Adam and Eve about the fruit in the Trees of Gardner they go to bad and it's about an inhabitant in the garden land it's the same twice before they could trust God's word in this case it means taking of the fruit of the land and going in and eating it and trusting the God will give you power to Concord snake and just like the snake in the garden. Adam and Eve to question God's word and fail the test it's the pre-existing inhabitants of the land who get the people to question God's where it is real choice to not trust God comes with consequences but also with more Mercy than they deserve that's all about God giving people what they deserve but not fully he will let his people suffer the consequences of their decision
 but not allow their Rebellion to take his train off the tracks than compromise his ultimate goal for creation of John Collins this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I are in the wilderness sending out the 12 Spies to scout out the land thanks for joining us here we go
hey John it's him we are in the scroll of numbers let's get into the tourist talk to her yeah we're spending our lives in these podcast conversation throughout the year taking a slow but sure tore through the main themes and literary design of the first buy Scrolls and Hebrew Bible called the Torah and while I've tried to read through the Bible and have in the past many of the stories end up feeling like oh wow yeah this was in the Bible or like I don't remember ever reading this ya ya know there's some Nicks and crannies of the tour of that unless you discipline yourself to do a comprehensive read through it's very easy to forget skip stuff stuff in here but good which is why we're taking our time so yeah give us an overview of where we're at in the Torah and then we'll jump in in the first parts
 of the fourth Scrolls of the Torah the first parts stores constituted by five Scrolls by their Greek names into the Christian tradition Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy so that for Scrolls of the Torah is where we are right now numbers so big picture Genesis obviously tells a story from creation to the Exile of Jacob's descendants down in Egypt in the living down in Egypt that's the Genesis crawl on the other end of the Torah Genesis ended with a promise that Jacobs descendants would go up out of Egypt and returned to the land God had made a promise to their ancestors Abraham that they would live there and be fruitful and multiply and become a blessing to the nation's so Genesis ends with them outside the land waiting to go in and it ends with Jacob on his deathbed giving this blessing to his children
 on the other side of the Torah Deuteronomy ends with the Israelites waiting outside the land and Moses is like Jacob on his deathbed Moses is about to die and Moses is giving his final warning and instruction to the Israelites to be faithful to God when he takes them into the land that he promised to their ancestors so it's very similar like Jacob what Jacob is doing to his son's is designed as a parallel to what Moses is doing to the Israelites are both outside the land anticipated going in Jacob gets a blessing Deuteronomy ends with Moses giving a blessing to each of the 12 tribes of Israel and this promised anticipation of returning to the land so those are like bookends on both outer sides of the Torah which is telling a story about God's promise to give a group of people and wear if they are faithful to the terms of their relationship with
 each other God will pour out Heavenly eating blessing on them and then threw them to all of the nation's it was like the book ends in the Torah Deuteronomy in Genesis and inside of that frame are three other Scrolls Exodus Leviticus and numbers and that little Triad right there is also like a mirror chiasm frame to it so the three Scrolls Exodus Leviticus Numbers Exodus and numbers have all kinds of mirror relationships going on with them you often stories feel like repeated yeah some of them are in the same exact places in numbers and matching stories in Exodus events at the same place has similar events and places so this begins with the enslavement of Israel in Egypt and then their Liberation through the ten acts of decreation and leave me up to pass over
 second part of Exodus is about Israel's Journey out of Egypt through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai then there they camp out at Mount Sinai for a year and then there at Mount Sinai through the end of Exodus all the scroll of Leviticus and then in the first ten chapters of numbers and then the moment the Israelites leave Mount Sinai in numbers they go through the Wilderness and they're tracking through similar places that they were at the matching middle section of Exodus of the middle of exodus in the middle of numbers are designed as these two Journeys through the Wilderness that are all in Mirror relationship to each other the journey through the Wilderness to the mountain from Egypt to Mount Sinai from Egypt to Mount Sinai camped out of Mount Sinai for a year then they leave book of back half of Exodus Sceptile to Leviticus
 first movement in numbers which we had just finished and then they get up and leave and now they're going to March through the Wilderness to Egypt on the way to the promised land and some things are going to go terribly wrong on the road trip road trip Gone Wrong Man and and what God assigns the generation of the Exodus is too afraid of wandering in the wilderness for a 5 span of a whole generation to let the whole generation of experience The Exodus so they die off in the wilderness and it's their children the people that were kids celebrating the first pass over here they are the ones who are now past middle age you know older it much older adults they are the ones who get to go into the land yeah and Deuteronomy Moses refers to them as the kids who don't know good from bad yes he does exactly I need instruction and you God's Divine command
 to teach them what is good and bad as they go into the garden land that God wants to get them cuz they're snakes and snakes of the gods they want to get their attention to the middle section of numbers goes from chapters 13 225 but their actual Trek through the Wilderness goes from what is middle of chapter 10 through at the end of chapter 25 and I should say I'll just put a flag the literary design of numbers is extremely complicated and there are many clear junctures of like literary boundaries but I think it depending on what you're focusing on what ideas you're focusing on the book different literary shapes of the book and merge so it's kind of like when you're looking at do you know those drawings likes optical illusion drawings that are so like if you look at it as a.
 I'll see the image pops one way and it's very clearly a Duck Blind if you flip it just a kids book I think it's called Duck Rabbit one or the classic one is just you looking at stairs and there are sending and then all sudden your eyes flip in the stairs are not be sent in another words depending on what you focus on the orientation what you perceive shifts and so if you look at geographical movement as the feature of numbers you focus on what you get is essentially chapters 1 to 10 chapters 10 to 20 to 22 and then 1:40 the end but if you're looking at other features like the cycles of vocabulary and themes of the melody The Narrative Melody with a narrative pattern that you got from Genesis 1 through 9 a different set of structure
 submerge the girl from chapters 12 12 13 to 25 and then 26 36 on the podcast listeners that was just a jumble of numbers but the point is in this is something that is important about biblical literature and whenever you pick up like the vehicle commentaries for example they usually have an outline of the structure of the book as if there's just one and something I've kept Reckoning and it's a big area of research and literary studies of biblical literature is that the structure of biblical text is much more like these rich visual images that depending on what you look at this play multiple like organizations and it's a sign I think of its aesthetic density that it's been designed to display multiple structures based on what features of the texture going to focus on North care of well that make any sense it makes sense yeah
 Linda abstract that sounds abstract when you actually get into the stories and you start seeing how things are sequins and organized there's a lot of logic I think for our case for where we're at and kind of like thinking through structure it's the deep end of the pool and I don't think we need to worry about it I don't want to worry about it and I don't want our audience I don't people listen along like it's interesting I'm glad that we're defining the movements and so we can talk about that and we can flag that yeah there's something happening where you can listen to do my ways there's a whole chain of caves yeah yeah I was down that little dark passageway and one day maybe we'll totally explore and I just pointed out it the basic thing that's found that dark hole Yeah but we're going to actually go through this other section that's right I said it's right in front of us a lot more open and clear in the section we're going to go into and is then a section of numbers which
 isn't structured about the geography it's more structured around the melody and the theme get the threat and what we're doing is we're going to trace one pattern yes and so we just left the first movement of numbers and in that movement they're still camped at Sinai primarily and we were tracing the pattern of the temple temple that's right because the main emphasis of that section is how the tribes of Israel are arranged in these concentric circles the tribes at the first layer all around you than inside of the tribes arranged in a circle is a whole other circle inside of the priests all camped out in this pattern and then with it in the middle of the Priestly circle is the actual Tabernacle and so that arrangement of the people the priests and then the little Eden tent in the center is modeled after the geography
 of the Garden of Eden story in chess to the land of Eden which is the region of God's the light and then you have inside of eating this a garden and their Royal Priestly images of God or appointed to care for the place around and in the middle which is where the tree of life is located so that's early chapters of numbers and then thought about caretaking for the purity of the camp in this Holiness as they get ready to leave the mountain as a holy army army Pakistan as much but they do a big census of not everybody in the camp of the males of eligible age to serve they need to protect themselves men of fighting ability and age
 yeah and then they're constituted as a holy Army that moves out into the Wilderness and that's movement one of numbers chapters 1 through 12 yeah we didn't talk about the Army aspect at all know it's a whole area I need to do more work on have a sense of what is going on with it but I need to do a lot more meditating on the actual text the focus on that okay and so then his movements we're tracing a new pattern and it's the same pattern that emphasized in the design and message of the Wilderness store is in the book of Exodus the corresponding part of the cemetery in the center of it so just think of it like I'll go back to your because you've used the amount of a sandwich Exodus is the bread on one side and then numbers is the bread on the other side Leviticus is a 3 stack sandwich in the piano piece of yak
 Burger the triple burger and then the two pieces of bread on the outside you realize each have three layers and the middle layer of both Exodus and both of numbers trying to imagine a piece of bread that has Henry Way or maybe think of that like marble rye bread and so it may be has a dark band White Band dark band and then the bread underneath has a little matching so the middle band in Exodus is them Journey Through the Wilderness from YouTube to Mount Sinai the middle band of numbers is their Journey from Sinai to the Jordan River and the Wilderness Journeys in both if you start comparing those stories to each other
 they have all been designed with major hyperlinks and usually they are patterns of intensive acacian like what happened in Exodus will usually get picked up and intensified but sometimes flipped her inverted by the matching stores and numbers 3 the amazing so the test was the main theme in the wilderness Journeys back to this and lo and behold what where do we find highlighted and idea in the wilderness journeys of numbers is the theme of the test the Wilderness constitutes a test for it whether Israel will trust the Yahweh is going to protect them and bring about little Gardens of Oasis a refuge in the wilderness and whether they're going to obey God's words when he gives them instruction in the wilderness and you can only anticipate where that's going to go not going to go well we're doing the Wilderness narratives in numbers focusing on the test so we Dive In
so these stories constitute chapters 13 through 25 of numbers the second movement of numbers and the blocks are organized into long pole three big chunks so we're just going to die think do episode podcast conversation episode on YouTube via the first chunk custom chapter 13 to 15 and this is the story that focuses on the 12 Spies that Moses ends into the promised land and then their failure to trust and they say they don't want to go into the promised land they actually want to undo the Exodus and go back to become slaves in Egypt they say they're going to appoint a new leader and go back yeah
 bad not good yeah it's it's Moses send out the spies from a place called Kadesh which is spelled the same three letters as the Hebrew word for kadosh which is Holiness so they're sent out from the holy place to go into the land they reject the offer of the promised land and so the story ends with that generation being told those bonder in the wilderness and I and then let me some enemies called the amalekites and they think they can try and defeat them in their own power and they're not there defeated by the amalekites at a place called so am I so it's a story that takes place at kaddish and korma and it's about their defeat by Canaanites in the Malachi it's because they didn't trust in the word of the Lord the middle section goes from chapter 16 to 19 and it's about a rebellion within the Rebellion so the 12 Spies were one for me too
 Twelve Tribes arrangement of the camps you so like the outer layer of the campground the Jedi Rebelle Rebelle one of each of the leaders of the 12 in the Outer Circle of the Camp's the rain around the tent but remember there's an inner circle and that's the priest net the priest and the Levites so the Levites are the yeah because not every Levi is natural priests act just like the caretakers of the exactly so among Jacob's sons is a son named Levi and then he becomes the father of a whole clan that specially set apart and designated to be the caretakers of the tent in the middle of his realm
 one of the families of Levi is selected to become priests who actually go in and out of the Eden Spa. But there's a lot more work needs to be done than just to offer sacrifices in the maintenance of all the furniture and totally and I could pick it up and carry it dissemble it wash away all the blood of an animal's right wow who's going to stand guard to make sure that people can't just Waltz into the holy of holies yeah you know they may be had a little too much wine for Shabbat dinner that night and to get the crazy idea of what teenagers do crazy idea tell me there wasn't an Israelite teenager who drink wine. Let's like sneak into the holy of holies tonight it for sure
 went through somebody's mind the Levites or a whole family do you call them G and maintenance groundsman facilities maintenance facilities and maintenance of the Tabernacle and then one sub family within the Levites priests which is Aaron and his sons so they're in the story we just summarize the story of the spies it's the leaders of the tribes and they were about this next store is in chapter 16 the 19th of numbers is about the Levites rebelling against the priests so it's an inter-clan rivalry so just like the spies represent the tribes rebelling against Moses now hear the Levites that whole clan rebelled against Aaron and what they say is listen we Are Holy to we are kodesh they say at the beginning of story remember the first story take place
 and then the next story about the rebellious Levi's begins with the same claim with the same word letters of the word which is we are kodesh and they said all the people are Coda and should be able to do what you do and Moses and Aaron do I know this is really bad and so God is like I'm done with these people and so are in intercedes just like Moses interceded for the spies now Aaron intercedes and we'll talk about that story length so that's the middle story at the rebellion of One Tribe happening within the rebellion of all the tribes this is the triple burger by the way right this is the middle meat Patty the meat patties okay yeah that's right yeah so speak service member that was actual members now we're just looking at the middle movement of numbers which is itself a sandwich but in our sandwich it's the band of
 The Bon-Ton store in the bun the last section of this movement goes from chapters 2025 and it begins with another story at kaddish the same place at the rebellion of spies we're back to that and this is a story where Moses rebelled against God and he doesn't trust God okay so in the first story it was all the tribal leaders who don't trust God and they were Bell and they are told they will enter the land and we had inside of that the rebellion of the Levites and then in the kitchen and then it gets intensified where Moses himself doesn't do what God says God says you didn't trust me and so now you to Moses will die here in the wilderness and will not enter the land the pattern seems to be Rebellion oh I see yes but they're all called it's called the test in the actual narrative so
 things don't go your like this is the low point this can't get any worse it could get worse than it's going to but this is a low point then all of a sudden in the story there's a Canaanite king of a big fortified city called a rod
 and he tries to sneak up and attack Israel in the wilderness and at this point of the store after three ways a rebellion you're like God's just going to let him get smashed in the wilderness and what God says to Moses says I'm going to give this King into your hand and so the Israelites defeat this Canaanite King at a place called your mama so poor mama was the place where they got defeated by Canaanites after the rebellion of the spies and now matching that was the rebellion of Moses in the same way and then right at the moment where you expect them to get defeated by Canaanites again at the same exact place if lips and God gives them a gift of Salvation in the wilderness I mean it's a great it's very clearly not deserve very clearly and unmerited generous gift of Yahweh and all you can link it back up to is that y'all we made a promise
 that he would bless the nation's through this family and that he's going to protect them and so you're the nation's attacking them and so this has less to do with you always feeling the warm fuzzies for Israel right now and has more to do with Yahweh being true to his word and this plan and so he gets them victory over their enemies at the same place they were defeated by those same enemies story and so with that inversion of what you thought would be death it slipped into life where defeat it's turned into victory that becomes the main theme of the climactic story of the section of numbers which is about the stories of Balaam Megan sorcerer that is hired by the king of Moab to pronounce curse and Death on this realm and every time God flips it and turns down the new a blessing or a curse into life
 which has been the main theme of this whole section of Israel through his Disobedience Rebellion Folly lack of trust keeps bringing death and curse on itself
 but at the moment where they're almost erased from the Wilderness God Saves them generously from their enemies both in a battle and then through his pronouncements of blessing so it's real it's a cool section of numbers and all about God giving people what they deserve but not fully he will let his people suffer the consequences of their decisions but not allow their Rebellion to take his train off the tracks which is his plan to use them to bring blessing to all the nations somehow even though they're not fit for that plan at the moment he's not going to let their sin compromise his ultimate goal for creation yeah yeah and this seems a little bit more sophisticated than the theme of the test as we've been talking about it there's like a there's a Redemption theme going on as well yeah well in a way it's similar
 when God exiled Adam and Eve from the garden but in his lament over their Folly and informing them of the consequences as soon as in the poems of Genesis 3 so yeah as a curse has the snake and the ground he gives a promise of the future seed who will overcome the snake and I guess in Abraham's test although he passes the test there there's Redemption yeah totally and so here is his real failing their many tests there are seven seven stories of rebellion here in the wilderness and it's in the seventh one where Moses did the seventh one is about as real grumbling over no water in the wilderness I know who God sends snakes to come by there dying dying because of the snake bites and he tells Moses to make a symbolic snake and raise it high on a staff and anyone who looks
 at that snake will have life instead of death the riddle to Wild story of Moses becomes an image of the one who can have power of the snake yeah so when you look at the snake that's in the hand of Moses snake Master then you get life if you look at the snake you get death but if you look at the one with power of the snake in your life that's what that story is about and that's the 7th Rebellion school is three parts of this movement in the first part 12 of the 12 tribes 3 Bell and then there's a pretty nice place ya like you guys all y'all except for the kiddos are going to die in the wilderness yet it is a road trip that could take two weeks ends up turn down to 40 years the death of all generation so it starts out pretty bad really dark
 we move into the middle section and now the Rebellion within the Rebellion so the the Levites rubel I'm not very familiar with this story so interesting to get into that and I don't know how in 10 seconds to get for your dad's yes the rebellion of Korah in the earth cracked open and swallows them is pretty good yes yeah okay and then we get now to the third part and it's like oh boy the rebellion of Moses and Aaron Brothers I'm just now realizing this that those three ways of rebellion map onto the three concentric circles of Camp oh yeah that's what you're saying yeah it's a rebellion of a tribe around since the rebellion of the Levites in the second Circle and then this third movement opens with the rebellion of Moses and Aaron who are the high priest
 recent Moses who are the who are the ones who work in and around the tent never noticed that the course of this conversation with you halfway. I mean I did notice as we're talking but it just crystallize. Looking at Moses and Aaron and chapter 20 and it's like so in the first movement is real as constituted as a wholly camp they're ready to go and this movement systematically yeah just shows how a circle around the camp had its own Rebellion against the word and wisdom really helps you emphasize yeah that's right because it's easy to like read a story of like the ground cracked open and eats up the Levites or like the snakes in the whole thing is just like gets what is this all about but seeing that's right the pattern of rebellion and in consequence and then the third time it has his classic storytelling at this point that we've internalize even as modern
 time it comes Moses's Rebellion this is going to be what's going to be the worst yeah sky and the land are going to dissolve into it he's going to get horrible and then what after you over there and then God provides water from a fountain in the middle of the Wilderness after that and then you got this really cool story about Bama can't wait wait to talk about it but when we did never is a long time ago any of them in my imagination turn from this cartoonish cute little figure who oh yeah he starts talking to over it is just this like childish Sunday School Story till like this kind of dark but wonderful story of this powerful sorcerer who he's a snake for hire a snake for hire and got turns the snakes curse into a blessing
 that was good stuff in here you just got to you got to know what questions and things to look for so that was our extended to the middle movement of numbers let's move on to this rebellion of the spot and what the folks on that for the rest of this conversation and then we'll talk about the other rebellions after that
alright then let's dive in Numbers Chapter 13 then Lord spoke to Moses send out for yourself men so that they can spy out the land of Canaan which I'm going to give to the sons of Israel send a man from each of the fathers tribes everyone a leader among them Somoza sent them from the Wilderness the Perron at the command of Yahweh the Wilderness of prayer on this just happened to be there at it's a general category to talk about the huge stretch of wilderness that goes from Sinai Peninsula and then up to the area where the lack Tel Aviv is today and south of Tel Aviv to it's a big stretch its Inland desert around that bend of the Mediterranean Sea bands from Egypt what's the town today there's like a
 Rayleigh Resort town called a lot a lot that's Inland on the coast of that tongue of the of the seat of the Red Sea that goes up there that would be kind of on one of the boundaries of the Wilderness yeah that would be the far inland boundary up like yeah this world and then over to what would be now modern-day Jordan or oh yeah if you keep going east Inland Jordan's right on the other side it's on the other side so yeah it's a big stretch so go out into the Wilderness from the weather in sopron and then you get a list of the names and so this list of names is all connected up to that list of the 12 tribes in the census in chapter 1 so the first movement of numbers begin with the list of the 12 and with the leaders of each try now the second movement of numbers begins with a list of the 12 L I encourage listen to the podcast to pull it up and meditate on it
 but there's two very important names that are highlighted wind up the tribe of Judah the guy named Caleb son of Yahoo net now so this is Judah the significance of the royal try kid this is sort of Judas Clans with one from Judas Clan what is also significant about Caleb is that he's half Israelite really one of his ancestral lines goes back to Judah the other ancestral line goes back to ISA when do you find this out later and numbers the right here he's called Caleb son of the effluent from the tribe of Judah in this the first time you've mentioned but he's going to be a repeat character throughout the book and you find out near the end of the book of numbers more about his ancestry that he's both from The Lion of Judah and one of his ancestors comes from a non Israelite line from the line of Pisa or eat them so he is both I've chosen to nachos and lines emergency
 turn 21 this is the line from which Jesus to send by the way Joseph but Joseph's lineage links back to Caleb Joseph has his adopted father Leo back to Caleb and we learn that Matthew. Matthew how do you say Caleb's name in Hebrew of Helen Keller
 are you a B I sleep your word for dog really hella is the Hebrew word for Todd and Fortune depends if you love your dog so he's introduced here in this list and then the other figures introduced here in this list is going to be a standout character is a guy named Hosea Hosea son of noon from the tribe of Ephraim one of the sons of Joseph and then there's a little note at the end of the list that says oh yeah Moses called Hosea the son of nun he called him yahushua that is Joshua Caleb and Joshua Joshua are the two spies who trust God and they believe spoiler and they've got no sorry but they're both kind of marked out here
 I'm Stein that was me month to do these are the names of the men most expensive at the land Moses sent them saying go up into the Negev that's about southern desert of what will become of the inheritance of Judah this important go see what the land is like whether the people who live in it are strong or weak few or many how is the land where they live is it good or is it bad and go see the land is it good or is it bad so I know he's saying you use earn if this is good or bad yo you said when humans are given a choice to see what is good or not good when the woman saw that the fruit that was good yeah which God said will kill you but she looked at is that that's actually looks good so go see the land is it good is it bad how are the cities that they live in are they live in camps do they live in fortified City
 how is the land is a fat or is it leaned that would be good lots of contacts are there trees in the land you know what make sure you take some of the fruit of the Trees of the land and then the narrator causes Moses peaches said it was right around the time of the grape Harvest they're going into like an abundant land Garden land with fruit trees and they are to see whether the land and the fruit of its trees is good or bad so I'm kind of heightening the vocabulary that is all be identical wording of the test of Adam and Eve's trust in the garden store through these little vocabulary choices the author of The Story of numbers is presenting the test before the spies
 as a similar to the test of Adam and Eve's trust in God's command the part of that pattern the pattern so it sets up the reader's expectations to say okay well I know how that choice went for Adam and Eve I wonder how this choices right so when they went up and spy out the land from the Wilderness of Zin far is Rahab and level, then they came to the Negev they went to Hebron and oh yeah there were three Giants living there and it all came on shy and tell me how do you know they were giants you'll see they're the descendants of anak anak anak another from a knock
 pretty sure so I want second real quick and yeah this is the first time and not ever mention a few minutes here three sons of anak Three Sons of Anarchy sounds like a joke and then they came to the valley of grape cluster that's called the valley of elah but as close as the Hebrew word grape cluster they came to the valley of grape cluster and man they cut down just one branch with a single cluster of grapes and they had to carry it on a pole Between Two Soldiers when you seen the school images of this is classic in fact I think still today in modern-day Israel there Bureau of Tourism Ministry of Tourism is an icon of two people carrying a huge cluster of grapes
 wow thank you can Google that Israeli Ministry of Tourism and there's a building in Jerusalem where the offices are located just going to hold off and walked by it was just like a huge plaque of two people carrying grape clusters so they also took pomegranates and fix fix fix fix a member with Adam and Eve use to cover up their bodies from each other after they didn't obey the Divine command those are fig leaves leaves of a fig tree has very specific in Genesis 2-3 more Eden 66 were used in the part of the story of in the Eden story of to cover up their failure so they took grape clusters and you like ye and they took figs oh so you're supposed to be like they were told to take figs
 you were told of grape clusters and then pomegranates which are woven symbolically all over the Tabernacle and then 6 the last time figs were mentioned in a narrative about a garden land it was at a sad note in that story so I'm just saying it's a little brush stroke without the painting here that reminds you of the eating failure so when they return from spying out the land after 40 days at the end of 40 days 40 days to her since they came to Moses and Israel and all the congregation at the Welden the Supreme jacket caught us at the holy place they brought back word to them I showed them the fruit of the land Who and the word show is to make them Seton so now the Israelites all this right are seeing the fruit from the trees and they said listen we went into the land that you sent us to and I'll tell you this the land flows with milk and honey here
 is the fruit milk meaning its Rich for pasture for goats and cattle so milk is the symbol of domesticated animals producing abundance honey is an abundance produced in the wild domesticate bees there isn't evidence that they do you know out of the top my head I don't know but I know in tourism is symbolism it's a symbol of the others abundance if you in the camp the candle and there's an abundance in the however the spies say 10 of the spice and the people who live in the land that really strong and the city's their fortified that's thick walls and they're really really big and we saw the descendants of anak living there
 oh yeah also emelec nearly annihilated Us in the wilderness like just a few months ago yeah they live here too as well as well the Hittites and the jebusites in the amorites the other all over in the Canaanites they live down by the coast you can see where this is going to be like beginning to freak people out then Caleb stood up his birthday is great and he hushed the people Everyone you can like imagine the collective campfire that night I called Caleb stand up and he's like quiets the people before Moses said we should by all means go up and take possession of the land we can overcome it like think of what just happened in Egypt you guys what happened at the sea with my parents but the man who went up with him said
 no we're not going to be able to go up there too strong for us so they gave a bad report about the land that they spied out saying the land that we went through it eats the people who are on it the land eats the people the land needs the people that's a for-sure ironic little anticipation of how the land is going to break open and eat the rebels and all the people that we saw in the land where huge yeah we saw the Nephilim there and then the narrator breaks in to the dialogue and says the sons of anak are from the Nephilim and then the spies pick up again we were like grasshoppers in their eyes that's the end of their speech yeah knocks three people
 tell him on these were the Nephilim the Nephilim being the Giants giant Warriors of old and it worries will now it's fascinating and we don't have to go down rabbit holes in the flood narrative in Genesis it seemed as if the Nephilim were all died out in the generation of the flood yet here they are and you never in that narrative the narrator spoke up and said hey dear reader the Nephilim we're warriors of old and they lived in the land of that time and also later on if you're there and what the narrator is alluding to back in Genesis is this moment in the story right here which are going to meet the Nephilim again and how they survived the flood is just left of the reader's imagination say so in Jewish tradition this little Gap in The Narrative of the Torah was filled in cuz it's obvious when you read the story there's lots of Jewish Legends
 interpretations of fill in the story and when Darren Aronofsky made the knowing movie back in the early 2000s he was making a movie retelling the story of the flood As Told through later Jewish Legend and interpretation which is why you have two volcanoes in one of the descendants of Cain who sneaks onto the ark and survive through and that was one way that Jewish interpreter solve the problem was that no one of the Nephilim so remember in The Melody of Genesis 1 through 9 the Nephilim are a sign of creation gun off the tracks in the spreading violence and bloodshed in the land the god meant for a garden to bring lasting so now here we re calling all those notes but with a new set of twists and you can kind of see it where the Israelites are being called to be like a new app
 many of whose subdue
 chaos in the land to be agents of God's Garden blessing in the land and then out to all day I see you're being the Nephilim because when we met them they are clearly a symbol of an of heavenly / human violence actually combined into this hybrid in Genesis were a result of a Heavenly and Earthly Rebellion here is the narrator is clearly using vocabulary of the Adam and Eve the choice that lay before Adam and Eve about the fruit in the Trees of gardener that good or bad
 and it's about an inhabitant in the garden land how the Israelites respond to this inhabitant in the land and whether they will trust God's word or look at the inhabitant land and let the inhabitants of the land guide their decision about what they're going to do we are we playing but with all these twists the choice before out of the inhabit it being the snake yeah so here's the Giants play the same narrative role as the snake in the story of Eden the inhabitant of the garden presented choice now for God's chosen ones about what they will do with the fruit of the land they could trust God's word and in this case it means taking of the fruit of the land and going in and eating it and trusting the God will let you power to conquer the snake which is you know all these twists on the Eden story but it was fascinating as it's the pre-existing inhabitants of the land who
 get the people to question God's word and God's promise to them and the animals who are the pre-existing inhabitants of the land in Jenison Genesis pre-eminently the snake yeah so the snake and the Giants take up the same slot in the kind of analogy being set up between the two stories by the author isn't it interesting that in Genesis the snake leads to the lineage of humanity that goes through Adam and Eve's oldest son Cain who gives into the snake and the next door and then that leads to a lineage that leads you down to the rebellion of the sons of God and the origins of the Nephilim so the snake and the Giants are connected in Genesis and then here they are connected here on that occur in somatic interesting yeah yeah that's cool it's a good example of the sophisticated way
 later narratives are pattern on earlier ones they're always with little twist so you have to meditate on it
where can I get to the climax of The Script to all the congregation of Israel lifted up their voices and cried they wept they grumbled against Moses and the whole congregation said it would have been better if we died in Egypt or the we died in this Wilderness why is he always bringing us into the land just to the we die by the sword I mean listener why is our kids will become plunder let's go back to Egypt would it be better in Egypt and then they say to each other let's get a new leader let's go back to Egypt yeah I got a knock knock joke for you
 knock knock
who's this anak-anak who I knock your head off if you come here and try to take her leg and it is make that up thank you John John Collins everyone
 the color all right Google Ok Google Moe's has and Aaron and Joshua and Caleb they tear their clothes
 they fall on the ground and they say to all the sons of Israel is good if you always pleased with us he'll bring us into the land don't rebelled against Yahweh and don't be afraid of the Giants in the land they will become bread for us because translated they will become our prey is here and there but what they say is they will be our bread like we can't assume that they will consume us will consume them but the congregation the people said let's execute Moses and Joshua and Caleb by throwing stones at them bad news bad news then the fire Glory Cloud appeared over the tent of meeting like the bat signal yeah I heard that is enough this is like one Batman appears just all the sudden this chaos and then just flash of light in your attic who's here yeah yeah
 how long will these people treat me with contempt how long are they not going to trust me the Hebrew word belief I mean I mean the last time this word appeared believe is a mean I mean that mean to consider something trustworthy and I'm in today I'm in his to make a declaration that trustworthy what you just said I trust that and I mean means is trustworthy how long will they not count me as trustworthy just buy all the signs that I've done in their midst you know what the things that I did to Egypt I'm going to do to them I'm going to strike them with plague and dispossess them and I'll make you Moses into a great nation like right after the story of the golden calf golden calf so this is on Parallel to how intense and yeah
 this foolish and horrible that moment was this is another way that number is an exodus mirror each other the golden calf narrative in Exodus at Mount Sinai is now being intensified on the other side of Sinai at numbers but it was a rebellion in the wilderness of equal if not greater intensity so Moses repeat Sagat exactly what he said in the story of the golden calf listen the Egyptians will hear about it and they'll think that you killed your own people that's you don't want people to think that about the nose is also says listen to remember that one time when you said you're slow to anger abounding and loyal love that you forgive iniquity and transgression that doesn't mean you don't bring Justice you won't declare innocent or guilty
 but would you please just forgive these people because of your loyal love and you always says yes yes I will before yeah but now it says this generation that has seen my glory that I did in Egypt and the Wilderness yet they have put me to the test the theory are the best they put me to the test these ten times not listening to my voice was referring to 10 times I was finished they put me to test 10 times not listening to my voice they won't see the land that I swore to their forefathers and he says later on Caleb and Joshua they will get to see it and all the children that they said would be plunder for the Giants the children will get to the entrance of these 10 times get this
 take a guess how many Rebellion narratives there are in this middle section of numbers
 well we just said there's three okay got it yes in the section we just talked about 3 okay but take a stab at the bread 10 yep we just read through on in this movement of numbers we highlighted 3in numbers 11 to 21 there are seven seven Rebellion story a God says that there are 10 was very interesting is that there are three matching Rebellion store is in the mirroring section of Exodus Exodus chapter 15 through 17 make up a total of 10 so what's fascinating is God says they have tested me these ten times as referring to before Sinai the three before Sinai then this one is the fourth and there's going to be six more so okay it's a metacomet reflecting it says if God speech in the moment
 comes to the reader a comment on the rebellion in the wilderness before Mount Sinai and the Seven rebellions that I'm going to read about in the numbers grow here but what's funny is the Tanner referred to are in the middle in the fourth one in before all 10 of happened yet but it for the reader is a good meditation literature moment where it's like for the reader you know we supposed to know this town this when you wake up, and you're like yeah every time but in the narrative sequence it sounds funky cuz you're like what were the 10 and you have to finish the section of number is interesting before you get to the number 10 M Night Shyamalan kind of moved where is the movie becomes aware of itself characters in the movie realize they're in the movie and hear God's voice but it's like you said 10 God like I'm only come for here
 what is like to sweat the Sycamore
 so that yeah that's basically how I actually that's not how the story goes so what God says to this generation is okay back out into the Wilderness with y'all go back turned backwards you said you wanted to undo the Exodus I'm not going to let you into that but I will let you undo your chance to enter into the land so back into the Wilderness and the people when they hear this and then God says according to the number of days that the spies B out the land 40 That's How many years you'll wander in the wilderness if 40 is a number that symbolizes testing through time where you're waiting for the Fulfillment of God's word synonymous with a period of testing because it's testing your trust so the people grieve and they get up and they say we have sinned against the Lord and you are a great that's awesome so usually when someone is awesome that they realized awesome they realize there's two
 but then they say you know what we're going to go up into the land after all and Moses's what know where you are listening you lost your chance the word of the Lord in the past was go up in the lamp but now that God's instruction is going to the Wilderness so you're actually you're rejecting God's word now a second time and the people say no we can go up into the lab so they go up into the light and who come out who crawl out of the rocks and the hills the amalekites who tried to whoop him in the past and God gave them a victory over the amount I it's back in Exodus but now he got to let the amalekites come and defeat them and that's how the story ends they defeat them at home, sweet the whole like all of the electribe try to go into the land prematurely and then get defeated or is it just a crude is just as the people people
 yeah the people all the sons of Israel they went up so just become a mess so that's the first main Rebellion story of the numbers is the first of seven and it's basically sets the tone for it and again back up to how we began this begins a Cascade of rebellion stories that you think is going to end in just total death in The Cosmic blood and it's actually after the seventh Rebellion that God turns death into life and then starts turning curse in the black LOL but for the Next Generation through this generation they've already signed their faith through the choices and so in that sense it's an intensification of the failure of Adam and Eve to trust in the garden and now here's this generation that failed to trust and lost her chance to enter into the garden
 okay so then next will step into the second part of the second movement and we'll look at and I suppose a few Rebellion stories then we'll focus on the rebellion of the Levites I like this concentric Circle we've been flaking on the rebellion of the tribes does the Outer Circle of the camp around the tent when we got two more circles but we've got five and read all the testing stories will reflect on three out of seven and downward and Edward Into The Human Condition
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're looking at numbers 16 the rebellion of the tribe of Levi it's a disturbing story about some Israelites who tried to overthrow Moses and Aaron and as a results God causes the ground to open up and swallow them whole and heavy the decreation we're at this moment where the ground opening up is echoing both the innocent blood of Abel human Rebellion violence and rivalry leading to the death of innocent and also the ground but open is an image of what happened before the collapse of the cosmos in the flood the wording phimosis of speech is echoing the beginning of human violence from Genesis 4 and then the ultimate consequence who human violence in Genesis 6 Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts edited by Dan Campbell in Tyler Bailey Lyndsay Ponder with the show notes
