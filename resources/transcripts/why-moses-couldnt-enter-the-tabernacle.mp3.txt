in the scroll of Exodus Israel is lead by Moses it's Moses who acts as God on behalf of Israel confront Pharaoh it's Moses is Rey's staff that's putting their two parallel as God's raised arm that brings in through the waters and defeat their enemies it's Moses who can Ascend the sacred mountain and sit with God and the cosmic Temple and receive the Covenant and the Tabernacle Blueprints and so it's surprising that at the end of The Scroll of Exodus after the Tabernacle is built for some reason Moses can't go in
 why what happened the answer to that question is what we look at today it's right at the heart of the third movement of Exodus the story of Israel making a golden calf so the golden calf did something that ruptured the relationship between God and his people such that even Moses who could and did offend in the glory Cloud now that the glory Cloud dwells in the middle of these people there unresolved problem is real get scared to get in patients while Moses is on the mountain and they take gold the gold that Egypt gave them when they left and they use it to break the first two Commandments don't worship any other gods and don't make idle images they're taking the plunder of Egypt there was a sign of yahweh's defeat of the Gods of Egypt and now they're going to recast it into the new got this story is like cheating on your wife on your wedding day this story is Israel's utter failure and this is Israel
 false narrative this is their equivalent of Adam and Eve's failure what is God going to do with this people always angry and he's fed up and he's ready to leave Israel behind the Moses goes back up the mountain and intercede on behalf of Israel and God listens to him this is the narratives way of trying to help us grass to tensions within God's purpose God's desire to blessed and share responsibility and Authority with his human Partners but then God's Own moral obligations to respond just lie to human evil and Corruption this is teaching us that the only way that we can stand before God as is blameless Partners is if we have an intercessor in the heavens thanks for joining us here we go
 it's a John we are in the last part of this world Exodus we've been working through Exodus in three movements and so this is the third movement the first movement was Israel in slavery to Egypt they are rescued with the 10 plagues and they're going to pass over 71 movement to is their Journey Through the water where is through the Wilderness to Mount Sinai where they given the loss Movement 3 is here at Mount Sinai Moses goes up the mountain to meet with God and he is given a vision of God's Heavenly throne room and then he's told to write down what God tells him which is the blueprints for an Earthly version of this called a pattern it's from the should set this episode
 built it's the building pattern the pattern blueprint and the idea here is that access to God's holy space is Central to the story of the Bible were Adam and Eve replace the garden the idea of Moses going up to the top of the mountain in this idea as well as he's going up through the fire up into the sky where God dwells yeah that's an apocalypse of the Divine throne room here are the Tabernacle is now something that the Israelites can have with them actually carried around with them and it's a place where God will dwell with them on their Turf essentially has moved into their neighborhood has it where yeah but it's that same divine power the Tree of Life the holy of holies top of the mountain here yeah that's right it's located right in the middle of the people which is both agree
 gift God is with the people that's the whole point the gases of the 10th but it also raises problems because God's Beauty presence is power his utter goodness also poses a threat to people who are mortal and or morally compromised and so what God also gives us a gift is a whole set of ritual enactments that will retell the drama multiple times a day and about how God wants to be with people who are Mortal Kombat compromised and he's provided a means for their sins to be covered through surrender an offering of a substitute and the God will eagerly forgive his people so they can mend the relationship powerful powerful stuff that we talked about over the last two episodes so this movement begins with God giving the blueprints
 then this movement ends with like recalling all of that speech of God yes but now all of them actually building the thing that got told him it was actually mapped onto each other pretty identically yeah almost identically so Exodus chapter tough chapters for most people to read Exodus is the verbal blueprint just detailed measurements I'll just not enough detail quite so you can rebuild it and make everything and make sure that you're right but at the same time it's enough detail to let you paint a mental picture what is four and then the narrative about the making of them that's next 35 to 40
 and it reads like a narrative it's a narrative fulfillment of all the blueprints virtually word for word slight little differences that are fascinating but we don't have time to talk so it's what is this 15 + chapters of like almost the last half of the book of these verbal Blueprints and if you didn't feel person of reading it the first time you get after you just text me what that repetition shows one is the meticulous care and how did the furniture in the symbolism of the Tabernacle was the source of deep meditation and reflection everything about it like it's not it's not easy or cheap to write this down on a score that many points all the narrator had to say was and Moses had the tent built just as God commanded how many scribes were tempted just to do that in the
 in the instructions that God gives to Noah about the building of the boat for the arc there's a paragraph detailed description of paragraph and then it just says and Noah did what God commanded. I maybe maybe the we know that they can do that when they want to avoid repetition the repetition so that tells us is that he ran Exodus there's a reason and I think there's a couple and one of them is meditating on the Tabernacle was a way to meditate on the presence of God being one with our world have an interest in wanting and that is such a Sublime beautiful hopeful thing to meditate on it's been doubled in the scroll that surely one thing here
 another piece has to do with a literary design of these chapters so here's a way to think about it the last census of Exodus 20:4 or when Moses goes up to the mountain you wait 6 days at the middle of the mountain then on the 7th Day at the cloud Comes The Glory the fire and he walks into the fire and disappear in the club 40 days 40 nights so that matches and corresponds to the final paragraph of the excess Kroll at the whole the final sentences of Exodus say and the cloud that you're the one that was over the mountain that Moses walked into it moved and it went to cover over the tent of meeting and the glory of your way there was on the mountain now it's filled up the Tabernacle and Moses and you're expecting oh yeah just goes up and go in he can go into the tent and then it says and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting
 because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the Lord fill the Tabernacle and when you sit down and compared those to moments you like does not compute he was up in the clouds the glory was up there not a problem. What happened so it's a narrative it's a good example of these two sentences read almost verbatim and the glory or the cloud cover and filled one the mountain the other the 10th but so what's the different what's different is Moses in ability which raises the question then so something must have happened between the mountain and this moment at the end of Exodus the change the calculus of this equation so to speak and that is exactly what has happened what has happened is something has happened what has happened in between the two long verbatim repetitions of the Tabernacle blueprints is what we call Access chapter
 32 33 34 the debacle of the golden calf so the golden calf did something that ruptured the relationship between God and his people such that even Moses who could and did Ascend into the glory Cloud now that the glory Cloud dwells in the middle of these people there's unresolved problems that prevent us from going in the tent was kind of a it's an easy way to see the pot conflict of the section it starts with like a Moses come up on the mountain let's hang out I'm going to show you how I want to move in with my people yay sounds like what do you call that the opening scene setting up the ideal plot conflict the people are breaking the Covenant at that very moment down at the foot of the mountain white wire
 so it's going to be a story about how they break the Covenant Moses is going to intercede the Covenant will be restored and renewed and then the Tabernacle is going to be built and ready but still off because Moses not able to enter that 10 and that's the scroll ends with that but tension hanging until you go to the next scroll. It makes the section of the book kind of easy to put together until like ideal problem and partial resolution introducing another level of profit
so we have talked about Golden castori at Lynx over the years so I think we will be helpful in this moment it's just a kind of survey and maybe I'll just point out for me what have become some of the really significant themes that work in the section there's this contrasts between Moses what he's doing up on the mountain and then what his brother is doing at the foot of the Mountain Air and his brother his brother Aaron and then also there's this Dynamic where Moses is going to compel God to maintain his Covenant partnership with these people five times over so this narrative is exploring what happens when God's people
 really push God's patience to the is there a limit and if so what is the limit what is the character of this God that is committing to these people than that these people are testing and lo and behold in the five acts of intercession that Moses undergoes here it's the fourth one that prompts God to make a statement about his own character that becomes the most famous bible verse with in the Bible to other difficult is the most like repeated Bible verse by other authors yeah the Lord the Lord Yaweh Yaweh gracious and compassionate slow to anger abounding in loyal love and faithfulness he forgives the sin of a facing now for giving this a forgiving Rebellion iniquity and sin but he won't leave the guilty unpunished he will bring judgment honest as many generations repeat the failures of their parents
 my perfect so beyond that line right there that's in the story gets re quoted more times throughout the rest of the Bible than any other person in the Bible so this is Ground Zero for some serious reflection reflection on human nature and character, and on this kind of boiling plot conflict of what does it mean if God is binding himself yeah if people who are imperfect and I'm going to screw up like what's he going to do much going on at the store so let's just do it kind of a quick survey of the events we can cats catch the order of events here and then dive into some specific moment so it begins with the Israelite essentially getting impatient and tired of waiting for Moses if you saw your friend disappear into a fiery cloud and then not come back with
 today is your best friend was stuck on the mountain for 40 days regardless we live here Portland Oregon like not even an hour and a half from one's a large volcanoes in the specific Northwest Peak ski resort people climate all year around yeah people lose their lives on the every year and we have you had a friend who nearly lost their life think I lost yeah you know Frozen than all that so it's serious but it's not like paint the people as like ridiculously Evil Hear a realistic thing to think that your friend is dead if you want to come over 40 days
 yeah so what they say they approached Moses brother and they say we don't know where this guy Moses's who brought us up how to Egypt so make for us in Elohim. Really didn't work out make let's make one and actually make for us Elohim who will go before us cuz this guy Moses yeah we don't know where he's at make Elohim who will go before us we need some Spiritual Beings to protect us out here makes sense and you make them I mean that's just make us sell him the way it's phrase is kind of poking fun make a spiritual being what they're going to do is make a statue in a way that is how you would then identify with your total Elohim that's right that's right into the Torah the prophets and the writings they make fun of this mentality
 that you would mistake a statue for a spiritual being in sync the statue actually has any power so Aaron Moses is brother you know says guys you just signed a covenant with the fire Cloud up on top of the mountain saying you wouldn't do what you just said you want to do that's like rule number two rules number one and two no other Elam and don't make any statues of a know him so yeah Aaron is depicted as being total what do you say compromiser just people pleaser major blunder what he says that are off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives your sons and your daughters where'd you get all this gold jewelry there's a little narrative in The Exodus that the night that they left Egypt Moses directed them to ask their Egyptian neighbors for valuables and it's Egyptian gave them all kinds of Articles of gold and and
 silver and they plundered the Egyptians to buy asking by asking yeah I know that point by the tenth plague I can see why Egyptians so this is a hyperlink back to that another with what they're doing is they're taking the plunge of Egypt it was a sign of yahweh's defeat of the Gods of Egypt and now they're going to recast it into a into a new guy you got that so the people do that and Aaron takes this and get the graving tool and makes a molten cast you know what you could Google like ancient near East bronze bowls or bronze Cavs and that you'll get you'll find they've dug them up little ball or cast recall them or totems statues were like a common Motif in ancient near Eastern religion typically depicted this is a fairly large statue but it's occurred to me like
 this was no it doesn't say and they've been found of a range of sizes and then is the calf of specific God that you just Googled Canaanite bronze Bull and typically associated with bail or okay but they're off the top my head I should know a thing like that but I don't but I know about all who was the Canaanite another down in the Sinai Peninsula so that's of Interest another interest actually so actually Aaron does this and then what he says to the people after making it is he says actually interesting how go to the NIV
 mr. maybe avoid Arapahoe what he says is these are your Elohim Israel the ones who brought you up out of Egypt are really changing the narrative here these are your Elohim these are your Elohim here are you the one who brought you out of Egypt now this is a great example of how the poor and the profits have been coordinated with each other the wording of this account is picked up by a narrative that's been modeled after this one and vice-versa in the book of 1st Kings and it's the story of when after Solomon's rain Solomon's son name Rhea bomb is an idiot and when the tribes who live north of him come saying hey you know your dad was really severe with the taxation thing and we have to build him a lot of cities to store all of his stuff could you like it
 maybe we could get along better and Solomon son is he says you know thank you and yeah he shamed them and reject the request so the northern tribes split off under the leadership of a guy named Jerry bomb and when jeroboam gain some Independence after eating what he says is oh man people are going to want to still go worship Yahweh in Jerusalem so this is 1st Kings 12 or the king consulted and said okay how about this I'm going to make alternate temples up here in the North 21 in Bethel one and Dan and then the king made two golden calves and he said to them Israel too much that you would go up to Jerusalem
 here are your gods of Israel that brought you up out of the land of Egypt and but one and that's all and you put one and Dan so hear a Jerry bomb he's being set on an analogy clearly I do but doubly so so it's sort of like the foundational sin of Israel this is Israel's bald narrative this is their equivalent Community fall that Adam and Eve's failure this is their failure and then the next failure that's just as Grievous and severe it later at the end of their history that sets them on a track toward Exile this story which is so the golden calves appear at the beginning of the end of Israel to God and Moses up on top of the mountain and What God Says is leave me alone these people have done the exact thing I asked them not to do
 I'm going to finish them off and I'll start over with you and Moses says that is PR nightmare God totally bad first of all are you sure you just acted on behalf of your name you revealed your name doll of Egypt for what you just did and now you're going to double back and like you know destroy the people that you just liberated like that won't be good for your reputation and I know you care about your reputation second how you made a promise, promise that you made an oath by yourself and here he's specifically referring to the wording of God's promise to Abraham after the surrender of Isaac and Isaac's Deliverance for death that's when you made no thing almost play you like the stars of heaven and give you the land and God listen to Moses and he seemed about the harm the catastrophe
 yes it's a play on Noah's name when Noah was born all the way back and Genesis chapter 5 and Noah's dad said you know I always got about a curse on the ground really bad stuff but he named his son Noah cuz he will not come with us and bring an end to the curse on the land so the word means to bring emotional Comfort Comfort Inns rest of the different word but they have dispelled with his comfort Comfort yeah and it's a bird is one way you can render it so this phrase to nakam one's self is what's being used here in the gold account story so the Lord had brought Comfort to himself settled himself he settled himself down
 yeah he's worked up his angry I didn't know that was that's interesting we're going to talk about that because in the tree and then IV I think it's changed his mind and Ivy translate changed his mind and I think that's how it's most translated right ESV translate relented and Ivy translate relented and let's see what the king who ya the King James classic and the Lord repented of the evil which she sought to do to his people yeah that's older English for you cuz you think God repents of evil so it's the word Comfort he was about to do something yeah and then that what Moses remind him is if you did that you wouldn't actually be true to who you are and through comforting oneself and saying right I won't do it it's a
 Yahweh has allowed himself to be moved by the intercession of the mediator that he appointed for the people who come to this a few different times that was the big takeaway from me which is we have that a character in Moses who is the most image of God that we've ever encountered and we're going to see that really on display in a second but the fact that he could go up the mountain and be with God but just the fact that he is that the chosen Liberator acting on behalf of God when he's out stretches and that's God that's rich. I'm like there's this like symbiotics thing happening totally and so this narrative kind of seems to fit in there like what does it mean for God to partner with humans in such a way that we actually are cooperating and it's kind of creepy to think about that in this narrative it's Moses actually
 like negotiating with God that's right and The Narrative of this negotiation but what's interesting is God doesn't say like I'm just over it like the moment Moses brings us up Yahweh like response and what stubbly fascinating is that we said every time we reflect on this what Moses says is not some idea that he has what he's just reminding God is you said you would do this so God is staying true to God's own character by changing his dispositions so you could say the narrative is and again this is thinking about if we're reading scripture as a unified story that's teaching us about the nature of the kind of deliver that we need the snake Crusher the one who will overcome evil and deliver Humanity in God's people this
 teaching us that the only way for real the only way that we can stand before God and as his blameless Partners is if we have an intercessor in the heavens Hoover remind God's Own Self to stay true to God's Own promises and that sounds like a weird thing to say at least where I'm at is that this is the narratives way of trying to help us grass to tensions within God's purpose God's desire to bless and share responsibility and Authority with his human Partners but then God's Own moral obligations to respond justly to human evil and Corruption and consequences
 and what happens when those two seem to be intention with each other and that's what the role of Moses is going to explore here so the first thing is if you have somebody to Advocate and on behalf and remind God of his promises and God happy that consistently with his promises cuz that's what I've done but there's not just got the promises that work here there's also God's the nice respond in some way to human evil and that doesn't fully resolved here yet we got to keep breathing
some of this comes down the mountain Moses still doesn't has actually seen what's happened this is all happening up on the mountain. Start that okay down now just like God was angry. Found out when Moses really sees what's happening that says he gets angry and this is the famous sea otters tablets you pulled her eyes has the calf into the like dust that makes everybody drink it and then he sees the ritual orgy is happening and he calls the Levites what what he says is anybody who's for Yahweh come to me and the Levites come to a state
 and he sends them out to execute the am and told him 3,000 people fall and Levi when the people win the Levites comeback what Moses says it is you guys were loyal to Yahweh even though it meant going against your own brother and he gave them a blessing so it's this weird in terms of the melody we're kind of gets to fit at the making of the cast is set on an LG to Adam and Eve's failure the tree where now exploring how is real thin also brings division between brother and brother and the vocabulary of the Levites episode is all drawn from the Cain and Abel story so but here it's things are inverted cuz it's actually the people zealous for you always defecation are the ones who are willing to bring judgment on their own brothers and yeah so it's Moses is the one who knocks this dude he's like gods
 and he does say this is what God says so he represents his command is God's will but I think what we are meant to see is so quickly after the people willingly saying they want to be God's covenant Partners we've devolved into a situation where the only thing that will compel Covenant faithfulness is violence which is just a tragic quick-turn quick turn it sad I mean we're definitely supposed to be like this is what kind of Covenant loyalty comes from a threat of violence you know so after that happens what Moses says is listen I'm going to go back up the mountain and maybe I can repair this more permanently here and what he says is that the end of Exodus
 32 he says you've committed a great sin I'm going up to your way maybe I can make atonement for your sin and you the reader or like the last time I heard about a tone was describing the Ark of the Covenant so but now how's it going to do that I'm taking an animal up with them like what they're going to do some Moses goes up to Yahweh and says these people have committed a great sin they made a god of gold but if you will forgive their sin and if you're not going to forgive their sin wipe me from your scroll that you have written what's a squirrel that got other than the first time you've mentioned it is yeah cuz I don't remember it's a depiction of yahweh's keeping notes back seems like that one for me if that person is for me and that's the idea is like a ledger and
 that word wipe me from your scroll I think English translations usually stay blocked me out like that it's the same word used is in the flood narrative or he wipes living things off the face of the land here Moses's thing wipe me off the face of a scroll so let me in let your flood come on me don't wash away these people in the flood of justice and why you always says is listen to whoever is has wronged me I will take care of it I'll bring Justice on those who wronged me but for now Moses you go lead the people and you know what the people don't want me to come so I'll send a messenger and a Messenger will go before you cuz here's the thing if I go with you that won't be good if y'all were goes with her yeah so now we've got another problem first problem was I'm going to destroy them
 no lettuce interstates Moses tries for more binding reconciliation the offers his life and he always says well listen I think it affects thing is not the last time whoever sins against me there's going to be more I'll deal with each person but you go leave the people and listen I don't want to I'll stay here so now this creates a new Karate sending someone a message in the crisis which is God's not going to come with us so this is what compels Moses to the next couple blocks of intercession so the next acts of intercession the most the steps up and he comes back out and he says listen we don't want to go anywhere without you he says these are famous lines Nexus 33
 he says if your presence if you're very personal presence doesn't go with us don't lead us out of here how will it be known that I found favor in your eyes not just me but all these people isn't it by you coming with us that we are people are distinguished from all the other people's on the land
 there's nothing that makes this real special if you're going to leave us behind yeah we're on our way through the generations especially for the minority of Israelites who remained faithful to Yahweh through the years the only thing that makes his real anything at all is that were marked as the people of Yahweh let's clear the menu at most Israelites didn't actually believe that about the history yeah so yeah we respond to that and says okay this thing that you've spoken I'll do it because you found favor in my eyes and I know you by name the Moses comes up with the sports request now he says okay how about this so if your presence is going to come with us I'm paraphrasing here is an idiom of some sort I know you by your name because obviously
 yeah and he knows Aaron's name I mean yeah yeah he knows like I'm sure I'm sure if we quizzed got here he's probably come up with a few more those rides names so yeah it's a good damn thank you it surely is an idiom that emphasizing an intimacy cuz out of all of the people right now Moses is the one who finds favor so it's a sign of special intimacy like we're on a first-name basis God says to Moses something something like that cuz he has on that statement of intimacy so what he says it's please show me your glory and cuz like you know hang it up on the Mountain is standing in the middle of a fiery Glory clouds like that
 what else what more is there I mean with a being of infinite and eternal being at this point it's I think this is gutsy so if we are the unique people of the unique Creator God of all and you say you're accepting my intercession cuz you and I are close Let's Get Closer show me more I bet there's more to you you could have been like I think God sorry for bothering you I'll get out of here okay thank you this is a portrait of Moses's persistent and is asking for more more divine presence and so what God says is I'm going to show you a little more than anybody's ever seen I will make my goodness pass in front of you and I will call on the name of Yahweh before you and I will be gracious to whom I'm gracious
 will call the name of Yahweh I'm going to call the name of Yahweh in front of you okay I got it like it's this to my name the famous line we're just a few sentences away so it's anticipating I'm going to show up and I'm going to call upon the name of Yamaha I'm going to Proclaim it to you and you will know my name in a way I've never known it before
 but he said seeing directly and seeing my face the full fullness of who I am yeah you died so how about this there's a place in the corner of the rock here I'm going to stick you there and when my glory passes by cover you with my hand but then I'll take my hand away and you can see my back
 a great narrative is exploring how close can you really get through these narrative image is that there is more to the Elohim of Elohim than any of us could ever imagine and the experience would kill us would overwhelm us more than we can bear but Moses is depicted as somebody who gets more clothes than anybody ever gotten so they Madrid at the back in the covering his face is hiding in the cleft of the rock yeah in the back yeah totally so I can see you're not going to give up here and I'll remain faithful is my promises so get two more stone tablets
 what's remake this company so he tells him get the tablets out and be ready in the morning and I'll show up so he goes up and the Lord came and cloud and the Lord the Lord compassionate and gracious slow to anger abounding loyal of faithfulness who keeps loyal of for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin yet he won't leave the guilty unpunished so I guess the points in B major these lines actually describe how Yahweh has behaved in the story he has held the guilty accountable but at the same time he won't break his Covenant promises you'll be patient and show compassion but not in a way that will make him compromises Justice and we're naming the tension here compassionate loyal to his promises yet at the same time he's not a pushover and there are limits and you will bring Justice if people refuse to respond to his
 can you generously and where it's at so cool this line is actually naming the tension in in the story itself so after you always reveals that what Moses says is okay so then seems like I found favor in your eyes so come with us come right in the middle of us even though the people are absent and coming with us means you're going to have to forgive us a whole bunch but you got to come with us is the last this is the Fifth Act of intercession and it's like the first one he's essentially saying do what you said you're going to do and so God restates all the terms of the Covenant in the compact form this is what follows is copy and paste from the original terms of the 42 commands from earlier in chapter 24 and then the story ends with the
 odd little narrative about Moses coming down from the mountain and his face is and so all the translation say shining the Hebrew word it's a verb a Quran and it's only used here in the Hebrew Bible as a verb it is related to a very common Hebrew noun just now on Karen which is the word horn so actually this is interesting you can Google or they're famous statues of Moses from medieval Europe where Moses is depicted holding the tablets he has little horns really like a little bit of a little little horns coming out of his forehead yeah and it's ripping off of this what it literally says is the skin of his face horned which you can take to be metaphorical if you're radiating light beams that's how it's
 taking the shine yeah that's where they get Cheyenne from yeah but it's at the least it's a metaphor for shining but that Moses would be depicted as having animal horns is a fascinating that's weird it will totally yeah so anyhow there's a standard color Baumgartner Hebrew lexicon of the Old Testament traditionally in the Septuagint earlier make translations the Syriac peshitta they all translated to shine however there were some early Jewish translators that translated as having horns
 who in the who was in the Latin Bible or the Christian Bible Bible quote from which to wear horns or to show horns as in the statue of Moses o by Michael and I suffered started yeah so long history here but I guess I'll just tell you where I have landed I think this is the narrative it does mean shining and is about the radiating face but it's a weird way to say it so the but Moses is being depicted as a sacrificial animal what did he just do on the mountain he just ascended up into the heavens through the fire to offer his life as a substitute in the meanwhile interested and then he comes down shining but the verb used to describe shining appears only here and it's the word horn and how do you know that it means shining though oh what it says is the skin of his face horned
 so only that it would be that you take it as a metaphor that is skin protruded horns that horned is there any other clues that it's talking about shining it's a verb connected to word horn cuz I'm just literally just explained that man in later Hebrew it's the verb used to describe animals growing horns yeah there is actually no Hebrew word for shine that is this where it's the word to radiate horns or to grow horns right so most basic common-sense reading it is not about shining skin of his face admitted horns as a interpretation interpretation yet because it's talking about the skin of his face being like this so that the people are afraid to come near him with the horn he has to cover over Okay so let's think this is what were the
 afraid of the people have been afraid of something and refuse to go near it already once in this story and it was when they're at the foot of the mountain and you always showed up in Fire and cloud and light and the people that's the same were afraid to come there and didn't come there and so you make a tabernacle live now vale's the Divine glory in the tent so now here comes Moses coming down from the Divine glory and his face is hoarding
 and they are afraid to come near him so he puts a veil over his face and now the people can come they're okay about the van that connects you to this idea of like some sort of shining yeah that Lori this little story The Riddle as you ponder it you will gain insight into what's happening in the larger story and it's about the veil over his face and it makes you reflect the narrator is inviting us to see the veil over Moses his face that's kind of a sad necessity for the people and it makes you reflect on the veil that separates the Israelites from you always glory in the holy of holies that's also a sad but necessary reality to the interesting I love this you get these little compact odd stories
 that are hard to understand and there there on purpose to make you reflect on the nurses there around them and their go man that's the golden castori now we know why Moses can't go in at the end of the book you can't go in because of how poorly Israel who he represents has it been acting like it's like I know you by name you can just see my back like we're we're good we're good and so if it's just him and God he can go into the cloud but when the guy comes down and he's among the people you can't go in and God's glory has to be hidden and veiled just like it was in whatever effect it had on Moses his face and it's the veil that gives us this idea of glory and Shining which has become the interpretation yep that all these
 thing that's happening that must mean something and you're saying it's depicting Moses as the sacrificial animal the dense Little Riddle packed with significance for the surrounding stories and so I think the pitching Moses as an animal an animal that's that needs to be veiled I guess you could say the veils to like hide his hideousness cuz I'd be kind of weird to see if he's got horny morning yet and totally but yeah because of the connection to the veil yeah and God's presence yeah it's very clear here it's talking about hiding his glory because it is always been connected to Moses just saw God's glory he's coming down he's been affected by it and everything radiating got some clothes so I think there's at least two layers of meaning to this riddle of Moses face one layer is yes as too high to space cuz it's been so affected by spending time with God
 that he now radiates with the Divine Glory so it's got to be covered with a veil just like God's glory in the holy of holies but also the way that effect of God's glory is worded with a very unique Hebrew word this the same word to describe the animal horns of sacrificial animals like who I am and goes then I think the other layer is that he's being depicted as substitute animal you have a suffering servant who will be glorified is exactly right yeah I think of Isaiah 53 he's like one from whom men hide their faces of the line that's a 53. The men are hiding their faces from the suffering servant for the suffering servant here Moses is hiding his face from them right reverse oh yeah but it's because they're afraid to go near him because of his face so yeah this narrative is remarkable it's about the fracture and the repair
 Israel's relationship to God because of the suffering servant mediator who went up to God's presence and gave his own life on behalf of their sins that's the story this is a remarkable man yeah so that's the story the golden calf and even though the relationship has been repaired for the moment since does not bode well for the future and that's what the Leviticus scroll this going to explore thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast that is it we finish the scroll of Exodus we walk through it and three movements tracing three themes before we move on to the scroll of Leviticus we're going to stop and we can have an episode where we interview our friend and Scholar dr.
