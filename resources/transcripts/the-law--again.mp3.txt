we've been reading through the Torah and we come too many sections where we read ancient lock code for reading our snippet a small selection of a larger ancient lock code that Israel had with the our way to establish their Covenant with him and here in Deuteronomy Moses continues to give us even more lot but it's now mosa either restating laws that happened earlier in the collection or giving new laws that develop principles found in place earlier in the collection up till now is really wasn't wandering through the desert but they're ready to settle into the land God promised to them and so Moses is giving is real guidelines for how to settle in the new land now it's easy to think of these laws as a list of do's and don'ts but the more than that these laws are met formed them into a people who know how to live with wisdom among the Nations as we enter the plan
 Allah forms the group of people to live and see the world a certain way so that when you encounter all kinds of other circumstances that may be a specific W I sent you will find yourself acting a certain way because the laws have picked you to see the world living by the law code is a way to declare their allegiance to Yahweh if they obey the commands their way of living in this world will be markedly different when the Nations around them and in a beautiful way the word righteousness is a relational word in Biblical Hebrew it's doing right by somebody specific to the context of our relationship Moses says obeying the wisdom of the laws will be Israel's righteousness before God and before then if they do that the Nations will lock on and say well following that guy is pretty awesome because the results in the community to look like today and I begin the second movement of Deuteronomy
 looking at the theme of law on John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey Tim John hello here we are yeah the Deuteronomy scroll we have arrived at the last section last major Scrolls of the Torah we have we've gone through a lot of for me obscure passages of the Bible that I don't tend to read and it's been really great to think you were here in the middle of Deuteronomy we just finished the first movements and we looked at theme of listening and loving in chapters 1 through 11 which form the first major movement of the drama scroll Moses gets gets his sermon on let me know. Like persuasive passionate sermons to a congregation knesseth a blister called off in times like in assembly so it portrays Moses as in the mod
 like a Priestly prophetic teacher teaching in a synagogue to a congregation congregation is Israel a new generation of Israel who's been wandering through the Wilderness out of slavery. They were the children who went through the Exodus in the afternoon and now the children are adults and their parents are now all gone passed away in the desert because of their lack of trust and Rebellion around though he's got to be old still kicking his heart must be great he went up and down that mountain so many desert backpacking trips that for decades so he is preparing this next-generation to go into the promised land there at the at the Jordan River so on the east side of the Jordan River kind of where modern-day Jordan kind of meats the eastern border
 modern-day Israel new Jericho and he said look we have this Covenant with God he gave us the laws I am going to what was the word basically make these laws legible yeah make legible Deuteronomy 1 verse 5 Moses undertook to expound or make legible make more clear than destruction of God that's refreshing the lock code for this next Generation yes who are now going to experience the company relationship in a new setting yes yeah that's right I might have been given to a migratory people who I've been traveling in other people's lands or territories or just in the middle of unclaimed Wilderness territory but what it's going to look like to be faithful to the same God and honor and live in Covenant loyalty to that God and with your neighbor is going to have to look different once you come in
 start building homes and neighborhoods and planting farms and that kind of thing and so the laws assume that new kind of social context vs Real Madrid going to be talking about law and this conversation yes let's remind ourselves how we've gotten all the lock code so far I mean I was just to help me because it's easy to imagine that what we've got in the Torah is like a complete set of laws yet that ancient Israel live by and it would even be easy to imagine that they would all be in one place at a few places but instead as you read through the Torah beginning with the Ten Commandments in Exodus and then on through the rest of X in the Middle cast numbers you've got little pockets lock code little sub collections of laws dropped into narratives spliced into an ongoing narrative
 so yeah this is connect back conversations trying to think the podcast how to read the law series we did get a few years ago and then I seen video on the law in the storyline is viable but yeah the tour is not a lot but that's we conceive of it it is a narrative into which have been spliced collections a lot which is tricky because often Torah is translated law I know when I see the word law and my Bible That's The Standard English words to translate the word Torah in all Modern English translations and that links back to and even pre English tradition which is all the way back to the Jewish Scholars who translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek in the pre-christian. And they used to Greek word Namaste translate or yeah which is like a legal statute written law so and that's a fine translation to cover one aspect
 of meaning of the word Torah but the basic meaning of it is instruction over teaching the guide somebody and sometimes those instructions take written form in the collection which case you could call them but as we're going to see Torah can refer to other forms or other ways that you can give guidance and instruction so yeah this is a conversation we've had over the years that the Torah is not a comprehensive law code given to Israel it is a story about a people who entered a covenant with God who said that the terms of our relationship will be a series of instructions and then into the story about the progression of that relationship have been dropped select like examples of yeah where we call them excerpts pictures of some larger body of law so Israel surely had much larger La collections
 but they have been selectively drawn from by the biblical authors and divided up into subunits and put into four different Scrolls of the Torah and when you say Israel you mean like ancient Israel Israel that would have lived in not even during second temple time you're talking like no during the time of the narrative setting which would have been middle Bronze Age maybe kind of time to transition into or in our modern Western calendar in the 1400 to 12 BC this is ancient Israel ancient to what we would call ancient Israel ancient Israelites what call this ancient Israel and the laws Bear all the marks of that more ancient contacts in fact in this conversation we're going to be reading some ancient Babylonian laws
 a lock code then what will see actually is the same concept is that lock codes function primarily as a source of wisdom and meditation and is a display of the lawgivers Justice righteousness and wisdom but I get ahead of myself so that's for the moment that's Deuteronomy it's Moses expounding and furthering the teaching of the earlier laws but now for the next Generation to live in a new context and that's the Nerdist reading the book we're going to do in this conversation is Pivot now into the second movement of Deuteronomy where it's good continues to be speeches from Moses but it's now Moses either restating laws that happened earlier in the collection or giving new laws that develop principles found in Bozrah earlier in the collection so this makes up what we call chapters 12 226 of Deuteronomy this is just a couple hundred ancient near Eastern
 I really like a list yep that's right there's no narratives in here sometimes the laws are cast as little mini narratives look like a little case lock brake you know where they say there's a guy who does this and then the woman who says this but from chapter 12 on track here I'll just read the first line of chapter 12 is and these are the statutes and judgments that you shall carefully observe in the land which Yahweh the Elohim of your father's has given to you to possess as long as you live on the way and you're there and then what follows a couple hundred of those laws before we die then I want to take this kind of two main large sections of law here one is in chapters will you call chapters 12 to 18 and almost all of them are about the way the Israelites are to express their worship
 and allegiance to Yahweh and also how their leadership structures are to be designed in order to keep the people loyal to Yaba so this whole section really is focused on Israel and God or loving God so we'll do the whole conversation on that second large section is in what we call chapters 19 to 25 and that's almost all focused on laws giving instruction about family situations or Village situations or how the tribes are to relate to each other in economics and social structure in a family then also how they are to relate to the Nations around them so this fits into a big large bucket that you could call loving your neighbor expressing love to your neighbor or so and loving God loving neighbor is a kind of the two what's up Jesus summarize the law that all toy but before we have those two conversations I want to back up and just remind us of something we've talked about
 over the years but it's always good to remember it when were talking about law or Statute in the Torah the first thing that should come into our minds is wisdom that laws are an expression of wisdom and a source of wisdom and meditation and that they function really differently than statutory law collections do in modern Western black legal libraries yeah we talked about our conversations on the wall and that's an interesting Rabbit Hole interesting set of Concepts to untangle because as a modern Westerner my idea of a lock code is very well cemented in what I understand about the judicial system in the way that our City's work and this is a completely different type of way to think about a lock of different legal tradition entirely
 those are is there public agreements about how we're going to organize our life together and agreements with some teeth and wisdom teeth yeah depending on how they're enforced you know whether through like monetary fines you know where physical coercion through like law enforcement and the way these laws adapt and developed cuz all the luck Traditions do is through collections of laws and then his new cases arise in a given Community you consult earlier laws and then either call them up and apply them in new ways where you adapt them to the new circumstance you know and that's what's interesting is maybe there isn't such a huge discrepancy in the way we actually do law yeah because when it comes down to it when I think about law I just think like a speed limit or you know I can't steal from the grocery store very basic kind of things yeah they're very clear but the judicial
 branch is in charge of when things happen that don't have a clear president like you just said they go to the rules that were set up before the case is in the house they were decided and then they use that as with them to decide okay then what do we do in this next case and then the decision that they make in that next case then becomes more case law that is now more wisdom and this whole body of law really is in a way a way by saying here's how we think is the most Wise Way for us to live and we're going to always adhere to it but it it's malleable it kind of changes slowly over time is cultural changes yeah yeah we just had a series of local elections here in Portland and so I'm thinking this was a couple Cycles ago but I remember when the way of the Portland public school system's high schools have been like paid for for maintenance and upkeep of that system.
 wasn't working because of Financial in the way the tax system moves design like a couple Generations ago was a big redesign of it and he's like bills I remember reading about it you know listening to radio episode of something and then like you know making my gut about this new bill and then you know within the next couple years and now all over certain for the public high schools will be shut down for a whole year all the students are sent to other schools and they are like doing a tear down rebuild of these hundred plus year old buildings all over Portland and it's Matt yeah I just was reflecting on it cuz it was like I signed a piece of paper along with hundreds of thousands of other people and how things are getting remodel all the sudden like the landscape of our city is being systematically redesigned and that was an updating of a series of financial tax laws to channel new money so that our kids don't go to school in the east
 old buildings but sometime I'm at you know I know all that in my imagination there's some like Body of Lies I'm sick or book yet down at City Hall or you know the courthouse downtown that just like exist in perpetuity and whenever the judges were judging cases they just look at the lock code and it tells them what to do about my mind it's hard to shake when you say like hey that's against the law that's kind of what comes to mind is this like sacred collection that is immutable. Just like exists and we all adhere to totally example another example is specific applications of the law so these laws exist you know like there should be stop signs like it's hidden corner but that you don't mess up my son I were just riding a bike somewhere last night and there's this intersection in our neighborhood that doesn't have a stop sign and it's just like so
 and so we went home and looked up like what does it take to like petition for a stop sign in your neighborhood that's a pretty elaborate process and you need to get neighbor signatures and so on but it was just kind of funny to think like what we need is a specific application of the law like traffic law in our neighborhood and the officials can't see it cuz they don't live on the street but we can see it every other time we ride by here so often times law codes become inefficient and they need new applications that require a whole process or sometimes the inefficient Caesar on purpose because if like you just put a stop sign up everywhere you want one takes forever to get anywhere Division Street in outer East Portland ever driven from like Gresham into Portland so going from east to west in the East and West Portland and there are more stop
 fine then like I'm not like Four Mile Stretch it's just takes forever and it's the same stretch but you can go down ten blocks and take Powell the north 10 blocking take Gleason and you can do it in half the time but anyway all this A law is a mutable adaptable thing and that's exactly what we're seeing in Deuteronomy and it's an embodiment of a set of values and a worldview in the view of the value of people and every culture does a little bit differently and the way that God spoke through Moses and the ancient legal cultural uniforms results in the loss that we have here in the Torah and this is the last big block in the section of Deuteronomy
okay so that was an interesting Little Rabbit Trail contemporary let's take an interesting Rabbit Trail but in ancient times about how the biblical authors and other ancient near Eastern frogs can see the laws as an embodiment of adaptable wisdom so the best place to go is actually not in the lock leknes such but it's one of the sermons of Moses and Deuteronomy chapter 4 and this it's this is just a great paragraph to run before Deuteronomy 4 is actually the center of the first movement of Deuteronomy which has chapters 1 to 11 to send her speech and know who is real listen to the statutes and judgments that I am teaching you to do so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land that Yahweh Elohim of your father's is giving you and statutes and judgments are two ways of just saying yeah specific applicable law code
 I'll talk about judgments in just a minute here but the word statute is sometimes hookah and it's from the Hebrew verb means to inscribe like the action to stem the switch is referring to the practice of actually a teaching if that's how you would ya make something official like a law under a stone tablet so that's what that means so Moses goes on you shall not add to the word that I'm commanding you nor take away from it so you can keep the commands of Yahweh you got that committee that makes us at immutable it does it does then we just so fascinating about this little line this is a great example of where Moses is adopting kind of a standard Covenant La Collection formula
 when you like learn to write a letter as a kid sincerely sincerely you know and then ending with Lexi those who are concerned you can say are you still awake like that and will actually be an example of later there's a handy Commentary series called The zondervan Illustrated Bible backgrounds, Terry the CIBC but its color and it just gives you pictures maps and it's a commentary specifically giving you ancient near Eastern cultural background cool stuff all through the whole paragraph the formula that is common in ancient Greece in literature it's found essentially in Egyptian scribal guidelines and in Assyrian
 La collections as warnings against changing any part of the Covenant treated Hammurabi between the minute included the same charge in the epilogue and he called down curses on anyone who would change his laws the same language is also found in the prologue and epilogue of a interlock hug called the lipid is start loss so this goes back to your kind of preloaded assumptions about what a lock code is in any culture so if you think of it the way we were describing earlier as some abstract collection that's down in the courthouse by abstracting mean well by abstract I mean it's just it's written and collected somewhere in writing and when judges are doing their thing day today deciding on cases they just go to the La Collection and then do what it says so here in this context the laws are the terms of a covenant old relationship so by living in
 Prince to the laws you're expressing your devotions and allegiance to a particular Elohim that saved your people out of slavery and he's saying this is how you can honor me in the relationship so to not add or take away is about saying you can't just change the terms of our relationship and invent a new lock code on your own in a way it's saying you don't do what's good in your eyes use the language of the Eden story but Moses is going to hear adapt La code for new contacts so I mean he's changing so there's something here which is yes don't go and change this but also you're going to have to have to change the example of what the words say
 we have to distinguish between what the words say and what the words mean so much it's not like up to you to just rewrite this Covenant a relationship or any time or any way you want to Moses is doing a particular way as he adapts earlier laws Faithfully into a new setting and in that sense you're not adding to it you are adapting Boca Ale least I think you know Moses is going to be rewording laws from Exodus example and adding new words to them as the adoption to a new setting so again either he's talking about two sides of his mouth or this formula, that's a formula means something a little bit different than it might mean to us at 1st Street or still in to drive before I see I have taught you statutes and judgments as you always commanded me and that you should do in the land that you're entering
 notice he keeps trying to tension to the new setting that requires a temptation of the lot so keep and do the laws for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the people give me the people's like other nations and they're going to hear all these statutes and say this great nation is so wise such an understanding people Moses continues for what great nation is there that has an L of him so near to it as y'all females whenever we call on him what great nation is there that has statutes and judgments as righteous as this whole Torah while I'm sitting in front of you today so you just dropped a ton of like Bible vocab here throw it away cuz I've been geeking out about this hook have an understanding reason why because this
 core a question in my mind I'm talk about a little bit come from Psalm 119 which is this reflection on this Israelite who just loves the laws of the Torah loves the Torah love it keep it up and three different times the psalmist says something to the extent of give me understanding one time he says it give me understanding so that I can do that if it's all in context of understanding the law and it's so interesting to me because and maybe we can talk about this on the podcast it seems to me that if I was an ancient Israelite reading the law it's pretty clear right is my ambiguity sometimes ya majority majority of it is there some you're thinking of that are kind of big and yes I go to bed I don't boil a baby goat and its mother's milk that's pretty clear line stand for what does it mean exactly
 it's like okay I understand the law says then yeah that's very total and so I do it right now I can't act like a modern person I can't read these laws and then do them but this is all messed up but you probably could have maybe midnight off of it depends on when he lives so what does it mean help me understand give me understanding you would think someone who comes a lock code would be like just help me fulfill my obligations to his flock only give me the tenacity to do it or give me the will to do or give me the like mind and heart you know give me a Shema heart but why ask for understanding and here we've got Moses using that word yeah along with the word sending them a related word but also different and in meaning as wisdom wisdom wisdom and understanding another words people who live by these instructions
 become a model to others of not just why would a law-abiding citizen but what a wise person who like they get it to get it they get what's going on are you understand the world yes that's it that's it yeah they understand the world so in other words laws are conceived of year as formative when Allah forms a group of people to live and see the world a certain way so that when you encounter all kinds of other circumstances that may be a specific law doesn't address that you will find yourself acting in certain ways because the laws have shaped you to see the world so this is exactly what most is the thing when people see the nation of Israel how they organize their economy and their social structures cuz that's what most the laws to do with and their worship of their God that does say wow that is a very unique way of being
 community and their God must be really wise that's the basic idea that we can flush that out of him or you could say all right if they're just going to be here to all these laws and just do them as stated then they are going to appear to be very wise people because they're always doing things that create righteous relationships Injustice even though we talked about his words in the past we maybe shouldn't take for granted that we know what they mean so he's using the words of these judgments which means the enactment of justice and he's calling the laws righteous subtact here wisdom and understanding law statute and Justice and righteousness okay so let's let's back up since we are on wisdom understanding we're settling that some wisdom so weird Hulk mama
 it's about practical skill like know how is a great English, Turn Fred's so it's the word used to describe both like craftsmanship people who know how to work with metal and wood The Artisans are said to have and then also people who know how to live and make life decisions that results in Florin Salam in abundance of good relationships it's the same word and understanding actually I'm curious cuz you took a deep dive and understanding reason why what's your current like shorthand for it's the word beat Dina Dina Dina Dina Skipper to they're both yasso Bean is the root word there is between and so I loved the picture of the in-between State being in flux that feeling of I have a decision to make and I don't know what is the right to say
 between thinks the liminal state which path leads to life which path leads to death and the ability to discern between between thing between things what does betweenin' and what's so interesting to me is a reflection on the tree of knowing good and bad to know between good and bad it's right yeah there's one tree that leads to life there's another tree. Says will lead to death but it doesn't look like it leads to death because it looks like a tree of understanding it's a tree to know ya between what's good and bad that sounds great that sounds great I need that and so they're not supposed to take it but you kind of have to be meditating on that you realize they are supposed to get understanding but not by taking it so anyways understanding what a wonderful Hebrew word yes so these laws will Moses says keeping and doing the laws this is your
 so, you know how this is your being on your ability to discern in in the eyes of all of the people's so the laws will produce people who understand the know-how and discernment okay so that's the point because what I was going to say was you could just do all the laws and you would appear to have understanding right almost like you're just little at, Ton's Yeah Yeah by robots Yes program just follow the lock code follow the code and then if you look at that person you'd be like what they look like they know what they're doing like I'm just following the code seems like there's something more going on here yeah it just saying like by living by these lock code you actually are going to become wise and understanding of the laws give you specific applications the wisdom and understanding so that over the course of a life you begin to live out the wisdom of the law in ways that the laws may be never addressed or imagined
 we are at the footstep of what The Sermon on the Mount in Jesus teaching is all about you've heard of said quit the law tonight and I tell you give the wisdom Jesus say like the law about don't murder is about how you regard your neighbor in your heart or how you talked about them when they're not around anybody he's like oh yeah but that's just the first step like there's wisdom and understanding involved in that law that will lead you to re-evaluate all of your relationships and I think about people that's what Moses's saying here
 cancel the last resort in wisdom and understanding he also uses two other words which is to call them just with judgement and righteous we've also made videos about these words to but quick recap the word judgement or Justice it's the word in the same word judgement is Justice yes and in fact I have tried over time to use the word justice more than judgment because I'm Protestant contacts the word judgment I don't know makes us think specifically of an angry punishing deity in my imagination but when I just shipped it to an another synonym in English that is very faithful to somebody just as if not a little more faithful to the whole range of meaning of the Hebrew word the word justice
 yeah you can say God brings Justice on someone brexit is a coherent English phrases and I've come to use that instead of saying God brought judgments on I'm not to like try and defend Dodge something but I think it communicate something it's that when God brings judgment on he is holding someone accountable to a standard of just relationship we would called Justice told her yeah so here's our two words so Justice or judgment is Miss pot is the noun and then righteousness the Hebrew word Estetica and Moses said that the laws are both so most convenient way I learned to categorize these was from the Old Testament scholar Christopher right in his book Old Testament ethics for the people of God so this is a quality of relationships right now we tend to think of it as an abstract, standard right I grew up thinking of it as
 an internal morality of like whether or not I'm checking off certain boxes we're not checking the wrong boxes my own kind of Purity code in a way but did you imagine that kind of abstract similar to the loss of City Hall Downtown there's just some Universal standard and I make a choice it either check that box Spritz I was a righteous move or that was an unrighteous move so within the Hebrew Bible a Act is righteous completely dependent or relative to its context in a relationship so the easiest way is that set of communes right relationships so you taught me that years ago and that's really helped me whatever I see the word righteous I just think right relationship with other aunt just to clarify I'm not just like pulling this out of thin air if you actually study how the word is used is used to refer
 are two two parties relating to each other in a way that is appropriate right and good for Mutual honor and flourishing but it will look different depending on who the two parties are so for an employer to relate with righteousness towards employee is different than a mother to a daughter is different to you and is co-workers is different to my niece's in My Neighbor Next Door and so different kinds of activity can be called righteous in the Hebrew Bible because they're about some sort of faithfulness or honoring the relationship between us and this is why I like in the book of Jobe he'll talk about how his efforts to provide clothing and food for the poor people in his neighborhood he calls it right just now and we would leave that Justice
 when Bible says that God is righteousness what is that referring to the way that he relates to his the way he relates to Creation to humans and then specifically to his Covenant people cuz when I hear God is righteousness I think God has fully embodied this abstract of list of things the dues and don'ts that like is complete versus the way he relates with creation or the relay at with Humanity yeah totally that's right yeah so you can have a Psalm a Psalm 36 your loyal love extends up to the skies okay to the clouds your righteousness is like the mountains of Elohim your Justice is like the Deep Abyss below
 you keep alive human and animal
 so the stability of creation we just referred to the meteors of the cosmos the sky the land and the waters beneath the land and the fact that the snow globe just stay as ordered doesn't just collapse in on itself as it did in the flood
 is a moment-by-moment manifestation of God's loyal love of his dependability and also have his righteousness and of his Justice interesting so here it's the image of an eternal self-sustaining being Elohim who is being itself doesn't have to sustain the life of puny little creatures like animals and humans but he does why because he said that he wants to be their Partners so this is a good example of God's righteousness isn't here like a abstract moral standard it's a relational quality that would have a real a suppression yeah when God preserves the life he is being righteous he's he's doing right by creation and doing right by humans by sustaining their existence the righteousness is the stability of creation itself in the stability of creation
 a display of God's righteous character but let's look at a human the human example one of the most scandalous and bizarre chapters in Genesis chapter 38 it's about a guy Judah who has some Sons die and then his daughter-in-law name Tamara palm tree is her name he lies and tune to see sir and says hey you know I'm not going to leave you as a widow I'll make sure you can marry one of my sons and then he leaves her hanging for like years so she dresses up as a sex worker and tricks for father-in-law disguise to have sex with her to produce offspring that will save the future of the family crazy story at first he says what my daughter-in-law like is pregnant by some unknown man so he says letter be burned at the stake you know and she comes out and she's like I actually I'm pregnant with your kiddo
 and what he says to her is this is Genesis 38426 when Judah recognized her he said she is more righteous than I am because I you know didn't give her to my son Shayla so in terms of some Universal standard of righteousness she lied to him but he lied to her so he says that she is more righteous that I am righteous so you saying in terms of righteousness here like we both have righteousness but she's more righteous than I am in this complicated story she found the path to create a good relationship which is weird because I did right by her father-in-law my father-in-law did not do right by her she became a widow under his care of his patriarchal household and so not cultural context he owes her
 to care for her and he hung out to dry and left her vulnerable so he didn't do right by her that would be unrighteous and maybe we would be like yeah that was on unrighteous to do that somebody and how we might use the word righteousness but then what she does is lies disguises herself sleeps with her father-in-law and that he calls that righteousness meaning she did right by him in what way did she do right by him in here the goal is to preserve a future for the family she did right by her and her family but all he did right by him she helped him fulfill his obligations which by the way was to make sure that she has a family lineage either through one of his sons or I guess it's Ryan he himself and she is preserving the future of his family which is what he neglected to do so but actually it is all very good at making the point of its its relative to the relational contacts
 very relative story here is a relative's the relational word in Biblical Hebrew it's doing right by somebody specifically whatever that might look like is specific to the context of our relationship so all the way back out Moses says obeying the wisdom of the laws will be Israel's righteousness before God and before their neighbor in other words it doesn't mean that this is not an example of what Protestants classically called like the laws are Works righteousness that you earn I married before God and then he'll save you here if I just would have checked every box I would have been okay it's more of that God has already saved these people are you wants to show them how to live in a flourishing society which means people doing right by each other so that the nation's
 look on it's likely were all the way back to being an image of God and being a kingdom of priests so living by the laws will show they live in right relationship to their God and if they do that other nations will lock on and say well following back. Pretty awesome because it results in the community that looks like this so that's set a right relationship and relationships are difficult and complicated and so you can eat a lot of wisdom and understanding I mean a lot to be able to decide between so many variables and ways that relationships can go wrong that's it so Moses called the law is righteousness and you also called them examples of Miss pot or Justice or an English translations judgment and so a judgment or a spot watch to hear this is Christopher right against his Old Testament ethics for the people got all this quote him
 he says Miss pot refers to what needs to be done in a given situation if people and circumstances are to be restored in Conformity to set up a spot is a set of actions it's something that you do taking upon oneself the cause of those who are vulnerable in there on the fence about Sarah, refers to the State of Affairs the situation you aim to achieve by means of Miss pot and it's focused on the vulnerable most often doesn't make sense I mean if there's two people in a relationship whatever relationship is and it goes south Whoever has the most power that relationship is likely going to be the one who gets the better end of the deal and then someone can be left in the work and so if there is no set of course there's going to be some one
 who has become the vulnerable in that situation and for there to be restoration towards set economy means you would need to help person who got the short of the stuff yeah yeah a great example of all of these ideas brought together in a poem about a lock code is in Psalm 72 which is a prayer somehow related to Solomon was it by him or for him that's all grab the whole but it's a prayer to God on behalf of the lineage of Kings from the line of David into the poem begins with the request of the poem The God saying oh God give the king your Miss pot
 and give your test a car to the son of the king so that he can judge your people with sciatica and judge the afflicted ones with Miss Paula said notice even our English word judge sounds kind of funny there you like why would you judge Afflicted vulnerable people but a means to bring Justice on their behalf when you bring Justice it can go either way you're bringing Justice to someone who's the victim then you're you're creating restoration for them tonight you bring Justice to a perpetrator and you are judging them to bring Justice on is a better English phrase that kind of captures the whole meaning support continues this interesting let the mountains bring Shalom to the people
 and also the hills in cetica if you had a king who is doing righteousness and justice for all the people especially vulnerable creation itself will respond by bringing Shalom and Harmony to the people cuz there's so much to bility in your environment is all rooted in a worldview sustained by the Garden of Eden stories when you have wise human rulers co-rulers male and female ruling the world together in unity and wisdom creation itself will respond with abundance in the form of garden that's because that's the setup and so here it's about a royal image of God bringing Justice with wisdom and righteousness and the mountains and Hills will respond
 and then the last line of opening paragraph may he vindicate or bring me a spot for the afflicted ones of the people vindicate so that's the word Mitch patin like as a verb for a book a chef so again it sounds weird me he judged the afflicted ones of the people that are judged on their behalf and that's in parallelism with me he saved the children of the poor and crushed the oppressor classic biblical Justice and righteousness language being in right relationship to his people means to specifically identify whose most vulnerable and then bring about acts of Mischief pot that will result in Seneca to for the community in which case you get a garden growing and giving salaam to everybody
 I know this is a Biblical Portrait of law as wisdom okay so practically ancient Israelite and there isn't a right relationship between me and someone let's say we decide let's consult the lock code and we do and it's not clear the right answer practically what do we know what happens like how do they then try to find the wisdom underneath the lock code and and what sense is this cash out Deuteronomy chapter one that we have a story about an exodus where his father-in-law Jethro said like a man can't leave these people alone and bring Justice Visions for everybody situation you need a team so Moses recalls that and then Deuteronomy 1 verse 12 he's telling the people like how am I alone able to carry the load in the burden of you and all of your dispute
 so he says it here's what I told the people I said choose wise and Discerning it's the same to Hebrew words as wisdom and understanding choose wise and Discerning and knowledgeable men from each from your tribes and I will appoint them is heads for your people and you answered me and said this is a good idea and so I took heads of your tribes and appointed them what's the experience word oh it's the word yeah. Experiential knowledge wisdom know how discernment knowing between one thing and another and you and your dad is that connected to the. Yes he burn down.
 416 then I gave a charge to these judges in this the Hebrew word Miss pot but as a referring to a group of people shooting the Miss Potter's the Miss Potter the Book of Judges in the Old Testament this is the word so I gave it charged to your judges saying listen to the cases between a fellow countrymen and bring righteous Justice between a man and his neighbor bring the spot citica bring a Miss pot that is that I don't show partiality listen to the unimportant one and the important person alike don't fear humans because Miss pot belongs to God in any case it's too hard for you to bring it to me and I'll take it there is a lock code is a lot but then there's a setup of Judges Miss Potter's
 when it's not clear you go to them and they discern they have wisdom and understanding they can look it up if it's somebody who has wisdom and discernment and experience don't know and where did they get that is Justice and righteousness comes from a kind of person that comes from the wise let me know if that comes up here and look like the concept is also the store I will make you wise exactly and well the Torah is a source of with them if you meditate on it the laws are an embodiment of applications of wisdom and if you read and do the Psalm 119 on them you will find yourself becoming one of the people that Moses would have said hey you lead a group of 50 people over here cuz I see that you have
 know-how and discernment an experience so that makes a lot of sense it's the push back just to make sure really clear that you're not just reading this into this cuz all the way back to where we started Moses said I think it wasn't for dinner before ya keep and do the laws for that is your wisdom and understanding so what he doesn't say is meditate on the laws that's what you just said yes that's true you do that thing do it don't matter don't matter you're not married don't boil the goat and it's milk and mothers and all right I won't do that thing so I love what you're saying about becoming someone who meditates on the law finds the wisdom underneath and I and yes Jesus did that and we already pointed out that the psalmist
 for understanding and but how do you see that here got it okay so you're right I am drying here on a metal seems about the Hebrew Bible starts in the garden there was one command of the tree of knowing good and bad but that command and bought it a lot more than just the wording of the command it was about trust that God can discern between life and death and for us in a way that I can't right now released out of mini-camp in their morale in tipsy so speak there's a lot more going on in that command than just you know forbidden fruit it's about trust of someone's wisdom what I'm saying is adherence to the laws of the Torah is wisdom laws are wisdom law codes are wisdom literature in the biblical imagination
 so that's why I'm seeing it here in Deuteronomy 4 because he's calling law observance wisdom but we'll see it appear for example later on to do drawn to me there's a law about how Israel is to appoint their kings so Deuteronomy 17 verse 14 when you enter the land lord to God's giving you your possessive and live in it and you all say you know we want a king to Reign Over Us like all the nations that are around us then do this set a king over you whom Yahweh your Elohim to needs to be an Israelite not an honest Reliant you shouldn't multiply horses for himself that his tanks tanks this isn't like don't don't have like a noise like a horse farm the ride knows about building a military you should keep a real small military definitely don't go back to Egypt to get a
 the horses don't get those Egyptian tanks ya don't multiply wives that is through political alliances because his heart his Covenant loyalty will be giving away definitely he should not try and amass a lot of money so just real quick weird actually these are building a big army power building political alliances and whatever religious alliances need to go along with that and building a big economic store house where power is really
 this is like what every this is the impulse of everyone in a position to take care of themselves to a group of people people that they are responsible for let's make sure we have security well networked and funded right bandhan this is what is good Shirley this is what is good totally seems like a good path what a what a beautiful tree is good to eat good for gaining wisdom to do the opposite of what you would leave them in it vulnerable insecure State less networked and without a bunch of Financial Resources build that kind of Kingdom so this is a great example of how in this cycle of his real story we're back at the Two Trees of Eden when it comes about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom here's how he used to rule
 write out for himself a copy of the Torah on a scroll in the presence of the priests and it will be with him and he shall read it aloud all the days of his life why so that he will learn to fear Yahweh is all I am by keeping all of the words of the Torah and so that his heart won't be lifted up above his brothers and that he won't turn side from the commandant to the right or left so the sons me live long in the land
 there's another example so the king is to be the kind of person who is supposed to Samba 119 person right here you write out your own personal copy is like a form of meditating on it and then obey it do the thing that's the word for keeping doing just keep it mean to obey it and it results in somebody who fears Elohim that is well it's a whole Rabbit Hole itself but yeah you are you have a healthy respect and even some black some good fear of the consequences of not doing what the sell him ask me to do you know I've been reflecting on that for a little bit and what's interesting is he out there is an intensity to the phrase the fear of Yahweh there's a fear but what's interesting is that the fear is if you go back to the story of garnet
 the fear would be taking the knowledge of good and bad on my own terms instead of going to Yahweh so then Veer would actually bring me to Yahweh yeah that's right that's right of the fear of Yahweh is actually an Impulse to draw near to him and to actually be afraid of making a decision without yeah closer to his arrest right into the relationship I've never heard you quite put it that way it's supposed to want to be near DIY flea which is in this case to sit in his presence and read meditate on his wisdom which isn't which you do it going to get to that but it's like the fear like if I'm not in this intense relationship things will go your way and in the bigger picture that fear of the Lord results in humility
 it says a twenty so his heart won't be lifted up but then also it results in all of these really non-intuitive decisions for the king who keeps his impulse for power and check totally so for the king of Israel to do right to do righteousness before y'all way we'll look like these Strange Behaviors you know when they're having like the ancient version of like the G20 like the king of Moab in the king of my daughter he's going to be like you know thank you but no thank you. No thank you he's like let me show you my new Fleet of Egyptian stallions you know when the Chariots they fall and you know the Israelites like let me show you this really cool store in Florida what I've been thinking about lately and but it teaches me with them in the fear of the Lord you know that's like that's the deal here it's a contrast Kingdom well and
 Fiesta La produces a king like this how much more so you know what the laws produced the people who all the way back to do around me for where we started this is all a stage play for the nation's but Samosa says that keeping the laws is your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of all the peoples to and faithfulness to the laws of the Torah is wisdom and understanding its righteousness is Justice and I think ultimately and then I'll bring it back to the dissection this opening section it's love it's how you love you and it's how you love your neighbor because it's living in ways that lead to life to eat in life if I was a king I guess I'm the king of my own little domain my calendar and whatever but yeah I want to okay I want you to someone right out the door and I meditate on it there is a difference between an ancient Israel
 King it says and then do it for the most part I think you can probably just do it right and me and my setting and it's like you know whatever don't boil to go in your car like I understand okay or you know make this sacrifice on this in this way I'm kind of like I don't do that so as I read I mean we can just probably go into the lock code to start reading us and we will in the next couple times we will print about this all works and then we'll design drive car in the next couple episodes but that's the that's the big picture here and I just for me it's just this is actually become one of what we call one of the pillars of the Paradigm that we use as we research and write and create content for the Bible project it's one of the pillars is that the Bible is wisdom literature
 and this is what we're talking about not just a lock code but even the narratives everything because this is a narrative even though it's a lock code embedded in a bunch of speeches of Moses that all happens within a narrative contact you and these texts are designed to produce people who lives with them and Justice and righteousness in the fear of the Lord resulting in the blessings of Eden in my life and in the life of those around me that's the goal that's why Psalm 119 I mean just pick any of the statements and the begins to make a lot more sense how blessed are those whose way is blameless those who walk in the Torah if y'all were walking in the Torah walking in the Torah
 I just walk the way that you've been instructed to walk how blessed are those who keep his testimonies is another vocab word yeah totally so every law Bears witness his courtroom witness language Bears witness to the character and wisdom of so4 7 I will give thanks to you with an upright heart when I learn your Your Righteous judgments there's a two words right there yeah one of my favorite ones is Psalm 119 Verse 18 open up my eyes
 so that I can see wonders from your Torah school has been my experience with the Torah over the course of a couple decades and understand it wanders that's similar to the line I love in this song and he's 31 give me understanding so that I might let you open my eyes to see the wonders of Wonders within it give me understanding that is that's the discernment between two things word so that I may keep your Torah I need discernment to be able to keep the laws of the Torah that's counterintuitive as you would think this is why I was cooking it so just do it now you're going to actually need wisdom to know how to keep the loss of the target here's a student of the Torah
 I'm sure has an unlock I mean memorized all right and they're like I need understanding be able to keep it what are they getting that Jesus mention the young Jesus meditating on you know when the Ten Commandments do not murder and he's praying this prayer give me understanding give me understanding father and then what comes out is that long meditation in The Sermon on the Mount that the wisdom the Divine wisdom there is about anger and how you talk about people behind their back and right that's where Jesus Is Mine goes when he hears the command don't murder and I think it's right it's because he clearly spent time seeking understanding that law now
 there's a mystery at the heart of this for me which is God gives a command and then we're supposed to obey it but then by meditating on the command we then get more wisdom to learn how to not just obey it that's why is understanding people now but that can easily go astray I can sit and meditate on a lot and bring my own understanding and then twist it and then turn it into something that was good make it bad right you can imagine Jesus but a young someone else who's like sitting meditating on a lot and then being like I know how to use this law for my own good so I can have power washer I'm going to twist this and so what's going to keep you from being that person and being meditator that twists
 and then it brings you back to this idea I will fear the lord which means what will do what he says and this is kind of like you remember that little details for the king he has to make his own personal meditation copy of the tour out here in the presence of the levitical priests and yeah for so this connects another pillar of our approach to the Bible which is the Bible is communal literature and Moses a talking to the congregation of the sons of Israel all of these user plural you know so yeah of course one of us will have blind spots as we seek the wisdom of the laws of the Torah but that's what why we turned the Bible backgrounds commentary that's reading the Bible and Community with the scholars who helping give me inside and then we do it with our friends and
 local community of Jesus followers and trusted spirit will guide us I think that's how it works that is how it's worked through history and how it works as described right Moses needed a crew of wise ones to guide the people with someone so that's too simple of an answer to a very important question but it's always the beginning of the response so they got the laws as wisdom literature it's as good a session that you know once a year or once every couple years is good reminder especially before we do we're going to do next which is dive into the straight-up meditation on ancient Israelite laws which will do in the next step of our conversation
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we'll continue talking about the law looking at the laws outlined in Deuteronomy and jumping Ford in the biblical story to how the apostles derived wisdom for followers of Jesus from these ancient laws the law as stated in Deuteronomy 15 is stating an ideal like a true north but of course there's all these other mitigating circumstances or things that will require wisdom and discernment and the law as word it doesn't address those so another words cause mine is on these themes of God's provision he would meditate on dear I'm 15 and stay if Israel was obedient to the laws they get eaten by so that there would be no poor among them and even though that's not the world we live in now we could approximate it so we could begin to taste it today's episode was produced by help with the associate producer Lindsay Potter edited by Dan Campbell Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza
