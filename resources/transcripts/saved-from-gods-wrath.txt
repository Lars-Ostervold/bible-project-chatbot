Jon Hi, this is Jon at BibleProject. This is our last episode on the anger of 
God. Today we’re going to look at how the Apostle Paul talks about 
God’s anger in the book of Romans. We’ve done these past six episodes 
on this one attribute of God, because for many of us, God’s anger 
can be scary and confusing. For others, we’ve actually flattened out 
God’s anger to be something simpler than what it actually is.
Tim This is the basic summary of Christian belief when I was first introduced 
to it in my early 20s, is you’re human, you have a conscience between 
right and wrong, you’ve done wrong, sin, God is holy, therefore, He 
is angry at you for your sin, and He’s going to kill you. It’s His justice 
and His Holiness, He has to kill you. Jesus died in your place instead, 
and so you can be forgiven and have life instead of death. So what 
I’m saying is that abstraction doesn’t really do justice to all of the 
elements in that summary, especially this idea of God’s anger and 
death. God’s anger is God’s handing people over to a process that’s 
self-chosen that results in death, but it’s very much what I want.
Jon So the Apostle Paul opens his letter to the Romans saying, 
quote, “The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven 
against all the godlessness and wickedness of people.”
Tim So then that raises the question, well, how is the wrath of God 
being revealed? What does it look like? He repeats himself three 
times. He says, “Therefore, because they’ve exchanged their 
glory that God wants them to have for idolatry, therefore, God 
gave them over in the passionate desires of their hearts.”
Jon God’s wrath is handing us over to ourselves, giving us what we want, which 
doesn’t lead to a true life. What Paul will later say is that we are rescued from 
this path by Jesus. And because of Jesus, we are now at peace with God.
Tim So to say that you’re saved from God’s wrath, it’s like you’re being 
taken off a set of train tracks and you’re put onto different set of 
train tracks that leads to life. This is what he means when he says 00:00:00

00:02:00Saved from God’s Wrath Character of God E11
October 26, 2020, 56.37  
Speakers in the audio file: Jon Collins, Tim Mackie, Carissa Quinn  2to be saved from God’s anger. It’s not just a post mortem event at 
the end of your life. God’s wrath is something that begins now. It’s 
something that I need to be rescued from right now. I don’t want to 
be given over to my basis desires. That would be terrible for me and 
everybody around me, starting tomorrow, and not just after I die.
Jon Paul puts it this way in Romans 5, but God demonstrates His 
own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for 
us. Since we have now been justified by His blood, how much 
more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through Him?
Tim When Paul talks about the cross, what he foregrounds of 
God’s character is not his anger. He foregrounds God’s 
love. The cross is a demonstration of God’s love. 
Jon Thanks for joining us. Here we go. 
 We are going to finish up a conversation on the anger of God. 
This conversation is part of a series where we’re walking through 
five different attributes of God in Exodus 34. The middle attribute, 
the third attribute is not so much an attribute of God, but it’s a 
description of the way God handles anger, which is that He’s slow 
to anger. This is our boy, sixth episode, I think, on anger, and we’ll 
try to land the plane. I’m here with Carissa. As usual, hi Carissa.
Carissa  Hi. 
Tim And Dr. Tim Mackie. I should say Dr. Carissa Quinn as well if I must say 
Dr. Tim. I’m the one here without a doctorate and the most confused 
of us all. Speaking of which, man, I feel like I really have been doing 
such a bad job. I just feel like I’m just all over the place. What I would 
love is to hear...Tim, you built these notes. We haven’t had you yet do a 
recap. Could you try to do like a five-ish minute just like how would you 
recap the main beats of where we’ve been and then bring it to Jesus.
Tim So God’s anger in the Bible is very common. Most people think that, 
especially the God of the Old Testament is He’s mainly just angry at 
humans and killing them for the stupid things they do. So the fact is, 
is that the portrait of God’s anger is way more nuanced than that. It’s 
actually telling us some really powerful things that we stand to benefit 
and learn from about ourselves and about God. God’s anger doesn’t 
occur nearly as often as readers of the Old Testament might think. It 
occurs less often in the Bible. And when it does occur, it’s surprising.
 So God’s Anger appears first in the Bible with Moses in a conversation 
that he’s having about how He wants Moses to represent Him. And Moses 
refuses five times over. That’s the first time God gets angry. So that itself 00:03:00
00:04:00
00:05:00  3is beginning a pattern that God’s anger in the Old Testament is most 
consistently expressed towards the people that He’s calling to represent 
Him. The famous stories like the flood or Sodom and Gomorrah, they 
are acts of God’s justice against evil. But in neither one of those stories 
is God angry. In the flood, God is overcome with grief and sorrow. 
 So as the storyline of the Bible develops, God invest in one particular group 
of people to be His representatives to the world. They are the ones with 
whom God gets most angry most often in the storyline of the Bible. Just 
like how we tend to get the most angry and frustrated with the people 
that we are most invested in relationally. If you get a concordance and 
you search out all the times that God gets angry at Israel, you’ll find a few 
dozen stories, and you’ll find a pretty consistent response. How does God 
expresses anger? It’s most consistently demonstrated with the phrase and 
God handed them over, or gave them over into the hands of their enemies.
 So God hands Israel over to the consequences that are destructive 
and ruinous. But it’s the choices that they made that got them there. 
Moses says it’s God hiding His face. The prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, 
Ezekiel, they developed this in a big way. The bad guys that Israel 
is handed over to because of their faithlessness to the covenant is 
Assyria and Babylon. We didn’t talk about this. Isaiah calls Assyria 
the rod of God’s anger. It’s as if Assyria is the instrument of God’s 
anger, which is to hand Israel over to their bad decisions.
 So when Jesus enters the scene, He sees Himself in the role of another 
one of these prophets, but also, as the covenant God of Israel Himself, 
pursuing His people again, warning them that if they don’t accept His 
way of being Israel among the nations, that they are going to yet again 
be subject to God’s anger, which will be to be handed over to the power 
of Rome. Jesus warned that this would happen. When He wrote into 
Jerusalem for Passover, He intentionally provoked the rulers of Jerusalem, 
challenging their authority, claiming that He was Israel’s true authority. 
 And when He begins to talk about what He thought was going to 
happen, it becomes clear that He knew that he was going to die. In 
fact, He went to Jerusalem specifically to poke the bear, to provoke 
the leaders to a showdown knowing that they would kill Him. But 
it’s not a tragedy in Jesus’ eyes. In Jesus’ eye, he is—and He uses 
this phrase multiple times in that Passover week—that He’s going 
to drink the cup of God’s anger, which is a key prophetic image for 
Israel being handed over to pagan oppressors, to foreign armies.
Jon Say that again, Tim. He’s going to drink the cup of God’s anger...00:06:00
00:07:00
00:08:00  4Tim Yes, which is a very particular Old Testament metaphor for Israel being 
overwhelmed and conquered by foreign armies and pagan oppressors.
Jon So they put a fine point on it. 
Tim Mm hmm.
Jon When Jesus uses that phrase, you think He’s specifically thinking 
about the fact that He’s going to be killed by Roman oppressors?
Tim Yeah, and the corrupt leaders of Israel that are in league with Him. 
Jon Okay.
Tim I think that if you just study the scriptural hyperlinks that Jesus is 
making there, I think that’s unavoidably the conclusion. That’s precisely 
what He goes to Jerusalem to do. That’s why He stages His protest 
in the temple courts, in full view of the leaders of the temple, but 
also in view of the Roman governor, because the Roman governor 
had a vested interest in keeping the peace in the temple courts. 
 So Jesus’ trial, the moment of these two Jesus’ standing on trial, an innocent 
Jesus Son of God, and then a guilty Jesus Barabbas, who’s the rebel against 
Rome, and the innocent Jesus, who was trying to tell Israel to love their 
Roman enemies, and then the guilty Jesus who tried to kill the Roman 
enemies go free. Jesus intentionally goes to his death on behalf of His guilty 
people. This is what He meant by drinking the cup of God’s anger. The anger 
there is simultaneously the wrath of Rome and the wrath of Israel’s leaders. 
 Another important strand in here is Jesus’ understanding of His death 
and confrontation as being a cosmic confrontation with demonic spiritual 
powers that have hijacked the kingdoms of this world to be instruments 
of injustice as opposed to justice. He believes that what He’s confronting 
the powers of darkness. So it’s substitutionary atonement. It’s Jesus dying 
in our place, it’s Jesus conquering the powers of death and evil in our 
place, and it’s Jesus as an act of love and surrender, giving his life in the 
place of faithless, corrupt people. It’s all of those things rushing together. 
So anger is one sub theme of them. That took me a while. Sorry.
Carissa  No, that’s good. It’s really helpful.
Jon Anger being a subtheme, meaning that the anger of God, which 
results in experiencing the consequences of our evil and injustice 
that manifests itself very concretely in the biblical story of, like 
Babylon coming, that Jesus is experiencing that anger and that 
He is experiencing what it’s like for the chaos of the oppression of 
Rome coming and taking His life, which is what He is saying is going 
to happen to all of Israel because of the way they’re acting. 00:09:00
00:10:0000:11:00  5Tim Yeah, that’s right. And that’s what Jesus Barabbas represents—a 
rebel Israelite who tries to confront Rome. What would normally be 
coming His way, which is to get killed by the Romans for being a 
rebel, but instead, the guilty Jesus Barabbas goes free. And Jesus 
of Nazareth, who’s innocent, takes His place and goes to his death. 
This reasonably struck me that that scene was Barabbas is actually 
close to the heartbeat of the atonement theology in the Gospels. 
Carissa  Amazing. 
Jon So Jesus is experiencing God’s anger here? 
Tim He drinks the cup. But what that doesn’t mean is God’s angry at me and so 
He just takes out His anger on me and kills me. It’s God’s anger has already 
decided to give Israel over and Jesus puts Himself in the place of His people. 
Jon So He experienced an anger.
Tim He experienced God’s anger, which is being handed over to death. 
Jon But if you were to try to parse that down more and say, 
was God angry at Jesus in that moment, then you’ve 
got farther than where the biblical authors go. 
Tim Yeah. I think from everything Paul the apostle or John says about the 
cross, I think they would say, “No, that’s the opposite conclusion.” 
Paul would say the cross is an expression of God’s love and it’s 
where God’s love and God’s anger meet together to rescue humans, 
and to provide them life out the other side of death. That’s actually 
where we’re going right now in the rest of this conversation. 
Section Break 
Tim So I’ve excerpted here a selection from Romans 1. I’ll just kind of lead us 
through and be to play tour guide as we go through. But you’ll just follow 
Paul’s thought here. Paul’s writing a letter to network of house churches in 
Rome that are divided along ethnic and cultural lines, and he’s trying to help 
them see that they should be unified because he wants to go there and use 
their network as a home base to go be a missionary further on into Spain.
 He wants to announce the gospel, the good news. So he unpacks what 
that is. He says in chapter 1, verse 16, “I am not ashamed of the good 
news. It is God’s power for rescuing everyone who believes to the Jew 
first, but also to the Greek. For in the good news, God’s righteousness, 
the upstanding character of God that compels him to do right by his 
promises, that’s what is revealed in the good news.” That’s my paraphrase. 
That’s not actually what the translation says but my paraphrase.00:12:00
00:13:42  6 It’s revealed from faith to faith. There’s literally whole stacks of books 
written on just what that phrase means. “Just as it is written,” and he 
quotes Habakkuk 2, “the righteous one, the one who does right by God 
will live by his trust—his faith in God.” So the righteousness of God is 
revealed in the good news. And then he flips it. He says, “Because the 
wrath of God, the anger of God is being revealed from the skies against 
all ungodliness, all unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth and 
unrighteousness. He unpacks it. He says, because what is known about 
God is evident even inside of people, God has made it evident to them. 
Since the creation of the world, God’s invisible attributes, His power, His 
nature, you can see them being understood by what’s been made.
Carissa  Tim, here, he’s talking about all humanity here, not 
just the Jewish people. Is that right? 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. That’s going to be important. His point is even without 
having the special privilege of Israel, watching the ten plagues, and the 
rescue of the Exodus, and being at Mount Sinai, you can just do Psalm 19. 
“The heavens declare your glory.” You look up and you’d be like someone’s 
behind this whole, elaborate cosmic system. Yep, that’s his point.
 So he says, even though humans can infer that there is some beautiful 
mind behind the whole thing, even though they knew God, they did 
not honor Him as God or give thanks. Rather, they became futile or 
pointless in their speculations and their foolish hearts were darkened. 
How does that work? Well, thinking that they were all wise, they 
became fools, and humans exchanged the glory of the incorruptible 
God for an image in the form of corruptible humans, birds, four-footed 
animals, and crawling creatures. So for modern readers, this doesn’t 
land nearly the way it would for somebody who lives in the first century 
Rome, which is where these people lived, where you had idle shrines 
at every corner, and even in the corners of most people’s houses.
Carissa  This seems like just probably because we’ve been talking so much 
about Exodus and the golden calf, it seems so similar to that story. 
But do you think it’s meant to be much broader than that?
Tim Yes. Well, that little line there, they exchange the glory of the incorruptible 
God for the image of humans, birds, four-footed animals, he highlights, 
he’s actually quoting from Psalm 106 in that little statement. “They 
exchange their glory for an image.” He’s quoting from Psalm 106, 
which is retelling the story of the golden calf in poetic form.
Carissa  That’s interesting.00:15:00
00:16:00
00:17:00  7Tim So he’s using the golden calf story to describe all humanity. He’s 
using a story about  Israel to describe the state of all humanity. Which 
essentially, he tells us a story of humans are made for so much more 
and they are talking to us, revealing that there’s something cosmic 
and transcendent going on. But what humans want to do is create. 
Instead of recognizing they’re the image of God, they give over their 
dignity and authority. And they don’t under the Creator, rather, they 
exchange the glory of the incorruptible God for a self-made God.
Jon And for all of the values and ideas that these 
other manmade gods represent?
Tim Yeah, that’s right. That’s what kind of we have to infer here. Like, what did 
these idols mean to people, but the names of these idols are Roma, which 
is the Roman Empire deified as a goddess, or you Iustitia justice. Then 
there’s all of the classic kind of Greek gods or Zeus or Apollo. But they all 
embody war, justice, wine, the economy. They’re what today we would call 
institutions. Actually, when I lived in Madison, Wisconsin, where I was going 
to graduate school, it’s also the state capitol. And the state capitol building 
is like right next to the big university. So I went in there quite a bit. And I 
went to Oregon State Capitol where I grew up like once on a field trip for 
school or something. But I went into the Wisconsin State Capitol a lot. 
 If you look up, is all of these elaborate decorative carvings, and 
there’s all these great words like liberty and justice, but written in 
Roman capital letters, like Latin capital letters, and above them are 
statues of the Greek or Roman gods that these words represented. 
I remember it hit me one day like, “Oh, I’m not as far from the first 
century as I thought. I think this is an all of our state capitols.” We’ve 
like secularized all of this, but these institutional ideals hold the 
same place in our imagination that they did in the first century.
Jon I remember when we were talking about the golden calf story, and I 
realized this detail that they weren’t creating a new god, they were 
recreating Yahweh. They’re like, “Here’s Yahweh. Let’s worship Yahweh. 
And it’s a golden calf. It’s this domestication of let’s turn God into 
something that we want, that we can understand and control.”
 Then the other thing I’m thinking about here is that, and you pointed 
this out many times, is that the tragedy here is not merely the turning 
away from God and creating an idol to represent Him. It’s that we’re 
missing that we’re supposed to be the image of God. So there’s this 
calling of reflecting  the true nature of this. And he uses the word 
“incorruptible”. I’d be curious, why that word. But you think of just this 
untamable God we’re supposed to be the image of to rule the world. 00:18:00
00:19:00
00:20:00
00:21:00  8Instead, we say, “Well, no, actually, let’s create things that we can obey 
and serve instead that are maybe a little more easier to figure out.
Tim Totally. We can even drill even closer. When he says they exchange the 
glory of the incorruptible God, this is that interview we did somewhere 
within the last year with a New Testament scholar Haley Goranson 
Jacob. She traced the theme of glory through the letter to the Romans. 
It was really cool conversation. But what she was pointing out is this is 
the first occurrence of the word glory. If you trace it through, what it 
most often refers to is the g lorious status that God made humans for. 
 So to exchange the glory of the incorruptible God is to exchange 
the glory that the incorruptible God wants us to have. That’s what it 
means here. So we are the glorious image of God, but we exchange 
that, the glory that God wants to give us, and we give it to these 
corruptible human statues. It’s this tragic inversion of our identity.
Carissa  It’s interesting that that aligns so much with our view of 
God’s anger—him being angry when people...
Tim Betray Him.
Carissa  Yeah, they betray Him, but they don’t have proper maybe understanding 
of their representation of him, or they’re harming themselves. 
Maybe that’s what I’m getting at. There’s like this humanitarian 
thing there where people are harming themselves or harming 
others, and they’re not representing Him. It makes sense why this 
is so connected with  His anger, or His handing them over.
Tim Yes. I’m just cluing into something you said Carissa a few minutes ago. 
Here we are again, at the story of a golden calf. Even in the letter to the 
Romans, when Paul brings up God’s anger, the first story, he starts thinking 
in terms of is the golden calf story and in light of the Genesis 1 image of 
God story. Here it’s, yeah, you’re right, it’s not even betrayal as such, it’s 
the thing that God’s so passionately invested in to share this world with 
human partners ruling it together. And that’s the thing that we forfeit 
when we take these transcendent ideals of beauty and goodness and 
justice and these wonderful gifts of sex and food and power. And then we 
treat them as gods that we’re willing to give everything for. And that’s the 
moment that God gets angry. That’s Paul’s argument in a nutshell here.
 So then that raises the question, well, how is the wrath of God being 
revealed? What does it look like? If you want to know where to look for 
it, if God’s angry, what would you say? And he repeats himself three 
times what he thinks it means. It starts in verse 24. He says, “Therefore, 
because they’ve exchanged their glory that God wants them to have 00:22:00
00:23:00
00:24:00  9for idolatry, therefore, God gave them over in the passionate desires of 
their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored.
 He goes on to talk about all these destructive, sexual misbehaviors that 
hurt people, through which people hurt others and themselves. Verse 26, 
he repeats it again. “For this reason, God gave them over to dishonoring or 
degrading passions.” Verse 28, skipping forward, again, “And just as they 
didn’t see fit to even acknowledge God anymore, God gave them over 
to a senseless mind, so that they would do things that are not right. ” 
 He begins to go through this bucket list here that he uses to describe the 
culture that he sees around him: unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, 
envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice, gossip. That is basically any human 
community anywhere in the history of the world. Verse 32, “Even though 
people know that these things are wrong and if they believe in God as 
he says, even though they know that God’s commands, they know that 
people who practice such things are worthy of death. But yeah, we do 
them anyway. And we even approve of people who do these things.”
 He’s trying to give a portrait of a realistic portrait of what happens to 
human communities when they exalt idolatrous ideals and self-made ideals 
to the place of God. He gives people over. He said it three times. God’s 
anger is giving people over to the consequences of their decisions . 
 So there’s a lot more going on in Romans one. I just wanted to point that 
out, that this is exactly how the Hebrew Bible talks about God’s anger.
Jon Handing him over.
Tim Paul’s articulating it just like they do. 
Carissa  It seems like a lot of times when we read that verse, Romans 1:18, for 
the wrath of God is being revealed, so he gave them over, and then 
he gave them over and he gave them over. At least for me, I feel like 
I’ve tended to disconnect those ideas. Like God’s wrath is coming 
because of all these things that people do or have done instead of 
the wrath of God is revealed and this is how it’s revealed. You see 
evidence of it when people are turned away from Him. That is actually 
his wrath has handed over. Does that distinction make sense?
Tim Yeah, I hear that. I guess my question in return would be: why 
does he say the wrath of God is revealed? Oh, you mean  it’s 
something that you can go see happening right now? I think 
that’s what he means. God’s wrath is happening right now. 
Carissa  Yeah. 
Tim How? What does it look like in the triple handing over?00:25:00
00:26:00
00:27:00  10Jon That’s interesting. Because what you would typically 
say is, what’s being revealed is human nature.
Carissa  Which is kind of the wrath of God. It’s like the 
handing over to one’s own desires. 
Tim Yes.
Jon And when human nature is left unchecked by God, where he 
says, “Okay, yeah, give into it,” then that is His wrath.
Tim That’s right. Which we’re back to the prophets in the gospels too about 
being handed over to Babylon and Assyria. What happens when it’s just Lord 
of the flies? What happens? It might make right, and then people justify their 
grabs at power and dominance and usually attach some kind of divine will 
to it, say it’s in the name of some God to justify, give authority and idolatry. 
There you go. I think it’s pretty press repeat and you’ve got human history.
 But just to identify what you’re saying, Jon, we would separate 
that. We would say, “Well, God’s angry, and so He’s going to do 
something about it. And then just humans are stupid, and they 
do terrible things to each other. But in the Bible, those two are 
intertwined. God letting humans destroy themselves is the expression 
of His anger. That’s what Paul is certainly trying to say here.
Section Break   
Tim Can’t quote Romans without quoting one of the great Romans 
commentators of our day, N. T. Wright. He’s got a great way putting this. 
He says, “The Great evils of the 20th century...” So pick your world war, 
pick your genocide, just 20th century, that’s what he’s talking about. 
Jon The bloodiest century in human history. 
Tim Bloodiest century in human history. “...these evils remind us that unless God 
remains in practicably opposed to the evil that distorts and defaces creation, 
not least humanity, God is not good. If God isn’t angry and unavoidably 
positive to evil, like the 20th century showed us, then God cannot be good 
if the 20th century isn’t a total affront to God’s goodness.” He goes on.
 “Paul’s whole theology is grounded in the robust scripturally rooted 
view that the Creator is neither a tyrant nor an absentee landlord, but 
rather the creator and lover of the world. The result is God’s wrath. 
Not just an attitude of hostility towards idolatry and immorality, but 
also actions that follow from that attitude. The content of God’s wrath 00:28:00
00:29:00
00:30:00  11involves the process of giving people over to the result of their own 
folly, but also more. Those consequences are also in anticipation of a 
final judgment, the death that Paul mentions in verse 32 of chapter 1.”
 In other words, what he’s saying is, when God handing people over, 
three times over, and it all leads up to the climax of the chapter in 
verse 32 there which is death, it’s all one organically connected whole. 
Those two the handing over and the ending in death are connected 
organically, the moral degradation in the present is an anticipation 
of the ultimate degrading of humaneness itself that is death. I just 
thought that’s a good way to put that. We see them as separate 
things. He’s trying to say Paul sees this all as one connected thing.
Carissa  Like death is not tacked on punishment. It’s the natural result 
or the natural end of people living their own way. Kind of like 
the flood. Humans were creating destruction for themselves 
and others and their natural end was death. They’re destroying 
themselves in the world. Is that what you’re saying? 
Tim Yes. That’s what he’s saying. I think he’s got his thumb on what Paul’s 
saying. Good memory. That was so many conversations ago when we 
talking about the flood. But it’s the logic of the flood story. People are 
ruining the land. So God says, “Their end has come up before me so 
I’m going to accelerate their ruin by means of the flood.” That’s right.
Carissa  So this matters, because otherwise we think of death as just 
an unrelated punishment. Am I getting that right? 
Tim Yeah. This is kind of the basic summary of Christian belief when I was first 
introduced to it in my early 20s is you’re human, you have a conscience 
between right and wrong, you’ve done wrong, you’ve sinned. God is 
holy, therefore, He is angry at you for your sin and He’s going to kill 
you. It’s His justice and His Holiness, He has to kill you. Jesus died in 
your place instead and so you can be forgiven and have life instead of 
death. What I’m saying is that abstraction doesn’t really do justice to 
all of the elements in that summary. Especially this idea of God’s anger 
and death. God’s anger is God’s handing people over to a process that’s 
self-chosen that results in death, but it’s very much what I want. 
Jon Well, to be fair, it’s not what you want. 
Tim Well, it’s what we choose.
Jon It’s what you choose not really realizing.
Tim Oh. Well...00:31:00
00:32:00
00:33:00  12Jon I mean, what you want is you want pleasure, you want 
freedom, you want all these other things.
Carissa  It’s distorted desire.
Tim Yeah, distorted desire. Okay. Yeah, that’s fair. But yeah, the question is, when 
you’re after an idolatrous version of pleasure, you can begin to see that it’s 
destroying you or destroying your relationships. And then you’re faced with a 
choice. This is destroying me, but it’s giving me the thing that I want. Lots of 
people will just choose to destroy themselves or find a way to slowly destroy 
themselves so they can get as much enjoyment out of it as they want . 
Jon Is it true, though? Like we celebrate vices that destroy you slowly. Or 
the ones that destroy you quickly, we’re like, “Yeah, those are bad.”
Carissa  Some culturally acceptable vices. 
Tim My main point bringing this up is to say, this is the most elaborate 
description of God’s anger that we have in the letters of the apostles. 
Once again, it’s really nuanced, and I think it’s profound, and it’s not quite 
what you might first think when you think of God’s anger in the Bible.
Section Break 
Tim So Paul is creating a problem here in chapter 1, and he goes on to 
talk in great detail and through long, complex lines of argument 
about what God is doing about all this. I just want to hit his kind of 
recap of this in chapter 5. We’ll just start in verse 6. Reading Paul 
anymore is impossible when you can’t sit down and just read the 
whole thing, the whole letter because this is hopelessly out of context. 
But it’s like we don’t have time to talk about the whole thing.
 But starting verse 6, where he says, “At just the right time when we all 
were still weak or powerless the Messiah died for those who are ungodly.” 
Maybe steps back and reflect, and he says, “Yeah, it’s interesting, it’s 
very rare that anyone would go die in the place of a righteous person. 
Though maybe for a really good person, someone might dare to die.” 
 There’s a New Testament scholar, Simon Gathercole, who’s written 
on this little line. He thinks Paul is alluding to some of the famous 
Greek epic stories of the noble death of the soldier who will die for 
his army general or this kind of thing. He’s playing into that category 
of like, you know, we have this category of the noble death, but 
somebody who would die for their enemies, die for weak, powerless, 
sinful people, that’s crazy. And that’s what the Messiah did.00:34:00
00:35:32
00:36:00  13 So then verse 8, “God demonstrates His own love for us in this. While we 
were the ones in the wrong, that’s when the Messiah died for us.” So he’s 
inverting the noble death theme here. You might die for your leader or 
for your friend, but to die for someone who can benefit you in no way...
Jon And who has betrayed you.
Tim And who has betrayed you. Yes. So this passage is important. Just keep 
reading it and we’ll come back and talk about this. The next statement is, 
“Therefore, since we have been justified,” NIV translation, where you could 
kind of infer what he means by that, “Since we have been declared to be 
in right relationship with God by his blood, that is by Jesus a sacrificial 
death, how much more will we be saved from God’s wrath through Him? 
For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through 
the death of his Son. How much more after we’d been reconciled will we 
be saved through His life? And not only this, but we can actually boast? 
We can speak publicly about how God has given us honor through Jesus 
Christ our Lord through whom we have received reconciliation.”
 In other words, to be someone for whom the Messiah died isn’t to stay 
cowering in the dust and be like, “Oh, God would put up with me, terrible 
me.” He says there’s something you can boast about. You can go out in 
public and say, “Yeah, that guy built a Coliseum, she built a library, and 
that’s a testament to her honor.” You know what I boast in? The Messiah 
of Israel gave His life for me.” And that’s what gives me honor. Dude, Paul! 
So good the way he’s working all these themes. This is a great passage.
 My point and to bring it up here is, when Paul in verse 8 of chapter 5 of 
Romans, when he talks about the cross, what He foregrounds of God’s 
character is not his anger. He foregrounds God’s love the cross is a 
demonstration of God’s love. In the next sentence, he does say that it’s 
by Jesus’ death that we are delivered, rescued from God’s wrath through 
Him. So what many people take that to mean is that, oh, yes, God was 
going to kill me. But instead, He killed Jesus and He wants to forgive me. 
 What we have to do is upload what Paul means by God’s anger and wrath 
from chapter 1, and read this statement in light of what he’s already said 
about God’s anger. When you do that, I think that this passage becomes 
even more beautiful than maybe it already wasn’t in the first place. 
Jon Yeah, I just noticed that and I hadn’t ever noticed that before. But 
since we just read Romans 1, talking about God’s wrath, and then also 
seeing here you’ve got the past tense. Well, I guess present tense. He 00:37:00
00:38:00
00:39:00  14demonstrates His love for us. While we were sinners, he died for us. That’s 
past tense. Now being justified mean in this right relationship by the 
sacrifice. How much more shall we be saved? That’s future tense, right?
Tim Mm hmm. 
Jon It’s like speaking towards now how am I going to live? And how is this 
going to shape me? How is this rescuing me? If I upload Romans 1, 
which is a way of living in a scrub state where my mind is handed over, 
my heart is handed over, I don’t have to experience that. I can have a 
heart and a mind that is uncorrupted as I move forward in my life. 
Tim But also remember the present being handed over to my destructive 
decisions leads me on a course that organically is connected to a whole 
life trajectory that leads to death. That’s Romans 1. So to say that you’re 
saved from God’s wrath it’s like you’re being taken off a set of train 
tracks and you’re put on a different set of train tracks that leads to life. 
This is what he means when he says to be saved from God’s anger.
 It’s not just a post mortem event at the end of your life. God’s 
wrath is something that begins now. And it’s something that I 
need to be rescued from right now. I don’t want to be given over 
to my basis desires. That would be terrible for me and everybody 
around me starting tomorrow. And not just after I die.
Carissa  So when he’s talking about being saved from God’s wrath here, I mean, 
that whole line is so important. “We’ve been justified by his blood. Now, 
how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him?” So is 
he talking about this new life in Jesus that now...? What does it mean that 
how much more now shall we be saved from God’s wrath? Is it because now 
we’re connected to God’s own life we’re reconciled to Him? Also maybe 
because we’re compelled by the example of Jesus about this reconciliation, 
justification, and then being compelled by God’s love Christ died for 
us that now we have new life. Is that kind of where the argument is? 
Tim Yeah, I think so. This is also embedded right in the middle. We’re in the 
middle moment of there’s something that comes before this and after this 
in Romans 5. But his whole point is going to be that through what Jesus 
has done for us, we are invited into a new and different kind of humanity 
that actually participates in the very love and life of God Himself. And he 
begins our career that’s going to culminate in Romans chapter 8, which 
is going to be all about the very spirit of this God dwelling within us to 
give new life to our dying bodies that will bear fruit in the resurrection.
Jon Is that what he means in verse 10 shall be saved through his life?
Tim Yes, I think so. Yeah, that’s right. 00:40:00
00:41:00
00:42:00  15Jon The life of the resurrection  and the life of the Spirit.
Tim So in a way we’ve been, we’ve been saved both through his 
death, and we’ve been saved through his life. That’s right.
Jon We’ve been reconciled through His death, which is a type of 
rescue, but then there’s this trajectory that humanity is on this 
being given over and debased. And we’re also rescued from 
that through his life, his spirit, His resurrection power. 
Tim Yeah. So again, just to put the point on it, when Paul wants to articulate 
the character trait of God that’s most clearly on display in the death of 
Jesus, he highlights God’s love first and foremost. God’s anger functions 
in the background of what the cross means, but it’s not the foreground 
character trait. What he says is that through the life and the death 
and the resurrection of Jesus, we are rescued from God’s anger.
 What is God’s anger? Then we’re back to chapter 1. It’s God being angry 
that His royal human images hand over their destiny and glory to created 
things rather than the Creator. And so He gives them over on a path 
that leads to death. That whole trajectory is what we are rescued from 
through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as an act of God’s love.
Carissa  Yeah, that’s cool.
Tim Yeah. It’s coherent. This actually is coherent as a whole set of thoughts. It’s 
not just a bunch of little one-liners. Paul doesn’t just tie a bunch of one-
liners together. He’s thinking through the same sets of themes and ideas 
that unify the story of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament as well. 
Section Break
Carissa  The idea of being saved from God’s wrath in Romans, or I guess the 
idea of God’s wrath in Romans just from these couple passages we’ve 
looked at, seems like...you know, if we think about the category we had 
for that before, the idea of being handed over to the power that rules, 
here it seems like God’s wrath is referring to maybe being handed over 
to the power of sin and death more than some other power. But it is that 
idea still there, that handing over idea in Romans? I can’t be handed 
over to your own desires. But how does that relate to being handed 
over to like the rulers and authorities? Or has it changed a little bit?
Tim That’s not so much his emphasis in Romans. He’s going to bring up 
the powers and authorities in chapter 8. And they play a big role more 
in Ephesians and Colossians. There are some other places where he 
talks about God’s wrath or anger in the letter to the Romans. But the 00:43:00
00:44:00
00:45:34  16significant thing is it’s God handing people over on a trajectory that 
leads them towards death. And that death is the just outcome of a 
trajectory of human life or human community that chooses corrupt, 
subhuman kinds of behavior. And that whole line is called God’s wrath. 
And that’s what he’s saying we’re rescued from. I mean, we already tried 
to summarize at the beginning of this conversation where we’ve been. 
I don’t know, maybe it’d be good to just offer some final reflections.
Jon So bringing this back to where this all came from, Exodus 34, there’s five 
attributes of God, or maybe arguably four attributes of God, and then 
this one. So He’s gracious, compassionate, overflowing with loyal love 
and faithfulness, and He’s slow to anger. Right in the center, He’s slow to 
anger. Why does God highlight His slowness to anger? I really appreciated 
this really deep dive and nuanced just exploration of God’s anger. But 
what is it about God’s relationship with us as humans, and specifically, 
I guess, in Exodus, His relationship with Israel, that is slow to anger?
 You brought up that Proverb, something about someone’s  
wisdom is seen in their slowness to anger.
Tim Proverbs 19:11. Yeah.
Jon And maybe they’re just saying the same thing again, which is a good 
God has to get angry at injustice. That makes sense. It would be weird 
if God was good, and He didn’t get angry at evil and injustice. But 
what is highlighted in Exodus 34 is not that he gets angry at injustice, 
it’s that He’s slow to do it. Depending on where you’re at, that can 
either be really frustrating, because you’re like, “God, just come and 
just make new creation. Like, let’s get rid of injustice, make it happen.” 
But there’s this, this forbearance, to use very religious word. 
Tim It’s the word Paul uses in Romans 2 actually. There’s forbearance.
Carissa  Yeah. I wonder if the being patient or slow to anger also allows humans 
to step back into their role of being true partners and doing what’s right. 
We want God to do and to make something happen. But it’s also an 
opportunity for humans to fulfill their God-given role of his partners.
Tim Yeah. For God to appoint human images to be the instruments of His 
justice in the world, in theory, if his human images were really doing their 
job well, there would be less for God to be angry at in the first place.
Carissa  Yeah. But His purpose in being slow is often that people would 
turn to Him and realize what they’re doing and turn to Him. 
Jon Isn’t there a verse to that effect? I feel like.
Carissa  Yeah, Romans 2. 00:47:00
00:48:00
00:49:00  17Jon Is that Romans 2? What’s the verse?
Tim It starts in Romans 2:2 where He says, “We know that God’s judgment is 
coming justly on those who practice such things.” He’s talking about the 
end of chapter 1. I think here he’s getting the hypocritical Israelite in the 
(unintelligible) here. But you who would pass judgment on pagans, I think, 
non-Israelites who do these things, but you do them yourself, do you think 
you will escape God’s justice? Or do you think lightly of the riches of His 
kindness and tolerance, and patience? Don’t you know that God’s kindness 
is what leads you to repentance? Is that the line you’re thinking of, Jon? 
Carissa  That’s the one I was thinking of. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. God puts up with the nations and with Israel far longer 
than you would think He ought to have. That’s what Paul’s reflecting on here.
Carissa  That’s interesting. So it’s like when we see injustice in the world 
around us, and then systems around us one response here 
is to recognize that God has been patient and praying that 
people would be led to repentance by that patience?
Tim Yeah, that’s right. God is offering it as an opportunity. 
Carissa  Or whether or not He’s been patient. I don’t know. I mean, how do we know 
what God is doing in a present moment? But that time or that moment 
would be an opportunity for repentance? I think that’s a true reality.
Tim I think for me the enduring takeaway from spending so much time 
thinking about this is seeing God’s what feel like more unpleasant sides 
of His character, anger, judgment. But I think I’m a step closer to seeing 
how those are expressions of His deep, agonizing love for creation. And 
how often the discomfort I have with God’s anger is really some way 
that I’m shielding myself from hypocrisy. Because if I’m impatient or 
uncomfortable with God getting angry or bringing justice on somebody 
else, the thing is I’m quite happy when God agrees with who I think 
to be judged. But when I participate in or in complicit in personal 
ways, or corporate ways, that hurt other people, I’m really hoping that 
He’ll be patient, and slow to anger with me and show me love. 
 I don’t know, man. The Bible has a much more profound and powerful way of 
reflecting on God’s character, His anger, and His love that normally we tend 
to think. It makes more sense to me than ever why the Bible is a book that 
requires a lifetime of meditation to really experience the character of God.00:50:00
00:50:11
00:51:00
00:53:00  18Jon Little addendum. Since we’re in Romans 2, if I could just ask you, 
starting in verse 5, he says, “Your stubbornness and unrepentant 
heart you’re storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s 
wrath. When is righteous judgment will be revealed? So we were 
talking about God’s wrath in the present tense of being handed over 
this degrading this spiraling out of control. But Paul, it looks like he 
thinks about it as a future thing too. The day of God’s wrath. 
Tim Yeah, that’s right. Again, that was what the whole point of our 
discussion in chapter 1 was it’s a trajectory that begins in the present 
and leads forward to...and then he just uses the word “death”. 
So that’s right. He uses the word wrath to talk about either in the 
whole spectrum from the present and leading up forward to it.
Jon Thanks for listening to this episode of BibleProject podcast. We’re collecting 
questions on the topic of the character of God for this entire series. Our 
deadline for submitting questions is November 9th, 10 a.m. Pacific. Get 
your question in before then so we can consider it for our final question and 
response episode. Record yourself asking the question, keep it to about 
20 or 30 seconds, email us your question audio file plus a transcription 
of it to info@bibleproject.com. Again, it’s info@bibleproject.com. We’d 
love to hear from you, and we’d love to engage with your question.
 Next week, we’re back and we’re moving on from God’s anger. We’re going to 
consider the fourth attribute of God in Exodus 34. And that is his loyal love.
Tim There’s no word in any language that quite does all of the things 
that chesed is doing. So it’s a challenge to render chesed into 
any language. It’s a covenant partner, you’re motivated by love 
and affection, you do concrete acts. And as you do so, you 
are fulfilling a promise that you made. That’s chesed.
