hey this is John and this is Tim and this is Bible project podcast for the last five weeks including this week we have been re-releasing podcast from her back catalogue the taking a break we are in 250-plus weekly episodes 5 years and the first time saying let's stop for a few weeks to do this work and have these conversations been hard when when I realized we hadn't missed a week is like whoa and you know just as a quick no looking back over this five years in 250-plus episodes I'm the reason we can do all this is because you all are so enthusiastic listening us supporting getting behind the Bible project and so just thank you thank you thank you we couldn't do this without your support and weird super grateful that we get to do this and we're excited to do a lot more so this episode is the fifth most listened to
 episode in our catalog it's part of the character of God series never doing that I do that was kind of weird and theme studies based on the description of God in Exodus 34:6 and 7:34 for the six and seven are the most quoted verses in the Bible with in the Bible in the Bible and when we say quote Yeah they adapted or choose one or two key phrases or words from it but it's the most repeated wine by later for the klothos within the Bible one thing I'm also remembering is that this was me and Carissa Quinn for all of this series and she researched and wrote two of the five videos that came out of these conversations also these conversations from the first to the last word recorded all remote and at home that's right cuz it was kind of in the first few months of the the covid pandemic so this is character of God Episode 1 the most quoted
 verse in the Bible thanks for joining us
 Bible is written by many different authors over hundreds of years it's a one way that it stays connected as one unified story is through repetition biblical office love to quote each other and to adapt his quote since new contacts building on them and giving them continued life if it happens constantly but there are two verses in the Hebrew scriptures they get quoted and adapted more than any other, you know how John 3:16 God so loved the world he gave his one and only son you know it's a perfect the most quotable first at least an American Christianity a form it says if these two vs. X3 for six and seven were the John 3:16 of ancient Israel he just may come up so much as you read throughout the rest the Bible the most quoted verse five biblical authors in the Bible is Exodus 34 Verse 26 and 7
 Cannery Yahweh Yahweh compassionate and gracious slow to anger abounding in loyal love and faithfulness maintaining love 4,000 forgiving wickedness Rebellion it's in yes he does not leave the guilty unpunished he punishes the children and their children for the sins of their parents third and fourth-generation we're going to start in a Serie walking through these verses and look at the key vocabulary learn this episode we want to lay some groundwork in particular we want to look at this tension that pops in the Spurs how it starts with such a lovely and caring picture of God gracious slow to anger abounding with loyal love but then it seems ends with a vindictive picture of God wants to punish kids for the sins of their fathers we see them as like these two parts of God's character that we proceed somehow intentions with one another and I think that's because of Isabel
 others are putting them out there is genuine tension but question is where are these tensions that God feels within himself attention comes with how does God relate to people who constantly fail as his Partners I'm done Collins this is the Bible project podcast today on the show going to dig into these beautiful important lines and scripture joining me is Tim Mackie and another member of our team doctor Carissa Quinn we're discussing the character of God thanks for joining us here we go
 okay we're going to start a new series in Exodus 34 it's 2 versus and 6 and 7 and a here on the podcast of course of 10 hello hello Tim also with us is Carissa Quinn hello and you might remember Carissa from a podcast episode maybe even a year ago where she walked us through the word witness in the Bible for would study that she wrote that is up on Youtube channel Chris has been part of our team for a while now and she does a lot of work for us but a Chris 10 people might not remember you quickly just the quick bio of yourself and we've been doing on the team
 sure I'm a Bible scholar and educator my main areas of research are the things that I'm really fascinated with all have to do with the literary Artistry of scripture and I work here at the Bible project doing biblical research and developing educational resources so right now I'm writing some of the upcoming videos like this topic were talking about today so we're talking about Exodus 34 and Tim and I are riding videos on some of the words used to describe God they're so I'm doing some of that and then developing the curriculum for classroom or were starting to provide free online classes for all of you awesome Chrissa you're creating in between likes sessions video of that classroom sessions so you're creating interactive exercise has questions all this interactive scripture study stuff that goes along to make it a whole class and it's awesome it's really cool stuff through multiple sessions on a topic or we'll have enough
 instructor in and then students will get to interact with with questions and your other students answers and do some projects in that type of thing as a horse of course you know which part of the Bible is near and dear to your heart the better part is my area of study and Hebrew Bible and focused on the Psalms in the shape or the story that the songs till 7 a slowly and it's going to be awesome this is recorded during quarantine so April early April 2020 it'll be interesting cuz when is episodes go live on a podcast who knows I was just thinking about that what quarantine will sound like at that time or what it what the field will be of it
 so these are coming out in the fall and what we're going to do is there Z's 2 verses in Exodus and we're going to talk about those and then we're going to actually dig in deep 25 a piece of God that we signed a nose and it'll be in subsequent podcast get this off to him you know once one thing that you told me is that this is the most referenced verse in the Bible Bible Co-operators that are all come from one verse in the book of Exodus Exodus 34 Verse 6 but what we wanted to do was actually make a video that introduced his people to these verses and where they appear in context cuz they are the most recorded and cross-referenced versus with in the Old Testament John 3:16 God so loved the world he gave us one moment and you know it is like the most
 go to bowl first at least an American Christianity and seven were the John 3:16 of ancient Israel they come up so much as he reads about the rest of the Bible so we thought let's make a video about these key words cuz it's a description of God's attributes but the sense that they make is the sense when the first introduced and a story in the book of Exodus and so we thought let's make an intro video to a word study series and that's this conversation that we're having right now Chrissa why don't you introduce us just actually just read these two verses allowed and maybe we can just kind of make some initial observations about 30 for six and seven Yahweh Yahweh a compassionate God and gracious slow to anger and abundance of loyal love and faithfulness
 keeper of loyal love for thousands for Giver of iniquity transgression and sin yet he will surely not clear the guilty visitor of the iniquity of the fathers upon sons and upon the sons of sons upon the third and fourth generations and that's your translation in your notes 10 so maybe at least some of these lines before but John can you remember back when we first started talking about this and before we took a deep dive into these verses and what they mean what your perception was yeah so the first verse is really wonderful compassionate and gracious slow to anger abundantly love and faithfulness I guess what you would want and any friend of those attributes A really lovely and so no wonder it's
 quoted so much by bill collectors in different ways and in the second half of the verse it starts out really lovely to it reinforces that got the keeper of little love for thousands and forgive her of iniquities and transgressions and sends and then it just all the sudden takes a turn yet he will not clear the guilty he will visit the iniquity of the fathers in the sons and on their sons and their son with the grandkids to the 3rd and 4th generation
 and so just kind of ends with this like whoa I guess god is vengeful after all what is this deal with like punishing grandkids for like and it's like you know when when you're writing something out in when I think of writing a memorable paragraph I'm going to end with the thing that is I want the listener to really go away with and just like the last. Is the thought I want them to become the central thought and the last thought here is about visiting iniquity generationally which is intense and faithful and all those things like all Center in the background
 yeah I think when I quoted this verse or said oh I love this verse I stopped after forgiver of iniquity and transgression and sin
 that was a splendid yeah cuz then you just got the goodies all the the gods goodies you know before that point so you're saying it's kind of like a bait-and-switch almost like I love you I love you he's wonderful and he's going to punish your family in Sandpoint you end with the thing that you really want to make sure they take away for long-term seems to be a different communication strategy here
 where it says there's a balance it's almost like the first half of the statement is about God's compassion and generosity but then the second half is about how God's generosity is not license for people to go do whatever they want their judgment and accountability I guess The Balancing Act is more important than the final word I just got some interesting different communication strategy we've really dissected these two verses in terms of their literary structure and our first video here on this is going to be highlighting yes there's a to chiasm happening here and there's all the cemetery and it's in the cemetery that I'm supposed to kind of walk away with appreciating the tension but also appreciating how much more highlighted God's attributes of faithfulness and and slow to anger and and Grace
 how much more these good attributes what we would call good after p s r r the supposed to stick with us in terms of of being more important even though their attention but you only get there when you can appreciate all that literary design where is just a western modern reader I'm just like what it feels like it ends big punch the deliberate design of the couples versus it was my kind of Maine see ology Mentor in seminary Professor Gary Brashears who really put this on my radar in a significant way I don't even remember I think it was a theology class but he's the one who first showed me that this is first of all it's the first description of God's character that you come across as you're reading through the Bible from page one so you watch God say and do a lot of things but it's the first time that God's own character is described and some kind of summary but then second
 the one who told me that it's the most repeated recorded verse of the Old Testament with in the Old Testament itself and five Gary to thank for putting me in the end of this many many years ago Chrissa did you was he still working that when you have classes with him probably I can't remember but I'm sure because it is a really important I mean it's these verses are super important for understanding to Yahweh is because it's all about God revealing himself and all his goodness to Moses so I'm yeah I'm sure and it is interesting that this self-revealing of God as portrayed as something new and that God says explicitly to Moses that even though he's revealed himself in the past he hasn't made himself known by his name which is exactly what he's doing here the Divine name twice more into the narrative context I think a little bit later but for the moment yes Chris that you're just naming this is the moment that Moses is in a cave
 Mount Sinai and there's a Divine storm cloud passing by cuz Moses ask to see God's glory and God passes by in a storm and then what Moses here is this announcement and it's versus six and seven that's a pretty intense thunderstorm so what we're putting our finger on for the moment is that this is the first character description of God it's one of the most important like statements in the Old Testament itself and what we found was this tension this is what you were feeling John of like what is God like if I just look at this first description of God in the Bible Well it's a balance of mercy and compassion and patience but also a very firm sense of justice and accountability and recompense and the first three like mercy and compassion make our hearts warm and fuzzy and then we hear judgment or Justice and recompense
 I don't know for many of us and I feel it too we start to get skill and uncomfortable and it says I think their cultural reasons for that in our cultural setting for why we start to mb2 but I was just interesting to pay attention to and that I can adjust to this idea of Justice yeah okay so there's Justice for when you do wrong that's going to hold you accountable to that it and liquidity use the Biblical word there but then when it says to the sons and their sons to third and fourth generation and on a plane reading that just bet it looks like God's will in the garage 7 has given rise to a pretty widespread idea I know in the Christian tradition different strands of the Trish and I don't I don't know in in Judaism about the idea of a generational curse or that there can be some kind of divine judgment
 that lingers over a family so the bad stuff happens to them you know for Generations Salon how do I have totally heard people talk about this before as if it's said that the Bible teaches that just sounded tense if that's if in fact that's what it means so it will come back around to that I think by the end of this first conversation so first however I think it's good to just sample this again the language of Exodus 3 4 6 7 gets repeated or recorded a r e used I used to say over 20 times in the Bible so I'm 27 and I'm pretty sure that I'm missing about half a dozen more since it might just be little little Snippets of one or two of the words together holding it why would it be so difficult to find how many times until it's not that it's not that hard it's more just sat down a couple different times and then I get interrupted or something and
 what time is it only closed part of it or maybe the words in a different order so it just takes some reflection at least 27 but I know there's some more re uses of these verses as you get to actually see how the biblical authors themselves understood it by the way that they re quote it that you get to see what they think it means which is why that they're recording at in the first place and so I think that can give us a clue as to how the biblical authors themselves understood the significance of the description of God's character so should we session some of them are really interesting
 okay the first time that it gets re-quote it is in the Book of Numbers Chapter 14 and it's actually Moses is the one who request them and that makes sense cuz he was the one who first heard them so Numbers Chapter 14 this is the story of the spies the rebel spies who go into the land then come back you guys know the story time story so 10 of the spies give a report that hey you know the promised land it's awesome look at the grapes they're huge huge great but then they save but we also saw a huge cities and huge people Nephilim they say or there is a group called The Anna khait so the Anakin who are the descendants of the Nephilim from the flood story so that's intense that's not a place you want to go hang out and so giant Olay so the tennis buy said no way we're not going in there Yahweh can't Deliver Us from those giants we're going to
 but two of the spies Joshua and Caleb said oh it's no problem like God's you know you can take care of giants he's done it before but they don't say that but that's that's the way the design pattern works and so the 10 Rebel spies get the whole people into a riot and the people want to actually appoint a new leader and go back to Egypt
 yeah. That's the scene right here so what God says is exactly what he says in the lead-up to God's saying this about himself in the book of Exodus he says I'm done with these people I'm going to destroy them and start over with a new people and so what Moses says what he respond is these verses in Numbers Chapter 14 verse 17 one of you should read it during the first 17th but now I pray let the power of the Lord be great just as you have declared the Lord is slow to anger and abundant and loving-kindness forgiving iniquity and transgression but he will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth Generations forgive I pray the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness just as you also have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now
 he is focusing on the second half of of the quote but he throws in first Lord of slow to anger and abundant and loving kind of two of the five attributes that we had previously and forgiving yeah it's really interesting that he still he quotes the second half this part that we think is really more harsh but within or because of that quoting he's asking to forgive that God will forgive the iniquity of the people it seems like you would have just left off the second half but I think that also shows us that we may be missing what that second half mean before reading as a fully negative statement totally and you just quotes to a mini condenses Exodus 34 verse 7 but his take away even after quoting the God won't clear the guilty and visit the iniquity of fathers on the children his tank
 forget to people cuz that's what you say you do your forgive her and so you forgiven us up till now so do it again because it is really odd you quotes God God's Own proclamation of himself by the way right we haven't even said that in Exodus 34 and exodus this is Yahweh himself saying this about him correct that he will not clear the guilty and not only like me to guilty but like generations to come and then right after that Moses says so forgive the guilty it's really interesting that those and right before that it says forgiving iniquity and now it says but he will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon the children so yeah there's definitely an interesting relationship
 there's like no hope for somebody who blows it because this is a moment of iniquity right yeah that's right now this is the hold on to an 11-1 and 12 to 13 this is the fourth Rebellion story in the wilderness of the book of numbers as the people leave Mount Sinai in Numbers chapter 10 going from Numbers Chapter 11 The Numbers Chapter 20 there are seven Rebellion stories were the people rebelled against God and Moses this is the fourth it's the center one which is which I think it's significant and then in the center we find this is Moses is doing the same thing you had to do on Mount Sinai in the story of the golden calf which is interested and he quotes the same words and he's essentially he's asking God to be consistent by changing his decision to destroy the people
 and forgive them and he doesn't see you guys to Justice and his Mercy is contradictory it's like somehow he knows if I press on the mersey side of the scales God will yield
 cuz he knows that his car is the verse 6 describe some kind of Baseline and the stuff about clearing the guilty it's important and God will do that but what else does he mean to say you won't clear the guilty forgive these guilty people yeah I was thinking about this is there any time in the Hebrew Bible where someone intercedes or asks God for for something and he doesn't respond with Compassion or Mercy or loving-kindness well that's really interesting there's not for the most part when you get into the book of Jeremiah he actually tells Jeremiah not to pray or interested he forbids him and the logic is exactly that cuz when you have a righteous intercessor God listens so God tells him not to pray on behalf of the people he orders Jeremiah not interested interesting that's a really interesting
 yeah that's weird it gives me this picture of like that God knows he's a pushover so
 he's like the technique of the yes it is it's interesting we season as like these two parts of got character that we perceive somehow intention with one another and I think that's because the biblical authors are putting them out there is genuine tensions but the question is what are these tensions the gods heels within himself to tension comes with how does God relate to people who constantly fail as his partner's well and he does get angry till we go back to the original story we haven't talked about the narrative yet but that's right that's right he has but it also takes him with Moses it's not until the fifth time that Moses read this and that he gets angry a quotation and it's a I think she would look at the mothers
 this is important so let's go to another Moses one this is in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 5 in Deuteronomy 5 Moses's retailing to the children of the people who rebelled in the wilderness so that story we just read from numbers God's sake says to the rebel spies and to the people who rebelled he says oh you don't want to go into the promised land will then you won't die in the wilderness and your kids will be the one to get to go in and so in the book of Deuteronomy Moses is now tree addressing this new generation before they go into the land and sea Deuteronomy 5 you actually it's a r e quotation of the Ten Commandments The Ten Commandments appear twice in the Old Testament we talked about this before
 and so when he gets to the first commandment about having no other gods he inserts a quotation of these lines super interesting and maybe John Deuteronomy 5:9 you talking about don't don't have any other gods before me or serve them for I the Lord your God I'm a passionate God and then he quotes visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and on the third and fourth generations of those who hate me but showing loving-kindness the thousands to those who love me and keep my Commandments flips it it's like more digestible when you flip it earlier and with a good day it's going to be just when he has to be just like it settles a little bear yeah yeah this one is also quoting directly from Exodus 20 The Ten Commandments right so not it's not Exodus 34
 Exodus 34 when Moses on the mountain is almost recapping Exodus 20 The Ten Commandments but changing it up a little bit another words this idea of God being both compassionate and patient and visiting Justin visiting iniquity of the fathers on the children saw on the basic idea for the first time in the Ten Commandments of Exodus and then what God is doing in Exodus 34 is picking that up and developing it and then that's what's getting recorded here do you notice there's also two small differences to each of these lines that's not president in Exodus 34 the clarification of the disposition of the people so he visits the iniquity on those who hate him but shows loving kindness to those who love him so
 it says this when you're reading and just exit 34 and you read he visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon the grandsons to the 3rd and 4th generation what you're not then that little kind of recapped there is what what did the children do this is what bothered you right back. Why do you have to correct the question is is that in fact what it means that God will visit the consequences of my grandfather's thin but I'll be the one to suffer for it is that what exit is 34/7 mins so what this phrase hang of it and Deuteronomy 5 tells us is when we're talking about these further Generations their behavior is crucial to how God responds to them in other words when God
 what is in Deuteronomy 5 visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generations of those who hate me it's clarifying that we were talking about is if later generations repeat were persistent in the Covenant rebellion of their ancestors they're going to get the same consequence but when we talk about these thousands to get love loyal love we're talking about thousands of generations who stays faithful to the Covenant no generation gets a free pass or no generation will be treated unjustly their own behavior matters for how God responds to them it seems to me that's the implication hear what you're saying that is the whole bit about Generations is just got clarifying this isn't just for you guys this is also for Brett for your kids and your kids kids I'm not making some special thing for this generation this is how it's always going to be you you hate me and you do you do Eve
 then I'm going to have to hold you accountable to that. My disposition is loving kindness that's what I mean this is God's revelation of his character to the specific people group that he's made a generation of Covenant with so when is this is us as the generations go by as we go down the line in this long history of relationship you can count on me being this way and this is how I will interact with every generation so it's really it's a statement about the about the stability of God's character that's interesting cuz I take that for granted maybe having grown up in Western Christianity we talked a lot about God is immutable you know that the logical term of he just doesn't change is always the same so I think I I I come to a verse and I just take that for granted where I put myself in the psyche of the ancient Israelites
 forming a covenant you might wonder yeah okay that's just for us or is this going to be for kids and it's going to continue I think it's harder for us in our modern context is the responsiveness of God that he's consistent to respond according to his character and according to how people respond to him I think that might be the harder part you're so friendly relational and interactive yeah I agree I think that I think that is hard for some for some people may be in some traditions it's hard to tell do you have a sense of why from your own experiments cuz I think that for a lot of people it does conflict with that immutability or unchangeable nature of God but I think like Jeremiah 18 you were talking about Jeremiah earlier explains the consistency of God that if a nation turns from their evil then I'll relent and if they do evil then I'll bring Calamity on them
 that's it's like a consistent thing you can depend on with God but I think what's interesting about the statement is that the scales are tipped toward Grace and compassion which I don't think me and some more people are doing good you know what I mean it means. Just chooses to be gracious above and beyond what people deserve which I guess is the meaning of Grace in the first place their basins are really but somehow when we the three of us and I'm guessing we represent how people in general you know in our culture might hear this we see the statement about God having this like nice side and then I'm more just our Stern side and for us we hear those somehow they're in conflict or intention but when the biblical authors heard this they heard the whole thing as a statement of stability and assurance and that God will deal with us justly and fairly always
 tending towards mercy and his generation will get what's coming to it if that's how they really ever so they act and it may be that I didn't grow up as a polytheist you know and so I I don't know what it's like to believe in or be loyal to a God who you hope will favor you yes he the right prayer my prayers especially then if you interpret you know the quality of your life at the Forum of blessing your judgment you know if I have bad crops were all my chickens die in a plague which God is punishing me and for what reason for a lot of ancient cultures and some Colter still today it's still related if they believe in the Divine Powers they relate to Divine powers in this way to be fair there's a lot in the Torah about how if you obey me your crops are going to be
 but the whole point of a statement like this is to say if your crops are going bad you know why you know exactly why it takes the mystery out of it at least I think that's the whole point of God giving Israel the terms of the Covenant and then here saying this is how God will relate to you based on the Covenant think the big takeaway is okay now I know that we serve God that he wants me to care about and there is patience and his mercy and his faithfulness but he also wants me to know that he's has a consistency for how he's going to deal with with us in that I can know that and so if there's not some unpredictability to him so those are the kind of to maintain balance I think that's right I also think it's significant in this verse in Deuteronomy 5 that and an Exodus 20 or its coating from that it gives the context for what iniquity means
 it starts with you shall not worship other gods or serve them I think sometimes when I think of iniquity you're saying we think of just doing something bad but I think the seems like a bigger a whole heart thing about which God you worship Allegiance gym in this Deuteronomy 5 because I'm a passionate, that's my translation what's the word there it's usually translated jealous I am a jealous God and I have become convinced that the English word jealousy communicates only part of what kind of owl is communicating and also the word jealousy introduces a layer of meaning that's not fully present with Kenna and so
 I like the word passionate more in English jealousy has an Envy become kind of synonyms uncontrolled Rage or something added to deal with this as we've written about emotions in this IDF you look up that way she'll see what has been used traditionally it means like when something that you deserve or should have is taken from you then you're jealous or envious when you want something that you don't have to understand why you move away from Chelsea but why it why the word passion but I think of English at least what it means to me and I've asked lots of other people about those two before cuz I I gave a sermon on this once I really want to figure it out I think jealousy in English for most English speaker has a self oriented Focus it's about what I deserve and what I want and so I'm jealous I want something usually that I don't have and I'm jealous of somebody else
 conflated with envy and it has become the typical way that that words you sound so it's a covenant term and it has to do with the passion that arises within you when you see somebody that your Covenant Ali connected to giving their allegiance and their well-being over to someone who will hurt them so one of the important other times has used his of a husband and a wife or husband he is suspicious that his wife is sleeping with another man and the number is 5 and it says if a spirit of kona comes over him and so it's passion for his Covenant partner a wife well that's the traditional meaning of the word gelled really mean that anymore what's underneath it with other gods isn't just that will because I deserve your praise not the other gods this cuz consistent depiction of allegiance to other gods is
 it will degrade your humanity and Lead Israel to death specifically towards Injustice and neglect of the poor nose almost like an element of compassion passion it's not actually very different than the like passion this hasn't happened too much with my kids yet but I can already start to see as they're in our neighborhood school and there's some little like neighborhood buddy friend that's are awesome and I'm so stoked to like take one of my kids over to play at someone's house or in the afternoon but then there have been other times where when my son has come home from a couple hours at a friend's house just the vibe he's giving off at luck and the words he's using and it's like I realize like oh he was exposed to a different value system just now and he's treating his brother a lot more poorly know and so we have to deal with that and the feeling inside of me is that kind of protective jealousy I think of like a dude he's going to
 be exposed to something that's going to I think you know chip away at his character and actually make you a less generous person that's the kind of passion and it's not about me as such he must be raised in my home and have my value is it's that I think the values were trying to give him or the ones that are actually going to help him flourish the best anyway so it's kind of a side Trail maybe we should make a video what's a video about that it's still hard it doesn't do the whole job but I think it at least has a better job than jealousy cuz it will raise the question of what does that mean just look at it. Can you think of another English word that captures that idea or you know what's funny is I just wanted to reclaim the original meaning of jealous was my like strategy and I was voted down I just become our binoculars and you said jealous to me and desire and you to have something that you don't have something better
 no we just we just ended up using the word jealous and just ended and the way that's used today I think it used to have it could have been a more negative selfish meaning or it could have a more positive other-centered meaning that you're I'm jealous for this meeting I'm passionate to see the other ones no one uses that way anymore but I think it used to be I probably had kind of this like slow morphing into a was very positive and then it became a mixed bag and now it's just a jealous is not a good day
 here let me show you guys couple others couple other times it gets used in the prophet let's go to Joel chapter 2 in the Book of Joel he is experiencing he's watching a drought which causes of famine in the land of Israel and then there's a locust swarm and if you know the Covenant key Covenant passages in the Torah like Leviticus 26 or Deuteronomy 28 you know those things are result of God removing his kind of protective hand a blessing on this realm as a result of Covenant violation is what he calls the people to do in response to all to 13 verse from the Bible Jesus of the people Rend your hearts and not your garments return to the Lord your God because he just gracious and compassionate slow to anger
 rounding and loyal love and a relenting of doing harm or doing catastrophe raw just quoted from what we call Verse 6 of Exodus 34 he's only quoted from the first deposit of half which is interesting the god good he's a what he sees around them is the results of her seven right cuz we see is it Locust plague in a famine and then he thinks this is all the results of Covenant rebellion and so here is God does not clearing the guilty and he's visiting the iniquity on us but even in the midst of God's judgment he knows that God has a soft spot for people who turned to him and humility I think this is why he told Jeremiah not to pray for the people that's the same idea and so he says listen if we turn back to God
 we can count on the fact that he will respond in some way at least this is a very common way that the versus get used to people in trouble and they say let's turn to God cry out to God because he's like this yeah a lot of the quotations you have here just quote from the first half it's from the re purposing of these words in Jonah the Forgotten chapter that's right this is right after the people of Nineveh turn to God and God forgives the city and the people on the king of Nineveh and that's where the story books and but there's another chapter in Jonah gets angry a greatly displeased Jonah he became angry he prayed to the Lord and said please Lord was not this what I said while I was still in my own country
 therefore in order to forestall this for this your translation knows it's numero standard I think therefore in order to prevent this I fled to tarshish for I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God slow to anger in a bundle and will love and one who relents concerning raw concerning doing Calamity sarcastic sarcastic yes yeah he's like I know this of you and so I didn't want to go to Nineveh cuz I don't like those guys and they don't deserve your patient Mercy he's angry that God is this way towards other people that he doesn't like but of course what was it that moves God to have the fish like vomit him out so that he would live and not die The Narrative didn't say it but the implication is because God was gracious and compassionate with him but then somehow the moment God is compassionate we're back.
 Consistency he says this is why I didn't want to go to to the city of Nineveh because I know you have the soft spot for people no matter who they are to turn to you and you always forget them
 and it makes like there is nothing that I could do to stop this consistency of God we're back to that consistency seem that God doesn't play favorites us and with every generation and apparently with any people group thiol will always operate according to XS 3467 so much so that you can Jonathan like throw these words in God's face as an accusation almost oh yeah and you can take those words to the bank he doesn't like the ninevites so much and he believes in God's character so much had to take off okay so Joel that uses from Joel gave us people sitting in hardship but they know that God will be gracious with some Parcells to attend the prophet Nahum
 does something interesting what he does is turn up the volume on 47 on the intense parts and so this is up a whole book that is the prophet who was commenting on the downfall of the Assyrians the Assyrian Empire and the downfall of the city of Nineveh which Jonah features in the Book of Jonah so we're talking about an Empire that ruled ancient near East for Centuries with Iron Fist I mean they would like peel off people's skin in public public shame and Punishment and like put heads on spikes of cities they conquered it was gnarly so the whole ancient world was rejoicing when one of us fell to the Babylonians and so they have rights this poem to talk about how he believes you always the one buying the downfall of Nineveh this is from chapter 1 of movie Chris that you want to be there at 2 and 3 at jealous is that the same
 Fidelis there a jealous and avenging God is the Lord the Lord is avenging and wrathful the Lord takes Vengeance on his adversaries and he reserved his wrath for his enemies in the quotation the Lord is slow to anger and great in power and the Lord will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Sometimes it's interesting though is that these verses are written about an oppressor to God's people and it also kind of makes me wonder about the Exodus passage if that not clearing the guilty I mean I think it's a multi-faceted but Pharaoh is one of the ones who sends the most in this in the narrative and he was oppressing the people I don't know I wonder if there's some connection to take Vengeance on those who are pressing the weaker for sure the most intense forms of divine anger in the Bible are aimed at leaders of people
 Israelite or is not an Israelite yeah who abused their positions of power without a doubt that's a great observation that's really worth observing what's interesting here is it the way that the language of Exodus 34:6 and 7 is quoted so may have one verse three the Lord is slow to anger and he's great and what should come is in loyal love Covenant love but what he says it's great and power and then the ads for a 7 of Exodus 34 in the Lord won't declare innocent or guilty or you won't leave guilty then punished so what's interesting about that is to say that he's great and loyal love that's a covenant term he is going to stick by his Covenant will you always not in a covenant with the nation of Assyria so we did he doesn't use that word loyal love because he's never made a covenant promise to Syria but he is great and power which means that he oversees the nation's and a serious time is up you know two really intense language of divine anger
 recompense on one of the great tyrants of the ancient near East and the first three says he's slow to anger but he still gets angry
 you know God reached the limit of his patients and that's what this time is emphasizing so I don't know if this makes you squirm it should but then it's also crucially important to remember it's aimed at a king of one of the most oppressive empires of the ancient world part of the oppressed then it's goodness correct the fortune this is after Jonah the story of Jonah is taking place when Nineveh is. It's kind of Pekin in his Heyday as the capital of the Assyrian Empire this writing right after the fall of the Assyrian Empire so big picture is kind of some observations here if you look through these 27 that I have and I think there's a few more the vast majority quote from Bruce 6 from like the goodie parts that we like the most consistent with these verses are quoted is people in trouble people sitting in a mess of their own making and
 turn back to God and say let's go back to God because exit 346 he's this way and that kind of makes sense cuz that's a big part of what they mean and that's a part of the original context of story that these versus a PRN but verse 7 is just as important of a statement about God's character but I think we've touched on it it's it's a promise of stability of a predictability and God's response he's merciful and he's just which even verse 7 which is intense brings a degree of assurance that I always know where I stand with y'all they based on my own behavior and choices I don't have to wonder and that he's going to be like this always for every generation not like change from generation to generation I think those are significant takeaways we're going to talk about each attribute and we're going to get too slow to anger and during that conversation we will talk about the idea of God being angry yes and so a lot of this
 language and Joel has being a wrathful God but I'm just kind of knowing that we will incorrect. Correct Divine anger is really important that we get right our understanding of divine anger especially cuz something about our cultural context angry authority figures and violence this is a huge theme in our culture I think a special ed in my generation Our Generation and maybe the one before cuz there's been such a public can whistle blowing on abuse of power and angry authority figures and abuse so people have become really sensitive to this in the Old Testament in a way that when I talk to people from the older generation they don't feel the problem here they're like I got to get so angry and you can punish people what's the big deal
 I got to work through some kind of screaming is about that you guys resonate with that so for me this is force me to go back in and really understand Divine anger income tax which is why we're going to dedicate all video to it cool so I will put the rest of the scripture references that re-quote exercise 3467 if you want to kick out further what we'll do then is in the next episode we'll talk about the narrative context of these verses and situate ourselves and what was going on in the biblical story what prompted got to say this about himself to Moses in the first place
