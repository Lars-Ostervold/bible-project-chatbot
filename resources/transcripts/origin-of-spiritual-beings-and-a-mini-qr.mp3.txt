hey this is John and Tim and you listen to the Bible project podcast today on this episode we were originally going to do a question in response episode about the last three episodes correct and as we sat down to do it Tim said hey actually recorded that episode 10 months ago and I've got some new thoughts that I think would be helpful that's right but this episode actually going to be us talking through your things that I've learned and want to put out there about more things about the Divine Council and the other Divine beings that rule under God's Authority specifically were going to spend a lot of time looking at Genesis of this Celestial beings right of the Divine Council and then off of Psalm 82
 then in the last 10 15 minutes or so will be a few questions and explore this whole complex topic even more so thanks for joining us.
 are you ready to talk about God I think I'm ready to respond to respond to questions we are in the beginning of a series walking through God that going to be of God in the Bible and we just had three episodes looking at the word Elohim and then looking at the Divine Council that the third one now that's the third one so it was about we started with the word Elohim how can refer to the singular Chief Elohim is having an earth whose name in the Old Testament is Yahweh God of Israel however the word can also refer to other Divine beings
 that populate the biblical World here and that's usually translated in English with a lowercase G. But the main takeaways were that the biblical worldview there are many Elohim there is one she fell of him who made all of the others and all of creation but that doesn't mean those other Alamar tell him they are and then it was about the meaning of the word means an inhabitant of the non-physical realm here and we talked about that the probably the most direct translation of Elohim help make sense that spiritual spiritual being that's because when you say God it has all this baggage correct although Elohim is translated most often that Scott when it refers to the god of Israel and one of the but that's right that's right and refers to the gods of other nations are other Spiritual Beings is like God is the god of
 the god of gods yeah he is the one I love him over the many other elegant and then second episode of the Bible said phrases like there is no other God besides what they mean is no other elahi mm compares to you. If there isn't any other lol not saying that other Ellen don't exist because the same difficult with her is like Paul or Moses will then another passage is talk about the reality is he said they're all him so yeah so these other him go by various titles in the Old Testament and the New Testament they can be called Elohim which is translated as lowercase G Gods there are also sometimes called the Sons of Elohim members of the class of a Divine beings they can be called The Heavenly Host the Heavenly army they can be called The Holy ones or the congregation Ohr
 counsel of God appointed delegates of how God runs the world that's that's what episode 3 full episode 3 was all about the Divine Council and God rules the world is delegated authority number 3 so we did those three episodes and that just begs a ton of questions Kansas can of worms cans of worms multiple can multiple can of multiple meetings were Dynamic picked up if you hear us making any time references in any of those episodes and actually the rest of the Gods series there's something that we haven't quite done yet after this point John and I we had these conversations that we're sitting right now in this moment right now it's 2018 and August 7th 2018 yeah you'll listen to some real X episode
 2018 it'll get released within a week all of the god conversations happened ten months ago October 27th asked him if this is just the inevitability of like being a lifelong learner and like a bookworm uncontrolled the book where I'm constantly learning and refining my ideas and that's what humans do what else can we do but you've listened to these three episodes present you and you're going to 2018 Tim has listened back to 2017 10th and becoming like oh well that's okay but really you should say it this way or well actually hears the bigger contact store now you're not using that word in precisely the way I've learned more about so anyway there's all kinds of little modifications that you would I want to make my past self a lot of the questions that will respond to relate to things that I've been turning to in that episode I think I had said October 2017 and it was earlier that
 in 2017 that I had realized that I was ignoring these things over a year-and-a-half in the journey I've been reading a lot and reflecting a lot so much discovery on Canada me how much of the Bible still feels like fresh territory no matter how many times I read it so there's a few things I just want to say okay to frame especially the last episode 3 of Father Divine Council the one thing that I didn't talk about it cuz I didn't realize I had reflected on it was where any mention of the creation of the Divine Council for the sons of God or other Spiritual Beings where they mentioned their origin story when are they mad cuz any of the passages we talked about they're just they're they're just there and even when humans are created there they're the let us make humor
 in our image actually have a question about this but all of it in this Valley are there where am I supposed to have seen where they are created right so here is something significant is it in Genesis one we talked about the literary design of Genesis 1 you get the opening Exposition God created everything the uncreated state was a state of chaos and then God begins to speak right so there's ten acts of speaking divided up into two panels of three days each day as 1 2 3 4 through 6 and there's 10 different access speaking and within then there's ten acts of speaking and a tax of making an S7 pronouncements of good did Genesis 1 unbelievable
 well architected yes everywhere there's not a careless misplaced word in the whole of the chapters left so anyhow was a significant there is people notice this isn't real estate is called wild and waste or tow a Volvo who who who means unordered or chaotic address to Tioga create order so where there's only Darkness now there's light and dark and ordered pattern of time counteracting the tohu correct where there's just chaotic undulating chaos Waters now there's water separated from water so the dry land can a marriage where there's on and habitable Dryland vegetation and life emergency room so it's dressing then vote fireman the environment we might say what day is 4 through 6 is address of the Volvo
 the uninhabited and that puts all the creatures yeah and it goes in the same order it creates inhabitants for the sky the sky will talk about this it creates inhabitants for the water so the teachers and the sea creatures and then it happens for the dry land here and let's talk about those inhabitants of the heavens this guy creatures light and dark Waters from the waters and then Waters drawbacks of dry land can a The Waters from the waters is creating the sky is creating the space above the face of them is the Blue Dome above us if this is the first time you've thought about that cosmology of the Bible that there's this idea of the rakia I see fascinating worms crawling out even more cans right now
 way to think about how the world was ordered was that we live here on land above us is a dome look around it kind of feels like you're in a snow globe of swords and this is actually a solid structure that holds back the waters correct that was their understanding and the first day of creation separating the chaotic Waters in the two was basically creating space for something to happen and now his Waters above correct and watching the clouds and its corresponding day in second panel and a five he's inhabiting yeah I got his face yeah he creates inhabitants so birds fly against the face of the Rockies
 the sky dumb I guess the face of the waters above fish are in the waters below at all happens on Day 2 3 4 5 start over day one day one light and dark it's the order of time test data chaotic Darkness time today to Waters from the waters create space for something not just chaotic Waters it's another space J-3 Dryland peers from the waters day for the great light and the small light and the Stars so are the inhabitants of the light and dark rum day 5 is the sky flyers and the water's warm and they're both in that in the waters of us day6 the inhabitants of the Dryland so that two panels each consisting of three days and you can just see each one matches the other first one matches the two
 who direct the unformed and the second one is on field day for on day 4 God says something that matches what he said on day one. They want again let there be light you he or on day 4 God says Let There be lights you he wrote lights so or his word for like my order is the word for more than one like more than one life I let there be lights in the rakia embed them in the Rocky of the heavens Heavens to separate day from night and that's interesting because one day one God separated light from darkness and God called God separate but now he's created something the lights you something and that thing is now doing the thing that God did separating know it's the thing that
 reading yeah okay then we go on let them let the lights be signs and for a meeting of The New American Standard seasons 4 days in 4 years
 so the word signs so fascinating the word sign it's the Biblical word for symbol so when God's talking to Moses and the burning bush and he says listen you're going to go rescue the people and bring them out of here and Moses like what no way and God says this is going to be the sign that I'm telling you the truth you're going to stand right here in this very spot before Fire and Flames with all the people and then you'll know that I was I was telling the Hebrew sign is a physical something real that happens but that is itself only a pointer to partial reality that points to some Ultimate Reality so this is a concept that the lights in the skies are symbols
 the point to something greater and even more real than themselves
so the first thing you pointed out was that and day one God already separated life separate from what I understand about the world light comes from yes the Sun or the thousands and hundreds of thousands or millions millions billions trillions of other of other son class ABC and D stars is a Class D medium but I like it sustains us great for me but there's all these other stars in the sky and light comes from that so when God says he creates light from Darkness yes he's not creating light as I understand it not creating photons
 and you say it's time it's idea of time itself at a few of the structure of The Gallery at all the same concept of the physical Universe than we do you make a gigantic mistake when we try and use our conception of the material universe that you can get on the plane and go to Paris and not get off the plane speaking English and asking where the McDonald's is. Do you can you can go down there at the unfortunately so what you do is love your neighbor as yourself and you learn the way I learned a different way of seeing the world be the bad guy. He has some cheese for breakfast that's the first thing I need to acknowledge is that the way I understand the world
 there can be ordered time and light apart from the existence of the object that we think is light so the source of light did this is so profound we think that the sun is the source of light it is and it is it is from what I understand is why I stick worldview if you believe that there is a beautiful mind who's the ultimate generator of life and lights and order you also believe that there is something even greater than the light of which the light is simply a symbol or a sign of light and I think that's what's going on here now it's also true that in that time and probably even still today and some food and some places you would actually look at the stars and Sun you think I'm a Scot
 when I get there we'll get there in a second. It's a whole lot of things and then there's the Lesser light and these lights are are all called symbols are signs of what what's the greater reality to which they point and I think here we're getting into houses did the literary design of Genesis makes the logical statements that for the biblical out there's these objects in the sky are themselves only reflectors and symbols of the ultimate source of light there's something beyond the sun more powerful than the sun yeah that actually gave the sun it's being correct and that is the true source of light and when we use the word light now we're not using it we using answer Ali as photons logical sense don't let me
 convince you of this another biblical author who meditated D play Genesis chapter 1 the poet who wrote Psalm 36:6 as a whole have a lot going on I'm just going to want to look at the center that here in verses 5 through 9 it begins your loving kindness or extends up to the heavens this guy in the build up there if it reaches up to the skies your righteousness character the drives you to maintain right relationships with your Covenant Partners it's like it's steady like the mountains of God your Justice or your judgments are like the deep below did you three to sky land in every part of creation is staying then ordered by God's stability his faithfulness
 is Justice 02 program
 how precious to me is you're loving your loyal Covenant Love oh God so not only doesn't order creation but it's meaningful to me because the children the sons of men sons of Adam can take refuge in the shadow of your wings
 they drink their fill of the abundance of your house and you give them to drink from the river of your Eden's War didn't end there for with you is the Fountain of Life by your light we see light this is a poetic meditation on God's character derived from the structure of the universe in Genesis and look around look around at the mountains and the sky and the waters and behind all of this is some stabilizing force that is good correct and that is such that this poet can see is of the cosmos as the temple in The Shadow of Your Wings your house is the temple in The Shadow of Your Wings is to be in God's presence is the wings of the cherubim that's right you have the wings of the cherubim
 the abundance of your house it's as if all of creation is the sacred Temple sustained by God's covenant loyalty and that last line there with use the Fountain of Life That's the river that goes out of Eden Waters everything and then buy your light we see light by your light we see lights no I see light by the Light of the sun would support with saying none of the sun is just a symbol to the ultimate source of Light how would you define then lights in a theological sense in Genesis when it's night and day which aren't things got not creating a thing they want God's ordering time because it's precisely is ordering of time that makes our life possible fit is a Hebrew thinker ancient Hebrew sticker with talk about it as ordering time that's maybe more of a way that we can start to think about it possibly
 time in terms of like the four dimensional fabric of the universe of space and time as alternating periods of light and dark you're the light is when I'm out and about and from that light stuff grows out of the ground that keeps my whole that's a literal that's literal like dark and light it just always comes here every day every day your loving kindness oh Lord that's that stability like the mountains of God that light always comes now there's always night but the night is always ended by the day so she was a pattern is a pattern of dark and then lights correct a son coming and going but that's Dave five the stay one well that is not a literal son okay that's right that's when the big light and the Lesser light are placed in the sky
 their place they're at and it says as symbols as signs so their mind they're already was a day and a night no no this isn't about chronology the structure of the days and the way that you each one is paired with the other icy phase one and three go together as a combined are you at the theological statement okay about yes the sun is the things that I see the bring the slightest but theological ideological my conviction is that the order represented and the life and abundance that comes from the sun is just a pointer to the ultimate source of that order I just don't have any mental picture or any way to hold on to this idea of geological light well let's do it in the new creation cuz John the Visionary in the Revelation picked up on this week and it says in the new creation there's Pinos. There's no sign or men or man God is light right the one sitting on the throne and the lamb
 provide light so what he's doing there is he's just going back to Griffin on this he's ripping on this exact thing that's right yeah so that's interesting turn of the sun moon and stars as distinct entities that do what God did on day one day one God separate but now God says Let There Be these things that are signs and symbols they point to me and they Mark the seasons of the years and God verse 16 God made the two great lights the bigger light to Rule the Day and the Lesser light to rule the night so I think the point here is that what's happening here Sunday for is God appointing entities that will rule on his behalf in the heavens and those that would rule is there a rule and that correspond
 precisely to the entities he's going to create to rule on the land which are the Divine image of physical representation of the Divine so the word to talk about the sun moon and stars as representatives of God's rule is the word sign or symbol and there's fourteen of those four things that the lights do they are four symbols they are four seasons were literally this is the word for Israel's feast days the mark Passover Sabbath so they bring order there to Mark the days in the years the first thing is tells you that their symbols they represent. And then and this in a similar way that humans represent got on the land and this is the conception of God's delegated authority he's delegated authority to entities in the heavens he's delegated his authority to entities on the land
 wow so I've never seen this before in Genesis 1 yeah and it's not that obvious or is it obvious well again remember the Bible the Jewish meditation literature so it assumes that you already know what stars are connected to yeah it's going to be developed throughout the whole storyline of the Bible right that the stars that participate in the rule God's rule they rule write the sun moon and stars they rule the heavens that's going to get developed as a whole category of beings in the Biblical word rule the same thing that humans were told to do that cane is told to do to the sin crocheting like an animal rule over there can rule it and it's a standard word for Royal rule in Genesis 1 the humans are
 the land and the sun moon and stars in the heavens and their symbols keywords symbol of the stars or a symbol that in the same way that the humans are sorry I didn't image of the line okay you always Authority on Earth we are symbol of of his of him in some way a reflection reflection and we are material beings made of dirt out of the dirt and in the same way there is a spiritual non-physical reality not made of dirt yeah it's made of whatever whatever you look up in the sky the different realm yeah the different Skyrim Skyrim yeah you know nowadays me feel like we can rule the skies we understand we have astrophysicists we have Rockets
 satellites show us after we are done we get it but back in that day you look up you're like what I can't go over there I don't understand it and it's above me and we'll talk about this and said this idea of the heavens that is other realm and they Shine the thing that they do is shine and move in these patterns sex by your light we see light so they are symbols and as much as they are the reflectors their light is absolutely a borrowed light that points to the ultimate source of light so you got neighbors may bring civilizations look at one of these lights that are moving and very unique way and go okay we're to worship that thing is above us and ordering things and if I give my allegiance to that God and if I if I make my decisions based on timing of my of my Farmington
 yeah and timing of my decisions elsewhere in life by the communication given to me by its movements in the sky I will be following that beings will. Just a common way to understand the world still is today for many people order our calendars are based off of astrology stars is community kind of transcendent as a follower of the one true Elohim. Elohim above Elohim Yahweh Elohim you have this understanding and yeah there is something there at the member of the Divine class up there there's something spiritual going on and I will grant that time. That's obvious to all of us but to me there's a great
 is it a created being correct and that's just reflecting correct him and his authority and glory in his glory and Brilliance and so don't worship that worship The God Who created all that but it is a symbol correct and so there is opening the world of the spirit world the spirit world if we wanted you to spirit world or Spirit realm is the language of Dimensions sure but in the biblical imagination the spiritual Dimension is packaged in language of a vertical spatial imagery of the Heavenly realm you can look up and see the spirit the heavenlies with God's presence of the heavens but he also rules here on Earth
 the heavens are a mirror image of what's Happening Here on Earth so I can go to the temple with all the spirit world even the even the land realm itself is permeated in the veil between the Heaven and Earth is thin and porous is a biblical story and that's what the vertical 2D drawing you know I was having an SSI get you but this is really significant because stars and the other Elohim the God created there one in the same throughout the biblical story chapter 38 there's a poetic line where the gods talking about you know where were you do when I laid the foundations of the earth and then God says you know what I was making reference back to Genesis 1 as a time when this is jug 30847 when the morning Stars sang together when the sons of God shouted for joy and morningstar's is the stars that hang on the longest
 yep totally like the brightest stars threat which are usually planets right the most important of these you think of a Spiritual Beings which are spiritual behind he's correct other symbols and it's using the same word morning Stars an angels sons of God sons of God stars are parallel to the sons of God they're all shouting for Joy their symbols to say that that can creation the Stars shouted for Joy is a poetic way of reflecting on how they how their light is a symbol for the ultimate source of light and why we're in the same round of psalm 19 the skies declare the glory of Elohim the rakia declares the work of his hands and that goes on the whole puns about the son of the Sun and it's like regular movements from one horizon to the other as an act of praise
 it's the same mindset and the Egyptians worship the sun rules the universe and your lives but it's just a pointer to create a symbol cuz here that we think of these we think of stars balls of gas like the ball of glass that we're closest to but if you're in you know an ancient God's revealing himself in scripture here through ancient authors and their ancient conception of the universe and so you look up the thing moves that shines and they're moving and then some of the move and weird patterns some of them are like regular 24/7 some of them are, but anyhow this is really important so did they or do they not think they were spirits and participating in this understanding is that they are Divine beings they are so biblical Authority
 yeah that's like that's my really yes my spirit and it is real I would just said no no no it's a created being just like me it's a symbol of God's glory just like I am an image of God's glory and Rule here on Earth and 5,000 years of gas that seems to be the case no one's ever actually, 21 we can only weaken him how to make sure that we're back to the conversation we had about having an Earth where God dwells in the heavens is throwing us above the heavens so the structure of the cosmos can be provided us with language to talk about God's majesty and rule about the biblical story of those things are going to be down here too
 is it going to look like humans yeah I might be down here right so so while we would go so fast forward we would say those are flaming balls of gas what we could and then say is been so the spirit world doesn't actually exist correct you know through the atmosphere and you didn't see God is taking the imagery that the biblical authors use and equating the imagery with the reality to which it points and I understand the difficult for you as a modern thinker I would go okay I would use the word symbol then okay well then it's a simple a greater reality when you talk about Moses being at the bush and got to give you a symbol there's going to be something that actually really happen but it's pointing to something greater that's right and so I can go okay so the Stars they are just playing about the gas
 but then wanting something greater but that's not how Genesis one is using the word simple because the authors actually just really would just go now that's a being so what did they mean by simple a reality that is itself a lesser realization of a more ultimate and greater reality to which appoints so they would think there's a greater reality points and that greater reality can come too early sometimes in some ways that we don't understand and with the K-9 a bird agree that a greater reality I think so except I think the point that this agreement that the Canaanite a Babylonian the house is that that thing rules me I see about on to it they offer sacrifices they let that thing guide all the decisions of their lives to which an Israelite would said know there's a beautiful mind and heart
 created that thing nothing just serves a purpose and that thing does govern and Rule. Me correct because I also rule we both in some way in fact the whole point of Genesis 1 is that humans are made to be the ultimate symbol of the Divine actually symbol doesn't even image image where the Heavenly entities are on our way out to their symbols humans are the tell them their physical embodiment of the Divine and they are like the Divine beings in some ways let us make human in our image for a Gods speaking to his Divine Council but at the same time does Heavenly beings are also in some way meant to serve us because the humans rule over the land they rule over the
 and they rule over the birds like the bird that's that should be the best me the territory of those cuz they go up there
 so they do as a reading Genesis one you should kind of be tripping out of that in fact it is his kind of the soul mate kind of thing is making this exactly what is going on here correct these terrestrial dirtbags people have God's Divine image they're not as important as you don't get the float around in the sky and shine that's what he says when he says you made this is Psalm 8 so when I and look what he said to the summit when I consider the skies the work of your fingers the moon and the stars be impressive that you've appointed what is human that you even think about him a bit less than Elohim the Divine beings we're not Divine beings in the sense that we're not floating around in the ender world however yet. Next line you have given him a
 Crown of Glory and majesty and remember that Psalm 8 opens and closes with the statement of O Lord our Lord How Majestic is your name in all the Earth so God's ultimate creator of all things and His Majesty is displayed all throughout the Earth but these puny little dirtbags God has crowned them with Divine majesty and Glory it's a reflection of Genesis 1 so humans are given a status that doesn't correspond to their appearance yeah and the stop sign moon and stars apparently are not giving a status corresponding to their parents are important
 but they don't rule they're not as important as they look humans are more important than the moment you get all the way back episode 3 of the god series The Moment The God says listen to the Israelites you're going to go into Canaan they're worshipping the sun moon and stars and remember that you may not be the line this was a part of the handing over to the sons of God thing here we got hands over the nation's Deuteronomy 4 19 he just said don't make any Idols of any fish human-animal and 19 don't lift up your eyes to the skies and see the sun the moon or the stars in the order of Genesis 1 the hosts of Heaven don't lift your eyes up there fighting the stars are the stars of the heaven the Army Divine beings
 and don't be drawn away to worship and serve them those are the ones you always your God has allotted or assigned to the people's under the whole Heaven yeah and then that brought us to Deuteronomy 32 which talked about when God scattered or divided out the nation's he assigned to them sons of God but it's real he took for himself Genesis one is really important and I didn't it wasn't factoring into my thinking a year ago when we were thinking about this and so once you map onto that the things that we did trace the Divine Rebellion that mirrors the human Rebellion it makes a whole lot more sense there's a couple of the key passages that we don't have to talk about right now but they're fascinating Genesis 6 the sons of God Rebellion I think is a mirror to be offered in literary design of Genesis 1 to 11 and it's a mirror image of the humans trying to attain eternal life
 through their own knowing of Good and Evil Rebellion Genesis 3 and then 4 with Kane the unlimited is the Genesis 6 comes and tells us about the sons of God and the Heavenly violating their order trying I think it's trying to restore immortality to humanity through underhanded Way by violating the divine order and the biblical texts that reflects back on this story and explore as it is another Psalm Psalm 82 in which God takes his stand amidst the sons of him so I made it to ya so God takes his stand in the counsel of L in the Divine Council
 Adidas gray assembly so the word great is the word one of these Hebrew words for divine being LL the short form meaning the singular Chief got the phrase Divine council is actually a Biblical phrase It's a cruise right here in Psalm 82 the Council of El Sol Elohim stands in his counsel amidst the Elohim he renders judgment
 00 with a scare quote quote on quote God's delegated Spiritual Beings through which so interesting how is F. Scott got it in the midst of the rulers the rulers so they are interpreting the word Elohim to refer to human rulers
 which is incorrect there are some people who think that those people sat on the conversation about the spirit realm fighting against a long tradition of not appreciating it and then actually kind of reverse engineering translations to hide it away there has been a long tradition specifically in Christian Old Testament scholarship that I think hasn't been aware of the ancient cultural context and so has over centuries been kind of screening I could totally understand that I'm screaming out the steam of our theology it helps me when they scream it out cuz as soon as we start talking about I get uncomfortable I'm really uncomfortable talking about this star's likes
 I get it I get it it's like okay now I'm involved in some weird religion that believes what I mean to me it's like let's get beyond that it's like a modern world we understand more and I've gotten comfortable with a spirituality that's with flattened out the spirit world and there's one ultimate God there's some bad ones modulo Jesus is the best thing in the world even like the demon stuff in the Jesus stories even that the Jesus story beginning to end I get it here we are 82 82 is God a confronting the sons of God and he said how long will you judge unsuccessfully you guys are ruling the world and a member the human and divine
 round mirror mirror's of each other remember the Book of Daniel where Greece and Persia have their own governing Ella and then Daniel pray and so we always at his fences his and these are beings and conflict but their conflict mirrors the conflict is the pay that actually exist in a couple I think this is the way forward at least for me for thinking about this is that it's the same analogy as God's presence in the temple in the modern sense because we don't see material reality as a vehicle for Spiritual presents for Catholic so what I'm saying is a modern world modern Enlightenment worldview the material it's just Adam crashing into each other that's not how most humans have understood their experience
 fluorosis most of human history of the material and the non-material and how they are interrelated to each other so Jacob right and counters God's glory is Temple presents in the middle of a field Ezekiel by a river in Babylon and he's a real experiences the physical and we will call the spiritual aren't separated by physical distance and then they permeate each other
 this is the whole all these debates about history about the sacraments of the Catholic is all about this but will grant certain spiritual things rack that has two yeah that's right that's like everything is muffled and such this flat down all the feast that is real participated in when you know you go to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage face you're eating before the Lord Deuteronomy go to Jerusalem with inter presents not everybody like went to the temple when you go to Jerusalem to go to the temple for an afternoon but you go to your uncle's home there was like I get that you know God is everywhere yeah okay well if God is above all and through all and in all the Apostle Paul says then there's something.
 what is that about the spiritual realm and so the point is that it's specifically connected with politics and power structures that's what these beings are associated with the sons of God power structures when you see human power structures that are corrupt and like perpetually not working and instruments of evil and Injustice even despite their own best intentions the biblical authors I think one of them to me that something more complex this isn't just a structure of just some mean dudes there's something underneath yes pushing this forward correct perpetuating yet evil and that's the thing that you just saw himself confronting correct I think Jesus would be like yeah it's powers of Darkness are working in and through the power structures in Rome and Jerusalem if his day
 God is rendering his Justice on them so many 2 verse 3 God says to the these corrupt rulers who Express themselves through human power structures vindicate the week and the orphan do justice to The Afflicted and the destitute rescue the week in the needy deliver them from the hand of the wicked what are human power structures what should they do so many to God's talking into the spirit realm correct but then he but he's saying hey guys your corrupt you're doing Injustice and how it's actually materializing is it in the spirit realm it's materializing in governmental power structure those two things are just so couple together in their mind God can go be alright guys here's the problem yet the humans are in just it's your problem you are creating this problem wrecked this correct this right here let's keep going then
 poet reflects on the sons of God over their response he says they don't know they referring to the Divine beings that God's appointed they don't know or they don't have understanding they walk in darkness and the foundations of the land of shaking so when humans reject in Genesis 12 11 when humans sees the knowing of Good and Evil for themselves who created order is it introduces chaos when that Rebellion is mirrored in the Divine realm there's also chaos isn't the foundations that were the stability of creation is threatened by that specifically when you see acts of great Injustice to the poor and the needy and so the Last Stand of the pond his God rendering his judgment so I said you all are telling him you all are sons of the most high is God saying listen I appointed you as with delegated authority
 but on the contrary now you will die like Mortals and fall like one of the princes arise oh God judge the Earth for you are the one who will inherit all of the nation's so I can Deuteronomy or cuz like I'm going to take care of you guys get I've delegated authority all these other Angelic beings ever build their own Rebellion just like humans are these beings are in rebellion and it's just a cluster now both the Heavenly and Earthly Realms are in Rebellion against the creator of God's response is your days are numbered you guys are numbered Genesis 6 the sons of God see the daughters of humans they see that they're good and they take them that's the fall fall fall pattern if just like the woman she sees that the food is good and she takes you so these these Divine beings are undergoing their own
 alien matching human Rebellion so they take them Wise from wherever they choose a new pair of children these children are associated in some way with violent Warriors who fill the Earth with violence and God's response to them and Genesis 6 verse 3 he says my spirit won't abide with humans forever 120 years is all you got so different ways to interpret that line but the point is that it's God withdrawing his life giving presents because of this act of the sons of God and it's that the marriage right here in Psalm 82 I appointed you to govern the Heavenly Realms you broke that boundary and your days are numbered me to is this is it the assumption that I bring to it is the Heavenly hosts and sons of God the I looking for eternal
 and now they're not specifically reflecting on the Genesis 6 episode Genesis 6 and 11 then I think it's specifically it's similar to humans were made to participate in God's eternal life of sharia and their days are cut short cuz of their Rebellion Genesis 3 glitches in the Heavenly realm there are other passages this helps make sense of all kinds of stuff in the book of Isaiah and is he Keel I'm sorry we should get we've been talking for like an hour and a half and we haven't done any question yeah here's what I think we should do this was supposed to be a question response episode and it's turned into something else about what I've been learned in the last year this is episode about the origins of spirit realm have a connection between that and I and now we've opened up a new can of worms
 securing our episode next week however let's knock off a couple North Wilkesboro Wilkesboro North Carolina my name is Cole right and I'm from North Wilkesboro North Carolina on my question is in regard to the second podcast episode on God we discussed the idea of other Elohim and so my question is kind of two part for the other Elohim Timeless and uncreated like God and if they aren't does that mean that God created them and would God create inferior out of him that would oppose him a great question about the meaning of the word Elohim and how it relates to our English word god it's such a category reconstructor so I totally get your question so just to be crystal clear the biblical authors when they use the word Elohim to refer to the god of Israel god of the Bible they
 believe there is only one time left on created Elohim Yahweh the god of Israel they also believe there are other Elohim but the word Elohim by itself doesn't mean Timeless created it just means an inhabitant of the spirit realm so it does mean that God has appointed other beings that share in the form of existence and Transcendent physical kind of way but they aren't inferior they're actually beautiful they are sharing God's Divine glory and light just like humans are beautiful as image of the Divine answer to your question that doesn't mean that God created them to oppose him I said the opposite the whole biblical story line is that God wants to partner with other beings to share that's a big takeaway and participate in the rule of creation something about the nature of God that's a very sharing he likes to share share share
 okay I'm going to I'm going to rule everything but no he like creates Spirit beings that rule for him and then he creates his terrestrial paying off a tree off of God is the God wants to share a sorority with others that's Genesis one which opens up the possibility that those other creatures could not want to do God's will in the same way for humans which is of course the whole debacle drama yeah and our understanding is that when you have a God who wants to delegate Authority what can go wrong answer and welcome to do and just like The Human Condition been welcome to The Human Condition good question all right we got Brandon Christiansen
 hey John hey Tim this is Brandon thanks again for all you do just wanted to ask when God says let us make man in our image that our likeness who's the US he's referring to in Genesis 1 and that's it thank you
 yeah Brandon so we dress that a couple times already but just to make it crystal clear I think when we get to Genesis 1:26 When God says let us make the author intends that will understand he's talking to the host of Heaven we've already picked up on the whole that's what I do being stopped writing on its correct and for the same reason that that plural we continues throughout the Book of Genesis when God expels the man in the woman from the garden he says lets you know send them out less the human send out their hand and take from the Tree of Life and live forever. Says they've become like one of us when the Tower of Babylon is built and the people that once they come let us build a tower and then God says come let us go down a lot of people in my tradition like to point out that and go see God is a plural and pointed as a proof of the trinity
 you can make that move I just think you don't have any contextual clues that that's what's going on Joe and all of the contextual evidence in Genesis and the rest of the Bible points to the Divine Council the Angels aren't making humans God says let us make and then it says and then gotten it in the process, got lots to share what's up with her and I have one question about the dirty of Christ TeamSpeak under and the podcast about the Christ said that Jesus said that he was got in a bury Jewish wait and in Jump eight when he say to the virus has it before Ibraham
 I am I just have one question I was looking the video about the word Lord in the Shema and he's in the work was a PA and I want to know if Jesus said before Abraham yeah yeah that means that only God can said that because I thinking about that question and I'm actually believe in that I know the actually riding sweat made in Greek but they were Tim said that is Greek thinking Hebrew thinking how to make so I just have the question did Jesus said before Abraham and everyone just freaked out like like everything else like there's something that will lose in the end of translation
 he say are going to Amy I know that Grandma is just a translation but what actually we think Jesus said yeah that's a great question yeah it is true actually you won't find a sentence in the New Testament you won't find the sentence it says Jesus Is God and you will find Jesus especially in the Gospel of John gospels to saying things like I am identifying himself with someone called I am and I am is a translation of the Divine name Yahweh for S yeah so yes the apostles want to identify Jesus not just with a generic title God they want to identify Jesus with Yahweh the personal God of Israel so that's a good example where they're using Hebrew categories even though they're writing and Greek and they do it narratively to where the depict Jesus as doing things
 that in Hebrew Bible only Yahweh does forgiving sins or calling the waters that kind of thing these are Hebrew Bible type of ways of identifying someone with y'all okay so we're going to more John Osborne in the series about God and I'm finding it very challenging when you discuss the song the medium you use her exclamation of calling Samuel spirit and Elohim as evidence that Samuel Spirit was in the same class of the rest of the Gods I was right that more of her being surprised that she was actually seen a Spirit come to her I'd always assumed the author was just telling us what she said not agreeing with her declaration is there evidence in the text and I'm missing the shows that Samuel Spirit was in fact Elohim and not just a case of mistaken identity by the medium
 understand my spirit is in fact and yell at him class and wouldn't that imply there's no real difference between humans and the rest of the Elohim spiritual world since we would all have some type of Elohim within us thanks for all you do and encouragement and my faith and help me love Jesus more the question is about when the spirit medium and 4 Samuel 20:8 calls Samuels disembodied Spirit of him coming up out of the ground what you just confused me because she just confused what was in her mind and I have no idea the point is that the author is depicting her as looking at a deceased spirit being and using the Hebrew word Elohim to refer to that this isn't the only time I love him refers to the presence of a dead person there's one occurrence of it in Isaiah
 8:19 and actually I think it's a reference back to this story where Isaiah says listen you know when Israel's lost in the darkness and people say to you come let's go to the mediums in the spirit test and then Isaiah says should people consult Elohim on the half of the living by going to the Dead 2 dead Spirits it happens again in spirits of the Dead would be a better spirits of the dead and the Rudolph is one of the terms could that can refer to the Elohim the Divine beings in the Divine Council in First Kings 22 that story of Micaiah who's next to Ahab and God says he'll get rid of Ahab and how should I take him out and then one Rudolph one Spirit one of the Divine Council who's the host of heaven was the two terms used comes up and says hey
 I'll be at the seafood spirit in the prophet and get him killed and you always says yeah good idea to that wow is one of the words that can refer to these be pretty flexible word in invisible life presents Leah and got himself it's right so the story when Samuel isn't the only case so my point isn't about what the medium thought she was experiencing my point is simply about the word Elohim in that context matches a handful of other uses of Elohim to refer to the presence of the sea spirit's yeah alright last one Matt and Kansas City hello Bible project you mentioned you don't think that there's a way to put the Old Testament Divine Council vignettes into a coherent narrative was that was listening to your podcast one of the explanations sounded to me
 like a clear and coherent narrative Elohim rebelled before the fall of Man and later God gave man over to his Rebellion by appointing over them Deuteronomy 32 the Elohim that they desired this is also consistent with the point Paul makes in Romans 1 what do you see as the shortcomings of this harmonization yes that's a good observation I think our hour of conversation leading up to this is for me a demonstration of my eyes I can now see a much clearer narrative Arc to the whole story of the of the spirit realm and we didn't even talk about Isaiah 14 Ezekiel 28 the ending of Isaiah 24 talks about the kings in the Heights and the Kings on the earth so it matches powers and authorities in Heavenly realm Matt read the ending of Isaiah chapter 24 it'll blow your mind so yeah there's a whole narrative here about a Divine Rebellion that mirrors the human rebellion and God
 in the story of Jesus is here to deal with both of those and that's the drama played out in the gospels is the Jesus is confronting human and spiritual opponents and is Victorious over both in the death in his death and Resurrection all right thank you for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast here's what I think we can do is throughout this whole God's ears are just going to go for a long time if you have a question send it in will keep collecting them if it's applicable to any specific episode with my bill plug in on the episode where we're going to stop every so often do qanon Theory episodes and we have a bunch of questions here that are great so next week we'll do an actual qnr episode interactive questions to it
 find story in the universe story Jesus
