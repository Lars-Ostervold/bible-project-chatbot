hey this is John Collins at bible project and we are finishing up a series called the Paradigm series we're looking at how we view the Bible what type of literature do we think the Bible is since we started this project 7 years ago the most common question that we get from people is what translation of the Bible should I use it's a sincere question without a real easy answer because behind the question is the understanding that the Bible was written in an ancient culture and an ancient time using ancient languages and we want to know how do we best understand that time that culture and those languages this is a massive massive area of learning and understanding so I find the simplest on-ramp to this whole heart of the Paradigm is just to focus on one little part of it and it's not like ancient Israelite cultural Customs or food in the fascia world but just to focus on words words words are the building blocks
 of language words are the most basic way we try to make meaning out of the realities that we find ourselves in sopore example are English word parts we can use that in a couple different ways we can refer to the actual organ that we have but often were talking about the heart as the center of human affection in emotion and we use a separate word brain talk about human reason for this is Ray's the fascinating example there is no ancient Hebrew word for brain there's no word or even concept of brand you look through all of the things associated with the heart thinking skill speaking it's all things that happened in the heart or so today on the show we're going to look at how the Bible is ancient literature in fact here's the sentence that we wrote about the Bible is written in another time and culture and we need to honor that ancient historical context as we come to understand better then we'll start by looking at how the Bible uses what
 thanks for joining us.
okay so we're going to continue talking about what kind of letter to the Bible is it's an ongoing conversation to really nail down what does it mean when we say the Bible's unified store at least Jesus got a tagline to use but underneath of that is a pretty what kind of well-formed or at least like it's congealing like this for me Paradigm of what what type of literature the Bible is and what that means for how we should encounter it and its really is trying to discern the Bible's Paradigm for what it is right and trying to say that it's a recovery project of trying to recover what this is the way of viewing these texts that was intended by the people who wrote them in the communities that first read them all right step one was the Bible is human and divine product of human and divine partnership secondly it's literature that's unified around one unified story
 common themes and motifs that are all unified and actually editorially unified as a collection collection of the Bible in the New Testament and then the next step was that it was Messianic literature that the most important part of the story the most more theme is this need for an anointed one a human who can really get this right and lead us all that's right and that is the filament of a storyline we're all humanity is called to be in emogene representative of God has lots of failure that leads to a crisis and I need for one anointed representative and anointed is what the word Messiah means you know they realize maybe the order should be wisdom next because then how do you get out what we're supposed to be these this image we need God's wisdom and
 then how to get the wisdom you meditate on scripture also the next step in the episodes was that it's meditation literature the type of literature that requires a lifetime reading rereading it interprets itself through the way that it's designed an artistic design the medium is the message and what's the purpose of that meditation it's for wisdom and what's purpose of wisdom it's to be the engine and the Bible it is wisdom literature it shows us how to say it will help us become humans that have good relationships about how to be the image of God but Messiah Style Style Style Style the one we're going to do today actually will do in two parts I think
 and I meant to say idea of the Bible being contextually rooted literature so which I think just means that the Bible was written in a certain time and place and that's important to remember in fact here's the sentence that we wrote about it the Bible was written in another time and culture and we need to honor that ancient historical context as we come to understand better feels like this part of the Paradigm is taking what we talked about so far and asking the question okay how do we do that how do we practically read how do we practically meditate and interpret this as wisdom and here are some skills for for understanding but I do think it's important to us as a point of fact to that leads to those implications which is that the Bible is from another language in place because it depending on the tradition of Christianity grew up in that may or may not have
 something has emphasized that all well you know every Bible has like a a map of Israel the little dictionary that consists of like hell what the hell it actually is a sure cuz it's like using measurements and things that you're not used to this right this time however you could read a story written in your own language our language to English written from a Modern English speakers point of view cultural point of view and have it be a story about an ancient time and place and so and need a map and it would need to us culture not just the subject matter is Nathan but the actual everything about this literature reflects in ancient cultural setting and if we want to
 stand up we've got we need to recognize and recognize that we are going to have to do some work really understand this on its own terms and that it's not a point that every Christian tradition emphasizes even necessary for different reasons and I have my own experience with different parts of those Traditions I think all three of us to a place with a point one other thing is that this is not a point that comes like there's no one word and our mission statement that you can drive this point out of this is super important for the Paradigm that we're trying to engage with reading the Bible do we teach them about a project but it's in our mission statement experiencing the Bible is even if I started leads to Jesus we don't have experience in the Bible as an ancient unified story book you a word and our mission statement that yeah we'll figure this but it is super important and it underlies everything ancients Sandra Richter's epic of Eden
 yes the other day and introduction to the introduction to the Old Testament and she does a lot of historical background work to understand the story in the term said it was written and she talks about encountering the Bible as a cross-cultural experience sometimes we don't think of it that way but yeah we're reading an ancient document written in another culture and the categories were going to encounter their the way of life it's cross-cultural and so even just that point even if I don't understand what that culture is like just the fact of understanding is different than mine that helps me so much at least like even if I encounter something and I have no idea what it meant what it means now or what it meant then to ancient Israel at least if I have the category of okay this is a cross-cultural document and I'm sure it means something but I don't know for sure I mean
 it would be if you travel to another culture. So imagine a scenario where you intentionally Place yourself in another cultural environment where you're at the Norms there are not the noise I want to be a burden on yesterday large somewhere else in your own City or two somewhere within your own neighborhood but into somebody else's home to experience a different assumptions taken for granted when I come to your house the default Inception is there no shoes ever in the house that is not at my house. And I forget to do it sometimes at your house I'll wear my shoes in your house I grew up wearing shoes in my house my wife is Japanese American and she and you don't wear shoes
 and the house and I actually for a while I was embarrassed to like kind of have to tell people I get take off your shoes and the awkward thing is like amazing fun taking up shoes enjoy it. But yeah it's a big cultural difference and it's not like a little thing of it it's like actually like grates against this really significant way of like being in the world right like you're bringing your bring the dirt into the clean space in my contacts. Went to Japan I would have an open attitude about what I was going to encounter what the cultural norms would be when I walk into somebody's house I'd be taking their cues like what I do. I might be a little bit cautious about it and listening if I walked into John Collins house expecting to encounter his house the exact same as mine then I would be surprised by the cultural difference you know
 like it's all about our expectations when we when we walk into a culture or we read a text if we impose our own expectations of that this is going to be exactly the same as my culture where that would be a really bad way to enter another culture to decide ahead of time it's kind of like the cruise ship mentality like making my cultural setting a little portable portable on the lean Tower but I'm listening to audiobooks right now that are there have been around for a while and I've known about them but just haven't had a chance to listen to him yet and they're about this they're both co-authored but one of them they both have one of the same coauthors a new testament scholar named Randy Richards Randolph Richards and I once called misreading scripture with Western eyes removing cultural blinders to better understand the Bible and the other one is called misreading scripture with
 the visualist patronage honor and shame in the biblical world so Randy Richards has done a lot of teaching and I was just lift in a number of different countries throughout the course of his teaching career and so he's just collected all these experiences and their scholarly informed works but they're meant for a wide reading on it since it is a topic that's interesting to any of you are listeners Randolph Richards books these are two really great ways to address of this talks about how there are cultural differences that you can discern when you go into somebody else's house and some you expect especially related to like often food and they're often the most humorous or funny ones where it's like the diet food choices available in one cultural setting are opposite or whatever at least make for great traveling stories for breakfast
 but what's more important are with the unspoken ones that you don't expect or have don't even notice the way that you're imposing your expectations on another culture's way of seeing things or vice versa. They have on default and you just it's nowhere near on your radar and you just bulldoze right over them and either Miss understand or just don't hear things that are being really important that you don't think are important because you never been trained to think it important and so that he uses the iceberg that culture is like an iceberg and some things are obvious on the water that like a difference but it's almost always the things under the surface but are the most important and that take the most effort and pose the most dangerous for crashing into us for what we do with that Iceberg so you know explain something that was huge but hidden
 it's such a great gift it is ancient history of context let's just go anywhere today
yeah it's interesting that you're saying it's helpful to both be aware of the culture you're walking into or encountering but also your own presuppositions and expectations and cultural norm So reading the Bible take reflective work on oh I think I I do function as part of this individualistic culture in these ways and I don't think that's what the Bible's doing another words in the Bible that I find offensive almost always this is a good indicator it's just something that offends me or something that's hard to understand you know seven times out of ten there's probably some cultural difference here on a deep level that it's killing me not just to say like off like it's different in the Bible's cultural setting but I'm in a cultural setting that sees things a certain way and that's why I'm reacting in this way so what is it what's underneath that you're not saying is that we looked at ancient Israel culture and adopt that as the norm or the way things should be but it's the vehicle that God used to communicate truth and
 actors in the world so we have to be aware of it but we're not imposing that culture on ourselves now I think the same way and I think that the cosmology Series where it's like you have to come and come on the terms of what's the way that the quasars Feud the cost for us and there's a dome in the sky and there is no water underneath the ground hella by pillars and like this is the view of how the universe works now is that how I have to the now think that's how the universe is That's The Next Step what is that mean for the way that my culture sees things and understands things is a different going what's the way they see the world see the world the way they do so seeing the Bible is contextually rude literature this is actually a massive area of learning and understanding and trying to approach
 so I find the simplest on-ramp to this whole part of the Paradigm is just to focus on one little part of it and it's not like ancient Israelite cultural Customs or food and change the world but just to focus on Words make a real simple in this is just for pedagogy in trying to get into the concept is just to recognize a very simple fact is nothing this beautiful about this fact the Bible is written in ancient languages ancient Hebrew ancient Aramaic and then also ancient Greek when you say ancient Hebrew give me the different than the Hebrews current yeah that's right in the same way that the English spoken today is different from the English says it was spoken eight hundred years ago and similarities and has developed the same thing different form of Greek so if you can just help people like noticed that fact and that fact itself will be a fact that depending on the tradition you grew up in that may have
 black up simple matter of fact or it may be really under exercised or almost never brought up depending on how you were exposed to the Bible over one of the most common questions that we get is what translation of the Bible should I read and underneath that is an understanding that the Bible was written in different language so tell me the best way to translate that language is MI at most of the Bible are amazing but they are translations their mediating one ancient languages into a modern language and that requires an enormous amount of cross-cultural work so this is this is why we're helping people understand difficult vocabulary is a big part of what we've done in the Dark Continent videos videos videos of class coming out about how to study words in the Bible so it's just one of the easiest practical ways to start noticing
 cross-cultural nature of the Bible is studying when this podcast released as well are mini class on words in the Bible be out understanding words in the Bible this episode is Kennedy idea so let's talk about this maybe in a little more theoretical or systematic way normally would just dive into the examples but I found some helpful ways to frame up how to think about this and again it's trying to help people see the Bible and recover an ancient Paradigm for reading these texts from Modern readers and so one way to do that is to come filled out why this is important and why learning how to say biblical words one of the best ways to get you into the culture of ancient biblical authors
so one, experienced people have is as you're learning a language words you're a speaker of language if there's a war that you don't know what it means that's a fairly intuitive way to discover what that word means Wilson how other people use it it looks good but that probably would be more helpful
 but you're right but even more intuitive the requires only listening to seeing how people use that in some ways possibly more broad if you're picking up how weird is he's in contacts instead of just reading one definition just last night I was reading a story to my son's what was the word contemplate contemplate my eight year olds like what does that mean and then I was reading in the sentence so I reread the sentence it occurred in the my ten-year-old was like this you think about something a lot and then I got a buddy did you know that weird he was like no I said he could see from contacts guess what was going on and don't worry, it was exactly what you're describing
 so this jumble of syllables even if you don't know what it means can still communicate the right idea contacts and I just say it by itself and Romans going to understand it exactly right but if you have a character I think there's a little picture of somebody sitting reading a book Serena and my daughter has been not understanding what words mean but trying to use them feelings words for the most part social she's been saying I'm bored actually she says I'm boring but she means I'm bored and I'm like what do you mean by that like what it what are you saying I'm not sure if you know what that means she said I mean I'm tired I mean I'm distracted I'm confused and how to say uncomfortable. I don't know if you're any of those things but could you keep talk to you
 I ended it and I'm trying to say could you describe cuz I think the context will give her a way to say what she means without just using a word but if she could describe okay what do you what do you mean by that what are you feeling or what are you tell me what you mean you know I want her to give me some contacts so I can understand the meaning of I'm boring Serena's like another culture and she is still learning how to express ideas and Concepts through syllables that she understands the meaning of the whole point is the big Meadow Point to be made about where it says that words it's an overstatement for the one that gets a good conversation going words don't have meaning we give words meaning by the way that that we use them so the fact that she can say I'm boring but it communicates something but she's trying to discover and she can use a
 Lady of words but she's really probably just after one set of things so that's a good example of where what matters most in that moment is not the words it's what she's expressing by means of a whole variety of words aspect of communication that's important is that words are a window into something deeper something more significant and just looking up a word in the dictionary doesn't always get you where you need to go over a masterful communicator will carefully choose Works absolutely so while words don't mean anything that's what you know but then they do in the sense that we kind of agree upon what words make the masterful communicator can choose from with this Collective understanding to choose the right thing to convey what they mean agreed upon context communication can happen really well when there's a really good communicator who knows the cam
 text of the audience and audience knows the context of the communicator that works things people mean things by their use of work but it's also true that if you look up boring a dick what do you mean Serena you could have gone to look it up and down there and be like what is study what she means by her words and by doing that you have to look not at what some dictionary maker think the word means you have to look at what she means in context of that conversation and so that's the basic impulse when I come across words in the Bible that I think I know and then go look him up in a dictionary Justice righteousness is a reading and reading a translation you see the English word I see the word love peace whatever holiness
 look it up or you just kind of go into your mental Bank of like how did how how people use at my life that's what I miss my medium of interaction between people and what we're saying is every person is a culture unto themselves like even Serena and that interaction and so what words the sounds and syllables are this medium of your interacting together and so this is a concept respond more in the class of art of biblical words and then we talked about before but I adopted it from a literary interest in the Enigma of a human being that Umberto Eco but he developed this these concepts are talking about language that I have found really helpful and it's just it's imagining that every human has a growing constantly developing encyclopedia in their mind of how they make sense of the world and then the words and ideas that used to make sense of the world so think of a and now vestigial encyclopedias or schema
 just keep the framework that you have and So within Serena's developing framework the word boring mean something she has a associated with something so then she speaks the spare syllables to Silver Bowl ring and then it enters your ears and then it starts interacting with your mental encyclopedia says the benefit of like Decades of experience speaking and learning new words and so you have your own encyclopedia and so Echo calls a speaker writers encyclopedia encyclopedia production you produce language out of that encyclopedia and then you Chris I have an encyclopedia of reception you receiving a words and then making sense of it and I found that helpful words of the medium and so what we're after when we're reading the Bible a tennis match in the trick is that we often
 import or impose our Encyclopedia of reception on to the biblical authors Encyclopedia of production we just assume that they're the same so we assume that whatever Justice means to me that that's what Biblical Waters mean by it and so look it's in the Bible and then you can start pointing it but we need the adjustment is to say to start from a default to say let me start by saying I probably don't know what this word actually means in the Bible there's distinguish word that the translators have chosen to approximate it but to really understand what boring means to the culture of Serena I need to do a lot more that I need to do something put in a lot more effort I have the benefit West Serena's being her parents so I do have a pretty good understanding of her Encyclopedia of production but if it was another kid if one of your kids came up to me and said I'm bored
 and I'll be like oh honey are you okay cuz I said I would I would know you're already as I hope they don't think they're boring when was Serena I know her Encyclopedia of production well enough to ask questions already familiar with how they use words and more you can anticipate a little better yeah that's what's the difference between you mentioned dictionary and encyclopedia are those meant to be different off what is just the dictionary approach the words is thank God words have a meaning to say no words are the vehicle of somebody's unique encyclopedia and to understand what they mean and I can't just assume I already know what it means that I can just look
 in the dictionary I need to study how that person uses that word classic examples we talked about through the years or when Jesus talks about the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom of the skies and so somebody might come to the Bible and assume the Bible is telling a story about you can go to heaven after you die so you read the phrase kingdom of heaven and Jesus is talking about the place where I can go after I die and the king of Heaven means but when you study how Jesus actually uses the phrase it's clear that he's talking about something that is arriving through him like on Earth not something you go to but something was coming here to have to study his Encyclopedia of what that phrase means and then famous theology debates write history are like when Paul says I'm not ashamed of the Gospel it's the power of God for salvation for in it the righteousness of God is revealed what is the righteousness of God what man you have to study what was Paul mean by that and then you have to study where did he
 get the language of God's righteousness from the Hebrew Bible but he's riding in Greek what is this concept in the Hebrew Bible and someone involve a sudden you're studying an encyclopedia not just looking up words in a dictionary and so this is the dynamic of of difficult words yes and it can be frustrating I've made this realization before and it just sticks with me that when you're reading the Bible your reading an English someone writing in Greek thinking and Hebrew. That's a lot of like you just said Paul English word righteousness translation of a Greek word that is in Paul's mind part of his encyclopedic knowledge that comes from Hebrew thought that's right and that's a lot of work there's nothing for it communication is a lot of work but it's a lot of work for the three of us to sit and talk and try and lie
 Halloween ideas together and we're like sitting in the same room you know so and cuz I found you can kind of turned it into a technique of like it's almost like a scavenger hunt I mean the goal is that I build an encyclopedia reception in my mind that more closely resembles the Encyclopedia of production for the biblical authors so they like the real communication starts happening
so, take one example of the word heart in the Bible the blood pumping organ in your chest will be like a literal definition probably a metaphorical we just go for it. Calm heart a hollow muscular organ that pumps blood through the circulatory system by rhythmic contractions dilation four chambers in the vertebrae two arteries to the ventricles literal anatomical meeting on dictionary.com then
 two levels down here's a meeting the center of the total personality with reference to intuition feeling or emotion Google search the second definition is just the central or innermost part of something so it's more synonymous with like the middle or head or heart of the matter of the city so there's a literal meaning and then because the heart is physically at the center of a human torso it can be used metaphorically to be the center of something and then that becomes a way of thinking about human nature the center of your of your being being and you have all my heart my whole self but then we have this other nuanced an English that's where the heart is particularly connected with feeling and emotion that's a separate heartbreak
 broke my heart that's right that's a dictionary definition the builds out pretty much my English to encyclopedia Center or something instead of emotion Center I had to go get a heart exam and on the way traveling through the heart of the city I had this sense in my heart that right now you do the same word and I can't really intermix those I can be like this hollow organ burritos burritos give me a heartache from a friend that it was heartbreak so that's our experiences English word that's our it's like a pedia so when you going into the Bible here's what you'll find so the Hebrew word Old Testament Hebrew word for more it's interesting there's a two-letter word live and then three letter word live off a full and a shortened form for your phone for my short informed so you will see occurrences of the word
 part in the Bible that fit Encyclopedia of reception so for example in Exodus chapter 4 when God tells Moses that his brother Aaron is about to come visit him and he says when your brother Aaron sees you he will be glad in his heart I get it in my heart to make sense to me exactly so that's true and he besought the heart is where you can experience so the heart is connected to the motion also in the ancient Hebrew encyclopedia in 1st Samuel you have a husband addressing his wife Hannah hasn't been able to have children and so he asked her brother and sensitively why is your heart sad and that makes sense to me so you come across the phrase broken heart is a Hebrew idiom to be broken of heart
 a lot of idioms from Hebrew names in the Bible what part means to me this is a hard one because if I came across these I wouldn't think to look up the word heart in the tablet that's the whole point is you don't notice a difference here is the interesting one there's a moment when in the story of Abraham where he hears God say you know you and your wife you're both like almost a hundred years old are going to have a child and then he has a little internal conversation in the narrative and the phrase used as he said in his heart and almost here that's what it that's the literal translation but if you look in most English translations I think what it says is he said to himself so New American Standard has he said in his heart but the new inter
 National version translates and he said to himself would you ever do you recognize that idiom from you're on your own. It is hard to stay on your heart that's the I'm boring you like okay I know what you're talkin about I get it I've never heard someone say it that way but I guess you said in your heart and that you said it in a way that seemed relieved a meaningful to you and I like it maybe has like an emotional overtones that's how I would come and take it so I would make meaning of it out of my Encyclopedia of reception and and I figure it out because language is flexible and like I could totally drive with one of those moments so you could you can do a little work on the spot yeah it's not so foreign to you that you can't make sense of it but it sounds funky a question here is heart mean what I say
 it means or seems like the authors are using heart differently than how I would usually use it interesting is that wouldn't be my intuition would be like oh I don't know what heart means in Hebrew as much as I thought I did I think my my intuition just be like anyone with him I said to myself but the idea here is maybe heart and Hebrew is got connotations that I'm not aware of are there other ones where we would read & Co this is this doesn't make sense to me so there's a story about how God and Powers an artist in ancient Israel a guy named battle how to make the Tabernacle and all the jewellery in gold and tapestries and son so what God says in Exodus chapter 31 is look I have appointed him
 and I have placed skill in the heart of all of those who are skillful of heart so that they can make the Tabernacle that I've commanded you Gil in the heart and skillful of heart yeah that's interesting newest feels like if you look when you're talking to someone who just kind of their newer to English language the way they think in their language and you like you get it but you're like funny turns of phrase has but you're like I get it might be a different meaning underlying the word original language do you mean like skilled in the brain okay so this is raised the fascinating example there is no ancient Hebrew word for brain there's got to be the issue in your head there's no vocabulary words
 no not that we would expect one cuz the Bible isn't in anatomy manual expect one because I mean that's a massive part of being human is having this big clump of matter in your head I mean there's a word for head but it can mean physical head or leadership or there's no worse or even concept of brain as if you look through all of the things associated with the heart thinking skill in speaking with all things that happened in the heart in Egypt to where they actually like pulled out the brain and it is important when they bury people haha well this is the whole point different cultures have had different conceptions of the gray matter in between our ears and there's no word for it and everything that we would associate with the brand happens in the heart happens in the live in ancient Biblical Hebrew a holy God is able to
 do what he does because he is skilled of Heart School depart yeah that's right so he has an ability and capability God gives King Solomon wisdom he gives him a wideness of heart was literally why didn't you just say it to me like that I might think oh maybe so he's giving Solomon both was done like intellectual ability or inability to live in a way that is right but then he's also giving him a really big heart to love people as it doesn't if I am if I impose my own inside or outside of the contacts if you just told me where is sympathetic person yeah sure yeah but hear this verse 1st Kings 4:29 it says God give Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of heart
 what's the synonym of picking up that there's probably synonyms for yelling decision making a big heart for what it comes to discernment skill and knowledge we talked about the mind is example with a few different but that the basic principles at work here are we have an encyclopedia perception about what heart is means and what you do with it some of it maps on like really precisely who was how the biblical authors thought of the heart but then they have this whole additional set of Encyclopedia entry is about heart in their minds that don't match my use of the word hard what they match is my sense of what the mind is
 they have a different conception of the heart and there's famous Bible passage love the Lord your God with all your heart so there's a much more richer set of meaning this isn't just an exercise to make sure we have the right vocab if you are supposed to love the cockpit what God with all your heart that's the command like be nice to know what they mean by heart
now some of this is hidden in Translation right that's right depending on the translation that you were so that's not a bad thing that that could be the translators doing good work and translating it has skill in this example though all of those weird like skilled and heart breath apart translated so it makes more sense to us but then you get to the verse love the Lord your God with all your heart now you don't have the Fuller meaning of what that is for the translators did you a benefit but then also then that's right it's and now a deficit of sorts sure I think this is one of the outcomes of this conversation is the benefit and even the need to engage the Bible in multiple translations over the course of a long. Of time so that you have a best translation, like a category mistake it's relaxing wasn't the best apple well there's a variety of apples and different taste for different you know there's not a red delicious
 yeah I think I'm with you on that anyway red delicious apple is two truths and a lie red thread of an apple
 oh that's going to think about that one actually had to wait for you to give me the give me the brand brand new so I'm not into that it's another words it's just I think a sign of growing skill and awareness to realize that anytime I hold one in Translation I am getting one way the Bible can be expressed in English but there if there's whatever but there are other ways in English that will capture other nuances and what I need is more than one of them are some translations that try to be more wooden and literal and so it will have a lot of phrases that feel funny it to be awkward Inglot awkward and like the nasb or standard
 those are the more common English Bible Bibles you would you suggest for like a kind of average Bible reader to be like you said pulling up in every once in a while and get a concordance out and and then you can be like oh that's the word and then you can like do a word study based off of the actual like Hebrew word for somebody who wants to begin to engage the original language of the Bible but doesn't have time or want to learn to read the Glencoe just Interlinear is there an excellent tool great blueletterbible.org and that's it those are digital concordances or dinner linear's are great ways to begin to develop skill set in class
 this room is giving real practical skill sets and kind of a a study workflow for when you're reading the Bible and you hit a word that intrigues you sure you want to do more what do you do what's like the next steps but it's a good habit to get into cuz overtime you'll begin to build up a cross-cultural encyclopedia in your own mind which then makes all of us better humans can see the world through threats of heart wider sense of the world and different human experiences but also it can help us track with an understand these ancient Israelite Jewish text the God has chosen this vehicle to tell us a unified story that Lisa Jesus offers wisdom for the whole world through the Bible they might come across words or phrases that seem a little odd to them that could be a flag that he maybe this means something different than we think it means and so at that point you can either go into full
 studymode looking at a concordance or an Interlinear or you could pull out a couple different translations side-by-side and read through that way or you could even just flag like if you're reading the word righteousness and you're like I don't really know what that means actually you just keep reading and paying attention to where that word shows up then slowly developing your encyclopedia to understand that word better equivalent to like what you could do with your three-year-old daughter that scenario us know what she means when she says I'm boring is tracks through through Reading Romans big long complicated letter but just make notes of every time the word righteousness occurs and try and build up a portrait of it and you're mine and some will be easy if you like okay I think I get though the other cases we like I don't know how that works here could mean three things welcome to the wonderful world of studies isn't that an interesting word we're like
 it's translated into different ways an English translated Justice sometimes it's a whole different translations relations order know the original root word underneath the app to make righteous but are none of our translate to English translation so we have multiple English words that are mapping on what is an l and it's one and we don't realize like that's a little Torah study with an Interlinear what is 1 most surprising Hebrew words for you interesting okay well here is one that I I need to do a little more work on but fascinating when the first words in the Bible is Hebrew word butter to soften translated to create what's interesting
 is that you know what God does in the course of the chapter is separate things so there is a handful of uses of that same route verb Bara where it means to cut there's a use and Joshua use in a zequiel couple uses and Ezekiel maybe when it has a guy for the word means to split or cut and it's fascinating because that's what God is doing this one closely connected to this idea of separating separating Phantom like Semitic dictionary research things going on there cuz some people think it's a separate verb has two uses of interests separate verb but I may not be him a big lead and led kind of thing two different words are spelled with the same letters I think I've been
 enriched by studying the word love the way the word love is employed specially in Deuteronomy is a combination of features that's different than my English conception of love and it's an action word as much to do with loyalty at the Des to do with emotion so things like that some of my deepest learnings about God myself and others have come from doing word studies of yours and it's just such a rich rewarding Habit to form and so are the easiest ways to become aware of the Bible as a cross-cultural text Mia are you curse any surprising he realized I can't think of any off the top of my head that that stand out but what I am thinking is just how many full it is to try to understand what these really theologically packed words means that we're really used to hearing and so maybe we adopt without really
 play been thinking about what they mean like Faith or belief and that is what I've been studying recently like what does what is Faith what is trust what is belief and his righteousness is is a star blows words yeah Grace what is Grace I think I like those because we read these passages and can feel really strongly about him and know that they're really important but they have all these words in them that those words become so hard to explain in English you know like the way we're just so used to him as other words were like atonement or righteousness and you're like that word so it's kind of like a Bible word what that means so studying biblical words is one of the easiest challenging ways to get yourself into studying the Bible at a deeper level and then we'll look next at another aspect of being cross-cultural
 yeah and that's more of a broad range of cultural context of the vaulters and the one of the most rich rewarding areas for me learning this has been a set of what do you say cross cultural Dynamics people call it honor shame and cultures that refers to a whole package of cultural values that the biblical authors held from their settings it's so different then our meaning the three of us sitting here in modern West Coast America will understand in that culture also impacts how we understand these individual words it's true they're just there like I'm thinking of the word Grace or guest in an honor shame Society it's a really rich theological word but it means something totally different and then our shame culture so I think what we'll unpack some bigger the broader concept of ancient cultural context some good examples of it and then how do you begin to deal with that and waste forward that are hopefully a simple
 getting out of Interlinear for looking things up a lexicon but often if there's a little more homework at fault we just sitting at your culture and so I think that's what we're going to talk about next thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we continue our conversation on the Bible as ancient literature by looking at a few different cultural assumptions in the Bible that are different than the coach reception that we have today I just listed out just by not cuz these are the five best for the certainly they're not the five only different cultural assumptions could have called his half I have found in my experience when people have friction points with the Bible for you. Part they don't understand where that they don't like it's very often that there is a difference of background assumptions that work here's another one collectivism vs. individualism the biblical a service Express the more collectivist view other terms have been used corporate thinking but this is basic view about the human individual and their place within a larger group who so modern West
 readers have been shaped by our heritage that's just a few hundred years old that thinks primarily in terms of the individual liberty in the will and the autonomy of the individual we treat the wheel of the individual as a very important center within our societies and that's very unique in human history we have one more question response episode coming and so if you'd like to get your question in we'd love to hear from you record yourself asking your question try to keep it to around 20 or 30 seconds I just know your name where you're from and it's send that question to info at bible project. And if you could transcribe your question in your email that's really helpful for us today show was produced by Cooper pelts our editors are Frank Garza and Zach McKinley senior editor is Dan double the show notes are by Lindsey Potter and the theme music by the band tense Bible project is a non-profit our mission is to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything that we make is free because of the generous of her
 how many people just like you thank you so much for being a part of this with us and I'm from Calgary Canada but I live in the Central Coast of Australia I first heard about Bible project a number of years ago through their read scripture series at a critical juncture when I was trying to figure out if I truly believe in what the Bible and the Christian Faith said my favorite thing about Bible project is how it dismantles the unhelpful paradigms we built around the Bible and reshape them around what is actually being said there
 project is the creative imagery in a video we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus Bible project calm
