firstborn is a theme in the Bible about how God consistently chooses to work with and blast the least likely people in her last episode we looked at the story of Samuel the firstborn son of Hannah a humble barren woman who begs God for a son for years. Here's her and bless her with Samuel who becomes Israel's priest Prophet judge and Story of Hannah the lowly is exalted today we pick up where we left off with the story of Samuel he's an old man now and the people of Israel look around and realize that all the other nations have powerful Kings to rule them and so they beg Samuel to anoint a king for them this request deeply upset Samuel because up until now Yahweh has been is it okay to ask for the type of power that other nations have well that's the same thing as a Dollar Tree throughout the Book of Judges whenever danger came on the scene Yahweh Spirit would just pick somebody and
 what you're getting for Jasper but what a king is is like hey we can make our own institution with the guy at the head and then that guy can protect us and that's the shift in Legions that's happening here in the story and it's being equated to the sin of the golden calf Yahweh tell Samuel to give his real what they want and so they end up with Saul as their very first case he's tall is handsome is good with the sword he looks like the ideal Choice the kind of person we want to have a charge you didn't know he's not the first born as such he is the first place over Israel and he's clearly the one that the people value but God sees it as idolatrous from the start the whole story of the rise and fall of Saul then is to this case study in the failure of human eyeballs to deliver this brings us to the story of David Shepherd boy who lives in the Hills that small overlooked for the youngest and his family the least like
 candidate to king of Israel what makes someone be the right person to be in charge what qualifies someone for power is it that they're tall or they come from a good family so it really this is a theme about humans are really poor judges of knowing what is truly valuable and good and should be set above in this case positions of authority today to Mackey and I talked about the theme of the firstborn in the story of Israel's First Kings of John Collins you listening to Bible project podcast takes returning us here we go
all right Tim John we are smack dab in the middle of a theme or calling the theme of the firstborn and it's really a theme about power how does God deal with institutional power structures whether that's within families or within cities we have really gotten much the cities yet but I think we're going to get into that territory today a little bit perhaps but the first born is the idea of the ancient practice of giving the rights of your rule and often a like a double portion of inheritance to one favored child which is the one that showed up first your first born right child and how to read the whole story of the Bible God is messing with in adapting and doing also
 Maneuvers with this practice and kind of messing with us as we think about what does it mean for us to have God's power through on his behalf so that was interesting is the idea first born son's and then later born son's that's kind of some of the first story special in Genesis with Cain and Abel and Jacob and Esau Joseph and his brothers like that where these teams really get rolling but even within Genesis itself we call that the theme to get to broaden out to other situations to like rival wives of Rachel and Leah were Sarah and Hagar and then if you go on throughout the Hebrew Bible it's contrasting how God consistently identifies with and elevates the one of lower social status like the Israelites in slavery over Pharaoh in Egypt
 what are enfranchised in Imperial power so you get all these contrasts were like in the last conversation we had about Hannah and Eli you have this contrasts between rival wives one who has children and one who doesn't but then also this contrasts between like an old priest of high social rank in the community and then this young woman who doesn't have any children and she who gets accused of acting like she's drunk in public and but actually God's favor is with her and God is going to bring down high and mighty old priest Eli and Elevate the son of this woman to become the new priest and leader of Israel so it begins with the first born and that's what the video when mostly focused on but in these conversations we've been following the theme the firstborn is one way of the many ways that God challenges human structures of power and sore
 in value and submits them to accomplish as well in the world not really his like the metal thing with the word racing theme to me it seems like it comes to some sort of had here because now as Israel has been like in the land for a while and the power has just been shifting from one kind of tribal leader to the net yet right and it's not very organized and they're looking around and they're like man all these other nations around us after we have one guy one guy who's like he's got the power and it's like the ultimate patriarch it's the old two men like power broker who then passes on his power to his son's been so they want to like your job
 yeah so we're going to look at today is the story of the rise of the kingship in the story of Israel that leads to King David and we're going to find all of the themes we've been talking about the language in the vocabulary at all gets recycled here in the David story but in a really of course there's always a twist with a Revival in a really creative and Powerful wet so we just dive in and stuff so we're going to actually first to touch down before David comes onto the scene and that is in 1st Samuel 8 the key transition for Samuel 1 27 is all about the rise of Samuel and he is used by God to rescue Israel from the Philistines first Samuel chapter 8 we read
 and it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons as judges over Israel so just right there so Samuel you know it was a man who was really shaped by powerful encounters with God starting as a young boy and he's legit you know he's a great biblical character he's been faithful to God to lead the people so we're fast-forwarding from when we were introduced to Samuel in our last conversation as a child born of Hannah that's right who then was dedicated to be a pseudo priest like a Nazarene kind of the Priestly assistant that got adopted into the but thank God Elevate him above Eli and Eli scrub Sons she had the high priest Eli I got a reversal of sons and got elevated Samuel over those guys and now just watch how this is going to work
 is legit like where the story about Samuel if he's been awesome so it comes about when Sammy was old and that he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel so like you just said this is where is real to Federation of tribes in the land which is basically what they were in Joshua Book of Joshua and in the Book of Judges so it's really it's the Federation of tribes living in the Hill Country and so God throughout the Book of Judges raised up different tribal leaders from different tribes for different periods of time to leave the people are rescue them from their enemies and so on and so now Samuel has been that guy
 and now he's old and so he's going to pass it on to his son in the right there there's something happening because the assumption is this patriarchal tradition of the father passing on to his sons and then it's kind of Power Authority so there's two now the name of his firstborn son was so he's in ha yeah yeah yo L Billy Joel you're that bad really Ono Jim Gaffigan bed he was performing in Ireland somewhere and what are the sound Engineers as he was kind of getting ready for the show was like hey
 you know I love that American Billy Joe and I forgot what he was saying to notice the narrator's drawing attention to the name of the first born so we're we're in that territory again so we have two sons and they were judging in Be'er Sheva but his sons did not walk in their father's ways they turned aside to dishonest gain and they took bribes and perverted justice so we're at that piece that part of the firstborn Motif which is hereditary Authority being passed down doesn't equate 2 character like the fact that the father had a good character doesn't mean that his sons well and Sunday I have this Authority being passed on to people who aren't fit for it so the elders
 come together and they say the Samuel look your old man and your son's well they're not like you so appoint a king for us to judge us you know like all the other nations
 so it's interesting here is that one of them Otis is good like these guys aren't like you yeah but you've been legit and Samuel but your kids are not going to work so but what they asked for isn't just like let's pray that God would raise up a new judge what they want is an institution and what they wanted the king and the their other part of their motive is really clear so that we can be like all the other nations now I feel like there's been times in the Torah where we've been warned against a king yeah that should be ringing in our ears like a king yeah that's not that's not smart yes in fact this story is hyperlink verbatim to the section of the Torah that you're thinking of John gold star man could chill hyperlinking it up Deuteronomy
 17:14 when you enter into the land which the Lord your God gives you and you possess it and live in it and you say I want to set a king over me like all the other nations who are around me you shall set a king over you whom Yahweh your God chooses and goes on to talk about the qualifications for that King so definitely y'all wait until I saw this coming weekend of course they're like you know the group of people in the land so is this the passage that talks about the king like not multiplying his riches and being a Bible in there and that he shouldn't multiply horses that is tanks or definitely don't go back to Egypt your former and slavers to buy tanks that has horses you shouldn't multiply wives implicit in there is
 treating women like property which is definitely not a Garden of Eden idlo but also political alliances and religious alliances it's all woven in here and also doubt increase silver and gold basically the three things that all the money sex and power is kind of what we're after here rather he should be a Bible nerd make his own copy of the Torah and just read re-read that all the days of his life hanging out with the priests okay so that's what's tricky here is one of the motives is good like your sons are like you Samuel but their solution to that and the other motive for their solution you're supposed to just know I like more of this is this is not probably the best thing
 so what's the dynamic are literally it was raw it was evil or bad in the eyes of Samuel when they said give us a king and so Samuel prayed to Yahweh and you always said to Samuel listen to the voice of the people
 with regard to all they say to you because they haven't rejected you rather they've rejected me from being a king over them this is what they've been doing since the day I brought them up out of Egypt to this day in that they keep forsaking me to serve other gods
 and they're doing it to you too so then listen to their voice however you should warn them and tell them what the customs of a king are who will reign over them
 so as fascinating yeah what's what's that saying here's it seems like God is saying that by asking for a king there's in some ways seeking after other gods is that right that's exactly right this little paragraph for Samuel 8 verses 7 through 9 it's a three-part speech at the low mirror symmetry and so in the first part it's listen to the voice of the people they haven't rejected you they reject me the last part of the speech is listen to the people but warn them about what the king will do and then in the middle of those two is a listen this is just a replay of what they've been doing since the golden calf which is forsaking me to serve other gods the speech is setting this requested the people
 an analogy to the request of the people at Mount Sinai to make the golden calf cuz this Moses we don't know what happened to him but we don't know where he is so let's like have some other right let's make for ourselves and our team who will go before us that's super important for the story yeah because the connection is power it's a it's like who's going to protect us who we give our allegiance to who will be the one who Texas yeah so I mean the analogy is throughout the Book of Judges whenever danger came on the scene you always spirit will just pick somebody and raise them up you know like a Gideon or gesture or a roast in the oven
 or shamgar in all these all these are named and described in the Book of Judges but what a king is is like a we can make our own institution and then like with a guy at the head and then that guy can protect us and that's the shift in Allegiance that's happening here in the story and it's being equated to the sin of the golden calf so fascinating that because that the Elohim they rule through kingdoms and Kings like yeah and my biblical imagination like Nebuchadnezzar he's like the manifestation of the king for a battle on and so he had worshipped the god of Babylon we could also worship Nebuchadnezzar and those two ideas I can kind of connected in the famous story of Shadrach Meshach in Abednego with the image that going down to the inner they wouldn't.
 On to the image of the great king of Babylon and so on so that's exactly right and ideally kings are humans and humans are an image of God and so in that sense they are called to be representations of God's rule but here the human kingship institution Israelites want to put into place is there golden calf
 so it's interesting how these things come together but notice so you have a guy Samuel whose first born and second born are the rulers in his place and God is going to bring them down just probably like Eli in the priest before them but what the people want to replace Samuel and his sons with is like no better I think that's the point you measure yeah it's interesting because the idea of humans ruling is a good thing but it seems like hear the idea is that wanting a king isn't about wanting to be the image of God it's about God saw it as them saying you know what we can't really trust you always rule over us we need and its tuition we need our own thing and that's pretty much the same as like going and just making idols and that's just that's interesting I'm trying to wrap my mind around that and there's a thread to pull
 Karen will do that some totally totally when and if we make a scene video on idolatry which we have to this story will be at the center of it because this is the story of the origin of kingship in Israel and you're as you work through especially in the first Samuel 9 through 15 and which is the story of saw the whole story is setting his rise and fall an analogy with the Israelites and their failure with the golden calf in Egypt in other words the narrator retelling the story of the origins of kingship in Israel is trying to show us that it was an act of idolatrous Miss trust from the very beginning 40 what's funny is because often times in biblical scholarship the book of Samuel is referred to as like ancient Israelite propaganda for the monarchy it is real and you're just like
 wow like we're we're missing some serious signals here cuz it's a it's an indictment of the monarchy it's not propaganda for it's the opposite but anyway is that depends on the assumptions you have if you go into the store is in the first place
okay so what happens is Samuel then gives this long speech about listen if you want a king here's what Kings do they're going to raise your taxes they're going to take all your children and co-opt them into their armies or bakeries
 and he's going to like take all your fields and all all of your Harvest and make your children into slaves and you're going to cry out cuz of this King that you say that you want and he always not going to answer you that is he's going to let you have what you want you going to give you what you chosen but the people say no no they refuse to listen there will be a king over us so we can be like the other nations so that this King can go out before us and fight our battles
 and you like what that has been doing and you so if you can get the idea here so this is this been the story about the rise of King Saul and this whole story to tell and we don't have time to go into bed except that the first thing we were told about Saul is that he's super handsome and from his shoulders up he was more tall than any of the other Israelites like a giant he's like one of the Nephilim do you think you think you're supposed to think of him as a giant I mean that's interesting I was imagine the Giants being like like not just a head taller than everyone can you know well sure that the narrative is drawing attention to from his shoulders up he was taller than any other Israelite you may be a good giant at the moment you know but we're clearly connecting to the like the huge people theme you know that began with the Nephilim back in Genesis even back then being taller at me cuz that's the case today I think it's been
 what is the show that you're taller on average make more money so that's interesting up like that the narrator calls saw he's from the line of quiche in The Tribe of Benjamin and he was a mighty warrior A Gabor which is also what the Nephilim recalled in Genesis 6 yeah okay so he is being compared to a giant Nephilim kind of guy saw him as a new Adam and Eve and all of his choices like all hyperlink to the moment at the tree in Eden and a bunch of other things in Genesis and it's all about his failure to you no take up this opportunity to rule as an image of God
 and you make some really bad choices that culminate with him making a bad choice on the seventh day in 1st Samuel 15 and we don't have time don't have time to get into it but it's a good example of he didn't know he's not the first born as such he is the first king is placed over Israel and he's clearly the one that the people value but God sees it as idolatrous from the start by comparing them to A A Gabor or a Nephilim that's all connected to the idea of Kings right like these were that the Mighty Warriors were the other nations Kings they were there like God Kings Gilgamesh and Nimrod and all that bunch
 so the whole story of the rise and fall of Saul then is this case study and the failure of human Idols to deliver Sunshine by the time you get to the end of the first Samuel chapter 15 you get to this line and verse 11 where the word of the Lord came Samuel and said I I tried to do this in English I regret that I have made Saul king that's a new American Standard but it's that same word that's used with Moses in the flood narrative and the story of Moses where God relents from the destruction that he was going to bring about and here he relents from allowing Israel to have solid as their King if so interesting so basically says that the kingdom is going to be torn away from you
 because you didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh and so that's how is 4 Samuel 15 ends this the famous line in first 28 the Lord has torn the Kingdom of Israel from you today saw and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is more Tove than you did more good than you and the old house the next door the end it's the story of the anointing of David for Samuel 16 so you can see the progression hear God is already now brought down the mighty not first born by the mighty first king
 if so does we're going to see David is both the youngest son
 being elevated over his brothers but he's also the second king who gets elevated over the first king so it's like this clever he's like the back of King has to be squatty all right so that's the setup I took us a while but all the scenes of the firstborn you know getting overturned by God's purpose are already at work and now the story of David astori is Joyce first name is 16 to the Lord said Samuel how long will you grieve over Saul since I have rejected him from being King over Israel still up your horn with oil and go since you know exactly cuz we all have like a big empty ram horns hanging on her wall
 the Philippines oil and go. I will send you to Jesse the bethlehemite that is a guy named Jesse who is in the town of Bethlehem for I have an ass has selected a king that has the word see it's the same use of the word see that Abraham uses when Isaac asks where is the Lamb for the offering and Abraham answers God will see to it
 or piss off translate to provide but it's the word see he will see it
 and so we got what is that different than the word see when it shows up like you saw the fruit to see and site is a kiki word repeated all over the chapter that's why I'm drawing attention to it here so we got says is I have seen a king for myself among the sky Sons
 and Samuel says how can I go when stall hears about it he's going to kill me so yeah he's like he knows Saul now and he knows that solves one of those things where if he hears of a coup attempt you know it's just the Assassins come and eat like a typical typical King Behavior so the Lord said I'll have her with you and stay I've come to sacrifice to Yahweh here in your town so invited Jesse to the sacrifice and I will make you see what you shall do you will annoy for me the one who am I say to you so Samuel Dead with the Elders of the city came trembling out to meet him and said you come and Shalom note where are they worried I think it's kind of one of those things where like it's a certain authority figure shows up at your house it's not a sign of
 you know what I mean yeah totally I never having that feeling usually cuz I thought they were there for me which was often anyway he said I've come to sacrifice to the Lord make yourself wholly and come with me big sacrifice tonight which means member sacrifice always means leftover meat and a big party and a feast so he made sure to make the Jesse and his sons holy so that they can fight them to sacrifice so it's interesting if you get invited to one of these sacrificial meals you need to go through like a purity process to make sure you go like wash yourself in the Mikvah in the pool and abstain from don't eat anything unclean that day or something
 yeah I'm thinking back to her Holiness video and all the ritual things that make you clean or unclean or Pure or in pure which is a way to set yourself apart to be able to engage in a sacred kind of
 Ikea so when you sacrifice an animal in what is Leviticus these are called The Fellowship offering to the peace offerings the purpose is one to say thank you to God but you say thank you to God by offering up some of the animal that the majority of it you keep and then invite a bunch of people to a holy party that's just a big sacred Thanksgiving party to Yahweh can you celebrate by eating as much meat as you can cuz it's rare and it's not going to keep going to keep so everybody come to the party and when Jesse innocence come in so so good Samuel saw there's that word again he saw
 who is Jessie's first born son and he thought surely you always anointed this before him now but y'all way said to Samuel do not look there's that word again don't look at his appearance
 and that word appearance is exactly the word used of the tree of knowing good and bad in Genesis 3 when the woman saw that the tree was good of appearance
 and desirable for gaining wisdom and desirable for eating she took of the tree and she ate so that that word appearance is that the key link word here so that parents what's the word in Hebrew is the noun and it's been noun of the verb which is to see where to look at sundown so to be seen exactly the things seen parents it's like what one looks like when other see you so don't look at his yep the threat the whole point is Ellie off who's the firstborn of Jesse has an appearance he looks a certain way and he's about to say what he says don't look at his appearance or the height of his stature is exactly the same words used as tall as him being high in stature above any other is remind
 so don't look at him or his height because I rejected him
 that's the key word just use the saw in the previous story I rejected him as king over Israel I miss something eliava is it described as which son is just one not yet you'll learn as this good Hebrew narrative style where the key information is left to the very end of the story first born are not what you know is he's the son of Jesse and that is two pennies told me it is really tall Mike saw and God is rejected him likes all the really tall guy so don't let The Disappearance of the height of the Statue because I rejected him and then this next line really is the heartbeat of our firstborn theme video like it's being put into one line right here for God
 does not see as humans see for humans see the outward appearance but Yahweh sees the heart like this, okay this is what we've been talking about power I've been using that word a lot here the vocab is seeing
 and it seems to be that there's a little bit of a connection here between the desire for power and this this idea of how we see things and especially as it relates to this disk or narrative where that we first introduced to this vocab with Eve seeing the fruit that is desirable and will make her wise right. That's what it says it's right it's good for eating and it's just beautiful there's something about our propensity to look at something and to go over that thing's going to be good for me I'm going to take it and usually that impulse is around power or desire influence or but the desire is could be a desire just to enjoy it
 but here the like the idea is about protecting ourselves about who's going to be in charge of power but also what's at stake is the criteria of how do you know what makes someone be the right person to be in charge qualifies someone for power is it that they're tall yeah come from a good family is that the value and it's the same idea of what qualifies a piece of fruit to be good is it that it's tasty and the fruit here being a metaphor for gaining wisdom like how are you going to get wisdom and how do you judge
 that thing that you think's going to bring you wisdom it's a parent's exactly what was at stake with Samuel and his sons he just assumed what are my sons and my first born son so yeah they deserve to have the authority and the people are like no a king deserves to have all the authority and gods like no and no. Says I'm going to choose a king and no Eliana certainly deserves to have the authority and God's again like no not that guy really this is a theme about humans are really poor judges of knowing what is truly valuable and good and should be set above as like the most important or in the positions of authority rights could go One Direction of like what do I desire the other things could go the same thing can go in a direction of
 who do I want to rule back in Genesis when Abraham and Sarah are faced with the choice of we want the Sun God said we would have a son how do we get a son and so Hagar becomes you know they see her they take her they do what's good in their eyes so there's about a desire for security and family in abundance where is here that's desire for power and self-protection security is being set on Knology to the golden calf and the tree so humans have a way of thinking they know what is good for them but actually you don't know Samuel what y'all way looks at is the heart of the individual and so what y'all we knows is that of all the Suns there's actually only one who is really going to be qualified for the task
 at least for a little while and hearts and Hebrew is not like it down complete parallel to how we think of heart and English but there's a lot of similarities we talked about the heart of a matter meaning like the like the center of the core and so to that degree it relates layup at the heart and Hebrew as I understand it is like this is the kind of culminated culminating hidden like a part of you that's not just your emotions but it's also about your intellect it's every its everyday of you but it said you have that it's in the core and it's hidden and it really at the core of even intellect and emotion is desire and will the heart is associated with what one wants and then the purposes one comes up with to achieve what one wants which is very similar to how we use the word heart but we have also uses of the word heart that aren't really like
 what he broke heart is in fact we made a video about this is a powerful little line it's one of the few times you get a really condensed statement of God's reason for constantly overturning these structures of human power and value in Authority that embodied in the right of the firstborn
so do I keep going Jesse called abinadab is apparently another son and made him pass before Samuel and he said the Lord has not chosen this one next Jesse made Sharma pass by and he said the Lord has not chosen this one either Jesse made Seven of his sons test for Samuel and Samuel said to Jesse the Lord has chosen none of these so Samuel said Jesse are these all the boys
 and he said well there Still Remains The New American Standard reads the youngest is the Hebrew word Catan which means smallest and it can be used to refer to a younger son like Jacob is called this in contrast to Esau who's called the bigger sound and smaller son and it's kind of ironic because you saw was kind of like one of these give Orion you know his big animals big hairy hairy dude and Jacob was a smooth man but for sure there's a contrast here between big tall is oldest brother and then youngest smallest David the youngest brother so there's still the small one and look you know he's out keeping the sheep and Samuel said to Jesse I'll send him we will not sit down until he's here and so he sent and brought him in and he was
 I don't know why this is so funny ready and standard reads his lips yeah I think I've ever used that word look at the NIV he was glowing with health New Living Translation he was dark and handsome Park in half of a witch it's the form of the Hebrew word atom which is what he thought it's called when he he's red red red but it means he has a dark complexion so
 yeah the dark and handsome that comes from Rudy and Beautiful cuz he says beautiful beautiful eyes is the next line really dark complexion but bright beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance so he also has an appearance and actually that handsome appearance but this handsome appearance is going to be part of his downfall like way later in the story when he takes a woman forces himself Bashi the forces himself on her and then it's going to be his handsome beautiful son Absalom who's going to form a coup to overthrow his dad because of the Cascade of events that come from that adultery and murder so even right here as you're introduced to him you're given a little clue for word to like his downfall
 later on I'm going to say is that interesting yeah but for the moment he's just a dark handsome dude but he is he is the small one so and juxtaposition he is the youngest brother he wasn't even thought of in the lineup and he's like small so you kind of get this juxtaposition with that but then when he shows up your like I'm in Disguise and I got some swag and right now I'm not saying it's negative I think it's ambiguous for the moment but usually cuz also this is how this is exactly the same phrase used to describe Joseph in the Book of Genesis beautiful of form and handsome of a parent's is beautiful and handsome of the parents are kind of all kinds really elaborate hyperlinks between the story of Joseph in the story of David they set them on an LG to each other but anyway I'll have to say is right now it's a good thing it's not a
 so when this guy shows up with a dark complexion bright eyes and handsome guy says Get Up Samuel anoint him he's the guy so Samuel took the Horn of oil anointed him in the midst of the brothers and the spirit of Yahweh came on him mightily with power from that day forward and so the whole story now I was going to be about David's slow rise to power never taking it waiting for y'all way to bring him to the kingship which bitten parallel to the slow Decline and Corruption of Esau throughout the rest of the story of Samuel so we can take our leave of it for the moment you know but I think the point being made here is so relevant to our bigger it seemed in this conversation about the first born I think what's
 lingering in my mind right now is we could spend hours now just thinking about the life of David and how he uses his power and I'm sure there's tons we could go through and just this theme of God choosing the lesser the unexpected and giving them power what I've been trained to notice now by reading these texts with you especially in Genesis is there's so many twists and turns and so here you've got the people want a king that's problem God lets them have a king it's the guy you would think you would want by the parents and he's strong and he's tall and then God
 says that's not actually the guy we're going to find I'm going to show you the guy and he's hidden away in the hills and he's the guy you wouldn't expect and right there it's kind of like at the core of God's choosing the Lesser unexpected and it feels like right in the center lane of the same but it seems like as we've been going to read the life of David even that gets turned upside down and stretch to Twisted and it's not as simple as goddess chooses the unexpected and then things go well because he knows you know it's like I think what you said at some point conversations is or maybe this was just when we were Drafting and writing scripts that just because God gave the lesser the power it doesn't solve the power Dynamic problems in a sibling rivalry problems exactly it almost like lays them bear even more so and and like exaggerate them something
 video we kind of work this in cuz relax sometimes it's the jealousy of the older brother or the person in a place of power status and they get jealous and angry and they act violently towards the one God has chosen sometimes you get a younger one who wants the position of the firstborn like ham or Ruben and so they grab it after it and that creates all kinds of conflict and then other times yet another twist is the one that God does choose who's the lower one the one of those status or the second born when that one is given the honor and responsibility they eventually abuse it themselves and corrupt it and that's the pattern of like of a Jacob
 or of sometimes Abraham and then in this case of David where he does good for a while but then he really blows it and then it all just comes crashing apart and it's about cycling this is just how the Hebrew Bible works it's just story after story after Story of like you're somebody who tries to be an image of God and kind of works but also really doesn't so here's another story and it just as the tension builds I think that is the momentum that turns into the Messianic hope of the Hebrew Bible a projecting forward of the kind of human firstborn we really need or at least the one whom God will Elevate whether he's the firstborn or not we just need a human who will like not be a chump and the David story fits into that pattern so sounds like we're kind of learning this two key insights here with this thing and one is that God's going to subvert our structures
 and so don't get cozy and don't just take what you expect and let's relearn power and an upside-down way but then the second inside it is in spite of that we're so screwed up that like will find a way to the store power in any situation and man do we need someone who doesn't do that someone who will be so empowered by the spirit of God and knows the spirit gets introduced here in the David story in a really important way someone who is so in tune with the will of God by being connected to God through the presence and power of God spirit that they actually
 what represent God's Authority and power but in a way that truly gets life instead of creates just another time on the Merry-Go-Round of The Human Condition
 in Isaiah chapters 1 through 12 which is the first important kind of litter a bundle of the scroll there's this hope of it coming King will deliver Israel and bring Justice to the Nations and and Isaiah chapter 11 this is the poem we read many times over the years
 but relevant right now. King is described as a little branch that will spring up out of the stem or the stock of Jesse we just read a story about him he's not mentioned many times in the Hebrew Bible and you just read the story was missing the first time and he is being mentioned again so here is the father of Davis father David So Jesse is being referred to as like a thick stock of like a plant
 and there's going to be a new little offshoot of it so I could just keys in other words this future hoped for King
 won't just be a new son of David like the Kings from the line of David what you actually want is a new David got a new son of Jesse not a son of David Son of Jesse
 and a branch from his roots will bear fruit eaten fruit of the spirit of the Lord the new David will be the new David will be like a branch bearing fruit and the spirit of the Lord will rest on that branch and spirit of wisdom understanding Spirits Council strength knowledge in the fear of the Lord the poem goes on to say he will rule with Justice he will bring Fair Justice for All the Poor Afflicted in the land and he'll slay the Wicked with breath of his lips we're going to have Garden of Eden when this guy shows up I mean Yelawolf spilling with Lambs
 and leopards with young goats down nowhere in the Garden of Eden story does it talk about how animals behave with each other no but they're naming the animals presumably they're not like eating each other as a desktop
 and also the ark with the animals in the ark is another image of humans and animals all together at peace peace so good in case you didn't get the Eden images and the nursing child will play by the whole of the Cobra and the weaned child will put his hand into the Viper's Den
 so even the snake even the snake will have power and yeah totally and the seed of the woman will be able to play with the snake come on that's good they will not hurt they will not destroy in all my Holy Mountain to notice out of the cosmic eating Mountain kind of being brought up here for the land will be filled with knowing your way like the waters cover the sea that will be a good day okay so that's your expecting a king from the wine of Jessie
 bring about the new Eden so this is a team that gets developed throughout the book as you go I mean it's really skipping forward but in later sections of the book this expected King starts getting called the servant he calls in my servant and this is the famous suffering servant poem of Isaiah 53 and I just want to read the opening lines and I think about two things look like police they do for me now so the poem begins with God introducing his servant and he says look my servant will prosper
 he will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted plus pause this is about power and exaltation yeah this is like humans in Genesis 1 and image of God that exalts to rule over the land so I got has a servant that he's going to elevate and rule over the land
 I'm going to switch translations here 14 just as many what are you right now I'm in the lexham English Bible which out for a while but I've been starting to use more it's one of the only English translations that in the Old Testament has the Divine name said y'all way instead of Lord so if you wish that you had a Bible that said Yahweh instead of Lord alessan things Bible verse for you so just as many were appalled at you so was his
 who's the Deep rabbit hole on Hulu that you it seems like the you is referring to the people of Israel and that Israel's shame and disgrace that being defeated an exiled among the Nations is going to be set on analogy to how this servant is going to be viewed so just as many were appalled that you most likely do you like Exile defeated Israel Refugee Israel such was his appearance appearance
 Beyond human disfigurement his form was marred beyond the sons of men he was not Rudy not ready and handsome of the parents rather he was like he looked like a ruined disfigured human is fascinating in other words the one that God has chosen to rule the Nations is the one who liked his people Israel is a defeated disfigured like trashed people group but nobody thinks is important anymore. Going to look at him and go that's the guy that's the fruits and that's why has the appearance that I'm looking for her but I thought about the Israelites that he conquered and hauled off in Chains right to Babylon
 like nobody was looking at the people of Jerusalem and saying
 in this people group is contained in the future seed that God will use to rescue the cosmos in the story from the Viewpoint of the biblical authors and so just as many people were appalled at you is real God's servant is considered like just a ruin to still get human
 but for 15 he will be the one to sprinkle many nations is that have to do with purification this is exactly the word I'd use. What the priest does on the day of atonement in the holy of holies wrinkling Blood on the on the holy of holies in the Ark of the Covenant and so in reality this it's the guy who's going to reconcile and purifying bring New Creation to the cosmos and because of him carrying he's the high priest has of him Kings will shut their mouth because what they will see is something that has never been told them before and they'll consider with full attention something that they've never heard before to do they like to like
 consider another position that they've never heard before I think what it is God is going to do something that will turn upside down human expectation in value the not even the most powerful rulers of the land side coming but they won't know how to respond when they hear the story of this inversion of what humans think is important and see that the god of Israel the god of creation Universe has Associated himself with the lowly in the suffering to save the universe is we'll just spend every category that you have and the next line goes on to say yeah who's going to believe this message that's so funny that's the exact thing I was asking myself like what king is going to be is going to like police. The servant and be like woah I never thought of this before
 send this message to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed he that is the servant went grew up like a shoot there's that word for my say 11 like aloe plant or Branch before him like a route from dry ground but he is a servant had no form or Majesty that we should see him and no opinion no appearance that we would allow a pleasure in him
 an old punk goes on to say like we thought he was cursed by God but in reality he was the one who got sent to die for our sins and then to be resurrected and raised out the other side to declare the many righteous that's how the poem ends and to see the buy fan light and Resurrection on the other side so are they 53 is actually reflecting back on this whole theme throughout the whole Hebrew Bible and putting really powerful imagery to it yeah the perfect setup for the gospels now this theme is carried forward in the story of Jesus right you must imagine when Jesus is walking with there's a couple stories where Jesus is like opening scripture with maybe it's just the one story isn't Luke he's walking with let me show you how the Hebrew Bible talks about me and he turned maybe they talked about King David a little bit
 maybe they aren't you know I know maybe they had this kind of conversation to be a fly on the wall is just bringing together all of the cycles of this likely go all the way back to the first page has Jeff and he's just condensing it into this powerful poem that brings all the images together and there's a reason why this poem is kind of Holy Ground in early Christianity Jesus was clearly influenced by the language and ideas here and so were the apostles they constantly quote from the storm and say that it was Jesus in his life death and resurrection that brought all this into reality with the core Motif is that God use as Paul will say God uses the lowly and despised things in the world to shame the wise and strong
 and that's the wisdom and power he sees displayed in Jesus's life death and Resurrection the crucified slave is the king of the cosmos that's he's the ultimate firstborn which is that's where we're going to go next and as we do go there next into the story of Jesus it's just important to see you like the Deep continuity with the theme song of the Hebrew Bible but they get ratcheted up like even more intensely than the story of Jesus so I said that's what we should talk about next pixel listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're exploring the theme of the firstborn in the gospel accounts about Jesus these two ways that Jesus is the son of God one is through his human lineage goes through Joseph Mary and looks back to Adam and that's crucial for him coming as a human to do for humans with no human seems to be able to do but the baptism is revealing the
 other aspect of his identity that in appearing among us as a son of Adam that one is at the same time the Eternal son of the father today's episode was produced by Cooper pelts with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Dan Campbell Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza and Who provided the invitations for our annotated podcast in the rap battle project we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that feeds Jesus everything that we make is free because of the generous support thousands of people just like you thank you so much for being a part of this with us
