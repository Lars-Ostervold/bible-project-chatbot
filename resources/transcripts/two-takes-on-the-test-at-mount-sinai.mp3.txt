John Collins this is Bible project podcast and today Tim Mackie and I get to talk with our friend and Hebrew Bible scholar dr. Carmen I'm coming has been on the podcast before talking about her book bearing God's name why Sinai still matters because she's a good friend of ours and because she has an emphasis on the scroll of exodus in her studies we thought how great would it be to sit down with her at the end of our journey through Exodus and debrief a bit about the things we've been talking about it was wonderful to talk with Carmen but it was also a little discombobulating actually because Carmen presents a few alternative interpretations two stories that we've been reading
 namely the story in Exodus 19 for Israel comes to the base of Mount Sinai God asks them to become rich truly pure and prepare themselves to make a covenant with him as Tim and I talked to you that Story 2 made a compelling case for how Israel was meant to go up the mountain when the trumpets blast and when they don't go up the mountain they've failed the attached big fail to trust God the Carmen is going to give us an alternative perspective on this story and which Israel was never meant to go up the mountain and they passed the test by fearing God and staying at the base of the mountain and sending Moses up instead as an intercessor and so as we listen along as to Hebrew Bible scholars discuss a passage in the Bible and come to fundamentally two different perspectives on what it means if you're like me you might get a little flustered but it's also good to remember that's the vibe
 is meant to be read in community and we're meant to challenge each other
 ideas like this
 as they read scripture together and walk what could be this and it could be this and somehow they were able to sit with more unresolved tensions than we are we want to know like what does it so let's prepare ourselves to sit and some unresolved tension around Exodus 19 and whether Israel was meant to go up the mountain thanks for joining us here we go
all right Carmen I'm thank you for joining us today in this conversation on Exodus mercy so it's been a couple years ago that we actually interviewed you about the book of Exodus even about the same section of the book of Exodus yes and many people in our audience who learned a lot from that learned about your work and really were excited about you so we are excited to have you back on cuz John and I have been talking her way through Exodus and we stacked up some questions that we've been talking to you and I are excited to hear your perspective let's see so maybe it real quick just as a quick bio for those of you who haven't heard that interview in the archives still free we encourage you to go do that but real quick tell us about yourself Carmen and also about recent updates and your family's life story the three of us go way back
 we went to Multnomah Bible College together back in the day so that was our connection and I'm a big fan of the Bible project I used the videos and all my classes so I currently have students in Old Testament history and literature class you are watching I think 40 Bible project videos on taking quizzes on them or they watch them outside of class you guys kept making so many videos I used to show them in class but then there were so many that like there was no time left for me to talk now I've created an outside of the class Dimension where they watch them and take quizzes on our Learning Management platform and it's the consistently their favorite thing about the class is that they they just love engaging visually with a text so that's fun I am associate professor of Old Testament at Biola University so having just moved down here from Alberta where I was teaching at Prairie college for 4 years so I'm I'm in the thick of it with lots and lots of undergrads and love
 get to do great as last time we had you on WE invited you to talk about both your dissertation and your book there in God's name we'll talk about some of these themes from that book today but you have you haven't left the orbit of the book of Exodus you're still there and other projects to working on maybe talk about some of those yes I will be here for a while I'm working on the exit of commentary for the baker commentary on the Old Testament Series so it'll be somewhere around 750 Pages by the time it's done it's a big project and I am just thrilled to get to do it because it's giving me the space to work through things on a detailed level to ask all the questions I want to ask and said she's down all the rabbit trails and I've loved it wonderful when I learned that you were working on that project as John and I have been talking to access racking up our questions we would like let's call Carmen Carmen
 speak into some of these things so yeah we are going to hang out at Mount Sinai as we did last time we had you on but we're going to focus in on some specific things movie be out real quick for those of you who don't know about kind of your first series of projects on Exodus you really zeroed in on both the moment of Israel making a covenant with God at Mount Sinai and that what God calls them like bypass title but also what he calls them to be and do to maybe talk kind of wrap that together that's where we are for this conversation we're parked at the foot of Mount Sinai so talk about those first paragraphs and moments of the story how that connects to one of the Ten Commandments and just talked about that as you mentioned I wrote my dissertation and I wrote my Master's thesis on 1st Peter 2:9 and 10 which is an echo of Exodus 19 so I've really been in these chapters
 or ten years now and just think they're fantastic and I really believe that if we want understand our identity and location as Believers we have to go back to Sinai cuz this is where it really is flushed out so yeah that people arrived at Sinai in Exodus chapter 19 if cross through the desert and the first thing that happens is God speaks to them through Moses and in Exodus 19 verse three he says this is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel you yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried You On Eagle's Wings and brought you to myself now if you obey me fully and keep my Covenant been out of all Nations you will be my treasured possession although the whole earth is mine you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation and those that moment is so important in Israel's development as a nation because it's defining who they are and what they are
 are designed to do what is the vocation that God has for them and that phrase my favorite phrase there is treasured possession which is just one word in Hebrew the word secular and cycle but it's not just a warm fuzzy term that you might use if you really like somebody it's a technical term used in treating context to indicate a special training partner that has a representative role and so God is appointing is route to a special task of representing him among the Nations and that's before they get the law if you know the second half of Exodus is known for having lots of laws before we even get that God makes clear this is who you are you as a nation are wholly your set apart for my service you represent me and my men nation's best-loved okay let's talk about how that connects to this language of kingdom of priests and then also about carrying the name I think because then that tease us up for
 what we would like to do with you which is actually kind of walk through the steps of this Narrative of how God shows up on the mountain and then how they come up to the mountain and then are they supposed to go out there but only Moses so there's things we'll talk about there but all the way back here just this is setting out the ideal picture as it were so he calls Kingdom of priests and that's before he's given them but then he does give them lost and those laws are the means by which they carry out the mission he's just given them to be the treasured possession the Sega light and the kingdom of priests so why is kingdom of priests important well it's very interesting that God would designate an entire nation as having some sort of Priestly status this would be totally unique in the ancient world the idea that everyone in this nation is a priest or that together they function in Priestly ways and so in just a few chapters will meet the actual the people who are designated priest in Israel's Tabernacle Aaron and his son
 and will see that they are they become like a visual model of what the entire nation is supposed to be in do and so the high priest in particular is interesting to watch because he's the best dress is our lights he has this elaborate costume that he wears made with gold and jewels and fancy died Fabrics embroidered Fabric and were told in chapter 28 Exodus chapter 28 is where God gives Moses the instructions for how to make his garments and we're told that he's supposed to Bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart so he's he's got 12 gemstones on his chest each gemstone corresponds to one of the Twelve Tribes as you know there are actually 13 tribes we don't count Levi in this because he himself is a levite so I presume the 12 Stones are the 12 other tribes but anyway he is bearing their names he represents them before y'all way and then he also wears some kind of golden medallion on his for
 and that Medallion is engraved in Hebrew with two words to Dosha yaqui and it's holy belonging to Yahweh is that the meaning of it so it's setting him apart as somebody who's designated by Yahweh for this special task so with that in mind like we can Bend Circle back to their the kingdom of priests if the high priest is representing them between he stands between Yahweh and the rest of the nation as a representative then they as a nation are in a sense standing between Yahweh and the rest of the nation's the rest of the world and having that kind of mediate or you'll roll and presumably they have this will not presumably God tells them they have this representative role until it's as if they are wearing God's name to and so when we get to the Ten Commandments and God says you shall not bear the name of Yahweh or God in vain which is what it actually says in Hebrew bear the name not saw using the same Hebrew
 that's used to describe what the high priest is doing with names on his chest he's not saying the names and they are supposed to Bear the name of y'all way it seems clear to me that that command is not prohibiting them from saying God's name or from using it as a swear word or using it in Osan although we have to think carefully about how we speak God's name the command is much broader than that it's telling them you are my Representatives I put my name on you so represent me well
 Johnny realized I didn't invite you to say hi at the very beginning
 I'm sorry so John and I were talking about this he had interesting question that I wanted to hear your response to that but Johnny was it what about the way that the idea of a kingdom of priests and then there is a family of priests within the kingdom of priests and are those two at odds with each other you had a way of putting it was really helpful and asking that question do you remember asking that question I don't know if I remember the exact question you thinking of was that what conversation was it from where is the idea that begins with the nation of priests they clear they later become a nation with priests and the question is is that is that a lessening of an ideal or is it possible to have a select priesthood and all the nations increase and that's just a happy situation or are we
 to see some kind of idealism that all the people are priests so
 Carmen I'd love to hear your perspective on the priesthood of Israel when I talked with Tim Tim when we talked about the priesthood especially in our series on the priest the Royal priest you make a pretty candid case that the priesthood is a concession and that felt new to me that it wasn't the ideal and here at Sinai is released called to be a kingdom of priests so is the fact that not everyone it is real is now a priest is that a concession or is there an extra something really beautiful and important about the priesthood as doing within his real or is it a little both like hot yeah how do you weave through that will let me admit that I have not listened to all the your priesthood podcast so I don't know at work so good
 so at the risk of disagreeing with Tim which I would hate to do so I think it's interesting that God called them a kingdom of priests and then before the golden calf incident he's already giving instructions for how to build a tabernacle and what the freezer supposed to wear so I feel like in terms of literary design it doesn't seem like it's a concession they're like Gods anticipating the need for it at least and there's something really beautiful about the high priest and and his elaborate garments that he wears that I think then help the nation to see what it is they're supposed to be in do on a broader scale you're saying there's a Harmony between the nation itself envisioning itself as a priesthood and then looking to One Tribe set apart as the Priestly tribe as it were like a visual visual cue
 which of the New Testament and see a similar dynamic because we talked about the priesthood of all believers and yet we do have people who are set apart for Apostolic pastoral Ministry like in leadership roles we have Elders I think that the fact that we all have Priestly Axxess does not get rid of the need for there to be specialist that's a good point actually don't even more to the plan would be Jesus is our high priest but not to the exclusion of his followers being the kingdom of priests write those to work in sync together I've never really thought about that parallelism being parallel to Israel and its price I probably thought about it because of my Master's thesis it because I was hanging out in 1st Peter where he calls them a kingdom of priests kind of looking at that I think the conversation John that you were calling and actually feeds into what will maybe get to if we get to the golden calf today that Aaron is introduced into the Exodus story as you know at the concession
 the Moses's unwillingness to be got mediator before pharaoh and so it's just interesting that Aaron is introduced into the story because of God's anger at Moses and I've just always thought that seems really important that that's when Aaron gets brought up
 start with that because in chapter 4 when Moses is saying no I really really don't want this job like I didn't sign up for this I wonder if part of why I got so angry is because he has already accounted for Moses weakness as a speaker and he's already provided a solution and Moses is failing to trust him for it because he says 4:14 in the Lord's anger burned against Moses and he said what about your brother are in the levite I know he can speak well he is already on his way to meet you and I think one way to read that is God already had this covered and it's that the reason got angry is not that he needs to call Aaron hit already called Aaron but Moses has the one who's failing to trust that God's going to work this out and give him what he needs okay so what you're saying is it because he says Aaron is on his way and plaid because I prompted him something like that to compensate
 for your fourth of Jackson but now with this this objection you're just kind of taking me off you could take it as
 we before he even pre initially read it but then as I was looking at it again it's thinking about really the area of disability like thinking about reading Moses disability the Lord said to him who gave human beings their mouths who makes them deaf or mute who gives them sight or makes them blind is it not I the Lord like God knows Moses intimately and knows what sort of support she's going to need the problem is that Moses doubts his own ability and needs to try so so maybe Aaron was the plan all along when we come back to the developments later but when Ram Mount Sinai I appreciate your perspective that to be a kingdom of priests is not at odds with having a Priestly tribe with high priests that those can all work in sync together
 let's move on to the next step in the story then so God and now you read God's opening words to this realize through Moses after that God invites them to become Covenant Partners if you just listen to me this is an invitation keep my Covenant and you'll you'll be my Representatives so then we're going to make this official I'm going to come down on the mountain in storm and fire cloud and on the third day you're going to hear the Rams Horn and now I'm into Exodus verse 19 12 and 13 verse 13 to introduce a really interesting detail where God says on the third day when the Rams horns sounding let the people come and depending on what translation you read you get a very different sense of what's happening so the new revised Standard Version says let them come up onto the mountain which is I think the most natural way of read
 he protects their many of our other English translation say let them come up to the mountain now. Do it just to it so John and I talked about this at length in the previous episode already but maybe kind of tea iced up what do you see as the interpretive challenges in the story why these translation differences and how have you sorted your way through this challenging story yeah well it's challenging because the people say they don't want to go up the mountain and so then God says okay you can and there seems to be a tension in scripture about whether it was a good idea or bad idea for them to not want to go up the mountain I remember first reading these texts in Bible College and thinking what a missed opportunity they could have gone up the mountain and they didn't and now in Jesus we can and so let's lean into this I think I've shifted on this I think I have a different opinion now than I did when I first read it and I'm basing this opinion on the work of Michael kibbe
 who is the professor of New Testament and academic Dean at Great Northern University he wrote his doctoral dissertation on this conundrum he did his doctor the New Testament so he was looking at the way Hebrews 12 pixelate sorry caps this event so tracing it from Exodus to Deuteronomy and then into Hebrews and he says that this moment verse 13 is a test so you've done a test video you talked about how God's that these tests he believes that this is a test designed to demonstrate Israel's fear of God and that the proper response to an invitation to come up on the mountain where God is just supposed to say no no we can't approach a holy God if that was the right response and that this with Dan sort of galvanized their commitment to obey Moses as a mediator so when they see that Moses can approach God and that they shouldn't that shows both their fear of God and their
 Preston Moses as the mediator and he traces that from Exodus into Deuteronomy and then on into Hebrews kind of show exegetically how it works okay alright so that's good this is a different you're at a different place than where I was taking John to which is wonderful and this is why reading the Bible and Community is so important cuz we can learn from each other so let me say back to you when I'm hearing you say that you summarize Michael key because what God does us right before all of this is listen I'm going to come in and sit Cloud this is Exodus 19 verse 9 is it the people can hear when I speak to you and so they can trust in you permanently so I'm guessing that's where Michael is really he sees that as a preview that this the goal of this is to set up Moses and the people's trust and Moses that's a sold mediator that right yes I can read you a little section here this is from page thirty-two of his dissertation so that
 Terron Sinai in Exodus he says Israel has not consistently demonstrated proper fear of God in the events leading up to Sinai so he's not confident of their ability to respond appropriately to his presence so that the test here is to see whether they will respond appropriately she says the human recipients recognition of the divine presence and subsequent fear is a necessary precondition for moving forward in the story so then he goes on his survey is there seven different options for how to reconcile these you know how could God say this twice or is there a translating it wrong or we know what's going on you talks about sailing hammers approach to it which I'm guessing you're familiar with and shows why he doesn't think that works exegetically I'm but he concludes the contradiction between saying don't come up the mountain come up the mountain is intentional and therefore necessary for the flow of the narrative and it plays a crucial role in the
 in a broader purposes at the mountain which he said were to show fear of God and to establish that mediation is necessary and so when Moses when Moses intercedes for them the narrative is showing that he's ready to move forward as the mediator God appointed him to be and that's jumping ahead to chapter 32 when he intercedes for the people in chapter 32 that's the test of Moses and God's presenting him with a test case should I destroy these people and start over with you so they both get a test Israel gets a test here at the foot of the mountain and they say no we fear God and Moses get the test and 10:32 with hey should I destroy these people and start over with you and he says no I'm going to mediate and so they both passed the test and now we can go forward with the ended mediator interesting this okay at this great so so I'm curious if you work it be so here are the other two things that compelled me in the direction of sale hammers to protection
 not has to do with The Narrative patterning of the story is massively patterned after Abraham's test on Mount Moriah and then Adam and Eve's test on the Eden Mount when God showed up in the Wind of the day and their Adam and Eve hide themselves from God's presence and that's viewed as a sad fear of the Lord who was the came too late and we're as Abraham's decision to go up the mountain and even surrender the life of his seed even though he knew that God said the Nations will be busting my seat so how does that work same kind of seemingly contradiction it seems to contradict yeah but they're for Abraham it's his fear of the Lord is demonstrated by going up the mountain. So what do you think about how those narratives interact with each other cuz it's also becomes a question of how do we interpret later stories when they are at going earlier stories
 in the whole thing I have in the margin of kippy's dissertation how does Middleton's reading change this because he has Kimmy says on page forty-three that Abraham passes the test so he sees the same parallel that you do zebra have passes the test because he fears God enough to obey him when doing so makes no sense in light of previous Revelation Israel passes the test because they fear God so much that they cannot do what he's commanded however Richard Middleton just released a book last year called Abraham silence absolutely mind-blowing so he argues that Abraham failed the test that the test was would you intercede on behalf of your son like he reads the Abraham story in light of the lament Psalms in the book of Jobe where our questioning of God when he when he seems to be acting out of character is held up as a positive thing but we should question God and
 Abraham feels to do this he just slave Ashley obeys and a case where there's a clear contradiction between promise and command and so she shows exegetically like he does care for work through the Abraham story in Genesis 22 to show why this is the case and I'm not going to be able to do it all off the top of my head but his basic point is Abraham is treating God like a Canaanite deity that would require child sacrifice he doesn't even question it and what God wanted him to do was to intercede the way he interceded for Sodom and Gomorrah when he intercedes for Sodom and Gomorrah to get down to what if there's two and righteous but he doesn't go lower than that and so Middleton thinks it here in Genesis 22 that God is asking Abraham to press in and find out that God would make a sacrifice just for one keep negotiating down or keep pressing in to know God better so so yes Abraham shows face but his face
 misplaced he shows that he actually doesn't know Yahweh as over and against other guys so that throws a bit of a wrench in the parallel need to work through his argument a but when he in Genesis 22 when God responds to Abraham and says now I know that you fear God you didn't withhold your own this God so that's not an early notice you don't seem to really know he's so like God God stepped in to save Isaac because Abraham kind of failed to intercede for like okay so you hear me okay we're good but I'm going to go ahead and save your son because otherwise the promise is in Jeopardy and I were two stories.
 talking about Exodus well but this raises an interesting question when you have these narrative patterns what does it mean to read one story in light of an earlier story and how much do you import of the message of under their story into a later story is it just replay or is it a contrast does it invert does it reverse and these are interesting questions cuz the narrator's obviously want us to make these kinds of connections and so the question is how do we so how does the narrator want us to see the people at the mountain is some kind of analogous relationship Abraham in the analogies Adam and Eve and if so what's the comparison and what's the contrast and there's this clear Lucien right back to Genesis because they're not even supposed to touch the mountain which actor is the language of not even touching the tree at Eve says so yeah there's some clear burble parallels so you're persuaded by
 that the people decided not to go up the mountain and to say Moses you go up for us is assigned a positive it does have an interesting parallel to when God tells Moses in the same spot at the burning bush don't come any closer and there that's a sign of his faithfulness is by honoring you know the the Divine fire so then the idea would be that they that Moses goes up on their behalf as a mediator and God gives him the blueprints for the Tabernacle which is going to help provide proper boundaries so that they can approach God appropriately
John I'm curious at this point where are you watching two people who have dedicated a lot of time to understanding these and all the sudden there's more than one way to read these texts what what does that feel like for you this month energizing yeah I think well I mean I spend so much time with you so I just get inside of your brain and so I could get really comfortable and just be like oh yeah this is this is great nice coherent way to view all this so it's a little jarring to kind of go oh that's how you read that story or there is a there is a compelling case to be made to read that story and that way but I think that's just my initial reaction and then also I you know I can hear Tim's response to who I want to engage I want to hear that argument through
 I'm like okay I'm going to let Tim hear that hurt you cuz I don't know if I have the braid space but I think what is cool is for me to be able to engage with these ideas on the level of narrative patterning and having that perspective in tool set is nice hi I will say I'm very empathetic to the reading that that we've been having of so it's kind of hard for me to detach from it and try to completely understand how the test for Abraham would be second-guessed me I mean that's interesting it's an invitation to wrestle with God and Abraham doesn't take the doesn't take the bait like she doesn't wrestle what most does yeah that's interesting I am thinking of the Jewish meditation literature video in the how to read the Bible series and just how you guys have laid it out as like this is complicated and they're all
 residences and it's going to take us a lifetime to sit with these and wrestle with them you know the complexity means we just can't wrap our minds around it and be done like check it off the list is also want to say that I'm still in the early stages of actually writing my commentary so I haven't worked in depth on that question like I quickly turned to my kitties dissertation to help me answer it because I knew he had stopped that question for a long time but I haven't worked my way all the way to that point of my commentary so I may listen to you your explanation of it and be persuaded by that can I use jumping seems like these two interpretations cash out and pre different ways and they're both really cool ways one is where we took our video on the test which is a test is an opportunity to trust God even though doesn't make sense and we have this image at the end of the video where this is Flaming door
 but then an arm comes out you know to lead you through it and you picture Moses going up the top of Sinai and it looks like he's going into his death I mean that's what is it as to what is realities but through the Flaming door into the space word God and him can be together and and so it's this picture of can I trust God even though I have a sense of self-preservation and that's telling me not to or I'm second-guessing God's wisdom based off of my own assessment of what I need a cool thing to think about it is the other way to think about this that you're suggesting is the opportunity that we have as Gods human Partners to engage with him and we see that with Abraham as he negotiates about Sodom and Gomorrah we see it with Moses negotiating on behalf of Israel and that's a cool thing to think about that we actually invited
 participate in actually actively negotiating with God and those are kind of two completely different they almost feel a pose to each other and some way like just trust God even that doesn't make sense Something Beautiful there I think there's something difficult there or here's an opportunity to engage with God and almost second-guess God in a way because he wants to actually engage with you as a partner beautiful approaches is the character of God we can trust God blindly because we trust his character when something looks like it's not lined up with the character of the Yahweh we know that's where we would be invited to wrestle this is what you see say in Psalm 89 where the song has the same look at all these break promises you made to David to have a king on the throne and then halfway through the song it's this
 where are you you don't seem to be upholding David as king the way you said you were going to so there's a disjunction between What God Says or what he promises and what what were observing in life and I think we can trust God that he's going to work out his purposes but I think he invites us to engagement with him like that get to the part of the narrative where Moses is on top of the mountain for 40 days with God there's this sense of perhaps that should have been all of Israel up there with God in the Eden space or are you pretty comfortable kind of guy I know that's that's great that's how I deal like Israel up there would have been a mess like her in some way and they needed a mediator and that the ideal was the mediator goes up there I think they needed a mediator I think it would have been a mess because they hadn't been made holy yet and so they needed a mediator because they didn't have a tabernacle yet and they didn't have her Priestess
 so therefore there was not an operational sacrificial system that that would repair that relationship so that they could safely be in God's presence so I actually think what resulted was even better than if they had gone up the mountain God said no I'm going to come move down into your neighborhood I'm coming down to where you are but the Tabernacle facilitated that move so that they could safely be in the presence of God for me this raises the whole set of questions about well I already named it how went earlier stories are patterned skews me one later stores are patterned after earlier ones so for example of the establishment of the fire in the Angels at the boundary of Eden and you can't go back in but the whole narrative is like but I wish somebody could go back in like we need somebody to go back in and wouldn't it be great if it was everybody and so then you start having these narrative patterns of people characters facing these life-and-death decisions real life and death for the Next Generation where they stand at that
 as it were and whether or not they're going to trust and step towards what looks like death and then discovered that it's actual real life and that was the what do you say that's the force or the pressure that the Eden story was exerting on me all through Genesis leading me up to be inclined to see that same Dynamic here namely that the idea would be for all the people to be re-entered back to Eden but what happens if the people stay distant and I do think there's something to the macro to sign how the moment where the people say we don't want to go there or they say that they stand far away and push Moses up
 and Moses says this is a test. In chapter 20 verses 18 and following that's at the literary Center of all of 19 through 24 so there's something there that it's really highlighting that moment cuz they want to be distant and Moses is the one who goes up the pressure of the earliest patterns is what led me to see that as a another concession as it were in so it's good it's good that we have one because if they have one God can work with that one on behalf of all of the others but it does points still to a lost i.d. he'll be even that one ends up not being able to go into the Tabernacle at the end of Exodus right like in the literary Design This is what your your exit is video brings out so well there's like this unfinished element and I think that's setting us up for why we need Leviticus but we don't have our priesthood yet we don't know the sacrifices yet and that's going to be necessary if we're going to re-enter God's presence I think it's the merse
 if God isn't it that he drives Adam and Eve out of the garden because he doesn't want them to eat from the Tree of Life and live forever in that state in that state of Brokenness so the people aren't ready yet to approach the tree of life until that healing happens appreciate that what's good I need to think about these things more oh yeah yep the problem is I don't want to wait till I'm 98 to say anything about the Bible
 and so there's nothing for it though to just say this is my current understanding and I might actually land at the same place but with greater conviction or I might adopt my views on the way and likely both will happen many times over and isn't it a beautiful thing that we can sharpen each other and trade ideas like isn't this what the rabbis did as they read scripture together and we could be this and it could be this and somehow they were able to sit with more unresolved tensions than we are we want to know like what which is it more room for ambiguity there
 what transition to a couple other questions that we had for you the first one I think I know but I've never I haven't heard you quite speak to her so I was curious cuz you mentioned be brought at the Tabernacle setting up the Tabernacle is a place where the relationship can be home so the Tabernacle is full of garden like imagery and its description people have interpreted that symbolism in different ways however overtime so and that is going to lead to another question about the dress in the role of the high priests within that place so maybe first what do you make of the Tabernacle Garden imagery within the larger storyline of the Torah I think it's unmistakable that there's all this Garden imagery I have an article about it where I should have assembled all of the different yeah so it's in the best race for John Walton for us but not to us and the article titled The Lost World Of The Exodus so I kind of take Walton stylist
 Lost World Books and I apply it to seeing Exodus as a creation story and in so many ways the book of Exodus is a creation Story the creation of the nation of Israel and so I think that the Tabernacle chapters Echo the creation of Aunt because it's finally bringing them to the place where they can do well in the presence of God as Adam and Eve dwell in God's presence in the garden so so many things God consecrate the seventh day of creation he consecrates the Tabernacle there's cherubim guarding the way to the tree of life is cherubim in the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle there's a tree of life in the garden there's a tree shaped candelabra in the sanctuary there's gold and Onyx in the Garden of Eden there's gold and Onyx on on the high priest garments and in the Tabernacle in of the other Furniture has been the creation days go from evening to morning you can evening and morning first day and evening and morning the second day and the lamps in the Tabernacle are lit from evening to morning sis so so many
 goes between the two there's all these sevens in both stories right we have 7 Days of Genesis 1 but we have got issues the Tabernacle instructions on Moses 7 stay on the mountain so he wait 6 days and then he hears them on the 7th day we hear that in chapter 24 the priest ordination ceremony spanned seven days and then they're closed with new garments just like Adam and Eve are closed in the garden the ordination has seven days of atonement on the Altar and the seven day ceremonies repeated for Aaron's successors at the very end of the Tabernacle in Exodus the last thing we're told is that they should keep the Sabbath so it's the instructions are happening on the 7th day and we hear about the Tabernacle and then we get Sabbath last and it's the Sabbath directions are the 7th of speeches or on the 7th Day and there's seven speeches about the Tabernacle in the last news about the Sabbath I mean it just seems like it's everywhere
 Eden Focus contact list so that all of that being the case what do we make of I'm just kind of these three sections that The Exodus tour lays out then Somoza sees all of this he's shown what you just described up on the mountain and he sees a high Priestly you know figure in description know what it all looks like that's what it is then the next narrative after the seven speech is conclude is the guy who's going to supposed to be wearing those clothes the camera shifts down to Aaron is not only not being somebody who's ready for that kind of role but he's making an image of a golden calf and then you get the image but Moses has the one up on the mountain and he's actually being the mediator and he starts shining while he's up there mediating and so you have this you have this idea priest the guy is supposed to fill the role
 not fit for the job and then you have his younger brother who's actually seems to be doing the thing of what his errand should be doing on a good day so what do you make of that juxtaposition of rolls and failed figures and put the wrong person doing the right thing what do you think is going on there Moses is clearly exhausted like he clearly has an exalted rollover Aaron and we see this again and again in the Priestly ordination ceremony in Leviticus Moses does all the things and Aaron is passive Moses washes him Moses dresses him Moses does the sacrifices Moses put the stuff in there and pans so it really we see Moses has a strong actor use the prophet he's the one authorized to lead Aaron Aaron is an interesting figure and I need to spend more time thinking about it but she's a model for every Israelite but he's almost like mute Aaron doesn't say anything except the blessing the Priestly blessing that we see a number 6
 he doesn't even dress himself I have an article about Aaron's garments his high Priestly garments in which I talked about the clothes make the man so Aaron actually has no special qualifications you know skill-wise he just when he puts these clothes on and these things are done to him he is able to perform his role and I wonder if part of what we're seeing in the golden calf story is that God is going to take a very ordinary flawed human being and that the ordination ceremony and the clothing is going to transform him so that he can be put in God's service the same way the whole nation is flawed as a kingdom of priests and God takes them as they are and transforms them to be his representative Aaron's interesting because he's not autonomous he has no Authority outside his office in the Book of Numbers when there's that brush up between Aaron and Miriam and Moses and they're complaining about Moses because
 what profits to like you know what's so fascinating about that is Miriam gets leprosy or lepre however we translate that and Aaron is powerless to do anything about it and he has to come to Moses and say will you pray for her because priest actually don't cure skin diseases they just let you know if they are cured and so Moses Authority is so much greater he's he's not just one of them with access to God like he is a different level of access then Aaron does and it's consistent through his life okay so how does that difference between the two brothers and the ideal role how should that affect how we think about the role of the priesthood not in the history of Israel but how the biblical authors want us to view the role of the priesthood it's a good thing that there is this mediator
 but at the same time the first character to ever fill the role it's like the volume is turned up on his failure and the same will happen with the only other main priest highlighted which is Eli and his sons and they're just as much of failures is Aaron that there's some things I think very significant about that about the portrayal of the priesthood contrast with Moses what do you think it was overall implications are for how we think about the Hebrew Bible's message about the aaronic priesthood yeah it is a very I feel like the stories are fascinating because they're showing us the priest at the same time issuing a strong warning against any kind of innovation or any kind of syncretism so the priests are they never become their own thing they can't run the show in fact the very first story we have about priests after the Priestly ordination in Leviticus 8 and 9 is the story of Nate having to buy who like first day after this thing is up and running we hear about Native
 my Google to bring unauthorized fire into the Tabernacle there in a dating right away they get too big for their britches there thinking oh I work here just what I want to do just what I feel like doing today and it's very clear that like there is no tolerance for any kind of innovation this is about strict adherence to protocol so they don't they don't have some kind of Greater Authority outside of the commands that God's given in so it does turn our eyes to Moses as mediator maybe it turns our eyes to the role of the prophet in the Old Testament or the Tanakh as a whole we shouldn't be relying on the priests who had every generation seems to be corrupt we should be looking to the prophets who then critique the priesthood and call people back to accountability yeah you say it's fitting into a larger theme in the Hebrew Bible That's not like anti priesthood but it just saying we need something more Chase Chase Chase
 yeah now it's just fascinating to think about these scriptures are read and highly valued say in the second temple. We're after the return from Exile in Babylon there are no other institutional authorities apart from the price they preserved and passed on which is fascinating stuff like a man friend think of her I never think of good Parables on the spot but you know a group that are the ones running the show and the main story that we have to tell about our people is all about how the people who have had our jobs throughout history were told us whether there is this like scribal class that separate from the priests who are actually preserving and passing on the stories like I'm thinking of qumran who felt like the priesthood was corrupt and they were going to be even more pure and they're the ones collecting and passing on stories so I don't know enough about textual transmission to
 confident but it seems to me like somebody wanted us to see the failures of the priest for for real I guess you could say the same there's a lot of failed profits to and Moses being both successful at certain moments and then now he has his failures there a lot of field prophets like we have the Moses moment in the money yeah I guess it depends on how you read the Elijah story currently I am persuaded that he is a failed intercessor by his story on Mount Sinai and see what else is in the weird Prophet who gets to see even eaten by lion that's terrible the whole thing I did not a parable in the sense that it didn't happen but yeah I'm pretty persuaded by Peter leithart rating of that story like symbolizing the northern and southern kingdoms and their failure to follow the prophetic word getting eaten by lions so and you know Kings of course are both exhausted but as the Royal seed of David but also face
 failures so maybe they were just maybe that's part and parcel of how the Hebrew Bible works is to say we need these figures but at the same time we just keep producing ones that fail or maybe we need Yahweh himself because all of our shepherds are bad I think this just for me it's the priest and out because even the first priest is not there are no good priest there's just the description of the ideal but every human priests we meet ends up being a pretty miserable failure from the start of the store is I just that is so fascinating to yeah I mean Aaron's a total pushover in Exodus 32 like everybody's pressuring him to make entitled to see I'm kind of trying to quickly rescue the moment I say hey let's have a festival to y'all way as if that's going to somehow solve a problem it is the very negative story so
 I may be here I'll make us a final question and John if you want to do any twists on it feel free and this kind of going up and some summarizing the theme from what we've been talking about what is the send it significant of a story about the Sinai Covenant Israel in the law that both the priest and the people fell in the very moment of its Inception and so thinking globally because it's so especially depending on what Christian tradition has been brought up in you think all the Old Testament that is teaching people about the law and now that uses his comments about Grace and so on so I know that you don't buy into any of that and I've learned a lot from you about how to correct those things but it just seems so significant that in the story about the Inception of the introduction of it the law to Israel its total failure from the start what's the significance of that in the larger framework of the Hebrew Bible
 and they got the Exodus the end of Exodus and waited through five or six chapters of Tabernacle instructions would be able to tell you it's kind of a letdown so you know yet some stories again in chapter 32 and 33 and then we're back into more Tabernacle instructions like we get all of the process of building the Tabernacle takes as long to recount as the instructions and it feels like why is this in here twice I think in the literary design of Exodus it's super important that the instructions came before the golden calf and that the implementation of those instructions came after it because it's what it says to me is that Yahweh anticipated the need for forgiveness he anticipated that these are simple people and they're going to need a way to reconcile with me and so before they even worship the golden calf he was already designing a way to safely live in their neighborhood and he was already putting into place what would need to happen so that they could be cleansed and the Covenant would not because
 this is one thing that persuades me with my kitties thesis that that when Moses is interceding in chapter 32 he's passing the test that God was in fact giving him a test when he said I will destroy you that Moses passes the test by correctly Discerning that he should mediate not do away with these people and so then when you have the building of the Tabernacle we get such detailed instructions I think on purpose to mirror the instructions that Moses was given to show okay we're actually following God's plan now and this time it's going to work so these two things are framing the golden calf which is where we see a total apostasy and I think maybe important to note that it's not like God just kind of snaps his fingers and says oh okay I'm not going to punish you again for that terrible thing you did break like there's this moment of violence where the Levites running around killing the people who were involved in this this terrible
 orgy worship whatever they're doing there's a sense in which those who have participated in apostasy have to experience the consequences but the rest of the community that has a path for cleansing like the residual effects of that sin are not going to hamper the Covenant going forward because they have a tabernacle where those things can be dealt with that sort of descent of the community as a whole and I think it was both that God takes in really seriously but that he's very serious about forgiveness and about creating Pathways for forgiveness breast people those are great Reflections yeah I can approve on those even I think it's we come to the conclusion of the conversation that's good severe and strong commitment to Justice on human evil but just as equal if not a greater as James would say at Mercy triumphs over judgement commitment to creating Pathways of forgiveness
 what most people would get after a first reading of Exodus
 but those are really great Reflections thanks for your great questions for being on podcast again and gauging with that's more in Exodus and sharpening Tim some pushback wonderful I did say it's overwhelming as I think it's also good for those following along to realize that there's a lot going on and not to just let us simplify things but invite us into deeper engagement with these texts which helped us understand the character of God and our place in the story I'm encouraged though that Jesus is our high priest and we can enter the throne room on the mountain we can enter the Fire on the Mountain so at least I know that to be true and that is not less intimidating I suppose but encouraging
 be more intimidating right like we're actually going to send the mountain we're locked in vain awesome yes thank you Carmen we wish you all the best and I'm sure we will be talking again about the Bible at some point so to be continued thank you for having me and thanks for all your work
 okay how's everyone doing we did it I'm sure you have no questions actually speaking of questions we are going to do a question and response for the exit scrolling it's going to be in a few weeks because we wanted to give enough time for questions to come in for these last few episodes in the question response Tim and I are going to debrief this conversation Tim's going to read The Scholar that Carmen is cited and we'll discuss his thoughts but also I want to talk with Tim about about what to do when we find ourselves disagreeing fundamentally about the meaning of a Biblical passage so I look forward to that conversation in an upcoming Exodus human are
 next week we're going to begin the scroll of Leviticus the Leviticus crawl begin first with that good danger kind of tension but then chapters 1 through 7 Up Leviticus R1 long speech from God to Israel through Moses that are in the invitation a Divine gift telling it is realized how they can approach the source of all life and beauty and power and goodness even though they are frail and mortal and morally corrupt but God wants them to come here and so he gives them the gift of the quarterback today's episode was produced by Cooper pelts edited by Zach McKinley and Lead editor Dan come on Lyndsay Ponder did our show notes and the annotated podcast for our app is done by Ashland Heights and Hannah will Bible project is a non-profit we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus everything
