living a good relationships with others is actually really complicated the way I treat my best friend with respect and love is different than the way I should treat my wife with respect and love for my boss with respect and love what works one day won't work the next day and knowing the right thing to do in any given situation is well really messy there's a lot of different ways to be human some of them are going to lead to life and fun dance healthy relationships and Justice in learning communities and there's other ways of Being Human that will lead to broken relationships and Injustice and violence and poverty in my community and despair and depression how do you know what's the right way to be a human I'm John Collins in this is Bible project podcast today and talking with my friends and Scholars dr. Tim Mackie a doctor Krista Quinn
 and we will be discussing Pokemon is the Hebrew word for wisdom this is part of our Paradigm series we're looking at how we see the Bible the way we think the literature Works will discuss how the Bible is wisdom literature wisdom literature is often difficult studies but the title that refers to a handful of books with in the Bible the whole thing what we mean by this little bit different all of the diverse literary Styles in the Bible reveal God's wisdom and invite us into a journey of character transformation of the Bible is meant to transform our character wouldn't it be easier for it to just be a list of things that we ought to do and Things We ought not to do but if you really think about it you don't want to list you want to list for certain Seasons little train like your moral compass so that when you confront really complex situation and it's not clear
 no less but you've been shape to be the kind of person who knows how to figure out the right way for work lists will not help you do that but wisdom wisdom will help you do that and so while the Bible does have lists of rules that has the ancient lock code for ancient Israel it has lists in the first century letters for the first century Christians despite the list of rules the Bible actually isn't rulebook all of the stories of the poems Proverbs The Parables and the rules they all give us access to God's wisdom that's ahead of today's podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 that were talking about the Bible as we do I'm John I'm here with Tim and Chris how y'all doing good morning this morning this morning we are jumping back into this conversation about the Paradigm by which we review the Bible and read it and think that it works as literature and we've been going through a number of these all in an effort to unpack of phrase we've been using for years now to describe what we're doing at the bar project which is to help people experience the Bible as a unified story Teresa Jesus in cursive and John what what do we mean when we say such a thing that's a big I a story plot of God and Humanity themes in it unify it and then we talked about what a sweetheart about unified litter
 yep and before that we talked about how it's human and divine human both human and divine lot of the human and divine partnership yeah holy book as people say that one because you guys just recorded it but that seems like that what happened locations for being unified as this Divine work that has God's spirit working behind it and he's brilliant literary ninja authors that are really really good at reading but it's really early right now play meditative are really good at interpreting Devine unified and then that it's Messianic that is about the governing story that unifies that is about anointed representative human who comes to do
 for Humanity and forgot the people what they seem incapable of doing for themselves which is to be the anointed representatives of God in the Bible that unify it will be expressed in many different words throughout the biblical story so page one uses the phrase image of God described humans as Representatives but then as The Story Goes On the pool of legitimate Representatives keeps getting smaller the narrowing yeah and so there's this roller office that is both Priestley on Royal that is called the anointed one in Israel and that is another expression of a little Annoying too hard representative Northern beans messiah messiah messiah and Christ means Messiahs the Greek translation of the Hebrew word Messiah look spelled with English letters Christ Jesus Christ is Jesus the Messiah juice the annoying
 current step and that's and so it is his literature that's all about this idea of meeting and then then we looked at last episode that it's meditation literature and I just love I love this part of the Paradigm that this is the Searchers meant for like a lifetime of reading and rereading and that it's shaped in such a way that it has shipped your imagination as you cannot continually discover and see how it almost interprets itself and how he's kind of those this I don't know actually how would you describe a time with your shorthand question for hand or maybe Chris or what did you remember from it's designed to be this piece of literature this whole text that we engage and over and over and over and as we read that were transformed by it but we also see more in the text so we see the patterns that are repeating and
 and how things are connected it's not meant to be I think it's goes back to what you guys were talking about in the very first intro episodes it's not meant to be a theological dictionary immoral guide book or the spiritual grab bag but it's literature to be meditated on and it tells a story so we get to imagine that story and be a part of that story was interesting we talked a lot about how it's artistically designed to yeah that's right that's kind of two aspects to this one one is just the basic point super-dense but unified but you have to work at thus covering its Unity through constant rereading and it's designed that way that's not like a glitch it's a feature often we experienced hard to understand biblical stories and treat them as if there's a glitch repeated that or the story is leaving out too much information or that's a weird way to tell that narrative that's because it's telling stories in a very specific way to force you
 to allow you to like see how it's connecting the dots itself and explaining The Human Condition and explaining who got is not by just telling you but when you discover it by the way that it repeats motifs and we call it an harmonizing with itself and I was listening to myself what a thing to say about the Bible that leads into the next aspect of meditation literature and that the Styles and conventions every culture both produces and develops certain literary Styles and conventions for how they write poetry in narrative and so on and so ancient
 Israelite literature Nation Jewish literature which is two ways that I'm about the same literature just over the course of a long. Of time tribes unified living some kind of federation and then after the Exile of Babylon it was mainly just the tribe of Judah that still had an independent existence is the origin of the word you and your best friend so usually do is describe the literature after the Exile Israelite describe the literature before the Exile different political circumstances ancient Israel a Jewish literature has a very unique but also you can profile conventions of how these narratives and informs our design and it's through a non often a nonlinear way of communicating of telling a story and a handful of parts and those parts
 relate conceptually and in terms of linkages between them but not always linearly so stories often read in a weird way it feels that you tried to like make a movie out of many biblical scenes yeah a lot of repeated seems like they made it literally the movie would be really difficult to watch because but also I think because when you translate into film you need to make it into linear linear sequence otherwise it's like a Christopher Nolan's film where everything is out of order. Talked about but for biblical Otto's narratives are designed according to the same principles as poetry in terms of symmetry and parallelism and matching Parts going from the outside of the inside back to the outside and so it's a unique narrative style that Fosters meditation read one story from multiple perspectives interesting about that as we've been talking about the Bible as unified literature or a unified state
 sorry but that doesn't mean it reads like a story in the way we typically think of story beginning in the middle and an end I mean it does have a narrative strand that the entire Bible does even have a somewhat chronological narrative strand you see how like if this happens often where Hollywood will make a a movie about The Exodus and they have to like adapt the story into our our modern narrative convention to make the story palatable things that just wouldn't work the way we tell stories now reviewing one event from multiple different lenses and telling those lenses won in a row witch acetone repetitive and though good directors and movies do something similar where they based at which the theme or type of character and then they reestablished that idea and
 new way and you are supposed to have the viewer connect the dots or not going to do it for you but then we're talking about like you know artistic film where were supposed to engage his readers and wonder what's going on here could it be this or that and that's part of the strategy was going to call conversations that we started having You and I John in the how to read the Bible series like years ago I think it's specially in the how to read biblical poetry in there. If that was for me the first attempts to try and articulate all of the stuff I was wanting something with boiled it down to this how we borrow the down we just talk for five minutes so give me like the good of you since the Bible is a kind of literature that's designed to communicate to you only after multiple readings and long periods of meditation and pondering what its meaning is and so its meaning is
 the experience of discovering what a story or poem means is like peeling back the layers of an onion you walk away and see what's going on here and then you come back later after reading the rest of the collection be like oh man I had no clue what this is really about and then a year later you come back to that same time her story and be like I didn't see that but now I see that it's designed that way and it's not that it's it's like oh what I was thinking was wrong that I knew I didn't see everything had to offer that's right sometimes evaluation of like something that I thought was good was not good
help this kid SoundCloud Gnostic you know there's a secret hidden message in the Bible and you have to learn to code to like to meet it can't just read it and understand it on on a 1st Street and after know these ways that okay so I have a couple thoughts one is if you really think about any field of human knowledge it's exactly like this like you learn math starting and what the first grade and then you can study for the rest of your lives true you know it's true like what field of human knowledge is not like this you could come to it at a basic level but then it just keeps getting deeper to be honest I think there's something especially in American Protestant tradition it's come to a culturally that the Bible ought to be simple if hot to be able to understood at its face
 value on the first reading to communicate to the simple average person and as time goes by that is not my experience this text thing you know what is it about the Bible that makes us View at that way as opposed to the way we view everything else is almost like a resident with this be idea that you know if God wants to communicate something to people then he's going to make it understandable to people and I do think there's a truth to that there's a God is going to be a really good communicator and a spirit working through people is going to be a great communicator but I think there's something to the Invitational nature of the Bible that engages Us in it instead of just giving us these propositional truths were meant to be drawn into a story and so that means it's going to be complex it's going to be interesting
 instruction manual he gave us little secret part I think it's something unique to American cultures produce that and then it's probably an exported into places where American Christianity has been exported but you know if you look at how any man if you look at how the Bible is read and understood by the first five hundred years of Christian Scholars or Bible teachers with the church fathers with rough called This is why there's a lot of mothers in there to the basic assumption was what we're talking about right now in the Bible is deep it's full of mysteries it's meant to be read and reread it will not give up its most important messages on a first reading for me than a new Arena of learning and the church fathers in origin and two Italian or whatever and this is all the Assumption they have about the scriptures is that they require a lifetime of rereading something uniquely about are called
 contacts that has foreign people to think the Bible isn't like that it shouldn't be like that and what we're trying to do is recover what actually Jews and Christians have always said about these texts but somehow our situation has made us forget that what are the simplest level the story of the Bible is not that hard to understand humans I've been called great great calling to be God's image I guess that's hard to understand to represent God in the world and we are his creatures and we could do it on our own terms which leads to violence and pain and misery or we can do it through God's wisdom which will be great that's the story of the Bible and that we need a messiah has we talked about that could do it for us and show us the wet and become a part of that so but notice what you just did there is abstract the message of the Bible's based on years of covers
 from you and I reading and rereading the group and so I think you're right the communicating can be communicated but the way the literature gets these ideas across call Genesis 12 11 in a literature were never meant to come to it just me by myself with no preconceived notion and no Community interpretation we typically do start off with all this is this is a story about how God loves Humanity rescues Humanity through a messiah hopefully part of the story that we come to the Bible with supposed to be like a short into the summer and we got some yoga meditative something about the meditation thing that I love it and I want to make sure that we can kind of explain it in a way that would make someone
 that sounds exciting. Kind of like what kind of hard on taking Gnostic nonsense or what kind of like the Bible is Arts like that's these guys don't fault you something that's really exciting about it to me that if I read scripture if I study the top-end in my PhD work on the Psalms is I read the Psalms everyday this small group of Psalms and I felt like I'm not even reading outside of the Psalms I'm just reading these songs for two years and then when I went back to read the New Testament or other books of the Old Testament after that my eyes were open to new things because I had been meditating on the songs for so long so to me it's exciting because the more that we read them or that we study them or they will see and it doesn't matter if we're reading the story all the way through or studying one part of it will just continue to see more our whole lives which is exciting we are going to then talk about the next part of the Paradigm look at is that the Bible is wisdom literature and let's jump in
the Bible is wisdom literature the key part of the Paradigm we used to have back when we first started about a project we had an additional little ending to our tagline Mission if I was you if I was to release of Jesus and offers wisdom and no longer believe that because I was acting as our mission statement, and we were trying to decide as an organization do we exist to show how the Bible brings wisdom of the modern world and that's we just kind of worse when I sure that we felt like my ass that's what I'm missing the connect those dots but we do want to show the wisdom but the Bible has about as wisdom and we do believe as we do not believe we can apply that wisdom in all the different contexts where you all listen to the podcast list that is your adventure with the Holy Spirit to figure out how it connects the modern world but we wanted to share with the wisdom is
 so what's the matter okay so what it what do we mean in biblical studies title that refers to a handful of books with in the Bible not the whole thing because he has to use Proverbs sometimes song a song Sometimes I miss all the wisdom literature so here's our short hands sentence that we've written to summarize this all of the diverse literary Styles in the Bible reveal God's wisdom and invite us into a journey of character transformation the seems pretty common sense to me when I read it so what makes it important to talk about the Bible as wisdom literature is it that it's supposed to thinking of it as something else won this is in contrast to the Bible is a theology dictionary for the Bible is immoral handbook or the Bible is the total crap back so in each one of those my treat
 Bible like a reference book and ignore its literary style I just treated like a or letter at for narrative is what we're saying is all the literary Styles in their all their uniqueness poems Proverbs Parables I'm beginning lots of peas what's a piece of Parables narratives letters apocalypse is all this stuff every one of these is a medium for God's wisdom so what do we mean by that we'll talk about the word wisdom the wisdom but crucial to the concept of wisdom in the Bible is that it's a practical knowledge that actually shapes your actions and your life choices throughout the formation of a whole human life which is often called someone's character I mean that wisdom is not just intellectual or cognitive knowledge as it doesn't turn it one more person then yeah that's right that's right so
 the Bible is aimed at shaping people and communities of people to see the world a certain way to live in the world and that's the end of this behind wanting to be a robot that's right or moral handbook tell me what no one believed in advance so I can do the right thing correct the Deep intuition that one of the goals of the Bible is to shape how I see the world and how I live in the world in the kinds of decisions that I make you want to do that but not in the way we typically think it does execution if I try and make it by will do that by treating it like a reference book is going to result in the water problems and I has resulted honor the literary style of the Bible that say all the literary Styles and all their difference are communicating a message of God's wisdom that is meant to shape the character of me and my community that's the golf so when did part of this is to
 what is the concept of wisdom in the Bible so you could get out this a couple ways so maybe one will be a word study way and then another way is to look at it in the story house with some fits in the story with them as it happens is like one of the man seems and it's right at the beginning quest for human wisdom quest for wisdom and knowledge of good and bad is it it's right there at the beginning of the conflict of The Bible story the first a quick word study on wisdom that we've done before but years ago I think in the podcast I know yeah we talked about it for Proverbs yeah that's right so just quick recap here first the Hebrew word for wisdom is the Greek word is Sophia and in the biblical tradition was in Greek and Hebrew wisdom is about practical know-how is a wisdom can describe practical know-how and a variety of different types of projects so for example two examples are when somebody's building something so when
 add commissions these two guys to be the lead of the Craftsman teams for the building of the Tabernacle Artisans yeah that's right betzalel and Olaf and God says in Exodus 31 is I filled him with the spirit of Elohim with Pokemon with wisdom and then with understanding Bina and then with knowledge and that knowledge same where does the word knowledge of good and bad for the Tri-Cities the three synonyms wisdom understanding and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship so there is a word for craftsmanship at its word work the same word for work as God resting from his work in Genesis 1 so here is an artist it's like if you go to like the farmers market you know and there's like a boost and you see somebody who makes like handmade jewelry on while using a skeleton
 but that's what's interesting is that in English we call it skill so it's somebody who knows this medium they know this material they know its limits they know what the potentials they know how to take it from him like an inert cried chaotic disordered State and make it into something that's beautiful or productive or what's interesting is when we talked about some of these wise we mean the same thing but the media is my life but that's because it's like a physical material silver or fabric they take something that has potential but also limitations right you can't do everything with gold you can't make Shields out of it while you can solve
 battle war with somebody who knows the medium with which they're working and knows his limits potentials of capacity can take it from disorder to be so then you can be used for different types of human behavior so in Deuteronomy thirty-four Joshua son of nun he's going to replace Moses and Leading the People and his ability to lead the people is empowered by what's called a spirit of wisdom Spirit of Hope, and what we read it at the sons of Israel now listen to Joshua and did everything that y'all would have commanded Moses so you really skilled at making decisions on behalf of the people guiding and leading them so that they are faithful to what God revealed Moses self leadership leadership is a skill
 speaking directly about leadership or about his Spirit-filled or just his life he has wisdom for life and Leadership is a part of that the thread from Deuteronomy 31 where it's all about how he's going to lead the people in the place of Moses and so here it's a culminating moment of Moses just died and Joshua is empowered as the leader for the people that people recognize his wisdom and leading the people and they follow him through it so and then in the next chapter not me but in the next part of the Tanakh in Joshua chapter one we learned that he's going to learn that wisdom by meditating on the Torah day and night so wisdom is practical know how it comes to leadership which is about making difficult decisions that are complex so it's different than working with a piece of metal fabric you're working with ultimately you're making decisions working with material you know the
 you know the limits you know what's going to happen if you've ended this way so it that way but it's a little simpler than dealing with the community of people working with gold or fabric maybe it's a different there's there's more variables right that you didn't can't control like we're like you can kind of learn all the variables of gold and obviously takes tons of artistry and craftsmanship to really Master it but it's not going to all the sudden get grumpy on you were split into groups and then you have to make a decision for everyone which will unify people who don't like each other in like one anyway requires know how and the discernment and that's a part of Pokemon you're saying it comes from meditation on the tour off probably his training under Moses learning the Practical skill
 Joshua is here being offered as a model reader of the whole Hebrew Bible that's like a icon what was interesting is it is the picture here is that it's a little passive like he was filled with the spirit of wisdom of sure that's where in Deuteronomy thirty-four that's right and then when you pair it with the next chapter in Joshua one is very active here and I just didn't include that
 so wisdom is also something that a whole Community can exercise and gained and Deuteronomy for Moses says that all the laws of the Torah are for them to keep in to do for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of all the nations who when they hear the statutes of the Torah they will say wow what a wise understanding people so here what Joshua is doing as an individual shaping of people in the culture in the community here it's about then the whole Community can be said in body whole, because they've ordered their life in this really productive just okay here's the last one the last one is I think maybe more typical when we think about the Bible in wisdom is that it's about moral discernment or discernment between what is good and what
 daughter was good and even what's best and so the story of Solomon is really important here this is where it got it pierced in the dream Solomon and said asked what you went through the genie narrative this is 1st Kings chapter 3 he says you know I am just a little child which is a man calls himself a child I don't know how to go out or come in going out and coming in is it in in the book of Hebrew for leadership and its use of Joshua Slater David he knew how to go out and come in or bring the people out or bring the people in so it's like figure of speech. So I don't know how to lead but I'm in the midst of the people that you've chosen they're great people huge so many too many so give to your servant and understanding heart to judge your people to discern or have knowledge between what is totaled and Rod between what is good and bad and then God When God Says back to him great job great wish
 what's the what are you going to do those in Hawaii he says you've asked for discernment to understand Justice and so I'm giving you a heart that is wise there's our wisdom and discerning
 so it's about more of the sermon between what is bad what is good but he's also a king so it's also leadership here it's personal but it's for a whole Community to all of our meetings kind of come together here there's no communal moral ethical and then also this practical skill and know-how that he replied to living life as an individual and then how to organize the life of a community this is the Bible's vision of wisdom and God is really pleased if that's what Solomon asked for a jump into the narrative then it's interesting that you know this is what knowing good and bad God is pleased with its almonds asking for that but the story The Bible begins with humans
 a tree offering that yes yes yes yes that's right and then Humanity taking that tree and that's bad when he asked for it that's good leave in the garden to take this is a great example of meditation letter sure the Solomon story is designed on an allergy to that of any story and is if he pondered the song and story you'll actually see you learn new things about the Adam and Eve story so what you just said that summer was Solomon what say it again Solomon wanted to know what is good and bad if we ask God for it and it was a good God was pleased Adam and Eve wanted the knowledge of good and bad right and I took it and it was so bad. Like it's the like the horrible fall Narrative of the Bible so let's meditate on the difference between those two narratives you just talked about the similarities other similar but there's anything you said in your wording you may not have noticed it there's a very important differences
 between these two stories but you just kept having wisdom about how to discern what's good and bad but how you get it I'll ask God for it and Adam and Eve just took it it becomes really significant and following narratives whenever people just take her something they think is good and one tree is not about wisdom it's not life right it doesn't seem like it's about wisdom than the others tree of knowing good and bad that one seems to be about wisdom and so is the story there seems to be like God doesn't want you to have the wisdom that's off-limits
 and so by itself you can go away from that gun like oh God doesn't want me to have wisdom but then you get to this story which is very clearly like connecting you to that story using the same vocabulary and images and I'll send you really like and how God does want me to have wisdom so what was going on in that difference between these two characters Adam and Eve's and Solomon. Yeah I think your fingers right on it Chrissa one desires and takes for themselves what's good in their eyes that she saw that it was good so she's sees what's good in her eyes and then takes this wisdom for herself versus coming to God with a posture of I don't know what I need to know
 and I need you to give it to me so the posture of taking versus receiving I think is fundamental to the message here I'm being connected with God and trusting God for his wisdom instead of trusting ourselves for our own discernment of Good and Evil apart from him a good and bad apart from him if Proverbs 17 here that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge is like connection or trust in in God with fear of the Lord is kind of a weird phrase but I think that for me that reminds me of the encounter with with y'all on the mountain on Mount Sinai when the people feared him but it's this encounter with the Living God says relational connection to God fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge so it's like wisdom comes from connection with Yahweh not this connection and choice to follow ourselves instead
 meditation literature so the Book of Proverbs itself it's all a meditation on teams of the Garden of Eden there to do in the Garden of Eden narrative the people are there they fear the lord Adam and Eve fear the lord in the car so yeah afterwards and then they fear the lord and the narrative is very clear that you know that's the language that used to come to Proverbs and hear the fear of the Lord is what you ought to be doing before before you make a decision before you make a decision and then that leads to wisdom and in Proverbs chapter 3 wisdom is called a tree of life Proverbs 3 verse 13 how blessed is the one who finds wisdom or 16 long life is in wisdoms right-hand verse 18 wisdom is a tree of life so this is also giving commentary the tree of life was also a tree of wisdom from the point of view of Proverbs 3 but it was the wisdom
 that you get access to when you fear the lord and don't take what's good in your eyes so you need the rest of the Hebrew Bible to explain what the Garden of Eden story was about right and this is a good example example yeah you know what's interesting though so here were talking about how wisdom comes from Yahweh is connected to him and trust in him but in the Proverbs you also see that wisdom comes from observation of human or of observation of creation Solomon or that the author watches the ants and says this is what the ants do they work so hard feel like the ants yeah that's right yeah yeah okay so wisdom is about learning there's a lot of different ways to be human some of them are going to lead to life in abundance healthy relationships and Justice inflation communities just give me the book give me the textbook
 relationships and Injustice and violence and poverty in my communities and despair and depression and so how do you know what's the right way to be a huge and that's what Hulk mama is about and then then so the biblical story opens up and saying out of humans need to know that the question is how do you obtain that knowledge and biblical story is saying not by relying on your own instincts when you rely on your own instincts you will inevitably without even knowing it start to make decisions that are foolish that you think are wise and so this literature claims to be offering a vision of human life and human communal life
 by wanting all these stories and poems that you learn how to be human know what is good and what is offering a vision seems like maybe he sounds like you're saying more than that to his offering its offering the wisdom but it does give a vision of like perhaps like what do you mean by offers division story about Cain and Abel story and fraught complicated sibling relationships I wonder if anybody's ever had any of those very Universal you get to ponder here's a way that relationship and go that leads to death but then you can have positive relationships like with Joseph and his brothers swear there's a relationship that leads to death but it ends up leading to life because of God's involvement in the world and then that becomes a whole study so every character becomes as we say in our how to read the Bible video and characters
 mirror for self evaluation to point out where is that I'm acting foolishly to teach me the way of wisdom and this is how we acquire wisdom through meditating or just observe the outcome of a decision that didn't go well and you know and the wise person will learn that's okay I'm not going to do that again but you can also save yourself a lot of pain and read the Hebrew Bible studies endless case studies on how to be human and thing when it goes well and when it goes out and so this is where the Bible is its wisdom aimed at helping a gyro and develop as ethical moral beings in the world but it doesn't do it in style of a handbook it does it the way it is and pawns do it and that's the basic point is wisdom literature
 now I think I have a very intuitive sense for how a poem is or a proverb is wisdom literature and how you meditate on a poem and then it just gets deeper and more rich and the connects to The Human Experience and it shapes you or like you know a nice saying how it first your kind of makes sense and then like the more you sit with that the like more profound it becomes and then I get that was stories to write my doesn't do too since their there's a whole section of the Bible and it's the section of the Bible that I was going to talk to prioritize what's your day like the New Testament letters and those seem more like a handbook and so does the Old Testament law code a little bit and seemed like kind of like this is a handle but even there you can see how Jesus uses it as wisdom literature and some of them out
 you can you can understand how like okay that was for a different culture yeah I'm no longer I don't live with the Tabernacle I don't live in this hole in like this. Culture I can't go sacrifice you don't live in ancient Israel Bible so there's something there for me to have his got the wisdom in that it's fine but I think if I can we talk about the New Testament letters as wisdom literature because when we say the whole Bible and all its literary style as was in there to your Sterling Inn Hotels you know the Church of Corinth like a good do this don't do that is that a dude don't listen we need to really take seriously if it wisdom literature what's the difference between 11 level everybody reads the letters of the Apostles as with a lurcher even if they don't know it cuz right next to all the commands think through Paul's letter to the Corinthians he has commands but did he gives
 the Corinthians about how they Oregon the value set by which they organize themselves in a community's you have commands about sexual Integrity not sleeping with prostitutes his commands about not taking lawsuits outside the community people are not have intentions with each other about marriage and betrothal about making sure you take that offering every week that you're together for the poor in Jerusalem have all these commands and throughout Christian history Christian readers have selected certain of those is universal and other ones contextual and the problem is based on anybody's social location what you elevate Universal or safe contextual difference it's a matter of fact church history different communities pick and choose and so the question is is just one is one Community right and one can be the wrong or is this the wrong category all together right yeah although there is I think there are crazy
 three days you would say no we do mall we can we try to do it all it's impossible they're also like commands to the Indians to take an offering every week for the poor in Jerusalem they turn into wisdom we also take an offering for Echo spot in Reading at his wisdom of living by the wisdom of that x-ray has to do this and so we do this or no guidance for how we ought to live but they're not doing actual command to do cuz they don't live in first-century corn but then there will be other things we were like oh yeah Paul wanted to do that and of course we should do it too so this is the dynamic that Jesus communities around the world have been engaged in to me it's just helpful to say all of the blood of the Apostles are written to first century communities in the commands were to them
 these letters were to them and they are function as wisdom literature for us the same way that the Proverbs do the same way that the laws to introduce real do I know the first century Clinton but what Paul guided the Corinthians 10:4 how to be faithful to the way of Jesus has immense wisdom for how I follow Jesus but it's the same type of relationship is when I watch got to get commands to ancient Israel it seems to me so I think that's that's what we're saying all the glitter s tiles are wisdom literature cuz none of it is to me I'm not an ancient Israelite I'm not a picture for Century Corinthian or Ephesian memory of of coming into your office when you're a pastor when I was just starting my studies and I asked you a question about how how do I know which of these things are Universal how do I know which are contextual and you said they're all contextual like there are they are all they're all written in this ancient contacts and it's like
 yeah it's it takes me a long time to figure out what are the guard rails then so what do you do the process of interpretation but just recognizing in the first place there everything in the Bible is written in an ancient contacts to an ancient audience for our benefit via for a wisdom the story if the story is that we take wisdom on our own terms and it's a disaster but we trust God and it'll be beautiful then how do you get from God the wisdom from this literature vs. you just saying I know it's good and bad then if this was contextual for them I'm going to say we can do this we could do that and just relying on your own and thinks this is really where the last two Paradigm Pieces come into play its context really rude and literature that's the next one and then after that it's communal literature
 written within a community to a community for them to community discern the will of God that was being communicated through these texts and it's never been otherwise it's often just that the contextual nature of the Bible is often under a sized depending on your tradition I guess and the communal way that we discerned God's wisdom from this literature is often invisible to us we don't recognize the way we're doing it cuz it's just the way our tradition this always done it seems like you need wisdom to interpret wisdom literature to know about you know I think about what we typically think of us the wisdom literature in the Bible has these different voices at a table talking about the same thing so Proverbs Ecclesiastes Jobe are all talking about how the world works and you know when you when somebody does something good or they were worried
 and when I do something either they punished is that how the world works and they all have these different perspectives and voices and you need wisdom when you listen to those voices to know which of those things might apply in your situation or how to how to interpret those and I feel like the whole Bible is this this collection of voices and of wisdom that isn't necessarily straightforward but that we can learn from but we need wisdom to do that I'm listening to your your directing my attention to roll you talking about 2 we can land the plane with this one this one of my favorite paragraphs in the Bible to talk about this it's a meta paragraph It's a reflection on scripture but it's within scripture itself so it's in Paul's second letter to Timothy chapter 3 and
 riding to the Protege but like an apprentice who he sent to lead the church's house churches in Ephesus and so he starts talking about how you learn the scriptures from your mom and your grandma and then it says you however Timothy 2nd Timothy 3 verse 14 continue in the things you've learned it become convinced that because you know the people you learn from her from childhood you know the sacred writings that is great to know about Fight Club you already have to know about Fight Club he was raised in a community he's been talked already what these texts are about that they're unified story Lisa Jesus they give us wisdom and so on another words it's not he doesn't just grow up and become an adult one day and like now I'm just a blank slate and I learned what God wants for me and I can learn from it in the simple straightforward Way by reading the Bible That's not how anybody's learns how to discern God's Will from The Bible you're apprenticed into it in the community he says about the Sacred Scriptures
 Testament more probably in the squeak form he says when they're able to give you wisdom that leads to Deliverance a rescue through trust in the Messiah Jesus is the summary which is so great it's Messianic wisdom out the Hebrew Bible in the Old Testament he calls it wisdom literature gives it shape Sia to be able to see and live in a certain way and what does that way to know that you need to be rescued and that's the kind of like formation piece of the kind of human you were made to be too right that's right and ideal human in the Bible is somebody who recognizes the limits of their wisdom and says whatever is going to happen in the world needs to happen through something way bigger and smarter than me
 hands off that's what you mean by wisdom that leads to Deliverance Deliverance or salvation there's something that has to be done to carry the world forward and I'm unable to do it I need deliverance and deliverance is marked by trust salvation through faith or Deliverance through trust in an anointed representative who will do for us what we can't do for ourselves that's the basic storyline and when you have when you view yourself in the world that way we'll all of a sudden what scripture becomes is a source of teaching all goes on to say that tells you things you never knew before for reproof it confronts you about the things you do know but don't live consistently with for correcting saying stop going that way go this way and then for shaping you and to do what is right character formation
 individual and Community with the unified formats of the Gods people are trained to do good works so this is what we mean by Wilson Motor
 what would you say to someone who maybe it's kind of morning this a little bit like someone who life is tough enough already you know it's the grind things are difficult just tell me what to do just give me the answer is be more straightforward like I want to do the right thing I want to have a more Abundant Life just give me the give me the list I'm going to do my best but just make it simple don't give me this art project I think about it one level that's totally right there are these distillations that we get throughout story like in the Ten Commandments or in The Sermon on the Mount
 you know and that points that's very clear like don't murder of your mom paw you know what you want them to do to you, crystallizing where it's like distilled but if you really think about it you don't want to list you want to list for certain season right at will train you right little train like your moral compass so that when you confront really complex situations like Joshua or Moses and it's not clear and there's no less is no list we're outside the realm of any less but you've been shaped to be the kind of person who knows how to figure out the right way forward that will not help you do that but wisdom wisdom will help you didn't know book to be long enough to be a long enough list to tell every human within you do and every situation and that's not what we actually need
 or think what in the long run I want to make decisions for my son my ten-year-old he is so ready to be 18 and he's just constantly wants to be an adult and so it's so fascinating I'm trying to help them learn like the way that you can become an adult is to start learning from the consequences of your decisions and let you know we're going to be at the store another eight years but it's not right there when you say more in the loss I guess I would just gently challenge that point of view and to say but is that really what you want to be just be told exactly what to do your whole life don't you want to make some decisions for yourself and try it out in life growing experience and maturity is not what most of us want
 but then when there's a real tough decision and we're stuck man we just want some Jacob yes were like we want God to have given us than exhausted map and what he offers is a compass and that's that's kind of what this reframe is in the house with a human life requires there is no there is no map how could there be a story's not written except so next stop is communal no contextual we're going to look at how the Bible is was written in the time and place in history and how that's an important
 part of the paradigm
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we dive into the next pillar of the Paradigm that the Bible is ancient literature the Bible is written in ancient language Hebrew and Aramaic throw in there and then also ancient Greek so our modern translations of the Bible are amazing but they are translations their mediating one ancient the languages into a modern language and that requires an enormous amount of cross-cultural work we're going to do one more question response so we'd love to hear from you you can record yourself asking a question keep it to about 20 or 30 seconds and then email it to info at Bible project.com and please transcribe your question that helps us a ton and don't forget to let us know your name and where you from Today Show is produced by Cooper pelts our editors are Zach McKinley and Frank Garza our senior editor is Dan demel Lyndsay Ponder does our show notes and our theme
