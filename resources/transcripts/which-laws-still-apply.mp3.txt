it's a high question in response to our discussions on the scroll of Deuteronomy we lost 9 hours pay a conversation on Deuteronomy it was great the 2nd law and we heard from many of you as usual and Tim you selected some questions as usual and as usual you typically say you looked for a repeated questions and what else you look for whatever is the most repeated themes or the questions that
 have stuff that I think they will be excited so there's a little subjectivity is about the way followers of Jesus today relate to these ancient laws yeah we talked a lot about that relates to the laws we get more of that sounds great totally and other stuff so it'll be great from Guatemala my question is how do we determine which law still applies in which ones don't know some traditions believe that if it's not addressed in the New Testament is no longer valid but I've also found all the traditions and cream an Old Testament law explain train Church Rex you know the Ten Commandments
 yep yeah well the ones about idols and Sabbath yeah that's actually a great example because don't murder feels pretty Universal yeah but there hasn't been a time in history where it's like early today yeah has gotten thoroughly re culturized in many Christian Traditions to mean Sunday yes on Sunday but of course that's not what Savage means in Hebrew Bible was very specific meaning of Sabbath it's just a way to do that from Friday Sundown to Saturday stuff down yeah it's the Sabbath is a day and a half commandments so Diego I think there's a provocative way to answer the question and then that's more helpful
 how many of those are still relevant today and in one sense all of them and in another sense none of them
 you sound like one of those gurus it's like I'm trying to do the G through forward you must stay present
 so in one sense none of them none of the loss apply why do as one is the laws appear in a narrative
 of what God revealed to ancient Israelites in ancient people group on the other side of Planet Two thousand years ago unique culture history language song and I'm not a nation Israelite and even Israelites who are still ain't shit in our minds like Jesus and his time the rabbi's then they couldn't follow all the laws of ancient Israel is kind of important right so that leads to the next pizza so what is I'm not you're not I'm not yet and so the vast majority of followers of Jesus around the world today now or not it's right there are many Jewish brothers and sisters who follow Jesus Messiah but in terms of numerical right proportions so no modern followers of Jesus are the audience
 spoken to in the giving of the lost this one piece second piece though is a deeper presupposition the many people many Christian Traditions have developed about the Bible that we've called the reference book approach that the Bible is kind of this like it's a handbook like a Divine Behavior manual and so far the Bible from afar the Bible that parted Bible front back middle end and that's what God says for you to do or it's a constitution of sorts which this is where it gets confusing because ancient Israel what time the time of Moses and then also Beyond would have had some sort of ancient constitution of laws and we don't have homes in custom we don't have it we just have pieces of it and they say we have the biblical authors selected and gave to us and answer
 into the story collections different collections of legal material that they believe were a revelation of God's wisdom to his people and so well that's the thing I was going to put a pin in force the wisdom thing back to your point is just even then we don't have Israel's whole legal custom and tradition we have samples of it yeah if you think what you have is an ancient Constitution are like the legal handbook we have pieces of that we don't even have that and so the Bible isn't trying to say here is exactly how you do everything to be a good person yeah as a child of God yeah so so in that sense none of them because the purpose of the laws in the Torah isn't to provide the ultimate comprehensive way that God wants you to live
 as stated in the laws as such that just you just don't have what you need and that's not the role that they play said they're okay but there's still something there so why don't I just follow the things that it does have I mean I should at least do that this is God's word I should at least try to do the things it does tell me so bad but this is part of the laws are in bought incarnate their embodied in the language and imagery of their culture and time their laws that assumed a Federation of tribal communities living in the Hill Country of Israel and Judah and Iron Age in agricultural units most humans and most human history now don't live in the social setting assumed by the laws. This is the whole thing so why does a reference book approach to the laws
 don't really allow anybody who didn't live in the original time ever given doesn't like only they could apply them on one level than one sense none of them a fly but in another sense all of them apply what we mean by that is the Lost fit into a unified story and they play a role in with the authors trying to communicate about God God's wisdom and human nature through the cycles of the biblical story and we just looked at what Jesus did with the law that Moses gave about divorce yes and then we did the whole experiment with the law of the captive a captive of War right what you would look at the law like that what do you do with a woman who's captive of war in ancient Israel and you would think I can apply this but we were able to through the lens of how Jesus
 interacted with this these laws were able to discern there is wisdom here wisdom about respecting people's dignity and how Jesus would grab that piece of wisdom and then Crank that and say how do I apply that in the most radical way in my settings so Diego your question is there are some traditions say if a law from the Hebrew Bible isn't quoted repeated in the New Testament then it's not valid so fall quotes what are the Ten Commandment handful of Ten Commandment what about the ones that mean they reference book we're assuming it but viewing the Bible as a unified story and that the laws were viewed as a source of wisdom and all the sudden means that all of the laws apply but in different ways and the reason why Deuteronomy was such a great set of test cases was you can see even huh jesus takes one of the Ten Commandments listen to Toronto me don't murder
 so you could just say well well that applies but look how Jesus what Jesus does with that command is all the sudden he turns it into a dressing issues of contempt and pride superiority and anger it's not so easy as don't take someone's life anymore there's some deep wisdom about respecting humans as being image of God and so in that sense with Jesus sees the Divine wisdom and do not murder I think it's the same process that we are called to undergo with all of the 613 laws where's the Divine wisdom that transcends particular wording or situation of the law and its ancient setting and the transcends that and that's what we traced Jesus doing I really am not being sarcastic when I say but none of them apply and all of them apply none of them apply literally cuz I'm not in ancient Israel I
 however I am an honest relied who follows Israel Messiah so I've been grafted into the family family story The Views these laws and the narratives around them as a source of divine wisdom and so in that sense what would you say to someone who is trying to beat were observant Christian so they do these days they the Eco sure they do Sabbath and I'm sure a bunch of other things as well, and they're just they're going for it yeah I would want to hear more about the story and why there why they're doing that and how they're encountering Jesus as they do that like what he said to the church is it rum
 Eva said like if man if that is the way the pathway for you to express your lord your discipleship to Jesus then double high-five let's be careful that we don't make that the entry
 my card for anyone else cuz that's what Paul was not anti Torah observant right he was anti making culturally exclusive torah-observant the barrier of entry for getting into the coven of family of God that's what that's why he's trying to work out that tree between Israelites the honest tree lights in the house churches around and he says well some will do this day as holy some will not both will do it as an expression of Devotion to Jesus and somehow we need find a way to be unified and cross that boundary and I think me being a nausea non-israelite coming in my family we've adapted all kinds of different practices from the laws of the Torah especially around holidays because we found him so rich and meaningful you know what to do like a Messianic Passover
 or I'm a Messianic Shabbat meal every Friday and we love it I guess it's so life-giving so I could get a little messy but so Diego it's a good question we tried to really go out and look in the podcast episodes but it's worth revisiting in restating and then also related to that question we have another question from Alex and Ontario in the same thing thank you so much for all the work that you do my question is about seeing the law as organized into moral civil and ceremonial aspects which is a common interpretation of the law that is used especially in war reformed and apologetic minded circles based on what you have been saying throughout the series and Deuteronomy I get the impression that that interpretation is not native to the text nor is it a framework that Jesus and the apostles
 Auto Summit Church History like Aquinas did see the law that way is this a faithful way to understand the law as Jesus in the Apostle side can this view live alongside the concept of the law as wisdom that you've been discussing as you've walked through Deuteronomy thanks again question yeah some moral civil ceremonial meaning there are some laws like don't murder there are other laws civil like if someone breaks into your house and it's during the night and you strike them and they die if you're not guilty of murder if you're awesome killed someone before then you owe this much money is a civil laws and ceremonial being all the ritual things related to the Tabernacle so about sacrifices offerings day of atonement purification rituals
 and so I think people make these categories because then you can go okay well then the Civil ones we don't do cuz we're not a nation Christendom well as Jesus new fossils. It wasn't a nation-state ceremonial yeah we don't have the Tabernacle Choir Temple and we don't worship that way we can so we don't apply those lies about their morale if we could just categorize those out then those are the ones we continue to follow and that's what the laws of matter either way it's a variation of what Diego yeah how do we find the ones that weren't supposed to do yeah you're right Alex that organization of the laws in two topics or spears irrelevant something like that it is not how any second temple to just talk about the laws in Jesus name fossils talked about the laws so you can see Jesus talking about the laws about the Sabbath
 the laws about do not murder the laws about picking grain from a field the laws about ritual Purity and hand-washing so I think the wisdom of the unified story leading to the Messiah and then a wisdom reflection on the laws it is is more native to how Jesus the apostles view the laws of the Torah however I think it is I have found that like Triad of categories helpful personally just as a way to categorize them in my mind right but it's not like it's wrong
 but it's it's not the way to find the one that should matter still yeah I think if we're doing that to sort out which ones apply which ones don't think we're back is another variation of the same question I just asked was a new testament authors quote on okay this limit test is can you categorize them as a moral category and neither of them are the right way to figure out how to use these laws which one's better because none of them apply and all them apply the laws are meant for a good about the organization right now I'm working in them in detail for enough room for an upcoming classroom class that I'm going to be teaching them I've been there you're going to be in the second book of Exodus in classroom and all the details of the Tabernacle
 Treasures in Heaven and Earth it's so beautiful it sends my mind to such beautiful places and I love it and what I'm trying to do is embody the same type of wisdom reflection with those Tabernacle detail laws as with the Ten Commandments for example when you say none of them matter but then all the matters I apply apply apply and so when you see it in practice jesus takes them very seriously yes any ramps them up and like
 like almost makes them like more intense than they were yeah because what they are about is life and death it's about it's about the the one command in the Garden of Eden from all the trees do all of them yeah but there's one there is that is a very clear literary thing going on which is the one lot in the Garden of Eden is the Torah that is the instruction and it being it's a synthesis of what then you're going to experience in this whole collection of of laws that are scattered throughout a story and not why is Dollar Tree's enjoy including the Tree of Life of the tree of knowing good and bad that is also good to look at and buy all the trees are
 to look at and desirable for eating it so that even the one tree that's prohibited looks as good and tasty as all the others but there's no instruction there do you think this particular way though it may seem counterintuitive and reading it as wisdom literature saying
 I want to learn to discern good and bad through God's wisdom not by taking it on my own terms yes yeah 42 and it's always skipped over them if we did what if you'd like let your neighbor borrow your donkey but then you know what a bear or something you know malls it how do you make things right and all that stuff about the stuff of life but really they're just a little mini narrative that are giving you case studies for like what does it mean to do right by my neighbor and living community together when things go wrong yeah yeah Jesus Took observing the laws of the Torah very seriously he says the one who you know ignores a lot of the toy will be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven but the whole question that's a steak is what does it mean to live by the laws of the Torah and then he gives you six case studies
 tell you what he means which is not what it seems to me in on Facebook about you cuz do not murder seems very simple but then jesus takes it way deeper and it does that six more times it seemed simple but even that gets complicated for people death penalty a totally wore in that direction yeah it's all about how you contempt and pride and anger you so what I discern and I know that just from my own experience when I was first learning how to make sense of the Bible is and it's the ears to John this conversation we had for years has hundreds of these commands if I have a reference book Behavior manual view of the Bible the Bible exist to tell me in the form of direct instruction what to do and what not to do you just forget the narrative just take things from here and there and that approach will lead to an internally contradictory
 inconsistent use of the Bible that produces the kind of diversity and division that are in so many Christian Traditions today and it doesn't seem like that's how Jesus the apostles engage the laws of the Torah so they're different Traditions have developed different tools that can be more helpful last helpful and so the moral civil ceremonial is a helpful Organization for some things but I don't think it leads us to really see what Jesus in the apostles are doing with the loss is just good it's just Perpetual I think it will be ongoing until the new creation but it's a dynamic that's right there in the New Testament and it's it's important for all of us as we met on the loss of joy
 1 helpful resources but helpful for me is Christopher J H writes book I'm Old Testament ethics for the people of God c h r a b c d j 80 J and I didn't read it correctly about the style of wisdom reflection and he especially addresses issues of civil law in the Hebrew Bible as having so much wisdom for how Christians think about Justice the economy of the more societal issues and it says he's so wise and insightful and he is an embodiment of this Paradigm so that's a great help a book on Old Testament law and ethics a question about a law from Kate in Washington
 flight from Vancouver Washington my question is regarding the law of the Harvest in the second movement of Deuteronomy where they say in 2314 through 15. If you go into your neighbor's been here to feel you may eat your fill that you pluck with your hands but essentially you can't Harvest also in 24 19 through 22 gives instructions on how to leave part of your Harvest for basically any people that don't have land is this significant in Matthew 12:1 through eight when Jesus and his disciples plucks a grain with their hands on a Sabbath since they were essentially Nomads with no land thank you so much for all you do and have a blessed day
 hate okay was there a little literary hyperlinks with Jesus the story of plucking the grains and what's happening in his law and do ya still good cuz I definitely like definitely seeing is Jesus and the disciples are cruising on on the Sabbath and they are plucking grain kernel of of Wheel of slick the first time for me but this happened to me where I was able to do such a thing was just us last summer a really yeah through Greenfield yeah yeah it takes a family trip and we were staying a couple nights in the rural area and we would take evening walks along this country road along Wheatfield it was and the time of year it was midnight summer and so they
 fat black heads of rain so I do we just grab them and we were do they were so good and the wheat berries or the week they were big they like the size of raisins the berry but it's a see if you know what I see it's so funny I don't even know we're talkin about is how far away I remove some of the things that I eat before I was strolling on the road but if you seen you seen the picture I want a picture of but the you know the Little Flower Rings or amber waves of grain and so when we would take off of the stock and pull in your pull out the husk the chaff and then the little wheat seed of the week it was like big as the shape of it it looks kind of like a piece of pop like I'm pop popcorn
 Colonel the taller Yakima Colonel little taller and soft as it would be nice match it down and turn the cornflakes you smash it you could turn in all kinds of stuff. Anyway it's good like they tasted so good and I was so it was me and my two boys walking on his road and I just it was exactly the story about Jesus and Matthew 7:12 a can on some weekends I mean in my mind I was like is there some angry landowner who's going to come anyway so that was all beside the point your question Kate is really on point so Jesus and his disciples cruising Along on Sabbath and they're having a snack from somebody's field they don't know
 and the Pharisees see this and they accuse Jesus of working on the Sabbath was very clear rules about what does does not cost to work on the Sabbath so side from the Sabbath this year so there's a whole Sabbath debate going on with links to other healing on the Sabbath and things that she's still on the Sabbath but the fact that Jesus and disciples are described as taking bits of not harvesting just plucking connects to a number of laws yeah and Deuteronomy about doing that and it's for sure relevant and so you're right Kate the fact that Jesus and the disciples have renounced land ownership Jesus didn't renounce his family so he did distance himself you know who are my mother and sister and brothers those who do the will of God through Jesus pronounced land ownership and joined himself his movement
 recruited many of his followers and disciples from among the non landed class for sick people immigrants non landowner in the. So he made his kingdom crew is for sure connected to these laws of Jesus identifying himself with those on the margins of Israeli Society is very similar to how an exodus Yahweh identifies his name and reputation with a group of enslaved immigrants and not with the powers that's a great little inside Kate and I think you're exactly right it's not the point of that controversy which is more about the Sabbath but it's the little side parallel them is pretty cool. Okay, what's good Tim and John this is Vaughn from Long Island New York now in DC in the gospels when Jesus tempted by Satan he responds by reference
 Deuteronomy three times is this seemed connected in some way to the Deuteronomy scene of preparation to enter the promised land looking forward to hearing your thoughts piece or all three of us is from Deuteronomy alone but by every word out what happened in numbers right in the test about bread Jesus quotes from Deuteronomy chapter 8 which is Yahweh saying Israel I led you through the Wilderness giving a Mana to teach you that humans don't live on bread alone then the tester takes Jesus up to the top of the world which is symbolic of the world and
 sexy quotes a song that hymn Psalm 91 in Jesus quotes back at him Deuteronomy 6 don't test the Lord your God and then the Diablo of the slanderer takes him to a high mountain shows him all the kingdoms of the world and he says go quotes you shall Worship the Lord your God and serve him only from Deuteronomy chapter 6 yeah three tests which fits into the motif of biblical characters facing moments of decision Choice testing often associated with the third three times and also 40 to 40 days in the wilderness three tests 3 and 40 are associated repeated pattern with testing stories and so for Israel and going into the Wilderness to get to kind of his point is about going into Exile in a way it's like going out into the unknown to the baron
 uncultivated land dance oh yeah that's right people to be able to enjoy the abundance of the of the of the of the land yeah that's right which 4-H Israel was was a very specific place and they got to go into yep for the people in the story The Torah if it's in it's a Eaton if it fits into the pattern the cycling of patterns of finding Eden of finding an eating spot to have known her spot where God meets his people with abundance presents provision Security in shalam this is the Land Theme video that we've yet to make his father's present Jesus as I was going through the waters of baptism just like Israel going through the Jordan River
 oh yeah Jesus baptized in the Jordan River then Into the Wilderness for time of testing just like Israel was in the wilderness for 40 years Jesus is in the wilderness for forty days and then is this rug goes into the promised land Jesus go starts going about in the land announcing the arrival of the kingdom of God so you're right Von there's a deliberate parallelism that the gospel authors are create yeah between Jesus and the story of his preparations a great word for it and all of those are built back on Adam and Eve who were put in the garden and then given a choice that force them to undergo a test and they failed that test and it resulted in going out into the Wilderness and so Israel is invited to undo the replay in Reverse okay we play Traverse your test is in the wilderness to come back until late in Jesus's test and they stay lit
 and so Jesus is both reversing Adam and Eve's failure to enjoy the land cuz of their Folly and Disobedience and then he's off the reversing Israel's failure then what school is when Jesus goes out of that testing and he announces the arrival of the kingdom of God what he starts doing is providing eating stuff food for 1,000 people abundant right here chilling rehearsing the bodily conditions that would prevent people from being able to go to the temple and becomes president he didn't start a movement to take the land over again no no rather he said what Eden actually is is a can arrive and break in anywhere I am in people start living the way I invite them to and so that is the Promise Land that Jesus is inviting people enter into
 the email and the correspondents to Eden and the promised land in in Jesus's time is not a place but it's a relationship you enter with the kingdom bring her no matter where you are and no matter where you are two or three of you can be together and I'll be right there in the middle like the tree of life will be in the middle anyway so it's cool wave at Promise Land imagery gets transformed in in the Jesus story Super Bowl thank you for an item and John my name is Madison and I live in Allen Texas my question comes from episode 4 of the series going through the Deuteronomy scroll in the broader wisdom behind the laws and using that in light of the rest of scripture to inform how we live centuries later as you talked about the destruction of the asherah poles and altars on the
 places in Deuteronomy 12 to through three discouraging adultery against the marriage covenant with Yahweh my mind was drawn to Jesus's statement and Matthew 5:29 230 he says to tear out your eye or chop off your hand if it leads you to commit adultery against your spouse is Jesus drawing his audience's attention back to the Torah here and modernizing the underlying wisdom if you will are there other passages he's linking to thank you for your dedication to a faithful reading and understanding of the scriptures you helped me become curious and fascinated by Yahweh in his word okay so she's referring to refresh me Deuteronomy 12 it's about going to the land and just tear everything down and it's kind of like this violent like and we were trying to say hey let's be careful not to just apply this to some sort of new like cleansing yeah yeah yeah when you go into the land you're going to find these markers and shrub
 find the other gods to other deities that dedicate this space and service in an allegiance to that spiritual power and when you come across those Shrine tear them down because you always going to create one place in the middle of the land that dedicates all the land to the Yahweh alone that's Deuteronomy 12 and I think we talked about how would this be a reason to go and find a church you don't agree with and tear down of what I took me how Jesus didn't read those walls this way I think you're right were you see this aggressive even violent language picked up by Jesus or by the apostles is in the relationship 2
 moral compromise moral failure and in our relationship to the principalities and Powers law calls them are the powers of sin flesh and the devil super Jesus that's the exactly right that aggressive mentality is reflected in Jesus's command of his own body no mixing and giving Legions to other gods and Hebrew Bibles to fix it as adultery and if your eye or your hand leads you into objectifying another human sexually for your own personal desire and if you're married then that's a form of adultery for Jesus According To Jesus then to get aggressive chop down that Paul will adopt it like in his letter to the Galatians with Ilse execute put to death the desires of The Flash
 big conversation we had a couple times in Deuteronomy that the aggressive language of the conquest of the Canaanites is directed at the Giants specifically and at the deities to which the promised land was dedicated and that's where the focus of aggression is not the Jesus the Apostle's have done a lot of reflection on that and they mirror that in their own echoing of those laws the job Madison way to go file is like a elementary school teacher there be a little gold star sticker that I would put on the screen right here talk to you like this is well beyond Elementary School like I'll get the stickers sticker
 this question is from Days Inn Indiana my question comes from Deuteronomy 31 21 which in the English Standard Version reads and when many evils and troubles come upon them this song shall confront them as a witness for a live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring my question is when in the Bible do we see the prophets using the song to confront the people do you think Phineas use the song and the judges 17 through 21 stories to confront the people thanks this is lost remember the songs of Moses we did a whole hour talking about the song of Moses and it's when God tells Moses hey these people are going to betray
 Covenant betray me fall over the gods that's why Moses would be a poor Locker Room codes on the song by songs about to come to your mind upon and write it down and it will be when they betray me and all the curses of a covenant come upon them this song will stand there written centuries before bearing witness against the trail to say you know you knew what would come if you betrayed me and it came and it's like a witness like a courtroom witness that's the passage so Dave you're asked when do we see the prophets using the song to the people ask a question so you're right when you read through the former prophets Joshua Judges Samuel gettings the language of the song doesn't seem hyperlinked in the messages of any of the prophets that appear
 in the stories so you mentioned Finn yes but also there's all kinds of other profetica Priestly characters that come but what's once you turn to the ladder profits every one of the four big prophetic Scrolls Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and the 12 prophets are hyperlinked Deuteronomy 32 the rhythm of this song and then Isaiah it's the opening lines Isaiah really where he says he's so go spend 20 minutes just reading Deuteronomy 32 upload it and then just go read Isaiah chapter 1 and literally the opening words listen o Heavens here first
 the Lord speaks and that's what Moses says he says I call Heaven and Earth as witness against you today Isaiah goes on Sons I have raised and brought up but they have revolted against me remember this team and Deuteronomy 32 which is they are my sons who are not actually my son's yeah okay in the whole poem is about who are my sons and then the son that I raised it he has a Remnant let's see later in the Paw me talks about your land has become desolate your cities burned with fire strangers devour your Fields it's a desolation overthrown is all language from the middle of Moses's song
 He Likens Israelites to Sodom and Gomorrah which is what Moses does the same thing in the in the song so that's just a couple examples of random but Jeremiah is permeated with the language Deuteronomy in a huge way the song exercised a big influence on Ezekiel Ezekiel takes the references to idolatry as adultery and he does he composes easy elaborate poems Ezekiel 16 23 those are the most sexually
 graphic and I actually in Hebrew Bible times pornographic and the whole Bible like really disturbing sexual imagery and he's there hyperlinking to these really profound images of idolatry is adultery in Deuteronomy 32 yeah, we didn't hit that one in Sunday school and how wide it is interesting question when you read through the history is presented in the form of profit the song doesn't come up in the speeches of the prophets it's in the four big climactic moment anyway here's the song and it's going to instruct Israel has been fail and then you're going to like read a lot of Scrolls of failure in the sun doesn't show the effect or the the story that the song
 you want to play out in the stories that you read but it's in the prophetic collection Scrolls that Deuteronomy 32 really starts popping up again and I've been pondering the significance of that for a while and up there's probably more to it that I just haven't thought about not yet there is also that all of the the three big prophet Isaiah Jeremiah is heki all they all have stories about the prophet in the Scrolls to and all of them are hyperlinked to most of the story in different ways all of them have moments where they see the appearance of God's glory like Moses did all of them resist their calling in different ways and all of them suffer in different ways that are similar but also different from the profits are presented as like the end of Deuteronomy thirty-four Prophet like Moses kind of but no profit was ever fully black Moses
 anyway so in a way Deuteronomy 32 is used by the prophets just in the lot of profits especially that one last question Jordan from the great state of Oregon as some people call it you know there's a town in southern Wisconsin when I lived in Madison Wisconsin for grad school there a town says Wisconsin called Oregon and that's how it's okay that's why I was talking to a guy on the phone from that area and he said oh you're gone I do you know who has to work and he does not around here it's not I thought I was like correcting him and he's like no like we you're wrong it's Oregon it does make more sense of how it's spelled anyway Jordan your question this is Jordan hooton from Portland Oregon by question is on Deuteronomy 29
 one where it says these are the words of the Covenant Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab besides the Covenant that he had made with them at Horeb is this a different Covenant from Horeb or is it the same one Revisited in light of the prophetic hope of a New Covenant thanks case is pretty specific question about 1 verse in Deuteronomy so I don't care I'm just going to what up I'm going to pull up thank you this is a great example of one little line opens a whole universe of conversation so Deuteronomy 29 one we heard Jordan say about all these again these are the words of the Covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab besides the Covenant which he made with them at Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai
 so here's Moses there in Moab cuz it's like a staging ground before they go into Israel and so he's going to give them coming in here that's right and it's a new audience new audiences because the people do people of the next generation of people that he's speaking to they are they were the children their children when they were at Mount Sinai second gen Covenant Keepers so this is an interesting line so in other words did Moses actually broke to Covenant between God and us around like he has both here's the Covenant from Horeb and he's how I'm giving you another cup, Nanaimo app is very interesting remember how began with saying hey here's Moses and he is on you know in the land of Moab and he undertook to expound or exposit make legible
 make an explainer Explain the law of the Torah so and and he says now Yahweh Our God spoke to us at Horeb so you always entered into this Covenant with us with all of us and become it is a lock code the terms of the Covenant are expressed in The Wasp that's right but Moses is going to begin explaining and adapting the laws for the kind of life that they're going to live once they settle in the promised land would be different than the wife that their parents had to leave in the wilderness or are we saying that the story gets even Messier when we think about like what what was some ancient Constitution like cuz there was the first generation by Covenant lock code agreement at Horeb with Israel is Israelites in the wilderness
 but just you get one generation down in the story and Moses is like all right I'm going to adapt to this and where we got a new covenant well so that's the question question question is what Moses doing at Moab is it being described here in Deuteronomy 29 verse one as an additional Covenant cuz it says the word is beside where do you have besides in it in addition to the next two years as fascinating is a lot of it comes down to what are the words being referred to when it says these are the where it's kind of moment if you look at the footnote that's provided hear what you're told is in the Hebrew text in the verse chapter and verse numbering in the medieval Hebrew Hebrew manuscripts in our English translations is Deuteronomy 29 verse one is in Hebrew Deuteronomy 29:29 other words it's the end
 the previous chapter
 this is a good example of how or where is the chapter be in and then is this sentence if the sentence is this the conclusion of the previous or is it the introduction to the following literary unit and Architectural Witnesses disagree so there are a number of manuscripts that clearly give signals that the sentence was understood as the conclusion of the long Covenant ceremony remember you go up on the two hills yeah and you yelled back and forth and then the long announcement of Covenant blessings coming at Chris's and if you read that as those were the words of the Covenant the words of the Covenant are describing the ceremony that they go up and do once they get into the land and then that kind of makes sense to sort of like well there was a covenant part 1 yeah and I hear this kind of ritual that I'm giving you two go and then perform
 that sits beside the coming of her one that's right or is it the introduction to chapter 29 and that's how in the Greek translation tradition Greek Scholars and translated Deuteronomy viewed this as the beginning of the unit and they numbered it that way and then I was followed in the Vulgate and Christian Bibles to our Modern English translations are based on medieval Hebrew manuscripts and also Dead Sea Scrolls and all of them view this line at the end of chapter 28 so even though our English translations are based on those Hebrew manuscript the chapter markers are based off of the Greek translation translation bibles are actually a combination of so much history manuscript History Jordan we're still not to the heart of your question this is just Why
 play cabinets are there but the reason why the chapter numbers are verse numbers are different is because of that interesting history so the question is this is the narrator talking and they seem to Envision that on both either side to Mount Sinai there's two ways of thinking about the covenants that Moses brokered there's Covenant part 1 free golden calf and pre Wilderness rebellions but then after the golden calf and after the Wilderness rebellions is this a re-evaluation deepening of that first Covenant or is it somehow distinct that's that's the question so Jordan you're familiar with the work of John Sal Hammer clearly he was a Hebrew Bible scholar of blessed memory is with Jesus now you can just talk to Jesus about the Hebrew Bible and so he had a big influence on me so maybe you sent that
 Jordan and so you're asking this question too so just take on this verse was actually this is the introduction to the following chapters with where Moses says I know you're going to break the Covenant but yahweh's not going to let your sin and Rebellion cancels purposes so he's going to raise up a righteous remnant of servants through whom he's going to make atonement for the land and the people and that that is the Covenant the Moab Covenant that Moses is talking about here so I've gone back and forth whether that is a compelling way to read this and I haven't been able to find any other Hebrew Bible scholars who agree with that if you normally you know that doesn't necessarily say a lot cuz there could be somebody who sees it right and everybody else is wrong and possible so I haven't been persuaded overtime but that's exactly what what's going on here but I am open to learn more
 I'm not aware it's on time or ever wrote more done pack of you about the meaning of this verse and if you did Jordan I would love to know if there's more if there's more there is the difference really is is it possible that these final chapters of Deuteronomy that Envision the failure of Israel and Yahweh providing for that failure so that the company can be fulfilled in the future if that's what the Moab Covenant was about whereas the Sinai Covenant was already broken into set up to fail is that already of you that that work in the Torah I don't know if that makes any sense what I just said yeah I feels like what we were talking about is at the end of the day not that important as a cash is out to what it means to live by the wisdom of the Torah but we are concerned here with what is what's the view of the Covenant of Mount Sinai that's being put forward by the final shape of
 there was obviously yeah there's actually two events there was a covenant kind of ceremony at Sinai and now there's this New Covenant ceremony happening as they prepare to go into land and being told what to do when they get in the land and how does to relate to each other I feel like what we're trying to discern interesting but as it pertains to what's the wisdom underneath any of this I don't know how essential the question is that you know this is may be similar to what happens between spouses sometimes we're going to have these moments usually it's me not paying attention being dimwitted in like not really understanding what she's saying and so we reach this kind of point where I realize that that's what has happened and so I and so I get real pragmatic
 okay so I misunderstood you fundamentally and I'm still sorry I think I get you now enough let's move on to like we could move forward so that I could like do whatever the thing is what you really trying to tell me or we could take another 15 minutes so I could really understand everything you were trying to say that I missed out on how much it hurt you yeah I did exactly right so maybe that's kind of but it's important to know what somebody actually meant sure you're okay and the same time I'm pragmatic level you could under you could read the laws of the Torah and not have to sort out this question that Jordan is Raising I think but it is an important question in the last question it if feels like a 500-level question maybe we've got a lot of 500 level sure that's well that's the Torah
 that's Deuteronomy well but we finished though we're going to have one more but we're going to have one more okay there it is so actually yeah we are going to go back through and there's a lot of questions we didn't answer so many and so next week we'll do a bonus toric you and I are at the end of the year we're getting we're getting creative and we're going to do one more two and I have two that are released next week and we'll arrange the whole Torah great questions that came in that we still want to address so we'll be back with more of this in the next episode but thanks for listening this week we love hearing your questions and we do all of this because you make it possible with your support of our Patron Community with many many of you to listen are apart of
