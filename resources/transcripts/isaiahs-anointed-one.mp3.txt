which racing the theme of the anointed in the story of the Bible that the people were chosen by God to be a bridge between Heaven and Earth the character who gets the most are time as be anointed one in the Hebrew Bible is King David but David isn't the final anointed one in fact and 2nd Samuel 7 God promises David but the final anointed one will not be David but will come from his family life and how old is Emily final anointed one will come and Crush evil what you learn here is that if any of the seed from the line of David Violette this Covenant Lavon or blows it in some way then that's going to correct them but his loyal love won't depart from the lineage so this is setting you up for the whole story of David son who rule in Jerusalem starting with Solomon and then he goes on to commit iniquity just like Adam and Eve or just like saw they forfeit opportunity
 themselves to be that ruler but what God says is my loyal love won't depart from your seat it's just the opportunity gets passed to the Next Generation David Sons kept on failing and Israel gets more and more corrupt until God let them get carried off into Exile and so now with no land and no Kings how will God be faithful to his promise to David well the prophet Isaiah writes that God will bring a new date Rule and a new way what Isaiah beliefs we need is not just a new king from the line of David we know what those guys are mostly like what we need is another David he won't look like a royal glorious are from the line of David ruling in Jerusalem that's not going to be like that somehow that rule is going to look like somebody who is rejected isn't Honorable in the eyes of important people and he identified
 with people in their suffering and grief the new David will bring Justice and crush the serpent once and for all but it won't be by brute force or military power anointed servant is going to accomplish Justice for the Nations but like you wouldn't pick him out in a crowd with interesting is it uses what you would think would be like violent imagery with a sword he will strike his enemies but what is striking and slaying with are his words his words will bring about order his words will push back chaos and disorder in death in the land today to Maggie and I are talking about the portraits of the new David in the scroll of Isaiah I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us.
 hey John I did normally you're the first one to say hey Tim wow and chipper this morning I know you just on it great hi we're talking about the theme of the anointed and if I remember correctly we were talking about David and that was what type of last because David out of any character in the Hebrew Bible who is called the anointed one yeah well he gets the most page time as an anointed figure yeah and he's got some great stories. Just showcase him as a guy kind of gets it gets what it means to be courageous to be faithful to God to be in a patient and wise and you just kind of like makes all these
 great moves as the anointed one they was kind of rude for me like that is you know in the meantime I realized that I have a rationale for why Focus it on David it's pretty simple that I actually didn't say show me about to say I hear the word anointed one or Messiah as a noun appears just a quick search here 39 times in the Hebrew Bible in the noun anointed one, it occurs three times in Leviticus to refer to the high priest and then if you're just looking for the distribution of those occurrences it goes from three hits in Leviticus tease me for four hits in Leviticus
 and then it just moves to 1st Samuel 1 hit two hits 3 hits 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 the second Samuel to rain today at 45601 and then Chronicles switches recycling the ones that were in Samuel and then the rest of them are in the Book of Psalms Psalms scroll and the ones in the Psalms are all about David to wear the king's from line of David or some like maybe even some teacher David future David exactly so another words the vast majority three-quarters of all of the occurrences of the word messiah in the Hebrew Bible are somehow related to the story of David As Told in Samuel and then reflected a pond with in the song scroll
 where David is a major figure so if you want to talk about the anointed in the Hebrew Bible do not talk about the high priest and then you got to talk about David and then you got to talk about the role that David plays with then goes the prophets and the writings in the Psalms so that's what we're going to do in these two episodes that lay ahead we reflected on the Samuel story of David last episode and you're right the portrait is surprising Israel wants a king and so they get a king according to their own desires in the person that's tall is the first anointed one but he turns out to be like another Adam and Eve who does what's good in his eyes and so he forfeits his opportunity to rule as God's image and so Yahweh chooses another anointed one and that's David and the key portrait that I wanted to focus our attention on was the image of David
 being privately anointed as becoming heaven on Earth representative of God's rule in Israel but he consistently wealth that private anointing slowly starts to become evident to others especially to the reigning King saw and it becomes this long story of God's real anointed one waiting patiently to persecution and suffering from his own Brothers wandering in the wilderness hiding in caves Waiting for God to exhaust him he's not going to take matters into his own hands and that's where we kind of left things last time so that portrait of the suffering patient anointed one who waits for God to bring about his public exaltation that's like crucial to the theme of the anointed one in the story of David the fact that he was privately anointed
 and had to patiently wait for the realization of his anointing with everyone else yeah and he was tempted to become impatient couple times but luckily he had either his conscience or profit or his a wise woman like Abigail to speak wisdom and to encourage him to trust in God and not his sort order his own plans cool I'm glad you highlighted that cuz I wasn't thinking about that and that's seems really key and it's interesting that the other way that Samuel the same as scroll would tell the story really does focus on this in-between state or David's annointed but he's not yet King and how he deals with that 15 chapters of 1st Samuel 16 2 the end of the scroll in chapter 31
 and saw dies in that last chapter and then remember 1st and 2nd Samuel are divided up a separate books in our Bibles but they are one continuous later I work so 2nd Samuel begins was David lamenting over the death of Saw even though the guy was chasing him trying to kill him you know the last few years and then the tribes come around him and make David King so what's up with that why is the narrative giving so much air time to this long. Of suffering waiting
 the must be something about with a way that God's Heavenly rules brought to Earth through that kind of anointed figure must be really important to these authors and we're going to see that same idea of the patient waiting suffering anointed one is the same idea brought forward and Isaiah scroll will look up in this conversation and also in the portrait of David and his future seed in the Psalms scroll which will look at in the next and the reason again for doing this is when we turn to the New Testament Christ Messiah anointed one is the main title applied to Jesus by the New Testament authors not by Jesus himself he avoided title but people use it of him answer the question is what is that word supposed to conjure up in our imaginations like what are the Back stories
 that we are to see there and so that's what I'm trying to help us fill in that the Hebrew Bible gives us a pretty robust backstory around someone who got the oil of God's Heavenly oils and spirit poured upon them so they can represent him on Earth so with that I'm going to turn our attention to an important promise that God made to David that is going to be really important for understanding the theme of the anointed servant in the scroll of Isaiah
so important moment and David story is after he patiently Waits and he is exalted in God's time to become king over the tribes in 2nd Samuel chapter 7 David has now established Jerusalem as the capital city he brought the Tabernacle that Moses you know oversaw the construction in the Ark of the Covenant he brought it there and that was a bumpy ride to get it there but he eventually did and 2nd Samuel chapter 7 begins with David expressing his desire to God that he wants to make God a really nice palace like I've got Capital City you know why should you always still live in that old tent that wandered around the Wilderness centuries-old now it is pretty tattered keep it up I know they do there's so much that's not sad about the Tabernacle
 in the story line this just kind of kind of there but not described mentioned every once in awhile but the impulse here is hey I'm King now we've got this nice city we got some resources like let me play make you a nice place God and what God responds back to David is I'm really happy with my tent thank you very much. It's cozy is my paraphrase what he says did I ever ask or tell any of the leaders of Israel to make me a house like I'm good with the 10 and then got flipped it and he says I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you I'm going to build you a house using the same word so the word house in Hebrews to buy it and refer to a physical building the word for the temple to House of Yahweh
 but it also can refer to a household in the way we would use that word in English strikes meaning of people or family going to build you a house and then these are there going to be kind of like a launching pad for the development of the hoped-for anointed servant both and Isaiah and Anna songs crawl so this is Channel 7 verse 8 know this is what you will say to my servant David God's talking to his Prophet Nathan thank God say this to David this is what Yahweh of host says I took you from the pastor from behind the Sheep to be ruler Over My People Israel I have been with you wherever you have gone
 I've cut off all your enemies from before you one of them was the king of Israel salt and I will make you a great name
 please be suspicious of people having a great name but member it's all about how you get it having a name that people respect to recognize it's a good thing was a good one Imran wanted to do it no more the Babylonians right let us make a name for ourselves so got scouters that project but then what did you do in the next chapter tells Abraham he's going to make his name right now he says he's going to make delete PS3 says yes what God says David here is exactly what he said Abraham Abraham is going to receive a promise ring them or they Browns Broncos so I'll make you a great name meaning I'm going to make you an important person I'm going to make you do something with you and through you that will make it so that these two guys sitting on the west coast of the United States
 33000 years later are going to be talking into microphone sindri telling your story so a great name means becoming someone worthy of
 being known through history yeah your name is your reputation a reputation and the story attached to your name is also probably something very Concrete in terms of the real life experience some of the great name where you can people respect to you you can get into places you can do things to do with longevity and you're enduring Legacy because it's equivalent to long life humans only live for so long or short 70 80 years according to Psalm 98 but then after that you're gone but if you have a great name people will remember you it's more like you live on through the perpetuation of the name it's a form of life beyond death and that's part of notoriety I didn't read the second half of the sentence of God says I'll make you David a great name like
 names of the Great men who are in the land the other kings of the Kings the time I mean you know how many people lived back then and how many were talking about today small micro fraction of them I will also appoint a place for My People Israel and I will plant them that's Garden of Eden language yeah except now the people aren't the plants going to plant people that they can live in their own place not be disturbed nor will the wicked afflict them anymore this is what Pharaoh did two Israelites in Egypt in the Book of Judges Affliction is what all of the different oppressors do when Israel and over
 even from the day that I come in to judge has to be over My People Israel
 I will give you rest from all your enemies this is starting to sound like Aiden to get an a garden like Plantation of people there's no more snakes and bad guys and you're given rest no it's no name is a verb in the land has he will make a house for you when your days are complete you will lie down with your father's I will raise up your seed after you will come out of your belly I will establish his kingdom and he will build a house for my name
 and I will establish the Throne of his kingdom forever notice the house in the name come up again so you want to build a house for me I'll tell you something I'm going to make a house for you and give you a great name
 and out of that house will come a seed and then that seed will establish my name and my house so we just want David SOS interesting in version I've never quite noticed it's that tracked you want to build me a house I'll give you a house in the name so that you produce a seed who will build a house for my name that's the program yeah it's so it's kind of two levels of meaning and awake going on here because on one level David's going to have a son Solomon who's going to build the temple that's right that's coming and you can go cool this is about David's son Solomon he's going to build the temple for God
 leaving the David wanted to do it. Said no not you but you're seeing yep but seems like there's another something even more interesting perhaps about I mean it's almond make God's name great establishes Throne forever when he dedicates the temple he quotes this line and says yeah it's me it's me I'm the one God told my dad that this would happen and here I am doing the thing that God said. Gozon however and says I will be a father to him that is to that Seed where you jump forward or this is the next rest I'll be a father to him but his to that future seed and he will be a son to me sweet the father-son relationship this is all Adam Adam language really back in Genesis chapter 5
 God made Adam In His Image in the image of God he created them male and female then Adam knew his wife and had a son in His image and he named him Seth So Adam being the image of God set on an LG to Seth being the Son and the image of Adam so for God to call another human son you're saying is I mean all humanity is are his sons in their way so what does it mean more particularly forgot to call someone a son yeah it's about the seam of selection or election called all Israel my first born son to challenge pharaoh to let my first born son go so when God chooses and selects a special Covenant partner out of the money one way of describing that intimate bond is the father-son language
 what all the good stuff about this I'll be a father to him he'll be a son to me when he commits an equity I will correct him with a human rod and with The Strokes of the sons of Adam
 so when the seed that comes from you if they blow it then I'm going to let some other humans come and walk them strike them and it'll be my allowing it to happen so the gods correction but he says my loyal love will not depart from your seed like I took it away from Saw who I removed from before you your house and your kingdom will endure before me forever yours from the stablish forever amen and amen so what you learn here is that if any of the seed from the line of David violates this Continental Bond or blows it in some way then they're God's going to cry but his loyal love won't depart from the lineage so this is setting you up for the whole story of David sons who ruled Jerusalem
 and starting to Solomon and he's going to be like yeah it's me and then he goes on to God says here commit an equity or 60 they forfeit opportunity for themselves to be that ruler but what God says is my loyal love won't depart from your seed it's just the opportunity gets passed to the Next Generation that's how the pattern of stories Works through the book of kings and that's very much all this is like top-of-mind when you turn to the Isaiah scroll so is this God saying I'm not going to give up on what cuz there's been this pattern of with Adam and Eve they blow it and got it and give up on them but if there's a consequence and then the resolution of the problem they created
 is pitched forward as a hope for the Next Generation the seed woman I mean this is exactly parallel and that there will be a seed coming who will resolve the problem that has been created by previous generations Abraham's family same thing I got promises him great name his family will bless the nation's they don't always make the best decisions but he kind of persists even to the point of with Abraham's grandson Jacob like there's a string on wrestling match yeah like I was wondering what were meditating on is the fact that for God to engage in a real partnership with humans
 means that there are real like they're real steaks and the any given generation can truly blow it and take themselves out of the running but that will not affect you always ultimate Eternal long-term plan to raise up a seed from this line and that's surely what is being referred to here so you know it's really nice though one of us all and what he says it's all as listen I raised you up for this purpose and you blew it so watching the storm from you so why does David and his line get all these Second Chances yeah I know it feels like unfair
 feel slimy all of it feels unfair as much as build consistent and it makes you wonder like I'm with you I think we're here to the theme that we Works through with the first one like why Abel and not can why you know Isaac but not Ishmael there's something about us all being the tall Warrior King in the people wanted the Mixels you know failure just disqualify him but somehow the runt King who is persecuted that nobody wanted when that guy is exalted here and then the logic of the story is God never chose that first born or like you always kind of his choosing yeah that's right from the beginning choosing the delete that likely a story. No it's all and I think it even says here that well I don't know
 remember the reason why I saw was chosen was cuz the people demanded a king so that we can be like the other nations and so
 God gives them what they want a war as it appears that what God wanted was a king like David I'm not trying to tie a bow and he turbo on this also we need to remember the narrator's Viewpoint of this is centuries in the future looking back and what they can see is this pattern in their history that the only lineage that endured in terms of royalty was this family of David throughout the centuries even though many of those kings are idolaters and unjust and how do you explain that the kingdom lasted as long as it did I'm asking as if I'm in the mindset of biblical authors and they attribute it to you always protection and promise but also the tribute the downfall of the monarchy to Yahweh as well and that's in the storyline the rod of men. So what this
 promise, sets up then is as you read through the story of Solomon and then the Kings from live David after him it's sort of like each one steps up to the plate to use a American baseball metaphor and you know some strikeout all three to strike out at once some get a gun with Facebook yeah they said they get the first base Call Me Maybe get the second third Hills to Temple the only other kings and maybe get the second or third base is Josiah Hezekiah and kind of guy Mesa but Hezekiah in particular lived during the time of an Israelite Prophet named you saw who
 Isaiah but we call him something about having Yahoo at the end your name in the English my dad would call it was like kind of a name for somebody who is silly or ridiculous or Yahoo Yahoo my dad oh I don't know it doesn't come from his name I think it comes from the house so This Promise of an enduring came from the line of David will be the Fulfillment of the snake crushing hopes from Genesis like that's worth the whole Hebrew Bibles tearing you up to this family this guy this lineage and these tanks and King Hezekiah lived during the time of Isaiah the prophet and in his days Jerusalem was spared from a huge Juggernaut of an Empire
 Assyria is Hezekiah day yeah and Hezekiah in the scroll of Isaiah becomes an important like a new David and narrative image of suffering anointed servant who Waits patiently for y'all way to deliver him and the city and so this starts to lay tracks for a whole thread of thought about the anointed one who will come in the future who will be like a new David and like a new Hezekiah so we don't have time to trace the whole theme for Isaiah I thought we could touch down and Sample a few passages cuz they're awesome and cuz Jesus and the authors of his story in the gospels definitely thought that these texts were awesome
so I'll begin with one text we've read many times over the years so I don't know how long this will take I was say let's just go briefly it's never a brief but this isn't Isaiah chapter 11 the first man kind of block literary movement and Isaiah is chapters 1 through 39 or 1:35 but one through 12 is kind of the First Symphony movement as wear and this one right here we're going to read is the culmination to one of the first major units and Isaiah and Linda paragraph right before the Yahweh is going to bring that human rod in the form of Assyria to come start chopping down the forests of Judah that's damaged here so when all of Israel and Judah is getting laid low and cut down what we learned in Isaiah 11 verse 1 is that a Little Chute a branch
 will emerge out from the stump of Jesse Brother David is the father of David and a branch from its roots will bear fruit so we're depicting a future fruit branch of a tree stump of a tree yeah so this is you know when the tree gets cut down the forests and then give it 3 years and they'll be a little mini trees coming out of it, and out of it. That's kind of the fridge so the stump is Jesse so that is what Isaiah believes we need is not just a new king from the line of David we know what those guys are mostly like what we need is another Dave or David come from
 the spirit of Yahweh will rest on him real quick we haven't talked about the oil in the spirit yet in our recap of this episode but in this whole series what we saw is that the first anointing in the Bible is when liquid Yahweh provides liquid life for the dry land when he plants the Garden of Eden and then he provides Spirit life to the human and that liquid anointing and that Spirit anointing are associated ideas so hear the word anointing isn't used because the anointing is happening with the spirit not with oil that's like the ultimate anointing just like David when you got the oil the spirit of God came on him so here you get Spirit but without the oil press and David you got the oil and the spirit and put in the Garden of Eden you had Spirit but not the oil right and this word r a stookey
 showing up and you you said it was Garden of Eden language but it's know his name his name is it connected to the Garden to rest supposed to work and keep the garden that's right yep that's exactly right so it goes back to The Seventh-Day okay when you always Shabbat yeah he he stops but then after the flood when Noah is floating in the little micro floating eaten with a piece with the animals and there's plenty of food and then the little micro Eaton rests on top of the mountain as the waters receded you like a new Garden gets off offer the sacrifice and plants a garden and so rest in the garden land is a key a message and then late and later passages about the Sabbath both the word Shabbat and the word rest from those name for are connected to the Sabbath rest in the land if it's so it isn't normal language for the spirit to rest or just kind of a novel
 yeah you said it's Unique yeah normally just come upon to be poured out upon the rush upon so yeah for the spirit to rest on someone is not a common way to describe it so it's very clearly bringing up the Eaton associations with the word rest
 the spirit that will incessantly anoint this Royal new David is a Sevenfold spirit with counts this before but it's the spirit of the Lord one Spirit of wisdom to Spirit of understanding 3 Spirit of counsel for Spirit of strength five Spirit of knowledge six and spirit of the fear of y'all I'm 7 and his Delight will be in the fear of Yahweh you almost expected to say his Delight will be in the Torah liking someone but his Delight is in the fear of the Lord cuz you learn the fear of the Lord is your getting wisdom in your meat store
 he won't judge that is he won't make leadership decisions just based on what is IC nor will he make decisions by what is ears here so it's not like Solomon with the two women that comes in both claiming that there's one baby belongs to each of them and nobody can figure out how to solve the dispute it is kind of like this is a sign of wisdom you can like see through the surface and get to the heart of the matter he's connected to another form of information yeah yeah cuz he lives by the fear of the Lord so yeah that's right so with righteousness he will bring Justice to the poor and with fairness he will make decisions on behalf of The Afflicted of the last he will strike the land with the rod of his mouth
 and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked so Justice advocacy for the most vulnerable in their communities the poor the afflicted ones but then yeah this happens a lot in the prophets were it's like someone's coming to bring Justice and you think cool that's going to bring that should bring peace in the act of justice is actually also this usually depicted as some form of here with interesting is it uses what you would think would be like violent imagery with the sword he will strike his enemies
 and with the spear he will slay the way but what he striking and slaying with are his words he will strike the Earth with the rod of his mouth which is it like a metaphor for words exactly his words he will slay the wicked so I mean is from comes from a different time and place but yeah the idea is his words will bring about order his words will push back agents of chaos and disorder and death in the land he will declare them guilty and then I think implicitly you know make them face the consequences kind of thing
 which you know if you've but its power is not in his like harm his arm or as far as strength his mouth does metal yeah yeah it is interesting image we go on skipping down a little bit then you get some real Garden of Eden imagery about Predators predatory animals laying down and playing with prey animals wolf hang out with Lambs leopards chilling with goats the calf and the Young Lion and the Really Choice fat calf that lion might be salivating but he's not going to buy it and then a little kid a little boy just leaving the mall around all the animals it's eating him injury isn't you know striking the reader than Versed and the nursing child will play by the whole of the Cobra and a toddler will just
 put his hand right into the Viper's Den like your little Viper Viper Viper
 is a seed a human seed will have the snake will be sowed like disarmed and made harmless that even the young seed of the woman can just take hold of the snake
 there will be no hurting and no destroying and all my Holy Mountain that's those New Jerusalem and Eden imagery of the high mountain Garden for the Earth will be filled with knowing Yahweh like Waters cover the sea and in that day the Nations will seek out the root of Jesse who will stand up like a banner for all the peoples and his resting place will be glory so we've got Tabernacle Glory of Yahweh in the Tabernacle at Temple Gloria signifying language when you talk about Glory appearing in a resting place that's Temple Tabernacle language which those are symbols of God's presence in Eden
 so you have you always presents taking up residence on a holy mountain and everybody knows Yahweh is knowledge and the nations are all going to be coming up to this Holy Mountain Glory Garden where there is rest and they're going to find there as a beacon drawing them all in this timeline of David the root of Jesse will be drawing them all in there that's the pump It's A Creative Vision that brings all the themes of the Hebrew Bible together in one place
 with many of them as I was reading the last few lines of this pain you just had a very Earnest look on your face in your eyes were closed I'll really yeah I think I started picturing the scene of the well at one point I was really picturing the scene of the child in the in the snake and the kid marching around with that you know leading this parade of animals some that we would consider dangerous is was just kind of Moment In My Head where it's all very playful and at the very end yeah the Nations will resort to the root of Jesse so we bred other parts of Isaiah together yet so yeah there's the theme of the nation's coming in I don't know what what do you want to focus on here oh well just this poem is setting up a bold hope it's all going to get complicated and problematize
 is it Go a course throughout the scroll of Isaiah but this is just the Bold image of hope that's connected to a spirit anointed king from the line of David that's the image yeah so this becomes like the default in the book of what you're hoping for okay okay so too tired to the anointed Fame
 we had David we know that David line has fallen apart there's this hope for this new David
 and he's a king who's going to be so anointed as the Sevenfold anointing of his in a way the spirit and it's so magnificent it's like in creation itself fundamentally different types of releases like the new creation blessing of God there's a new guess this is like we're not talking about life as usual we're talking about animals that want to destroy each other at peace which is then in a way to think about two Nations who usually want to destroy each other yes totally at peace out that's exactly right and the piece is coming from this Beacon of Hope this new Mountain of Gods resting place and from it is a signal where everyone can now know God and know the wisdom of God so yeah this is this is New Creation language
 if I'm living in this time and I were talking for an iron-age right man like I'm just like I'm a normal guy I'm living in and around Jerusalem and 2 mi North like the king of Assyria is like is taking people out they've come and they try to capture down Jerusalem it didn't work out but then and I guess these are my like my grandfather's stories and then like I seen Babylon come in and take us out and so what I understand of like life is like when things are good doesn't a food we can enjoy each other but in reality is always just some paying some other Nation just some violence around the corner and so I read something like this and am I supposed to think like yeah actually maybe there will be a guy who comes and fundamentally change all this
 we never have to worry about that anymore like is that a real hope I guess is what I'm wondering like is this like
 I'm in it seems like it in terms of its a real hope and as much as somebody wrote this poem and Incorporated it into the scroll of Isaiah as like something that is to capture your imagination and your hopes and help you Channel your prayers to the god of Israel that this is something you desire is to bring about in partnership with a human because if you know if you said to me like hey the light or the wolf eye keeps a life wolf skin to lay down with the lamb I know how Wolves yeah sure like to eat lamb like something right so you're using this fantastic language to maybe just mean I'm not going to have to worry about a king killing me that what you're saying like I can just enjoy my harvest in my family and like death is not around the corner or are you actually saying like there's going to be an
 we're like all the nations will just all at peace all the time and would like this Brotherly Love across the whole known land like
 that's the Hope yeah I guess that's why the word that came to be attached to these types of poems is the language of Revelation or apocalypse it's a revealing of a kind of reality the thing continuity with our world but also feels just fundamentally different which is why by the end of the scroll of Isaiah this very picture right here will get called the new Heavens in the new land the New Jerusalem that I will create That's What God Says in a part of what makes it the Bold hope that it is also is the poetic form of poetry is a kind of language that evokes your imagination as much as it tries to communicate you know an idea or a body of information so I think it is supposed to send our minds to high places up to the heavens
 so what an Iron Age Israelite living in Jerusalem thought about this I have no idea what Isaiah and all the Bible nerd scribes and Prophets who treasure these ponds and collected them into the Scrolls that we have in the Hebrew Bible they this is what kept them going man this is clearly it's kind of imagery that energize Jesus and his first followers
so what's interesting about this portrait is that the only real Conflict at work in the scene is that there's oppressed people and bad guys and that the king is going to rescue the oppressed and judge the bad guys and then says peace in the land that's the amateur so this is the image attached to the king and to the people of Israel in the story line of the Bible problem is and Isaiah assumes you've already read the whole story of the line of David and Samuel and then in the scroll of the Kings and what you know is that aside from a few bright spots like Hezekiah her Josiah it all crashed and burned and y'all were handed over his people and his City and the temple to destruction and wild Babylon to destroy it all and take many Israelites in Exile
 and so how do you process and explain that with these bold promises on the table did not mean what he said or is this some other explanation so what you get in the latter parts of the book of Isaiah is this reflection on what was the meaning of the downfall of Jerusalem and what about that promise that God made to David and what about the promise like right here and Isaiah 11 and so some interesting things start to happen in relationship to the anointed figure, and I'm just going to trace a few pawns are in Isaiah one is in chapter 42 and the poet introduces us to a figure called this all start this all in the voice of Yahweh
 behold my servant
 whom I uphold My Chosen One in whom my soul Delights I have put my spirit upon him
 do we learn about that yes that's the guy from chapter 11 and a guy like David David
 he will bring forth Justice to the Nations it sounds like the guy from chapter 11
 he will not cry out or raise his voice he won't make his voice heard in the streets but isn't it his voice that's going to do all the work if we try and harmonized all the poetic imagery between ponsness asking to be really frustrating exercise you have to let each poem exist in its own little story World know that we're so here we have a chosen servant whose anointed by the spirit not with oil to buy Spirit who's going to bring Justice to the nation's chapter 11 slaying the wicked all that but this anointed servant is going to accomplish Justice for the Nations but he's not like you wouldn't pick him out in a crowd he's not getting his name out there and
 he's not the one yeah he's quiet he works in a quiet way
 even a bruise or a bent Reed of grass he won't break it so if there's like a reed stock of grass that's bent you don't like my kids use so many straws you kids like to use straws
 I we don't we don't use Listerine with my youngest son is just attached destroy Every Me Every dinner break the normal way but some and he's so excuse on them and destroys all these. We started Jessica start getting like compostable like a booster destroying all these plastic straws so anyway they're great until he bends it and then it has decreased in it and then it said that's what that's the image I hear a bruised rib been treed and so meek and I he like the let that be he can walk by it and he's so gentle he wouldn't like knock it over or brush it with his finger not even the wind of him walking by would knock over Bruce visit and then the parallel line is even though a dimly burning Wick he would extinguish
 enforce Justice with trustworthiness faithfulness he will not be disheartened
 he will not be crushed so apparently he's going to be gentle
 he's going to be patient persistent he's going to be persistent even when there is opposition so you're getting this picture here that the way that that stand in chapter 11 is going to be brought about isn't going to be straightforward it's going to happen through this very quiet
 well this brings us back to where you started this conversation with 15 chapters of David exactly right yeah he's annointed and he's patiently waiting yeah that's exactly right so now we're getting this that there's going to be a journey ahead for the anointed servant of humility or humiliation of discouragement opposition but he's going to continue with it until he's established fastest in the land in the coastlands wait for his Torah then you go down just a little bit for 6 and you always start speaking to the servant directly saying I've called you servant in righteousness I will hold you by the hand I will watch over you I appoint you as a covenant for the people as a light to the Nations
 to open blind eyes to bring out prisoners from the dungeon and those who dwell in the darkness out of prison so now the servants being given this really amazing commission is that he's going to be the covenants for the people so I can switch over to means you the Covenant I'll appoint you as the Covenant for the people so if y'all we made a covenant with the people of Israel that they would become a kingdom of priests in agreement so the agreement usually goes you guys follow my instruction you live by it and I'm going to block you and I'm going to use you to bless the Nations and so that's the Covenant so you would not be a covenant you would
 live by a company intentionally loaded an odd turn of phrase so the people of Israel failed to live peacefully to their Covenant that's what all the tour in the prophets were trying to say so here's a elect anointed servant who will themselves become the Covenant they will be the Covenant faithfulness that the people have failed to ever demonstrate and in so doing this figure will become that Shining Light to the Nations
 and then all the imagery about opening blind eyes and bringing out Prisoners the light shining in the darkness that the God's glory shining and Jen's on day one from the 7-Day creation story now this figure is going to become that glorious light shining in the darkness to release people out of prison and to become the Covenant faithfulness of what God has a purpose for Israel
 so as you go through these poems in the latter part of Isaiah you see that this anointing is about 1 figure being filled up with God's Heavenly life liquid life of spirit to become the vehicle of heavenly light and blessing on behalf of Israel cuz this Grille has likes all would like different kinds of David Lyons forfeited forfeited that right and the depiction of his way is means Year all the sudden becomes not the kind of King you're used to write that's going to like raise the sword billed the Army charge or just like them astray his power through his strength and ability to Rally a crowd or he's going to be quiet and meek gentle
 gets developed even more in another poem about this anointed servant that we call Isaiah chapter 53 and we will read the whole thing but just watch how the images keep getting device like a snowball as he go through the scroll and previous images from earlier Palms get picked up and turned into new ponds so in Isaiah 53 to talking about the anointed servant he that is a servant grew up before him that is God like a tender shoot like a branch like a route out of the parched ground the root of Jesse
 he had no form or Majesty that we should pay any attention to him he didn't have any kind of a pair of pants that we would be attracted to him in fact it was just the opposite he was despised he was forsaken by people he was actually a Man of Sorrows and he knew grief the knowledge that he had was a knowledge of grief and loss he was like somebody for whom people hide their faces he was despised and we didn't honor him at all and we're really turn up the volume on this rejection rejection from his own that's a new development from the last poem is a sense of Regina we knew that the anointed servant might have reason for being disheartened or feeling crushed right and that's the theme they were turning up now they are cuz you can imagine that would just be be
 as of his on his enemies but here it's even his friends seem to are like you knows Brothers seem to like Yeah Boy them so he won't look like a royal glorious are from the line of David ruling in Jerusalem is not going to be like that somehow that rule is going to look like somebody who is rejected isn't Honorable in the eyes of important people and he identifies with people in their suffering and grief the picture so that Isaiah 53 and eventually this guy goes to his death like they described that this guy who we thought was abandoned by God the speaking voice says we thought that he was cursed by God
 that's what we thought about this guy and then in verse five that pivots and the voices but in reality he was pierced and killed and crashed and suffered for our that is Israel's transgressions for our iniquities and the punishment that brought us Shalom fell upon him and it's by his wounds that we have found healing
 so this speaking group is identifying that this anointed figure is actually going to experience on Israel's behalf all of the disasters in the suffering and hardship that Israel has experienced and was destined for by failing to live as God's covenant partners and that this figure would become the Covenant for the people that he would both embody the Covenant faithfulness of the people while at the same time shouldering all of the consequences for the failure of the coven of people and not again the role of this anointed one which is a lot like David it's as if David shouldered Solace failures really well David allowed himself to be exiled he had to leave his family and the people who cared about running like a fugitive in the wilderness
 why because a deranged thing you know thought that David was out to kill him when he wasn't and he could have taken saw that multiple times in the wilderness and so we talked about the last episode but instead he just suffers stalls Folly and whatever Insanity for a little years so it's like he's suffering for Saul since that's the portrait of David in Samuel and those are the ideas that are getting picked up and developed here but now of the future seed from the line of David so where this poem ends I mean that we could spend and one day we should spend many episodes in the scroll of Isaiah you think that this annoys the servant is just gone dead and gone but all of a sudden down in verse 10 chapter 53 after he's given his life as a guilt offering
 he all of a sudden he's going to look upon his seed he's going to have like a spring
 and he will see them and he will prolong his days and the good pleasure of Yahweh will prosper in his hand and I clap my guess is what happens with your offering no it's like if somebody's dead you don't normally live to see your family and live long days and have you always good pleasure prosper in your hand but that's it that's exactly like the servant somehow goes through the suffering that leads to death and is brought out to see the light of life again and now by his knowledge he used to know suffering and grief now Force 11 by his knowledge the righteous one my servant will declare the many to be righteous while he Bears their iniquity so he suffers on behalf of Israel's failures and then reconstitutes
 a group of people called the seed to be the righteous Covenant partners
 that they have never been but that the servant was on their behalf so that's where the portrait of the suffering you know it's a servant ghost in the scroll of Isaiah and we could look at many more Palms but you get the idea so what's truly remarkable is that when you turn to the Psalms scroll in the Hebrew Bible it's this exact same portrait of David as an image of a suffering Vindicated anointed one of your way but also brings light and life to the nation's it's the same exact portrait you can see why Jesus was really in to these text Isaiah text in the songs used in particular thing about Isaiah in the Psalms and they were like a ground zero for Jesus in as early as followers than not it's not hard to see why I want you to spend enough time here so next into the song
 yeah into the Psalms that's where we're going to go
