when you think of God's spirit what comes to mind maybe it's the story of Elijah who encounters God's still Small Voice on Mount Horeb maybe it's the spirit descending like a dove a Jesus is baptism or Jesus promising the spirits to his disciples before ascending to this guy's perhaps even the first mention of the Holy Spirit one God hovers over the Darkness ready to bring order in life where God spirit is there is life and so not many of us think about. Spirits related to judgments that all creation order is stained by gods who lost the spirit it means that God has a project is to take it away teams that sell this at least in part why Adam and Eve were scared after they ate of the tree of knowing good and bad they heard. Coming and he came in the sound of a storm the wind of the day in Genesis 3 verse 8
 foreshadowing this storm of God's justice when he shows up for the day of the Lord and the next one appears in system a really complicated story about the sons of God and daughters the women and giant Nephilim oh my look at some fascinating stories like the Nephilim in Genesis 6:4 God makes this strange Proclamation he always said my room will not dwell with Humanity forever because he also is flesh and his days will be 120 years where have I gotten the idea that God's life might live with humans forever the Tree of Life in the garden and we'll look at the flood story in Genesis 7 but God lets the Earth D create yet hope isn't lost
 God bless one ranked person in create a mini loading Eden the outside the boat the breath of life is going to be taken away but inside Breath of Life remains in the remnant it's the remnant that the Same by the spirit of God the flad does undoing of creation actually returned the Earth to the original Genesis 12 States got Spirit over the water is ready to bring New Creation on John Collins and this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie Krista Quinn and I trace the theme of God's spirit is Rue on to the second half of the first movements of the Genesis Grill thanks for joining us here we go
all right we and by we I mean referring to myself Tim Mackie Krista Quinn hello we are walking through the first movement of Genesis tracking the theme of God's ruach or another words got Spirit but we will call it God's we walk often because embedded in this idea of rock is not the spirit but also breath in the wind yes and it's very enchanting way of viewing the world which is that the wind is God's spirit and our breath is God's spirit what a cool way to exist in the world yeah that's right and also raises the possibility that if all creation order sustained by God's relock it means that God has a project is to take it away if he deems it so and that's what we looked at at the last example or at least where somebody thinks that God is showing up in the form of a
 and after Adam and Eve eat from the tree and disobey God's command you shows up in the wind and the Freak Out In The Wind of the day or the sometimes translated the cool of the day we are saying it's foreshadowing this idea of the spirit being a force of decreation what's right is foreshadowing the storms of God's justice when he shows up for the day of the Lord so quick real quick recap do you want to do the quick recap of the three hits so our first hit was Genesis 12 God's spirit and creation where God's spirit is hovering over the waters and is about to animate life into all creation the second hits Genesis 27 Zooms in on humans and their we see a synonym for Rua the Breath of God and it's the Breath of God that goes into humans and gives Humanity life
 the same way that God gave life to all creation and then the third head is what we're talking about it's the after that humans eat from the tree and they hear the sound of God and the roofs of the day it's this depiction of God's spirit about to bring some kind of decreation hides it turns out God comes just asking questions and looking for a confession but it doesn't kill them and he doesn't even curse them ground which will affect them negatively but that God's anger is slow yeah yeah yeah the only reason I'm using the word equation is because if spirit is creation and life than the opposite of that or another way the spirit can function function
 yeah I like that because when you say Exile is a type of decreation it's exiled from the place where life eternal Isis doing of creation creation can happen in many ways it can be the undoing of the order in or can be the undoing of my little personal order in my community or in my body which means that I died which means death is undoing of God's creative purpose so we're going look at is the 4th Thru the 8th got threw off in Genesis 1 through 11 and the next one appears in just a really complicated story about the sons of God and Daughters of women and Giants and Nephilim all my contacts here let's back up and remember where we at in this movement
 yeah I'm so glad you asked so where at is we looked at so far we looked at God's ruoff hear the brought about order in the course of the six days of God's working and then the combination in the seventh day and member that was God creating by bringing land out of too much water in their two picks up and it flipped it over we're God creates by bringing water to too much dry land and what we found is right in the middle of this narrative hear Genesis chapter to the opening of The Garden of Eden narrative God through our breath appears to animate summarized so what happens is that you have two individual human to break the Divine command they wanted to come out with him instead of being satisfied as images of Elohim so their Exile from the garden and that's where God's walk shows up like a store correct so what the next narrative in about
 about Justice for is the about the next generation of Adam and Eve's sons can replace his parents failure but this time by doing what's good in his own eyes which is murdering his brother and the blood of his brother cries out from the ground that happens in this narrative here then Kane gives birth to a whole chain of descendants and you build a city and he calls it after his own name and seven generations later this is what the next litter at units about after the convergence is brother is in Kane's City he has a descendant name Lemak who murders flagrantly and says man of my ancestor came converter and God forgave him and God is obligated to forgive me 70 times more than kin and it's it's a downward spiral and you left it imagine man if one person's innocent blood Rises up to God and God hears that imagine what happens when a hole
 City built on the blood of the innocent what's going to happen then when you're given a divided lineage a lineage a genealogy that goes from the line of King and then the last line of Genesis for is but Adam and Eve had a third son that replaced the table and then that's the Sun that you get a 10 generation genealogy in Genesis chapter 5 that's what's going to follow is a d creation Story the outcry of innocent blood in the rise of violence among the city of Adam the city of humanity it's going to become what do you say something that God can't ignore but there is yet still one more thing that's going to go wrong with creation these are all about human Rebellion
 yeah actually Genesis 3 involves humans and a spiritual being the snake snake is going to bring it together and show that a mirror in version of not only are the humans are going but the spirit beings are now yes welcome to the story we call Genesis chapter 6 verses 1 through 4
 here's the story and it came about when Adam Humanity started War began to multiply on the land and you're like started for a while now so that's a little clue right there but we're going to be doing some kind of replay of a beginning narrative is it sounds like I told the humans to do before for multi-crew X face the land and so and humans X you get Sons and Daughters to them but the Dodgers going to play a role in stories are going to highlight those daughters the sons of Elohim saw the daughters of humanity that they were good and they took wives for themselves whenever they chose pom pom pom sons of Elohim so so far we've been talking about a Elohim has God
 sons of Elohim the volume the phrase that Pierre is about half a dozen times in the Hebrew Bible and it always has the same meaning refers to the Spiritual Beings God's Heavenly God's Heavenly Court Heavenly realm these are the hosts of Heaven yeah they're called in Genesis when the host of the skies are the sons of can just be referring to a kind yeah part of that group I got kind of I Love You Mia we saw it with goats in Leviticus I think take your son of a goat of this phrase is the son of Adam the son of man which means a member of the human kind of right and so to be a sign of a song about him is to be I love you like being that it's a spiritual being so that's one thanks a whole Rabbit Hole there we have a past podcast
 of someone seeing something is good and then taking it for themselves which seen that before yeah this is mirroring the language of Genesis 3 human failure or in the Jacob storm it was good and right hook it and she took is the players in the story The reason the woman sees that this thing is good and then takes it is precisely because of a snake that is he reads from Hebrew Bible you discover is it forces are too many people do you have a spiritual being to see this evening a woman so that she sees it as good and taped and here it's exactly the intrusion in Genesis 6
 you have Spiritual Beings who see that women are women are good and they take them for themselves so it's a good example of a mirror narrative where way that the story is echoing and inverting just like all the way back to the when you have two parallel lines of Hebrew poetry or like I use that analogy of the two plants for the most plants that my wife put together on the Shelf you just now you read Genesis 3 and this little narrative and you Ponder how they help you understand each other better where is portraying the sons of Elohim in a really negative light they see the daughters and they take it they take them the three you might not know that right away you might have to assume that oh was that bad were they not supposed to do that but saw that it was good and tough we should know if we're looking back at Genesis 3 that this is not good
 so Genesis 3 is about a failure of the human images of Elohim because of instigation of Spiritual Beings here failure in rebellion of the sons of Elohim and images of Elohim are the victim here is named we're just trying to act like this is all normal especially to us to the actual beings yakking women as their what as their what their mates this is very common motifs in ancient literature especially Foundation stories of the empires of the ancient world humans that were a hybrid between the gods and humans get Divine humans the most famous ones are the ones that live on in the Marvel movies still today for Smokey butts
 for that more than the ancient Biblical context of the story is about the founding the founders of Babylon on one of the founding Kings of the in the area that would be comfortable on with the King named Gilgamesh Loose Park Auto Parts in his offspring of God in humans in this is celebrated then in other cultures it was celebrated that's a status that lets you know that this Kingdom has the Divine authority of God's to conquer the Giants or sometimes the men of renown the threat yeah that's what they're called story so this is tapping into a multi that celebrated these hybrid Divine humans who built the kingdoms of this world and conquered in their name and the biblical story is saying that's actually not a good thing yeah it represents everything that's wrong with the world combining with spiritual forces and then
 find their own way apart from God building cities apart from God and ruling apart from him may be so important than the fact the author is going to assume that you know the parallel in the next line that brings up our word response to what just happened Genesis 6 verse 3 you always said my room will not dwell with Humanity forever because this one also or he also is flesh and his days will be 120 years and then you were in the land in those days and also long afterwards cuz Joshua and Caleb and the spies are going to be a whole bunch in the land of Canaan when the sons of Elohim went into the daughters of humanity and they bore children for them
 these that is the Nephilim or the Mighty Warriors who are from ancient time men of the name that's what you were referring to the Mighty Warriors of the name of this is one of those passages swear I just realize well my lens is so different than the ancient authors so methylene is one of the main biblical words to talk about these hybrid Define human giant Kings of old it's a noun made up of passive of the verb to for those who have fallen which many Christians probably me and I got like the Fallen Angels not the first and most primary reference it means fallen in battle those who gain glory and Fame by Conquest on the battlefield the Fallen ones and Ezekiel we'll pick this up his whole Palm about the fall
 Kings of all to claim to be gods and then you kill chapter 32 and he calls them the no flame makes a play on it those who have fallen in battle that's why I hear they're even called The Mighty Warriors and parallel however the idea of falling from the skies is a subtext here cuz this is about a Heavenly Rebellion that comes down to the land where is Genesis 3 was about Earthly rebellion of humans trying to be able him to become higher than what they're supposed to be so that's one thing going on here but at the center here interesting Response Center here in the center because you can imagine it gone and this story would actually feel a little better tell me the story would flow better the first 3 came somewhere else if it came later so it's a good example of how the three part kind of symmetrical design is meant for meditation
 not for nice sequential storytelling in the daughters of men and then you always speaks about how his breath want to Alice Humanity forever spirit and then it goes back to the Nephilim the sons of Elohim in the daughters of humanity it feels very repetitive so when that happens there's probably an underlying structure and something being highlighted that's right it's like three plants on my wife shelf and the outer planets are very similar to one and three matching important ways and two in the middle also links up with both parts because both have to do with something about Humanity living and also about that the days of humanity will be limited and what are those as well those were the days when the giant hybrid warriors were cruising around I see you have verse three highlighted and Yahweh said oh yes
 parallel design with the opening to The Flood narrative Yahweh says two things in Genesis 6 verses 1 to 12 and they're related so the related thing was What God Says in verse 7 which is I'm going to wipe away Humanity that I've created from the face of the ground it's a reference to the flood which is so I think meant to illuminate what is going on here but we'll get there in second Suite B my spirit won't dwell with Humanity forever because he also is flesh and his days will be 120 years so notice the opposition between my spirit and the fleshy the fleshy Humanity this was the mud sculpture Yep this was God breathing in Fast Life Giving that works right now is where have I gotten the idea that God's life might live with humans forever
 flies in the garden in the garden yeah how was it that the humans lost access to Forever life there was their fault narrative that we looked at other phone that is because of a spiritual being a spiritual being that was trying to get humans to the Roundup the Divine on their own turn on their own terms and it resulted in the loss of eternal life through now you have Spiritual Beings mixing with humans now also resulting in the loss of eternal life to infer that two sides of one Bitcoin in a way to be Master here why they trying to mix with humans in the first place that they were good I saw that they were good but man are mortal they don't die here are we meant to infer that part of their motive here is is this as planned number to to elevate humans to the Divine no interest them the first plan was
 get them to cease wisdom on their own terms around times to so that they can become tell him I didn't work and plot number to correct interesting and you wouldn't get there the story doesn't say you know what the sons of Elohim were trying to do this is Plan B they're trying to restore eternal life and turn humans into a lot because we already know that humans are going to live forever by Ben dying or outside the garden so yeah why bring up this correct you always responds only makes sense if somehow it's on the table yet again that humans are going to live forever and what narrative do I have that would talk about another grass getting returned alive to humans and what we have is 26 verse the one at 2 and it's also weird that it seems like the sons of Elohim who are being implicated here
 doing something bad but in verse 3 it's Yaweh who says I won't dwell with humans forever my spirit won't tall is he send it to him are doing is affecting humans are trying to restore internalized to humans but in their in their corrupt state and it's as if saying the only way that Humanity's ever going to have life forever is for Yahweh Spirit to be the one that recreates and brings about a new creation and so this is a distorted gravity turn on Lyfe Jennings three it was at the store to grab for wisdom and Elohim life status and this is a the store to grab to restore eternal life to humans and not only do they not get eternal life what they get is a ticking clock 120 years we'll talk about that but
 also what results is not human images of God it's distorted humans who claimed to be God and found the violent Kings of our world because who's the next mighty warrior that you're going to be in the story of nimrod Elgar Nimrod associated with Bible and Ashley the origin story of Babylon right here so again when God says my spirit I breath my rock will not dwell in humanity word we're uploading what we've already talked about in Genesis 23 that the reason why Humanity has any life at all is because it's God's spirit that he blew into humanity and so God will also take that away from the point and what will remain is dust / that's right and yeah tell me about the hundred and twenty years
 possibilities one is it saying there's a new cap on human life spans and it'll be 120 years and the reason why some people think that is because the previous chapter it was a genealogy when people are living for centuries Methuselah this is a real down downgrade but after this humans lived more than 20 years Abraham many Biblical characters go on the live more than 20 years so that's an interesting feature of the story so is there another is there another possibility and so the problems with the hundred and twenty years as a shortened life span do yeah it's cuz lots of biblical characters will look past it Abraham lives a hundred and seventy-five years Isaac 180 Jacob 147 and this is in the same scroll yeah so it seems, you would have been aware of that perhaps it refers to the number
 years this is sitting of the clock Before the Flood 120 years until the flood this is actually the oldest interpretation we know of in the history of Jewish literature sell in the Dead Sea Scrolls is a retelling of the flood story that gives you a detailed it's not given in the biblical story that tells you that in the four hundred and eightieth year of Noah's life with no I've reached the end of those years and then it quotes Genesis 6 verse 3 the flood Story begins by saying in the 600 year of Noah's life it began the flood you know how children's Bibles off and rewrite biblical stories in light of their interpretation of the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible and they retail difficult story is but with their interpretations loaded in so in the earliest Ermac translations they took this hundred twenty years to be the little window of time before the flood
 and then later Jewish Scholars like Roxi does that add up with how the genealogies work out because that would mean the noise already live to Noah's are Eddie Alive by now but that the chronology is very interesting the chronology and the literacy Quints of these narratives and Jess want 11 is really tricky follow a linear chronology about the link of the spirit this 120 years as a narrative countdown to the beginning of the flood that seems compelling also because he always says my spirit will not dwell with Humanity forever and we're learning all ready to the spirit is associated with undoing Creations so it seems like when he says it'll be 120 years he's talking about undoing creation which is later how will see the flood is
 actually let's go to the next one which exactly follow the train of thought that you're putting up there
 so after you walk away from the strange story about the sons of the next time you hear a reference to God's Rudolph is in Genesis 6 verse 17 and it's an announcement that God makes to know about the coming of the flood hasn't come yet it's about to come and so he just grabbed the floods at the flood water going to 66417 blood water on the land is going to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life so what significant there is it's using the idea back from Genesis to but remember there it was that synonym for rock the nation salvation of God that uses it combines the vocabulary of Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 through off of the game and then the image of Genesis 24
 so everything that has the breath of life is going to perish it's an undoing of Genesis 1 the waters that were separated or going to collapse back in on themselves to try to give me but remember the the reason for this actually I'm just going to back up the reason for this is because the Earth became distorted or ruined in the eyes of Elohim and the land was filled and got told humans be fruitful and multiply and fill the land and they still the land all right with the blood of the innocent violets yep and we already have two stories of that came and then came to send it my Mac so God looked at the land and behold it was ruined everybody would ruin their way and so God said to Noah the end Exodus word the end hotcakes is spelled with three of the four letters of the word outcry Cain's blood
 Abel's Blood Rose up to God and then in the story The hockets has come up before God it's so the word play linking those two things the end of All Flesh is coming because of the outcry because of the outcry because the Cain and Abel marry this is a couple chapters away and now it's not always evident to readers that's what's happening but it's the rebellion in the garden can murdering magnified by the defendant magnified yet again by the sons of God and Daughters of men resulting in the silent Warriors who do more stuff that lamech dead and all the sudden you got a blood-soaked land that needs to be purified and washed so the flood is God's way of undoing the order that he he did to the creation the creation story so just like in Genesis when God God's spirit created
 the land and separated the waters and made the dry land appear all of that creation that took place there and then the the spirit going into humans and creating that life now those things are being undone so they're what's the first day that everything that has the spirit of Life the Breath of Life under the heavens will perish Brooks we're going to work and it's like the undoing of the spirits work in creation and a human's butt but my friends because of God's commitment to his purpose to rule the world through humans to his eyes will survey the land and look to see if there's anybody who isn't going the way of corruption and there is one guy and his family and this guy's name is rest. He's righteous blameless and he showed up to do with Adam and Eve in the garden at the end of the day
 you have to walk to walk with them and we've already met Enoch right in the genealogy and he was not because he was not so in contrast to the generation of the flood now I stand out which is why God tells Noah I'm going to spare you and your family so make for yourself a little a little wouldn't eaten Olive Garden boat then why am I calling a garden vote because you're going to hang out with the animals there and it's made of trees made of trees yet what you're going to live there with all these different kinds of animals and the list of animals comes from Genesis 1 and also I'm just going to give you more food than you can imagine just take it all on board so a little hiding place above the waters where you have enough food provided by God and you live at peace with the animals, doesn't smell as good as originally
 yeah I bet the flowers the garden covered over a lot of that on the boat not so much yeah so in contrast to the generation the floods washed away you have a Remnant who's spared a little floating you on the waters
so after got an abscess floods coming to take away the breath of life and everything. There you come across The Narrative of that beginning to happen and this is in Genesis 7 verse 15 to the next appearance of the phrase Breath of Life and here it's in a list of Noah going into the ark and then all of the animals to buy to in which is the Breath of Life call this out here that the animals have the breath of life it seems like the God is taking away his breath is Spirit from all the Earth there's this Remnant Noah's family and the animals where that Spirit isn't totally wiped out mentioned that all by twos male and female is recalling the one human that became to in Eden and so now you have all these two's Noah and his wife and sons in the sons wives when it starts listening the animals I think it gets translated each with it
 mate but it's literally the word each and it's white it's a bunch of couples have the Breath of Life just like Adam and Eve in the garden who were sustained by the breath of life so that they can be fruitful and multiply but here it's the remnant of the ordering that the spirit dead originally going into the micro Eden the floating eat in in order to then be able to become any of the work in the spirit after that outside the boat the breath of life is going to be taken away but inside the little art refuge in place remains in the sustained by the spirit of God this is so important for the quest at school
 okay so that's the next appearance we're cruising now we're making a lot of progress okay so God announce to Noah that was coming to take away life you had a narrative of knowing the animals going into the boat and God was going to preserve their breath of life then when the flood actually comes after they get onto the boat this is in Genesis 7 verse 22 it literally repeats in narrative form what God said to Noah and the speech part of repetition seems unnecessary but it's a part of the literary design it's creating a gigantic symmetry in panels as he goes through the story so you read that All Flesh chance to 721 all we've been using this would allow flash that's not a typical way of talking got it word
 to talk about your physical B the word meet and how is that different than your nefesh b'nefesh refers to you as a whole integrated living being body and energizing life body in real life but if you took the spirit away from your MeetMe case Spirit contrast with flash my spirit won't dwell with Humanity forever because he is flesh so it matter matter is a synonym to the dirt to dirt plus Divine breath equals living creature living nefesh so it's a way of describing a creature but it is emphasizing to pour on the temporal nature physical physical material nature just flash is going to just is going to be dead
 it needs Spirit requires which is God's breath just got the offer to humans or here in this verse 21 and all mankind to do what's right so in the Hebrew Bible of it mainly refers to the material mortal frail slowly aging and dying aspect of human being in the New Testament it'll gain an additional layer of meaning and in Jewish Creek for the appetites that come from our material nature hunger pleasure sex all these kind of things does it can be called just desires of the flesh or the flash similar how to Spirits can be used even though it's just means your animated life force comes to talk about off the New Testament as also your will or find a type of Animation is there two of flash was just literally mean
 like your Adam's the dirt that you are can then be used as a way to talk about the desires that you have that driving towards the dirt and that come from the the meat like a picture from the fact that you are you say in my spirit I wanted obey the tour of God but in my flesh I want I want to break the commands so it can be a neutral term but it can also be contrasted with spear so back to Genesis 721 all-flash the moved about on the land perished in the flood and it gives the same list from Genesis chapter 1 of creatures everything that was on the dry land in whose nostrils was the here it's a uses all the terms together the breath of the spirit of life
 next relation of elation of the roof and nostrils the Breath of Life the phrase used in Genesis 2 verse 7 where God breathed into the dust into the nostrils the breath of life and that was just about humans here talking about All Creatures Genesis 1 the creation of the whole ordered world and the animals and the spirit that was breathed in or that was hovering and creating and then breathing in the Breath of Life to the humans in Genesis to its Bakery calling up a snowball when you're tracing a theme the vocabulary will be introduced like one at a time and a story but then later store is it will just start picking up all the preceding terms and start using them and connecting them interchangeably and this is a great example using the language of Flash
 versus Spirit that's from Genesis 6 verse 3 nostrils and the brass that's Genesis 2 verse 7 and then the ruach which is from Genesis one does nothing that right now that's so cool calling all of that it's like these couple verses are saying all of that is undone the whole sequence of creation of a moment a moment if it is terrible it's a god handing creation over to its own violent death-dealing tendencies in the allows the created order to clock in on itself but but there is a Remnant the survives because of the righteousness of that Remnant got spares them which opens up window for the future and that what happens with the last appearance of raw dissection
so the last appearance of rules in Genesis 1 through 11 and it kind of both culminates and restarts this whole narrative cycle isn't Genesis 8 verse 1 so the picture that the flood waters have risen and the boats just floating there and everything's on Dundee created and we read this little line and the god remembered Noah and all the animals and all the cattle that were with him in the ark and God caused a ruoff to blow over the land and those Waters begin to subside which is exactly what happened in Genesis 1 verse 10 to The Fountains of the deep these are the waters under the land yeah this is the Tejon the Deep Abyss Genesis 1 verse 2
 is where the rain comes from the imagination so these are the waters above in the waters below so they were separated on day too yeah the flood began by the cardiac got Spirit kid shows up over the chaos when the chaos is just watery chaos and then they won or start date and separating what is the waters above from the waters below which was a form of creation and ordering and then that collapses in the flood The Waters from below and watch from above it rains bubbles up Earth is destroyed and then here we're seeing God say let's close that back off of the Christian Store in Genesis 1 then the waters receded from the land and that's the replay of day 3 land appears
 this out in the seventh month on the 10th and 7th day of the month The Ark found rest the ark Noah. So what God did on the 7th day now the ark is doing on the 7th month on the 10 plus Seventh-Day words of God 10 speeches of God and the emergence of plants that he sent out the birds in the birds can't find any plants one finally it's on not only does it feel like a random story but then it feels like it's repeated so much about these birds one of those plant plants without a raven 3 * 3 + 3 + 1 sending out of the birds
 what time's total and it's the test testing to see if the water's have lightened from Rapunzel and and then when he finds that he could talk about that passage about the Dive In The Raven kind of make a little bit of sense but seem repetitive but reading it in light of Genesis one that makes a lot more sense that we're waiting for the plant or the shrubs to appear the birds are mention Dave 5 right now just rubs appear on a 30 and then the birds appear on day five and then that land animals appear on day 6 but the bonus and a six is God gives the shrubs and the plants to humans and mixing together all these imagery from the days of creation to depict Noah getting off the boat another thing this is Rabbit Trail in the other ancient near Eastern parallels to the
 what story the fa has a tree houses and the one found in the Gilgamesh epic they have very detailed parallels to the scene of after the hero gets off the boat After the flood is over the hero sends out Birds just find out when the waters have receded and it's both our Raven and then it has paralleled and so with great as the others are taking up the traditional Motif from other and other ancient parallels but then totally transforming its purpose in the story by adding all these hyperlink to the days of creation so that it becomes a re-creation story is really cool example of like the repurposing of a traditional story but to a new agenda is translated as when usually that is like this invisible powerful energy and it would dry up the water so you feel that image but should we also be thinking of God's spirit here
 reading in parallel the Genesis 1 level a wind pushing back water to mix you know that this is not just it's like a deeper meaning for deeper layer to that wind because of that wind is up energizing presence of God that will bring about a new creation quotation God caused the wind because in if in the Hebrew imagination the wind is God's breath for that mean for God to cause the wind why would you just say God breathed wind or God God when did a window with multiple layers of meaning to it was got done realize it was happening here God sends a real over the over the waters The Rock comes from God. Send it so I think it's like a double double meaning or
 double layers of meaning the same thing is going to happen in The Exodus story with The Parting of the waters that the same vocabulary got causes a wind to go over the water since they split them in half yeah this is almost a bridging passage between the original creation of God Spirit hovering and The Exodus where God's Wind Parts the waters are pushes them back yeah yeah I guess it's it's kind of guess the difference between saying where do you put the separation between the flame and the light that emerges from it the famous puzzle the early Christians Easter images to use to talk about the father and the son and the rest you know they're both one but the light that comes from the flame has distinct from the flame but they're also one and so in a similar way here God's rule that goes out and pass it over comes from him so it's aliens real life but it yet and stuff
 get the Trinity beginning to form in a way you're to both simple one and also complex more than one God Spirit both D created and recreated in the same event or in the same narrative that the flood this undoing of creation actually returned the Earth to the original Genesis one to stay with God's spirit over the water's ready to bring New Creation New Creation starts with the wind and then it's going to, Nate and Noah getting off the boat and offering the sacrifice and told that other surrender of Noah compels God to say you know what I'm never going to do again even though I know humans are
 are different there going to be a violent is there everywhere but I'm never going to undo creation like I've done and Sonos obedient surrender of the spared Remnant compels God to promise to carry out his new creation purposes into the future of the story but the hinge on the narrative all was with the appearance of got through you know what is narratives are so rich yeah so much to talk about you know it's so interesting is I just use Bible software to search the route of route in these chapters Genesis 1 through 11 so just the route to rush valve and head so that could bring up a noun or a verb the only so all the heads are what we talked about the rock the spirit but the only other hit is this 1821 Lord smelled it's Vera it's like he breathed in or smelled the soothing aroma
 debris banjo and the word Aroma is the word Reyes yeah that I saw smelled come up but for some reason related that's related to Invisible life presents and then there's a related non-real which is the smell which is again very clearly something's going into your nose and it's like the aroma yeah I'm trying to connect that even more so it's okay God Spirit creates D creates and then his and he recreates by his Spirit or his breath and then in response to know a sacrifice he breathes in the smell and that is related to this Covenant promise okay without exhalation into the nostrils of the human has a breath of life here he breathes in no sacrifice and he says I'm never going to destroy all life like I just did
 it's actually got inhaling the obedient surrender of the chosen one the compels got to make a promise that he will preserve life from this point on I like that because that's no that's surprise me to that's really cool but the idea that God smells a soothing Aroma and it's like oh that's great I'm going to make a promise that's kind of weird to me good okay connect to Spirit and his life like there's there's maybe more soothing is the word play on Noah's name oh yeah soothing means to give rest so know his name is Noah the word soothing is Nicola so God Spirits a Noah like Spirit smell that actually makes more sense to my mind then it's God's melted
 the point is Noah surrendered everything and got smells that Noah likes surrender and says I'm going to fall God needs is one person surrender totally that's that's what the story is showing us humans didn't do an in Eden surrender their desires to God I could just have one righteous to surrender give life to the money if the Bible ended right here it's one of the first Scroll of the first section of the Bible the Torah which is the first collection of books that we call the Hebrew Bible say one more thing about that cuz we started with 120 years and it just hit me to as we're talking about. Kennedy creating kind of being done with the violence
 how to get rid of the violence wash and clean the countdown clock it seems connected to all so when God says I need to get the humans out of the garden or otherwise we'll live forever bright like so that's why I'm an exile them so it's like in that story it's interesting that God's saying if they stay here they're going to live forever in the state of corruption has to be bad so I'm actually going to get him out of here and it's that same kind of idea of you know if I'm going to let humans propagate on the Earth all this violence this is going to be not so 120 years and then we're going to watch a problematic human in that case is these giborim these violent Warrior Kings and so they represent everything out that everything is wrong with humanity and that's why as you read throughout the rest of the biblical story you're out you're going to meet more Giants but they're always called
 like the remnant of the Giants or the last of the Giants and you going to keep having to kill off the giant eration throughout the rest of the story but the whole thing is because those later stories are being patterned as little of local floods of God's justice that will have to be brought about to do away finally with that violence that erupted the land but time and you cut flowers with me one with Holy Spirit we're going to Dan come to movement to which is a story of Abraham and we're going to trace anything and no stories and we'll we'll introduce that became when we get to meet with you thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to look at the second movement of the Genesis scroll it's the narratives of Abraham and we're going to trace through this movement the theme of trees the tree is right on pages 1 and 2 in the opening literally units of Genesis and then that
