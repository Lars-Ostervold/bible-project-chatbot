look up to this episode of Bible project podcast today we get to talk with Esau mccaulley getting in the field of biblical theology in a few months ago I read a book by a song called he's a new testament scholar at Wheaton College at the University of st. Andrews Scotland and is a serious contributor to New Testament studies but you put out a book 2020 called reading while black African-American biblical interpretation as an exercise and hope and I do I came across a review of it and read it and was like this looks awesome he's doing good local theology but specifically offering it from his perspective in the American black church tradition by black ecclesial ecclesial that's a special word that means
 ecclesial it's from the Greek word for church Prichard the black church tradition it was really wonderful talking with him he really helping me understand and appreciate you know I grew up and I guess we could call a white clear the old tradition and there's certain things that comes with that are good and bad and being able to step aside have someone from a different tradition to be into that. That's such a wonderful. We just wanted to let you know our listeners know about your thoughts work and commend it to you but also we're in this series right now in the podcast in the family. Dre sings the theme of the multi-ethnic family of God throughout story The Bible and Esau's work is such a great example about how the cultural ethnic diversity of the body of Christ is essential to US during a holistic message from the scriptures and not just what may be anyone tradition, conditions us to see or not today and so
 this conversation we have with Lisa about that point. How to interpret the Bible but we just thought this would be a great contribution to the series and I was really enriched by these house prospective renters background and you think that you all will be given a our interview with Issa
is a thank you for joining us today on the podcast great to talk with you thank you for having me I appreciate it yes well I like a lot of other biblical Scholars around around the country probably around the world found out about you through your recent book reading reading while black and then I discovered through your other published book is your dissertation previous to that is that right yeah whatever reason somebody people that want to buy $120 book about inheritance law I don't think you're selling yourself short it's amazing it's about Messianic inheritance and Abraham seed in the letters of Paul that's good stuff on a podcast to talk about Shane and his eyes and everything
 but I really had this is the second one is right so before we dive into the book and ideas in it just sketch of a bit of yours story he saw me a family history and how does it all lead you to end up in biblical studies that's the whole podcast Alabama stand up for the Alabama listeners I grew up in an all-black neighborhood all black church my grandfather was a pastor at aunts and uncles who were pastors and in the in the black bag of tradition and so I just threw up in that context that was the world that I knew that was the worth of shape me it was in the shadow of the Civil Rights Movement where when I was a kid My Heroes people like bigger a and Martin Luther King and we grew up and kind of like the shadow of Jim Crow and so when I was a kid I wanted to be a pastor cuz everybody every black person who I knew who like love the Bible that's what you did we didn't really have categories
 Google Scholars and so I talk about this in the books I don't want to like step on it in case when asked about it later but basically long story short I go to college thinking I'm going to be a Bible major to become a pastor and lots of things happen and you can tell me about which part you interested in I eventually found myself pursuing a PhD in New Testament and instead of being a pastor much to my mom's Eternal shame she couldn't type of pasta should I you just preach it in in in school was like no Mom I have a whole PhD what was the initial spark they got you interested in the Bible just being in church with a Clear Sight until I was raised in a contest we just loved like I don't know sometimes you open the book and it's just like that's all these great stories in it
 every book of the Bible growing up with Ashley 1st and 2nd Samuel so maybe like what becomes does here in this as in here at the book and none of y'all read and enjoying it and find it useful and helpful for me to navigate life in America is African American and my heroes were people who looked in the Bible it said this the guy in this book Wheels freedom for black people and so it was a source of personal spiritual comfort and it was a means by which I was able to to look hopefully into the future as to what God wanted to do for me and for others and so I don't know if there is a mocking tell you I remember when I was growing up my mom gave me one of those cartoon Bibles or coming with us and they had like that but that's the narration at the top at least in the Bible that I had and then there's a light dialogue between the characters on the pages got it to me and I said I'm going to read the whole Bible
 if I read the whole Bible and at least I said that I did cuz I didn't read all the summaries I remember thinking I read all the dialog I remember cuz I was kind of lying about reading the Bible and I was wrestling in my own you unconscious the whole Bible and in my head I said technically mom if you listening in the fourth grade I didn't finish the whole Bible didn't read all the narration at the top I think I skimmed 2nd Chronicles mother forgive me let's find out about this right now what would you say you would have called her growing up my mom was like she has raised us that we are if there was a VBS happening in the city we were there we went to Wednesday we went to Wednesday Bible study at my church
 we went to Sunday school so I don't have a choice as well that I was going to read the Bible when I was going to like it was something in the Providence of God I did I will tell you this the other thing I remember when I was in college and this is skipping a whole bunch of stuff but this is something I've never seen in the podcast before I hear some new data teaching at Bible study on Romans and I think there is like one book that I had saw at a at a bookstore about a Roman, Terry. I bought it and I was just I read the commentary and then I would like you to Bible study and I remember seeing people like writing stuff down that I was saying and I was like I could be completely wrong instead of his for 15 minutes before I came into this week y'all like I know what I'm talking about and I said what I said rhetoric the ability to speak well it's like really dangerous and I said I don't want to just be entertaining to people and then have them
 listen to what I want to say I want to handle God's word rightly so I said when I decide to go to Seminary I want to run to the Greek and Hebrew and Aramaic to get through portions of Daniel to be able to say I've done everything that I can to read and understand this text well and then applied to people and then when I got to Seminary and everybody has different experiences some people hate the languages some people love them sensible of the Greek symbol of the Hebrew but there is something about the Greek language to just spoke to me they captured me and I just love reading people asses went with my fight with my favorite Bible translation Bible story people who think about learning languages you didn't put me on the podcast you do this but this would happen you do that so I remember City one day in a Bible study and we were going around the room
 and we like reading first by verse by verse by verse but first she was all in English but I was listening to people read and I could tell by the translation the decisions about the group text that the way the translate had made it was like the Matrix for the first time yeah yeah yeah it's okay for me reading the process of reading God's word and its original language is to apply as well to people has been something that God has his growing in me from a child slowly through adulthood that passion is still there what a gift you know so many people especially Americans and how and what traditions they grew up in really determines a lot of that example John you grew up immersed in the Bible but when you came to college you had this baggage in this tension with the Bible that was growing behind and it sounds
 it's like he's off for you even though I'm sure there were lots of questions driving you skip. Skip the question for you but it sounds like you're growing up so when I got the college is this the place where I am in chapter one I talked about this is the first time I experienced kind of like a higher criticism and I talked about entering like that I used to let me to the Hundred Years War Between kind of white Progressive Us in the white fundamentalism and so my professors were all theologically Progressive and they saw like the Bible as the problem because I'm I'm growing up in the south of this point and look at all the stuff to the Bible did justify slavery and oppression of women all of this you know Colonial Empire all the TVs in the Bible is horrible and we need to come to deconstruct the Bible in order to like get the braids for black people
 this a Bible did you said it's a tool of Oppression in my contact is it to loffredo I'm confused as you seem to be agreeing with the like the races who said the bible define slavery and my parents at the Bible that were wrong and correct it actually is the Bible is unreadable apart from a German reconstruction everything becomes white man's religion did the god in this book will political social and spiritual transformation for black people and I felt like they were better exegete there's not a matter of like ducky hard questions are not dealing with difficult issues the book deals too difficult issues in face on but at least for me is it
 Act of the will you can find like problems there for nothing you can't find the problems was it themselves to you and how do you work through them and I tried to work through it with the helper didn't trust because the full definitive revelation of who God is Jesus Christ revealed to be a God who loves me or not of God hates me because I'm not a marcionite I think that the entire Bible refers to the same God from Genesis to Revelation and my job is to try to make sense of how would we know about who God is can be discussed as we move through the difficult parts of scripture
okay you just dropped so many goodies there on that bar on that train of thought that was awesome so let's go back to what you're talkin about your grandparents what they taught you to see in the Bible so you know the book you you call this you trying to give voice to a tradition that you called the black ecclesial tradition so why what that means what you mean by that and then second why why did you feel that this tradition needed to get some new energy and a new voice that you want people to hear that you don't think spend represented I think this is very this is very complicated and actually very sensitive could you don't want no centralized things right but if you look at like the academy for example and you look like from the kind of the white Christian tradition
 from left to right you can have likely a progressive institution to be considered institution and all of them are engaged in a dialogue about the nature of the Christian faith and that's fine that's what the academy should be
 and but when you look at what happened with the development of Africa Namibia African-American theological tradition for variety of reasons mostly being the fact that Evangelical spaces run it weren't really interested in hiring African Americans in the 50s and the 60s coming during segregation the people who willing to hire African Americans were from the progressive strand of of the white Mainland Mainland tradition which means that black theology sometimes is from the more Progressive strand of the African American Christian tradition more broadly and sillier the more moderate or traditional there's another strain which I kind of get to in the other parts of the book there's also like a really conservative strand of the African American Christian tradition because mostly pietistic and that it doesn't really getting involved in issues of the day is focused most on like to buy it buy it so you see those two like traditions most clearly represent it in the academy in a dialogue with one another but there's a whole other stream of the African American Christian tradition that is basically Orthodox in his theology
 used to things that Chris is always believe and it's also known for its advocacy for justice and that tradition is not often presented as a viable dialogue partner in the Public Square and so it was tradition that I was raised in the situation that I saw all around me and black churches and so I called it clean Co tradition not because no academics think that way but that it is its primary location is in churches in the sermons in the music and in the teaching ministries of black pastors and so what I thought when I wrote the book is it about captured that tradition of well black pastors would look at that and go he got it right someone that said he cleans your body was never fully separated from the church and I say that with without making that the claim that there are no black Progressive to attend churches or that is not ecclesial in that regard I don't trying to say that there's at least
 ethos that I was trying to capture that also contrasted that with kind of in this is the important part when I speak it on generalities
 in general the progressive tradition in in in white tricks places have are known for a strong advocacy for justice for the offering revisionist on key elements of Christian teaching and in general Evangelical churches tend to be theological traditional put very hesitant in issues of justice and so the African American that comes out of the bag Church maintains to send to the Bible is God's word to us where I could who's also concerned for justice find himself or herself often out of Vogue and a variety of communities and I said I wanted to put my finger on that and if i n f articulate that well the people would rally to it and so one of the the positive responses to the book it's a lot of people to say I see myself in that description and one of the things they've been kind of unexpected benefit or things like what you going to do locals who are now starting to care about Justice oh this is the kind of Christianity that I want to it so that's been there when do in it
 because other people have that same kind of disorientation when they don't fit in, the theological camps that currently exists a social map so to speak for us of Bible reading communities and I don't think people take seriously how much they are a part of a Bible reading Community it has it on every Community has his own strengths and weaknesses in his own blind spots and so I'm speaking about my community in a way that hopefully allows you to see your community well and then maybe through mutual dialogue we become better read this in the Bible together to kind of the next layer to this and this is a deep Rabbit Hole in literary theory in Hermon today since I don't want to go too deep down it but you had a good way of putting it and it's just a basic class isn't controversial once you see it at work that all communities interpreting the Bible are reading it and where this influenced by their social location in that can be limiting your that can be
 determine shape things that we can't see but it can also be a great asset when you get different communities sharing their unique contributions could people will be emotional or really worried when people talk like this because what they hear is I can't understand the Bible if I'm not black or something like that if I'm not why I'm saying that your skin color determined by one interpretation but it's always better when things are heated take a step back and let's use an analogy that people will understand anyone who's priest in to different churches from one could you move from one part of the country to the other and you begin to ask if this is really important so I want people to like understand the claim that is being made when you say OK Google and I'm thinking that and I have a book of the Bible in front of me and I'm asking the question how does this passage speak to the community of like this this these young singles
 I didn't even think about it actually in the text that I didn't consider until I have that community in mine and then if you look at a community and so what I'm saying is the community that you consider influences doesn't create things in the deck it allows you to see nuances just called motivated readings and everybody's done this everybody and so what I'm trying to say is that like the idea that when I start asking myself what does she look like to to read the Bible with with the African American community in mind I'm going to notice something to someone who's never thought about that community may not consider the other thing that you could think about. Another example I've always understood the Incarnation of always understood Mary's done I have a different understanding of that now that I've been married and I've seen someone actually be pregnant and still watching a pregnancy unfold and a birth has made me understand the Incarnation better so sorry
 variant is shaped the way that we see things and sometimes they helped us and sometimes they hinder us people who come from the majority World talk about how materialistic American Americans are about all the ways we can lure the way the Bible talks about materialism As Americans we listen to what these things are normal and we hear that testimony from the global south or the global church we receive it as a gift if that is the case then it was okay to say did my experiences as an African American in America shaped the way that I see the world and it influences the way that I read the Bible some ways it helps me in some ways it hinders me which is the reason why I need other people who have different experiences to help me read the Bible better in the idea that none of us are influenced by our experiences it's simply not true and example is I teach at Wheaton College and every year the students are
 how to choose whatever topic they want to choose for their like what Bible talk and without a doubt like 75% of the women will choose one of the women's ordination passages are like none of the do too it's actually with Ashley not reading it as carefully as they are paying close attention to that passage remember reading 15 books about that motivated to read it because it touches on their lives that Fella's at least in my class that we got this we know what this says it's so they're not paying attention to it so that their inability to take the question seriously and make them poor readers a text so why are the women really excited and reading a very carefully and the men in some cases not reading it carefully because you're not invested readers so we actually need people who are invested in different parts of the Bible to bring the best reading forward and so what I'm trying to actually do is activate the entirety of the body of Christ in the process of Bible
 because I trust that somewhere in the body of Christ people who are different from me can help me read the Bible better we talk about this all the time and other contact we talked about the German temperament and Germans do Bible study as you're different than the British temperament let me give you an example for I know this is random rambling but it's in the UK and hopefully the Brits don't get mad at me cuz they're so undone by how excited Paul was in Galatians they say he's so heated button up like emotionalism Stone never said I never said it read upper-middle-class European scholars discuss Paul what that means that the cultural value
 emotional kind of Detachment is influencing their critique of Paul Campos said the way to defuse it why does Paul does run on sentences and he starts when I did and he starts yelling that's how I talk you certain things yeah that's right you sitting in Europe Germany Germany and they say go back and read it they say in order for Christianity become the universal religion that can serve modern man we need to make it less Jewish and place Jesus in the in the contact the Greco-Roman the Philosopher's why do they want to print make juice into a Greco-Roman philosophy Pacific because that match the temperament of people in Europe in the 19th century so tell me that the intellectual climate in Germany and in Europe in a 1900 did not distort
 Jesus Culture worship for 30 for 100 years after the after World War I and how do we end up there if you go back and you look at black pastors during the 30s 40s 50s and 60s and 70s who were saying Jesus was Jewish and the Jewish Bible contains the story The God of Exodus he wants to go to be liberated and why we say Jesus is Jewish and The Exodus is important because we're looking at the Bible and saying that we need something that can talk about our freedom and we go there we see the next talks about Freedom the German and the African Americans are both reading the Bible from their social location from 1900 to 1948 who produced a better reading of the text and why do they produce that really wasn't cuz they were detached the African Americans were involved
 it doesn't mean though it doesn't follow from that pain and every case the African Americans got to get it right history shakes shakes and moves and sometimes and sometimes that location can Henderson about they can help us to pretend like this doesn't happen all of these things are what I want to say is we can't remove ourselves from The Interpreter process so we can do is offer a gift to the community for analysis
 yeah thank you many examples let's just keep rocking some examples but the best essentially what many of the chapters in the book are different biblical themes that you're trying to express through this reading Traditions that struck me cuz it's very it would be unique to you and to the tradition you grew up in which is what it's like to be reading the Bible and encounter as main characters are heroes people who are from the continent of Africa I will never have that experience so talk to me about some of these characters and what they mean to people and you're one of the things that I think people don't understand it's actually weather is just difficult to communicate the kinds of conversations that go on in Black communities and the people say in the black community with a internal could think of Christianity is a Christian is a white man with a white man's religion
 I slave masters and it is not an indigenous Faith levied against black christian in black contacts I'm just finishing listening to the autobiography of Malcolm X and this was his one of his main Platforms in the book so often in other spaces they think of the spectrum running from conservative to Liberal if you let it slide in between conservative businessman liberalism but for me it was like black nationalism and its most radical form like something like Malcolm X and Christian and so when I say I'm going to look in the Texas the other Africans I understand that is not necessarily the part of Africa that I descend from but the point of the matter is it is it is simply a matter of the biblical record than Africans are part of the Christian Store in the Jewish story
 go to the store in Easton this no one told me this growing up but this is like these are facts hiding in plain sight after him a NASA or half Egyptian have to wish those two boys I brought to Jacob they brought their boss and Jacob literally says he says it he looks at those boys and he says God made a promise to me to go make me a family of many nations and if a film of that promise I'm going to take these two boys have African half Jewish and make them to the 12 tribes of Israel and he doesn't because of their ethnicity because God promised me the nation's when I say I'm a part of the story of what God is doing in the world or black people part of what God is doing in the world
 does God brought in the African and I'm from Africa it's a fact that God's heart was always for the nations of the world that it was never a mono-ethnic reality that Abraham we make Abraham and the father of many nations in advance we make it all Global and we push it like to the missions instead of thinking about what it means in our actual lived experiences into out of walkthrough and I point out the place and within the one that really struck me the most and it's so weird when you're riding in discovering things at the same time I'm writing about I knew I wanted to write about the Ethiopian eunuch in Simon of Cyrene. Cyrene being held and I remember when I was riding the part about Simon of Cyrene and I'm writing about him being converted through the king of the cross of Jesus and I think they are real reason
 which is what I had in my notes but I do have this connection I turn to I was going to discuss the Ethiopian eunuch please also converted by reading about the suffering servant who is like that he's a like and he asked Philip who did your friend too and you know Phillip reached across that's the best opening of the night I wish somebody would come and ask me hey I'm reading about the suffering servant who died the guy who died for the sins of others who it who could it be that's what better open it was certainly could you possibly hold on us to Africans
 who brought to Jesus Through the preaching of the Cross and what I gather from that has two black people are drawn to Christianity like everybody also. He's trying to appreciate what you preach the whole gospel anchored in the Cross of Christ like the idea that I then find the cross compelling is a part of attrition African-American to go after people from Africa of African descent who looked at the cross and found a compelling and so that's what I was attempting to do I was trying to show that we're not like sneaking into the narrative Interlopers but the weird part that all people are probably conferences
 select activate that focuses on African Americans who actually true of anyone but some weird denied often that place at the intentionally included
 let's look at another example that is also really timely release in American culture right now this is the chapter you do on a Theology of policing so in the Traditions that I came to Faith in in my early twenties I still remember this when you want to develop his new testament theology about the Christians relation to the state there is Romans chapter 13 and then there's the passage of 1st Timothy about praying for your leaders and I still remember like that was that was what I was giving it to this is in the class and this was in chapels so what you show in this chapter is that that is insufficient and not a faithful representation of the whole new testament teaching about law enforcement so it's at Ya unpack this chapter for us that people misunderstand this chapter I mean everything just A lot's going on at the first thing I'm trying to do is like point out how theology biblical studies works
 such a bad idea are clustering text together and thinking of one of my to the other and I'm saying that there's actually no real reason why we have to begin with those passages asked us as the alleged what you see everything instead of doing that like the Book of Revelation different if we sent a revelation and then added in Romans 13:2 say that this is the first text it it's a decision because you also have the entire example of the profits right so when the prophets come to a King and say to a King you ain't gazing is in the Justice you will be talkin to the government if you know what the prophets of the Old Testament criticized the king not just Jewish Kings but also gentle or Pagan King even in the Book of Daniel Daniel seems to expect Nebuchadnezzar where
 you know you know it in the store that we can ask her where he's going to go crazy if you got to eat straw and come give you a raise for that go beyond the sea read over to the bottom and he says therefore Nebuchadnezzar cease your oppression of the poor and it may be the guy will have mercy upon you so yes it was arrogant what is Eric has manifested itself in the mistreatment of the peak of the roof of some citizens and Daniel says if you stop this may be God's going to have mercy upon you and a cancer isn't Jewish to listen to the goddess that's all governments
 to treat people in a certain way and if they don't treat people in a certain way then he's going to bring about judgment and see when you read the Bible what you see is God in the Book of Daniel I'm going to take this nation I'm going to just take this nation and God always picking up nation and tossing Nations aside so we know as Christians that God is always in the process of analyzing judging racing up and tearing down Nation we also know that he uses human beings to do so from the Old Testament so then how do you make sense of all of those things into romance 30 what exactly is Paul say in this where it is both a traditional and non-traditional reading from verse 13 I think Paul is saying it is beyond the confidence of Christians to discern the road they can play in any kind of revolution
 so that's is the Christmas to mr. the state but it doesn't mean that the state is not free of judgment and so what happens too often submission to the state is translated into Trust of the state Justice to the state when you actually pay attention to what the Bible said if we want to say that Daniel was submissive the Daniel was not in some kind of Proto violation of a 13-speed that you didn't do what all the all the time whenever connect your phone to their did Josie been always do what he was told to do we have examples in the Bible of what Christians did when he had no political power like the Hebrew midwives acquiescence aren't the same thing but what tends to happen is that when black people protesting Justice we're told to submit which actually made be quiet be quiet
 the God is judging us information we just can't discern the road we plan it so I am actually at an advocate of or I would not say that Christians can claim Divine just in case for some violent revolution I do believe that but I do believe it if I would give her the full freedom to engage in a robust sustained critique with the one called nonviolent resistance of government in our day is the focus of the citizens of possible into the state submit to the state but in the course of making that discussion Paul also outlines responsibilities of the state to the citizen because he said if you've done nothing wrong and you have nothing to fear
 what is that the actual that's the only requested African Americans have ever had
 we have noticed we shouldn't have to be afraid
 to impulse articulation of like what Christian should do he's also making it clear that what the state to do if I'm in the Democratic Republic and I have a legitimate gripe this after the state is that the sword is not a source of fear then it is well within the scope of the Christian tradition read us a do better to the conversation a little bit ago about social location and invested readings set just that chapter struck me as such a good example of that different invested readings will read Romans 13 when Paul says the emperor has the sword
 he's not speaking about the Emperor of running around physically enforcing laws he is saying that the emperor sister policies that affect the little pieces of the people in those policy should not result in fear for those who are innocent that goes from the government to the policy to the people that means when I want to talk about transformation of the expenses of the people I can't just simply say I want to change the heart to some people and hope they treat me well it's actually go to the government whatever form exists that should have Democratic Republic change the way that the state director sword to the live experience as a people on better that's what I think responsibility of the Christian is in the wider context of our I'm not an anarchist that Christians believe the government is it created Good As It Gets of God and what does it mean that they created good they are Stewart
 their stories are persons they don't know us when the government is being a bad Steward it's our job I mean we tend to think of like things like what David did it's merely a you like Morrison that was his power and his lust corrupting him and Nathan says you are that man you're the guilty one if you think you think it wasn't you think it was in like a politically dangerous thing to do to go and talk to a King about his sexual life
 that sexual dysfunction that sit at a salt I'll make sure I get it clear has ramifications all the way through into the actual life for the of the nation ultimately resulting in things like war and in division in Schism until this all the stuff manifest itself and so when Nathan is stepping into that world he's stepping into a politically fraught place
 it's at least idea of it that the only job of the Christians to kind of sit back and end in prey is a sub biblical idea it does not take the entirety of the Christian witness serious yea thank you I just that chapter has such a great example of the kind of perspective you're trying to offer it if I say no one can have access to this stuff unless you see all my expenses and know my expenses coffee to make exegetical claims but you can't so that's why I think that the centrality of scripture. I was just a real conversation
there isn't time and I knew that there wouldn't be a mess okay at the culminating chapter is about slavery in the Bible New Testament I am just going to tantalize our readers and say and just encourage them our listeners by listeners who I hope you saw offers of really just a thoughtful perspective on slavery in the Bible as we just had briefly about law enforcement and I just encourage people to take a deeper dive I'll be part of that you have to think about my I want people that I'm going to pull back the curtain to talk about books structures so that the primary pieces of the book is the idea that that the Bible has been and can be a source of Hope in an African-American contest and I deal with the different ways in which that could be true dealing with the issues they were facing today
 and so it may seem like a strange question the strange move to conclude that book with a discussion of slavery
 but for us that's the question is behind so many other questions how do I make sense of a Bible that includes slavery and what I want to say is I didn't know how and I don't know we'll see how it comes out long-term but when I began that chapter I didn't have a conclusion of the since I know how I'm going to solve the problem
 it is a problem I had to address and it was a like not an easy thing to do as a matter of fact those who are inclined to pray I meant I'm writing a whole book on Paula slavery that's going to be my next major project but I felt like you have to answer the question of the people asking and so if you going to engage in Ministry sometimes you got to steer the thing in his face and you got to deal with the difficult questions in a way that includes past with sensitivity and courage trusting that God will meet you there
 so when I sat down to write the contract I just sent them like I'm going to do about this this this this this this contract with the new contract for that book I didn't have any like no chapter there's one chapter that was written which is the address of the Police and charged with attempted I sent to them everything else just like a paragraph of slavery in the book but what I'm saying is you have to be able to meet the people where they are indeed with the questions they're facing if you can give them away through it. I think ultimately ends and hope and it doesn't settle for liked write a simple answers because life is complicated to buy a complicated sometimes our answers to these questions that people pose have to be complicated
 chapter is an exercise and hope that's the name that's up that's the Final Chapter besides the bonus chapter but actually in the book you built or something it says the slave will be with us until the eschaton therefore we must continue to read write interpret and hope until the Advent of the one who answer all our questions or rather than redundant the end of the end of the book I want to keep reading writing and struggling until Jesus comes back to answer the questions what you doing at the pastor that I can speak to the people who pass this way you're helping the people hope until the source of Our Hope finally returned so if the book help people helped a little bit more than I succeeded that's good man thank you that's really
 that the heart heartbeat and a passion came came through in the book and really moved me personally academic world works but I was like you know that I'm going to be a Christian in this book like this is not for Jesus to make this argument I got its academic don't want to make people to say goodnight like a devotional yeah but I like my faith influences the way that I read these texts and so I can't pretend like that's not there and I just wanted to write a book that was just like ultimately hopeful cuz I felt like when I wrote it it was just like this is a Caesar Caesar in this isn't just like the season of coronavirus feel like I started writing the book in like 16th 17th it's been a rough season in the life of the church
 and I have the strong conviction that I need to write something that was hopeful for the book went through like 15 different titles but the one word that never left any version of it was hope you thought you also have a podcast he tells a lot about that cuz these are podcast listeners are hungry for more things listen to we're basically just for people who are disruptive in a particular way and disruptive isn't not an assistant that deconstructed for the text or Christian tradition more broadly but because of their commitment to the scriptures they they challenged sometimes the status quo it's a podcast for Christians who love the Lord who love the scriptures and who don't always fit in because of that. So if you if you're looking for a cynical podcast
 I hate it the challenge this season we've had Lecrae I've got some more Justin give me oh God so many people I won't stay the rest of the names of the first three people on the first three episodes of the season so it's right was on last season's my good friend to each one was on last season so if there's a lot you can start you can start at the beginning and then kind of moved through the last episode of season 10 last year like this like what date this year awesome thank you so much for spend time of the Late Nights & Early hours of the morning writing books is hard work thank you for taking the time to put this out there I publish my this book is the second one but I wrote it during the finished it came out during my the 40th year of my life so those people who are feeling like you got to get all of this stuff done now I just take your time
