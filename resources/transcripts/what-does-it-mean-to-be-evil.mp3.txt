is there a John hot in the middle of the series on the chaos dragon and we're going to do a question in response episode because you got so many amazing question yeah come in already lots lots and lots of wonderful it's a wonderful so we've gone on quite a journey so far and we've got a lot of material to get through but let's stop and let's see kind of how people processing than one of the major sets of themes in the questions was around the meaning of the chaos symbol meaning of the waters what are we actually talking about the meaning of the dragon as a symbol and what it actually talked about so we should since we're going to talk real time we recorded this much earlier in the year 2023 recorded the conversation or near the tail end of 2020
 animated the cast Dragon conversations unique was John you and I gained a lot of clarity about how these symbols work and how we wanted to describe them in the video and going back conversations 1 through 10 have a whole bunch of ambiguities in them that you discerned before I did and that you were constantly sniffing out and asking questions and so episode 11 was a crucial like Watermark kind of conversation will be developed a new level of clarity about the symbol of the dragon at least in our conversation right so a lot of people ask questions for clarity because that episode hadn't come out yet yeah hopefully if you're following along and you got the episode over the help yeah and then it's not hopefully this Human Arc until I hit it one more time that are going to begin like that and then as always
 I'm looking for the most repeated question and an interesting one so we'll get to it is about the meaning of that bronze serpent that Moses makes in the wilderness in Numbers chapter 21 Jesus refers to it. It's going on with that sell all that and more in this episode from Chris in South Africa by John Hudson my name is Chris and I'm from South Africa in the podcast invention that creation was first in state of disorder and then got formed it into a stat order so my question is did God create disorder then and if so why because of the antagonist of the stories that's open and it's his goal to bring creation back into set of disorder and why did God create the world instead of disorder in the first place
 yeah yeah it's God created disorder that is a great question do you think this question gets us too far out of the Bible and into just philosophy or do you think the Bible gives us a really good ground dancers question
 I think the biblical authors are doing heavy duty philosophical lifting by means of these stories and symbols disorder well I think in phatic Lee no not because such an idea is a pensive it's an incoherent thing to say because for the biblical authors disorder is non creation it's the opposite of creation so creation means to create a realm of structure order life stable patterning in which there's the biblical authors Dryland for humans to live on so this was really helpful introduction to concepts of creation and nothingness in disorder even if you don't know anything about the ancient backgrounds of the Bible is the word by John Walton The Lost World of Genesis 1 yes a bunch of books
 is Lost World Series but the one in Genesis one helps modern Western us imagined the way of viewing reality you don't have a concept of no thing your basic categories are disorder or order of stability of instability technical term for it is a functional ontology ontology is a philosophical word meaning discussions about the nature of being and the nature of existence and in a modern ontology we tend to assume the creation means bringing physical material into being something this something something exists if it has material reality and that material reality is in contrast in our modern imaginations into nothing nothing something which we think of as maybe the matter
 real universe and once we drill into that we realize the material universe is very fluid that weird and then say Ness means the absence of anything even though it's actually almost impossible for us to imagine we have a category for that that's what we mean by nothing this would mean by noting that the Ancients didn't think that they didn't use that language or use those concepts for them to binaria like opposition was between creation which was order and the opposite of creation is and the biblical authors primarily use images to talk about the opposite of creation and there's a network of them one is Darkness the other is the waters the abyss the abyss Waters to to home of Genesis 1 verse 2 or the desert Wilderness Wilderness and those are the three chaos rounds
 a rounds of disorder that if you look in the literature of Israel's neighbors and you can go south jipped you can go tonight or to Mesopotamian literature and it's a very common Trope to begin creation stories by describing a disordered land with a desert or with the waters okay so the desert the abysmal water the darkness they represent this idea of disorder yeah yeah they conjure up images of a settings something material in our men and so then the question becomes who created that right how did that come to be and that's a question here okay if there is a disordered realm you know it's not the Wilderness it's not Darkness it's not that's why he doesn't Waters but that's how we can get to it that's right what is something so then who created it or am I wrong it's not something it's it's not that ugly nothing it's the opposite of creation effects if we let's just
 let's use our modern imagination but if we'd let Zoe lose my materialist ontology so if we're saying God created something out of nothing then for us it's incoherent to say who who created nothing it's a contradiction in terms of State who created nothing nothing is the opposite of creation creation is the thing that the opposite of nothing that's why it's a contradiction in terms to say created to sort who created the dark house Waters well that's the opposite of creation so but it feels like something to me to r m a l Triton alright something okay cuz we have a different way of imagining what existence is and so the living Colossus the way to the opening line in the beginning God created the sky and the land if you take that as a narrative action that God created everything in that moment however the longer whatever then when you come to vs. too if you take that to be the next
 narrative action now the land was wild and waste and darkness was over the surface of the deep if that's how you interpret the relation of hers wanted to do you do have a problem cuz you like everything for someone. Everything's okay so there's a whole bunch of interpretations the fall if you take that to you if you take the view that I think more persuasive and is actually not even just a widely held view that the consensus for you if you look in scholarly treatments of the relationship and responded to the first one is some kind of summary introduction to the whole of the chapter this is what you're going to read about God creating the skies and Landon in the beginning of the book that's right and so averse to the land was wild and waste and darkness was over the surface of the abysmal Waters that is a depiction of nothingness
 if I were to write this is write this in modern vocabulary let me tell you a story about in the beginning God created the entire Cosmos and universe that we know okay send the beginning God showed up and there was nothing God began with nothing he began with nothing and out of that nothingness he said let there be and God don't smoke spinning jenny created by any created something that's how I would tell it but the Ancients say well there was the to home via best it was wild and waste what they mean is nothing even to say the English sentence there was other ways of viewing reality I did create the dragon okay this is where the Big Lots of pull their move so in the ancient literature's around the dragon-slaying Miss was one of the most popular Tales
 most well-known stories and so in almost every other version of the dragon-slaying meth this was episode to where I tried to summarize some of this is that the dragon and the Sea are almost equal symbols to see represents the disorder of the nothingness we see one of us to see monster is a way of detecting that nothingness taking on an aggressive stance towards creation which means it can crawl up out of the ocean and the Godzilla Godzilla Godzilla Godzilla is working but it's essentially what it does in the land and how it works is equal to what the waters represent so you can talk about the Waters of the flood overwhelming creation or you can talk about the sea monster on dry land with the biblical authors want to do is they the waters retain their Cosmic chaos symbol meaning
 the boundary got to put the boundary on it but the vehicle out there was also want to say that there is no creature in heaven on Earth that isn't ultimately subject to God's will to whoever degree chaos becomes a creature that thing is God's so it is ultimately subordinate to God's will in some way unless God decides to set up Creations such that it goes on a journey from nothingness into into Union with God's Own Beauty and allows a degree of freedom for other Wheels to exist in the world and this is what's happening in the 7-Day creation narrative with the rulers above and then the rulers below I was so happy with the clarity yet I feel clear we achieved with the idea that the dragon in the biblical out to his mind is like a costume it's when a creature with a will
 an intelligence puts on where it decides to take upon itself the power of the power to do what is good in its own eyes and so becomes an agent or it unleashes Chaos on the land and when creatures do that the biblical authors use the dragon symbol applied to Heavenly rulers Are Spiritual Beings to do that or two human beings who do that so that others have taken up the sea serpent and re-appropriated it in light of their conviction that there is nothing in heaven on Earth that's actually arrival but nothingness is arrival to Creation cuz we came from nothingness which means that we could potentially return back to it and we can actually Unleashed nothingness on each other
 and so is that the real quick answer is God did not create this order he created order and anything that counters that order to drive it back to disorder that's the chaos Dragon the symbol of the Dragon to describe how intelligent creatures that have a will the God allows an agency and will in creation when they unleash chaos and reduce it back to disorder the biblical authors use the dragon symbol to describe those creatures which is why Rebel Spiritual Beings and it's terrible human beings are described as snakes and dragons which means that they have changed the meaning of the Dragon symbol within the biblical story
 that's not primarily the meaning of the Dragon symbolism in ancient near Eastern literature so they pulled a fast one dragons put in the sea stars this yet nor do this person means I don't know what is in their neighbors literature the Rival god of the Rival Diadora Cosmic rival for the Creator God and another Cree a rubber duckie you're a dangerous one and it's with Genesis three then that the dragon a reptile symbol gets applied to a spiritual being and then in the next story with Kane he becomes an agent of that spiritual being and you get to image with cane then if people acting like snakes so hopefully that
 question that is looking for clarity and maybe some of these earlier ambiguities and this comes from Danielle in Kansas is the darkness is a created being or an eternal force of some kind and if it is internal force of some kind what is the relationship to God the father thank you
yeah thank you Daniel this is an important question question to clarify what kind of God is being talked about in the Bible but there's this really sophisticated move happening here that's kind of hard to wrap your mind around talked around it it's about really directly God created order didn't create this order. Order but there is an opportunity for that order to become disorder
 and that opportunity can be God's creatures humans and sorts of things can become agents to do that and so that opportunity and the Agents that pursue that opportunity are the ones creating disorder that they're creating Darkness Darkness is an image for nothingness or disorder Darkness chaotic Waters or the desert those are Realms or images to describe the nothingness so the cast dragon is not Darkness with the cast dragon is is it's a symbol used to describe when intelligent image Bears of God spiritual or human behave in ways that reduce the order of creation back into nothing that yes and then at a little below that doesn't also just represent the fact that in reality I'm an experienced chaos and darkness you know like the
 things rot the ocean will pull you in and destroy you if you're hanging out in the wrong spot and we are all returning to the deaths and we are ready and so that is that the creation Force equation force of Darkness Call It Whatever it does exist in some real way well yeah it's a parasite on existence may be think of it this way so again we're back to the middle class is doing heavy duty philosophical work their most basic assumption is the meaning of the god of the Bible's name Yahweh
 he is he is the one who is yahweh's existence doesn't depend on any other thing just he is the I am so that God is real, so whatever creation is it something that came into existence out of nothingness and its existence is conditional dependent and nut like you and I have not always been here like our existence depends on all of the contingent things that came before us and we're so for something to exist and to share in Ultimate existence it needs to enter into some kind of Union with God that's the basis that the biblical story so you're saying then what I experienced it is normal which is a death drives us all to the ground you're saying that's a
 that's a parasite on reality it's a it's the result of what happens when creatures are not in Union participating in God's infinite life we are coming out of the nothingness we live short little lies of borrowed existence and return back to the nothingness that's the face of a creature that's not in Union with God I'm just going to take the logic of the biblical story of the few first few pages and kind of and paint the picture but yet God's creatures are made to participate in God's own life which is why the biblical story ends with the depiction of having a nurse with God's creatures and God's own life and there's no snow there is no Darkness exactly has gone it's all Garden all light and it's no more ocean and so would it home or disorder no more nothing this everything
 has become threatened is sustained into its ethics so the darkness is not a rival to God it's not a created thing it's the opposite of creation and what God Wills Is to bring something out of the nothing so that that's something can share in the Beauty & Gift of of existence and share in God's own life like that's the Arc of the biblical story so whatever the darkness is whatever the cast waters are as clear as Slim as famously said that parasite did he also have the weather for play that up well what is a shadow is it a thing I know it's the opposite of a thing it's derivative of a real thing and it has the shape of a real thing but there's nothing actually to it it is nothing but we call a thing and so that is
 in the next cut off but I appreciate your question Danielle because there are World religious worldviews where evil and good order and disorder are rival powers that work constantly in a cycled back and forth and neither one has ultimate you no power over the other and that's very different than how the biblical authors and Jesus see reality which is that what is fundamental is goodness that is God and that all creation is on a trajectory and what we experienced was evil and death and disorder is creation being like recalcitrant rebellious refusing to participate in the thing that God is inviting and God being patient and God being very patient and letting us sit
 outside of Eden as long as we want to apparently okay Andrew is wondering how these images relate to our conversations about the nature of evil evil evil Andrew and I live in Washington DC the chaos creatures series introduces a range of language to describe the forces of chaos and disorder extent are these ways of talking about what followers of Jesus have traditionally called evil is being an agent of chaos different from Evil and has your research into chaos creatures giving you a more nuanced understanding of evil thank you Andrew one of the things I've heard from a number of people with how helpful your rabbit story was with your son when it's scratched scratches or like the rabbits not being evil but the scratches bad yeah yes it's bad it's bad and why is it bad because I didn't do you and now your relationship with this route
 that is you know not the same you got to be more careful so it's bad you're bleeding but the rabbit wasn't being evil to wrap it was just being the rabbit the enemy has sharp claws and I guess in the same way it's like if I swim in the ocean and the ocean drowns me was the ocean evil or drownings bad and so does that was helpful for a lot of people to have more nuanced not everything that's bad is evil yeah we reserve the word evil at least Modern English to describe the intention or the effects of an intelligent creature of it's something that has a moral intelligence to choose to do something that has a bad result when they could have chosen to do something that a good result is it depends on the agents ability to discern between good and bad and it's up there
 multiple choice and that we called evil was fascinating for the biblical authors today
 in the beginning of the biblical story they use one word to describe what you can say is both rah rah rah which is the binary opposite of toes which is good sub rocking me bad and rock and also I mean evil but even raw gets first introduced in Genesis 3 the tree of knowing good and bad and it's been kind of slow as soon as you already know what that might mean yes we have to go back and look at the development of the word toes are good in Genesis 1 which we've done many times over the years but God assigns goodness when he establishes a new boundary of order
 or implants within creation order the ability to reproduce life and to flourish in to generate more life in abundance in the word gud scrub seven times God saw that what he made in the it was good and then the first time you get a concept of the opposite of good it doesn't use the word Raw it's When God says and God saw the human alone that it was not good not good not good not too so the opposite of toe is a human alone who can't fulfill the purpose for which God has made the human which has to be fruitful and multiply to get splits splits the atom in the whole time so they're the opposite of good is when there's something that prevents a creature from fulfilling the destiny and purpose for which God made it that's the opposite of good yeah that's bad it's teaching you what the opposite of go
 creature can't fulfill its purpose which means that goodness is when a creature can experience all that God made it to be an experience and the opposite of goodness is not a thing it's the absence of goodness not good at the absence of goodness when you get to the tree in Genesis 34 God says you can know the difference between how to fulfill your purpose and how to support your purpose knowing the difference between what is good and bad is about making distinction discernment discernment between that will lead to the flourishing and fulfillment of my purpose is human it will lead to the absence of good the opposite of that purp some other purpose and what God is saying is listen I'm really good I can teach you all to to let me teach you up there and the first thing I want to teach you is to depend on
 my wisdom beer and not take it into your own pants so that's the portrait so evil the same word is no Hebrew word for you well I'm more developed vocabulary kind of evolved his crew throughout the biblical story of that the basic category is teaching you that if the rabbit scratching you the tree not producing fruit and the human stealing fruits to keep it from other humans all of those can be described as one word in Hebrew of which is raw bad whereas in English we have different words with my call it like a tragedy a natural tragedy of the disaster to describe an earthquake to distinguish it from Evil which we as human murdering it was being an agent of chaos different from Evil and I guess in one sense yes being an agent of chaos is definitely bad but what was your intention intention
 because every day I'm an agent of chaos is going to be really helpful in the marriage is like what
 are you everyday and agent of Chaos
 and for some reason it's Human Condition to immediately go you were meaning to do that you won't ya trying to create chaos in my life film the attention when really they're just trying to cope to make their life work so they're not trying to Creek house for me and they're actually probably creating the version of order for themselves within their own experience yeah whether it was a good strategy or not
 so there is some new ones here there is this clear moment though where the biblical authors are like look the monsters there you can rule it like I need to if you don't you are that's kind of evil but there's this ambiguity I think that we need to get more space for it when it's like I'm offended by someone I don't have to jump straight to there being evil yes you know not to bring it forward to Sermon on the Mount but a little bit to bring afford to send them out this is truly what Jesus is going after in Matthew 7 you know we talked about Don't Judge Me movie chat but yeah so then you walk away from that short line going well I guess I'll never evaluating another person's actions ever and then the next about this back in the login the I I just need moment which assumes that you are going to see specs and other people die and help them in his purposes not don't ever help people yeah it's recognize that you're likely going to project
 your own issues on the other people and the probably should just assume your issues are way bigger than the other person's yeah so do your work first before you try and help other people and there's more to it than that but that's like the logout of your own but the default is that we tend to project a higher degree of intention on the other people's actions that results in raw when in fact that may not be what they were trying to accomplish and think for the biblical authors their way of honoring is that within the wisdom tradition of the biblical laws is all the all the murder laws are all these case laws about intention let's say in Deuteronomy Leslie two guys or chopping wood and then I said like flies off construction of a guy need on it too so that's a totally different situation than if he was like that's hey let's go chop some wood and then you hide behind a tree and then chopped his head off to like obviously
 we have legal categories for that manslaughter accidental injury vs meditated murder but it's all about intention and what what is intention intention is an expression of human who has made value distinctions instead some purpose or end is good and then the name of that good I think that it's probably likes it that justifies doing this other thing which might include killing human to accomplish that good in which case all human behavior is based on some vision of what is good but humans don't actually do everyone's trying to get to a good life yes very rare is the human who is actually trying to do evil
 really and and even you could probably philosophically argue that for a human whose moral compass has become so distorted even if they're doing evil but in their distorted moral economy they're doing evil because they think evil is too good for them you know it's like we're all trying to do the good it's just we have really different value systems of a good what a dangerous place to be in though yes mix those up and how easy is it to do it becomes really obvious when it gets really crazy yeah tents yeah but it becomes very easy to be deceived principal I've had I've had those moments when I'm so frustrated with someone and I just feel like they've wronged me so much of something that I actually have a moment thinking like how I could get back at them and that series of thoughts I'm trying to think of how to keep them from fulfilling purpose
 and that that like it's kind of squarely in the realm of evil like an evil thought and underneath that is a desire for something good namely a world where things are Justin Ryan right so not having that thought because I am inherently evil yeah this is what's underneath the long tradition in Jewish and Christian thought that evil isn't I think it's very real nothing is not real but if you look at its nature its nature is always a deprivation or an absence of what it's good or a taking away of what is good and it's usually done in the name of some vision of good however distort it so that back to CS Lewis's image the evil is essentially a parasite from the good to the shadowy parasite which is why
 the waters the cast Waters where the Sea Dragon is such a great metaphor for creatures who in their distorted value systems
 you know spread death chaos raw or just disrupted relationships you know most humans are going to kill another human but we will be with different levels of intention to deprive the people around us a good sweetheart actions and that are those are manifestations of the chaos Monster to use the biblical symbolism does long answer to question Andrew yes the cast monster and the chaos and disorder I think don't just help us understand the biblical Concepts to be polite I think they are like this is how the Bible's trying to teach us about what is good and what is bad
 through the stories and symbols and to do that let's hear from her and Washington d.c. hi Tim and John my name is Ahsoka I'm from Washington d.c. my question is in numbers 21 God instructed Moses to play Snakes on a staff and hold it above the people so if they look upon it they will be healed I'm wondering if this is a moment of God using the snake or the sea dragon as an agent for him rather than an agent of chaos let me know what you think and thanks for all you do your on what a mysterious image that we've had with us and our Bibles Jesus even refers to the bronze snake on the stash that I was just uses this brings it up in his conversation with Nicodemus that's right in the Gospel of John chapter 3 right after the most well known Bible verse
 yeah it's right before the John 3:16 and he's kind of chiding Nicodemus for not understanding images of rebirth and Recreation from his Bible and he's like what your teacher this real if you are in the Hebrew Bible this is your jam why are you and then he goes on to say you know no one has ascended up into the skies except the one who descended from the skies the son of Adam just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness so must the son of Adam be lifted up so that whoever believes in him shall have eternal life so the son of man in the wages refers to himself and so he sing I am the serpent that Jesus lifted up in the wilderness now that story real quick yeah remind us what it's the last in a series of stories were the Israelites are going on the camping trip road trip gone bad from out
 to the promised land told in the the middle third of numbers chapters 11 to 21 and it begins a section of seven stories were the Israelites Rebelle Grumble and they resisted efforts to get them through the Wilderness and keep them alive and bring them into the garden speaking of not knowing the difference between good and bad guys trying to do good for them and they keep thinking about trying to do that so the first and the last stories are symmetrically matched
 fire comes out from God and consumes the edges of the camp this is the beginning of chapter 11 in the place is called burning because there was a burning in the camp The Last Story the seventh story is the Israelites Grumble against God for bringing them out into the Wilderness and so God sends fiery snakes so it's the word seraphim which means snakes that have a venomous bite that makes it feel like your Skin's on fire but it's the word burned is the root word for this word So It Begins and ends with fire and the snakes bite the people and in in the snakes are disorder the snakes are chaos creatures from the desert crawling up out of the underworld from holes in the ground and in one case it's the fire that comes and Moses cried out to God and got stops the fire here God sends fiery venomous snakes the crawl up out of the chaos around and
 or can I just stop by real quick when we say God sends you had a great moment few episodes go just helping us just remember that God lets creation go back into this order and then we get this language of God sends the flood or the fire you can kind of get this image of like a god whose like I'm going to punish I'm maliciously like retribution where the biblical framework is more that God sustains everything and at some point God allows the creation to tell ya if you're tracking through the Wilderness but you've got the fiery Glory protecting you of God said that the snakes going to stay away but if the people are consistently saying why did you bring us out here we don't want you with us anyway y'all way let's get our own later let's go back to Egypt giving you what you want then yeah I usually hold back the snakes but if you don't want me to
 like be who I am today then like that's that's that's totally damaged yeah also we need to remember this Israelites in the wilderness are people called out from among the Nations to be God's unique Covenant Partners in the Kingdom of priests and that singling out what God did to demonstrate his character to them in the Exodus from Egypt in forgiving them for the sin of the golden calf like all that's in the past my point is that the Wilderness narratives and numbers show God as being very more severe in his responses to the people's Rebellion then before Mount Sinai but they're uniquely culpable in a way so they've entered into a covenant commitment with a God who said listen let me teach you the way to life if you don't follow the way the life you're going to kill yourself and sounds familiar sounds like
 on the day you eat of the tree of him and go to bed. You're going to die don't do that and if you listen to my word you'll live like that that's the story line here so that people don't listen they reject their God and so they end up with snakes biting them that's the end of the story they all do snakes so the people come and say oh my gosh we send we'd spoken against the Lord and against you Moses so intercede for us and this is the Moses goes and does what he did what he's been doing all along in the wilderness and so God's instruction of the system make one of these Fire Snakes up to make a bronze version of it and the word bronze rhymes with the word snake and the hacha the hacha and then he is to set up this bronze snake on a staff and hold it up so all of a sudden we're mixing together the symbolism of Moses's staff
 Cecily was us has been both a snake and a sea monster that he used the holdup that's right to confront pharaoh and Confederacy and remember our puzzle when we are considering the splitting of the sea was that he uses the staff right that represents the sea monster but God's human image of God is using a symbol of the sea monster to Splitsville came the sea monster with the chaos water is using the dragon against the Dragons using the dragon against dragon and so similarly here now the dragon in the form of the snakes is the source of death but then Moses puts a version write an image of the snake on the staff right holds it up and then anyone who looks at the staff with the snake or save from the Snickers saved from Death so it's another image of Moses the image of God look up to death to be saved from death
 and okay and all you hear is this crazy riddle this story is a full-on riddle that's why it comes last it's really short but cuz you're meant to meditate on its hyperlink relationships to all the stories that came for you from death you need to gaze upon death and the same God who will hand people over to death if they refuse this gift of life is the one who wants to give life and so the death is like it's on the leash Deftones can only do its thing if people let that's overcome them through their choices okay with the riddle remains that the reason why not put a symbol of life on the staff right thing that you associate with death God turns into the vehicle of life but that's also true for the sea Waters the sea Waters that are split with the staff that was the Sea Dragon those waters are deadly
 but actually becomes the Gita path of life path of Life mrs. the same thing of what the great fish represents and Jonah the fish's belly yeah but the thing that normally kills people getting swallowed by the Sea Beast becomes a strange vehicle of life and Jesus uses both the belly of Jonah's fish and this Killer Snake the becomes a vehicle of life to describe what's going to happen to him when he dies okay so what does Jesus mean he's not that Jesus is not that I know what does it mean to gaze Upon Jesus to gaze upon the snake snake Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so the son of man will be lifted up that's code language and John to be crucified be lifted up and exalted on the X Jesus is going to experience.
 yes and we need to gaze upon about it so the snake represents both death and the gift of Life simultaneously because God is the one who can take away or give life and so in the same way humans unleashing their evil becoming agents of the snake to take the life of the son of Adam will actually in God's plan and purpose become the way that he gives life Moses is holding a symbol of the chaos creature Jesus like nailed it yeah and I remember what we were talking about is a innocent man who was publicly executed by the Imperial right occupier
 because of a completely rig trial and the cross represents both the fruit of the most distorted human structures of power and Injustice and their simultaneously condemned by God and turned into the vehicle through which God re-gift eternal life to his world it's remarkable, remarkable claim to make the thing that you associate with Death Becomes that God's power the way to life the way to lock half of Life yeah and then Jesus will say you know take up your cross you know you said something to me this Summer that I haven't been able to shake and we would do everything cost for a while as a contact of talking about AI artificial intelligence you know some people have this vision of the potential of AI to create what we would thing
 has eternal life right solving mortality what if our genes could be changed what if we create nuclear fission and resources are abundant and we all just learned to share and heal our bodies in like there we are does New Creation come that way I was kind of that conversation but you said was what you said was the vision of the Bible is it that the way to life is through death only way to life to True eternal life now it's true. That's the way and here we have that Jesus is the one who ever wants to follow me must take us across and that kind of will not
 here's a symbol of death look up and be saved through death that's right yeah this story and numbers 21 is so deep it's a riddle that it was surely why Jesus quotes it so ask me and let's have this conversation another year and I think we'll have discerned another couple of layers here but we're also meditating on the snake in the garden that that was a creature of God but became a vehicle of death but then through the riddle the God says to the woman that's the seed of the woman that will come and crush the head of the snake while also being struck by the snake on its he'll even there the deadly strike of the snake on the heel of the seed of the woman actually is simultaneously part of the Seas woman's victory of the snake the right from the beginning of the biblical story with the snake Unleashed is going to become the vehicle through which God restores life
 the Seas got to go to the belly of the chaos to check the ways that we have taken the agency given to us by God to discern between good and bad and that side down distorted nightmare good and bad that we created human history that's all got to go through some kind of died so that it can discover the real life but that time God has in store for us but doesn't mean it's all like the resurrection whatever the resurrection means means it's something of what we know is really now we'll pass through wife is on the other side is death but also a lot of it's got to die for us to be able to participate in the gift of life that God wants to give Connor back to the first question
 we've got a great question from Rebecca in Kentucky
 considering the distinctively down a dangerous path and it's taken out of context by saying that individual human beings can become actual Chaos Dragons you might be giving people a convenient label for their political enemies we could be co-opted to increase hatred or even to baptize violence-affected Rebecca super important question yeah and I feel that tension with like the story of David and Goliath while it's such a cool story and then the imagery gets even a moron we think of glass like a snake remember the stories we looked at of cisra the captain of the armies that right what a shame if those stories become fuel for me than to go okay who are the people who are snakes in my life and I'm going to go chop their heads off and not just what a shame let's just name the fact that these stories have
 been used and inspired people to do exactly that threw out two hundred years of their kind of interpretive history allow that we just have to name like these stories have been read. That way and so what we need to then ask is what what is a Biblical perspective on that and so that's a long conversation but I probably the most distinct way to go that if your follower of Jesus and you care about the Bible and what it says it's I think morally irresponsible and impossible to derive of you from this that some people just are the seed of the snake and they need to have their head smashed by other humans Jesus explicitly rejected that view in Jesus actually called people see them snake John the Baptist and he did certain religious leaders that accused him of being in League with the powers of evil so it's not to say that people can become chaos agents they can
 but the point is that we all can yeah like that's one thing the cane but other people have it more than me but that's what's so wonderful about like the David and Goliath story for example is that David becomes a dragon slayer but then also he becomes a dragon in his own family with the story of David and Bathsheba and he actually becomes like Cain to the best sheba's husband so the biblical authors what do you say they take no they don't play favorites they're trying to show how any and every human can and will be co-opted by the dragon at some point right so it levels the playing field and then you said you was explicitly like love your enemy yes and then Jesus explicitly forbid his followers to use violence as a means for spreading and caring for the even buy a mouth like whatever we would call it propaganda or like just spewing hatred towards someone
 love your enemies bless them do not curse them whatever that means if it means nuts calling someone a fool is as bad as murdering them so that's one angle to say if I'm a follower of Jesus and I'm reading the Bible whatever meaning I'm going to get out of these dragon-slaying stories of a human to another human in the Hebrew Bible it should not lead me to label other humans and think I need to somehow deal with them through physical force that explicitly goes against the teachings of Jesus and not just physical and also thank you we've been widening the forms of violence to verbal abuse and contempt contempt I mean Jesus said we are to love our enemies actually love them and engage them in Creative nonviolent forms of resisting whatever destructive Behavior there in leasing in the world so that's one piece another kind of important
 way to go with that is Paul the Apostle's line infusions where he says our enemy that is an amazing follower of Jesus are not flesh and blood but rather principalities and powers in the rulers and gives a list of spiritual powers of this present Darkness simplest mind if you want to grab some pads yeah pray some spiritual heads and love your neighbor and do justice and goodness in the name of Jesus and your crush that has its name and serve the return and the unified across boundary lines that's how you trust that Snake Eyes so thank you Rebecca a super important you requires some
 interpretive sophistication to know how to read these violent dragon-slaying stories in the Hebrew Bible with a Messianic lens but I think that's what it means to read the Bible as a Christian and we'll get there a little more in the series we will yes thank you Rebecca last but not least with actually a really sweet question from Colin in Vancouver Bible project my name is Colin and I'm from Vancouver Canada my five-year-old daughter loves dragons some of her favorite movies are How to Train Your Dragon and Raya and The Last Dragon so break it to her that the Bible's account of dragons are chaos monsters and what is your response to more positive receptions of dragons in The Wider culture around the world
 yeah I know it's same thing for Surfers in the ocean
 yeah sure the fact that there's no longer any see so I agree yeah how do we break it to her kids that dragons are entirely evil in the Bible are they are they entirely on the Bible there's the serpent in Isaiah that the kid plays with pretty defense and it's a defanged Moses tame the dragon there's a kids are going to play with Dragons maybe what do we do with the fact that the Bible's portrait of the Dragons is almost entirely negative maybe it's a good opportunity to talk about how cross-culturally symbols can have different meanings cuz I think actually the the dragon the reversal of dragon perception
 are lions actually really beautiful and there's a number children's books that I we read the records over the years that are about that to about the Knight who becomes friends with a dragon is dead of slaying it right and that's so Jesus style like your enemy actually it's probably more like you than unlike you right and no so not since I left the Twist on the dragon simple but it's just that twist doesn't fully happen within the Bible with the dragon symbol did the idea happens within the teachings of Jesus about enemies it's real it gets closer we just go with it and the fact that the Bible doesn't fully transformed the dragon image I think it's okay cuz it also helps us teacher kids that the Bible comes from a time and a place and that it's doing one thing with these symbols
 but that the symbols are about ideas and ideas undergo development and so in The Sermon on the Mount Jesus teaching you to love your enemy is a way forward for us to what up what are you in the dragon we had to do this series but we live in a culture where dragons were only good yeah that be really hard and that's like that's this whole the methodology of the Bible's ancient literature so we have to come and we have to first recognize the people who wrote posed organize the Bible how did they think and so there are things like that in the Bible we have to agree or so and so and the dragons the dragons one of them great question Collin I will now think that 304 how to talk to my kids in the Bible
 they go everybody you sent in such a great intelligent thoughtful questions thank you thank you thank you we love hearing from you and we love hearing more more questions we're going to do another Cuban are there still ground to cover so they'll be more opportunities to dress him questions but for now that's it today show was us sitting down and talking with some questions from our meeting audience but it made possible by Our Hope podcast team associate producer Amanda Ponder our lead editor Ben Gamel this letter is Tyler Bailey and Frank are then and Tyler who's sitting in right across the classroom a Time episode of Wu does the annotations in the app she just got some love on her slap Channel recently at school at the great features in the app
 and the whole team you just named are able to do what we're doing because the generosity and enthusiasm and support thousands of people just like you were listening and thank you for getting behind this project we love getting to do this and we're so glad this helpful for you as you all are figuring out what it means to read the Bible and follow Jesus and put those two things together so thank you for being part of this with us hi this is Bastian and I'm from Indonesia Southwest Missouri I first heard about Bible project by YouTube's recommended video algorithm for me to understand chapters in the Bible I used to have a project for bring my stuff on a deep study about the prophet's message to words of the Bible I'm an author and I use Bible project to write better fiction my favorite thing about Bible project is that they
 it will be grounded resources for people at all stages of following Jesus the unified story that leads to Jesus we are crowdfunded project when people like me but people like me find free videos that he knows podcast classes and more come
