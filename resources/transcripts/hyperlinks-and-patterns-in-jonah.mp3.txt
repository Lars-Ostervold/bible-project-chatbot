hey this is John and the temp and this is Bible project podcast today on the show we're going to do the third and final sneak peek of the lecture series that we've been doing on the Book of Jonah Tim you taught a class for what we can come classroom 3 Seminary level classes and we feel knows we put them up online and the Book of Jonah has been near to your heart for awhile and you got to Alexa through it with him students and we've been listening along and this final episode of the podcast isn't the final for the whole class but what is this episode of this is like the third little previous episode here but the class itself has like almost 40 more sessions yes this is focusing in on how all the story of Jonah is developing and repeating a Core theme that repeats throughout the whole Hebrew Bible all the way back to Genesis to buy
 how God will choose a select person and call them out from among the many so that they can intercede usually prefer some really bad people and it often involves passing through death or Waters of chaos sounds like Book of Jonah felt like the Book of Jonah sounds like a lot of sounds like the story of Moses and even more Joshua all right so that's what we're going to do let's listen in on this lecture with Tim and some students go to the Book of Jonah Hex joining us here.
 let us turn to the Book of Jonah we're not going to make it very far but I think something will open up for us if you recall in the Tanakh organization the prophets has kind of two main sections it traditionally these came to be called the former prophets which is the first four books Joshua Judges Samuel Kings and then the latter profits which is what we typically think of the big three Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and then the scroll of the 12 so what's interesting is the 12-pack of Minor Prophets in Christian tradition they never existed independently on a scroll as we have them they certainly began life as independent works but at some point they were brought together and we're themselves hyperlink together as a work on a scroll in a very similar way and salt
 I think of it in terms of Works within works with and Works collection of collections of Collections and what we just saw in the organization of the macro collection is diverse sections the Torah Joshua Malachi the beginning of Psalms those have all been coordinated together to circle around Ki main theme consider repeated so just noticed as a pattern of communication how that works then it means that any time I'm in one section of these writings the tour of the prophets was riding I also need to be aware simultaneously of the whole thing at the same time another words when I read Deuteronomy thirty-four I'm in three sentences at the end of the Torah but I went in those sentences I'm also simultaneously thinking about Malachi and how the whole thing fits together and so that's this literature works that way the whole context needs to be brought to bear on every
 individual story say the Book of Job but then the Book of Jonah will also begin to inform and give me perspective on things other things in the collection as well let's look at some examples of that if you look at the first sentence of the Book of Jonah I've got multiple translations open here for the first sentence
 show me read the first sentence with the word of Yahweh came to Jonah son of Amitabh I saying let's just pause when you see Lord in all capital letters that's our translations signaling to us that the Hebrew word that's 4 letters of the Divine name revealed to Moses so in some Jewish Traditions a couple hundred years before Jesus people stop pronouncing the name allowed to the Reserve at sacred honor and so it must have fell out of pronunciation and so the word Lord in Hebrew came to be swapped his people and say it say the word Lord which is Adonai in Hebrew so that tradition is carried forward in our Modern English translations not too many people are offended by saying the Divine name some Messianic Jews are and then some traditional Jews are but I personally found it to bring fresh energy to my own reading the Bayou
 go to say the Divine name up because it was put there I think to reread when Moses and the prophets read these texts so that's the short little thing right there now there's something hidden here if you only read the numerical standard there's nothing hidden that you won't notice because English translation doesn't it clue you into it if I turned say to the English Standard Version ESV I'll look at the first sentence of the word of Yahweh came to Jonah when the vomit I sang to see difference what is it
 now I turn the NIV just begins with the and Ivy and the nrsv now now this might take Mountain out of a molehill right here but this is significant and I don't be afraid I'm a show you the Hebrew text of Jonah opening sentence you don't have to remember this at all but that letter right there's the Hebrew letter of that's the word and Hebrew or wow in and depending on your pronunciation of offer while and in Hebrew of the word and doesn't ever stand by itself you attach it to the beginning of this to us most medical language is attached the word and to the word that it's in front of so the first word is why he and it came about the word of Yahweh to Jonah the Book of Jonah starts with the word and it's a connective conjunction so you just tell me the difference between the word of Yahweh
 name to Jonathan Rama Thai in the difference between that and the word of checking in the words and is there it presumes a bigger context I'm continuing something so to start a sentence with the word and means there's something before it that you're connecting it to its presuming a larger context let's just one observation to make you might think it's minor and perhaps it is an observation the where and the word of Yahweh came to your knob then I meet I just take the Book of John okay if I supposed to know who that is you are supposed to know who that is because this figure appears elsewhere in the collection doesn't it's already in the Book of Jonah in the first sentence of the Book of Jonah the word and it's like little threads stitching the book into the context the Book of Jonah doesn't float by itself in the Old Testament the first word of the book
 is it into a proceed in context the mention of Jonah son of Amitabh istps elsewhere in the profits in 2nd Kings chapter 14 I already knew this was significant but in actual prepping for this class I realize just how significant is this little story is where John it feels like we're going to spend some time here what we hear is about a really terrible King named jeroboam the second here's what God did for this really terrible King you always saw the Affliction of Israel that it was bitter there was nobody Banda free there was no helper for Israel so what did he do he saved them by the hand of jeroboam and He restored the borders of Israel back to what they were in the days of Solomon that's a very nice thing to do for what kind of thing a terrible King and who was the prophet they're speaking this promise
 a restoration and blessing on the wicked King you all nice and if I meet I'm so we also got then here in the book of Kings is another appearance of Jonah already in the first line of the book where hyperlinked into the scroll of the 12 with weird and we're hyperlinked into the prophets and his role in 2nd Kings gets us thinking about ya God sending profits to do good things for people who don't deserve it if that has anything to do with don't deserve it into blessing that's interesting go back to the Book of Jonah the word of Yahweh came to Jonas and if I meet I sang go to Nineveh the great City the great City have I heard of none of it before I have heard of Nineveh before here's what's interesting if you're reading in the book of kings that story in 2nd Kings chapter 14
 Jonah announces that the borders of Israel will be expanded which is always assigned a blessing for Israel when their borders are expanded for the wicked evil King in the very next chapter it's all going to be reversed in the very next chapter we are introduced to the 2nd Kings 18 verse 29 in the days of Pekka king of Israel is after Jerry Bond food donut coincided with who comes showing up to town taking everybody captive and just like annexing the land of Israel the king of Assyria whose capital city is this is after Jonah in the narrative so another words what Jonna is announcing is going to be reversed and I'm done by the people who he is sent to in the story but in the narrative time I hasn't happy
 but for the reader you know all of this you see what's going on here so that's interesting so the role of Nineveh or a Syrah is also connected to Kings but is this the first time you've heard about the city of Nineveh this is really Bible nerd trivia the first time you've heard of the city of Nineveh it's this weird story and it's in on the list of genealogies after Noah gets off the boat you know this no gets off the bus at the Genesis 10 called the table of Nations the listing of seventy Nations make up the map of the kind of biblical world and now I have three sons and we get a list of the sons of japheth we get a list of the sons of ham hams firstborn son who then has seven sons and then were told of an additional eight son the grandson of ham
 that guy's name is Nimrod his word spells Rebel in Hebrew bike motorcycle rider no Rebel with a cause or without one he is a mighty warrior on the land violent Mighty voir and he loves to hunt animals will talk about this later you know he is the first king in the Bible first king and where did he build his first Kingdom battle on Babylon 4 cities is the Hebrew word Babylon in other words in Hebrew with one word Bothell it gets translated Bible here and in the next story building City in the tower and then for the rest of the Bible are English translators translate the same word not in the habit of Babylon which I think sever the connection for many people it's the same place here Babylon I wish I knew why so he builds for cities to build his Empire here by the Euphrates in the land of
 John & Son. Lynde do you know there was part 2 to his Empire is Babylon good or bad in the Bible mostly bad though there are some Redemptive moments that are so this is like evil empire part 1 cross the afraid is the Tigris evil empire part 2 and what did he build you went forth into Assyria and he built Nineveh and also recovered ear and color or andressen another force it is between Nineveh and Colour that is the great City the great City to go back to look at 10 again how does Jonah begin arise go to Nineveh that great City do you want to know how many times that phrase that great City appears in the Hebrew Bible
 it appears to X the Book of Jonah and the story right here okay so what that means is that somebody who's composing Jonah has then hyperlink us into the table of Nations from Genesis chapter 10 a story about a prophet going to Nineveh is going to ring associations and patterns and connections this intentionality here so if the other story of Jonah is also about Jonah being sent to bring a word of God to people who don't deserve it there's something important that I'm supposed to the city that Joanna goes to is a city that was introduced on page 10 and is coordinated and associated with Babylon so that itself is significant fits in and what it means okay I need to also understand what's going on with Nineveh on page 10 of Genesis and I need to understand how and all the sudden you're thinking about the whole thing even though I just began was two sentence
 so this is every books like this in the Hebrew Bible every paragraph of every book in the Hebrew Bible is like this and go for a long time I was just I felt like I'm in the haze now cuz everything's about everything but someone just give it a lifetime and will you find us after a couple years you'll start to know your way is he as you learn to spot a hyperlink you follow it through pause and Jonah what's going on in s Kingsport TN what's going on in 2nd Kings 13 + 14 + x is that one section 13 to 17 and Jonas it's it's like reading a set of web pages that are all hyperlinked and they're all about coordinated topics and ideas it's a little mini universe that creates associations as
 go from page to page to page and back and everything gives you new angle and depth and perspective on everything else so this is essentially what we're going to be doing is just working our way through the Book of Jonah following patterns in hyperlinks that. Somebody is trying to get us to do this or not just making this up and so the way is that the biblical authors pattern and hyperlink things it's a skill set and the most important skills to develop is if you learn to do it is learning to spot repeated words I mean you think the phrase that great City you know there's ways to search for things in the Bible now and it's quite surprising you think it would occur on every other page but it doesn't and it's all about Nineveh and
 unlimited pause
 on that point as we've just worked through the first sentence but I feel like the principle that we just introduced as really significant we're going to keep returning to it the hyperlinked nature of the text in the collection thoughts or actions I never noticed a connection between great City here in Genesis and Jonah but now especially with the association of Nineveh as you know with Babylon and other unpleasantness why would it be called that great city which I mean for us great has its connotations I'll just a side but also have something good and so is that in there as well or is this a different meaning in English the word great has us great probably that's a metaphorical meaning of something is good it's a metaphorical development off of a metaphor is it today
 it's good but if it's big big large and then it can refer to something size so we can have a literal meaning big in size can have metaphorical meaning big in significance cuz he can refer to something that's important but it's not used in the sense of that's great. The English thing thank you but the Great
 I didn't mean to do that I wish I had meant to do that but when we looked at what happened after always on 2nd Kings 14 we went to 2nd Kings 15 and we see that the reversal of the land now is that how does the book of Nahum tie-in is it that that is at that time. Starts to knock on the door of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in chapter 15 and that's in the mid-70s BC the kingdom of Assyria actually is like conquered by Babylon in 6:12 BC hundred and decades after the time of Jonah and so that's the book of names registering that right there however the book of Nahum is a part is one of the Scrolls of the 12 prophets so you already know as a reader of the scroll of the 12
 that the ninevites repent of their repentance
 which makes it a fascinating minute meditation point that even those who at one moment recognize the grace and mercy of God and experienced it it doesn't mean that they continue to bask in especially if they turn back to the way they're going this is what Jeremiah 18 is all about and it's why their major hyperlinks to Jeremiah 18 in Jonah chapter 3 so we will get to that very point but you're right Nineveh eventually doesn't up and ruined just like Jerusalem and just like that blonde with Jonah beginning with Viber wow are we pretty certain that traditionally Obadiah always preceded Jonah so that that wow that link would come right after Obadiah and what ends so it seems like that should cause us to ask the question what's the main message idea behind Obadiah the Jonah is now making a statement about is that the right way to think about it I think so
 in ancient manuscripts about the ordering of the Scrolls within the 12 there is one there's actually one little Dead Sea scroll fragment the only fragment of Jonah has it following now that's interesting so I'm still in a state of development on how significant sequential ordering is I do think it matters on a macro-level look at the shape it's not but at the same time once everything is gets hyperlink to put it anywhere in the point is follow the hyperlink to the relevant spots and you'll see what you're supposed to see but there are there is some significance of the face of the nation and send the day of Yahweh is a major scene in The Scroll of the twelve and who among the Nations who is it that will call on the name of the Lord and be saved which is from The Book of Joel and that has relevance for the book of Acts because the apostles find themselves really thinking about who is included on those who call on the name of the Lord and Does it include non juice as well and they come to the conclusion that it does
 according from the school of the 12 and what they quote from the famous but John is not that far away you know about this great City so you said that there's only two places where it's a great city right do you think that there's a connection do to other great cities that exhibit the same sort of characters that Babylon does I'm so glad you asked that question I'll tell you the reason why I ask because the other Renditions of I can't I don't know Hebrew I'm going to make it very clear did not take Hebrew from my recollection other meanings for good doll is to exalt yourself to a position of greatness which is something that's also a recurring theme so do you think that that plays into it though not necessarily exactly the same phrasing that great City
 but other great cities referred to in the Bible who's who demonstrate the same sort of character do you think that there's a link between the word grade is significant for this connection here so yeah but that's perfect timing
 we're going to do for the rest of the session is actually I'm going to try and create very quickly the map of stories that are being hyper linked to the main ones in the Book of John what are you supposed to already know coming into the Book of Jonah and it's going to do with profits being sent to do something for great cities as we learn from Jonah chapter 19 of the great city cry out against it for their evil has come up before me so God has become aware of the evil being done in Nineveh and it's a great City can I think of other great cities or other times and places where they cry or a great Act of evil has arisen up to God then it becomes aware of it and then does something about it oh yeah okay now we're talkin talkin and
 Genesis Genesis for stepping in to things that you were supposed to have uploaded as you read those opening sentences of Jonah so we've got the story of cane which of course presumes Genesis 3 which presumes Genesis 2 and then we can do that all day long but this isn't a class on the Book of Genesis the so right after but we will say this is relevant for Jonah right after God banishes Adam and Eve Exile them from the garden and we're told that they go right to the East of Eden they don't go far away they don't leave you didn't they just leave the garden and then they're just right at the East side and they're on the Eastside still in Eden but out of the garden Adam and Eve have Cain and Abel and they are offering sacrifices their food offerings and for able animal sacrifices wow what for why were they trying to accomplish
 but here's the thing is that God I'm showed regard for Abel and his offering but for Kane and his offering keep God does not show regard or look upon it what was Cain's respond oh yes and Hebrew the word for get angry is to become hot if I asked you to do some readings of the translation of John I provided for you and every time the word anger came up with the word heat or hot in there cuz I'm the word can be used of things that are unrelated to anger a fire can do the same thing for the word for to get angry and Hebrew is to get hot I literally soaked and became hot hot with anger his face fell why are you hot sis God why is your face Fallen if you do the Hebrew word here is good if you do good won't there be a exaltations lifting up for you in the New American Standard is all kinds of little things here The New American Standard
 when they want to tell you dear reader we need to put in some words in English for this to make sense but they're not there and Hebrew so we'll put them in italics that's what that Alex mean so if you do good won't there be exaltation listing up if you do not do good sin is crouching at the door it once you hear the same thing I told your parents to rule become rulers especially of the Beast rulers of the Beast you can rule this thing and it but it wants you if you do good think if you do good good and evil if you do good send won't devour you the Beast won't get you but if you don't do good the animals going to get you and what is the animal here the first time seeing as used in the Bible he doesn't rule the Beast and so it comes about that they were in the field and Cain kill his brother Abel your brother
 and he said I don't know I don't have knowledge about that am I the keeper of my brother he said what is this that you have done the voice of your brother's blood the innocent blood of your brother crying out to me from the ground so the first instance of this pattern the motifs in the Bible they it in the blood of the innocent crying out to the Heavenly judge to bring Justice and does vindicate the innocent blood of the oppressed so just like his parents were cursed from the ground so now he is cursed from the ground why is he cursed from the ground will for a different reason than his parents here because he has spilled his brother's Blood on the ground so the ground will be hostile to you now it won't give it strength to you and you are exiled to Wanderer on the Earth plane says that his punishment is too great to bear and so God says all right I will protect you and he appoints a sign for can Dude rabbit hole
 let's just step around it and keep moving Cain went out from the presence of the Lord literally Cain went out from before the face of Yahweh and he sat in the land of wandering node means wandering East of Eden you know what else he did he start a family and he built the first city the first city in the Bible is built by whom by The Murder By the murderer and then you know what's interesting there is a line Seven Generations that come from Cain and the seventh from Adam through can is a guy named Lemak what do we know about Lynn he's the first character to have more than one wife and he is a murderer even even greater than can he says I've killed a man for wounding me a boy for striking may I listen if God protecting Cain seven times over then here's what I declare God has to protect me Seventy Times Seven this is the first city of blood city of blood in
 Bible and so you're meant to say well if Cain killed his brother and the blood cries out from the ground can build the city and then his descendants Murder By multiples of 70... How much how much cuz it doesn't need to it's leading you to the conclusion in a tables innocent blood cries out from the ground ohm an how much innocent blood crying out now with me and building the City built on the blood of innocent this is a crucial portrait in the storyline of the city then the story interrupts with a long genealogy your favorite part of the bible to read and yes there's too much to do here when the narrative picks up again who do we meet but some of the strangest characters in The Bible Genesis 6 people are multiplying on the face of the land
 yeah through the line of Seth that replaced cane or replace table and now through the wine of Cain and his murderous City in week we've heard some about them here's something else that happened in that day the sons of God which is a standard reference in the Hebrew Bible for Spiritual Beings Spiritual Beings saw that the human Daughters of men were in Hebrew good and they took for themselves wives whomever they chose they saw that something was good and they took it this whole sentence is mapped in Hebrew right onto Genesis 3 Verse 6 the woman saw that the tree was good the light to the eyes desirable for wisdom and she took from it so this is going to be a key design pattern in the Hebrew Bible to signify this is a fall moment this is somebody feeling they had great opportunity and they're failing so the Spiritual Beings are having their their fall moment
 Simmons in the garden being tempted by spiritual Liang and now you have Spiritual Beings being tempted by human women do you see the inversion of Genesis 3 here woman and the snake that you have spiritual being and women so here's the crazy thing that happens is a Genesis 6 verse 3 rabbit hole step around the rabbit hole here God says that from this moment forward 120 years and whether he's talking about the lifetime of humans or the amount of years starting the countdown to the flood two different options there I think the second one is more compelling the point of the narrator's what he really wants to tell us you know there were giants in the land in those days and you know also out of these marriages between the sons of God and the human daughters came to give Loraine Mighty Warriors of old do we just read something about a mighty warrior of old
 oh yeah it's one of them who built the city of Babylon a nimrod he was a Gabor he's a mighty warrior when he's violent Warrior guys he's like Cain he's like Lemak he's like those mutant offspring of the sons of God and women and he's the one who builds the next city after Cain this is the second City being built after Cain and then also what does he build none of them did you see if there's a porch somebody wants us to watch the development of human civilization being built on the blood of the innocent violent Warriors who found cities on the blood of the innocent Johnny 11 go to Nineveh that great city which is tied into this Legacy that comes right from the fall in the garden and Kane and so what regularly happens is he
 build the city of blood and out cry goes up to God and God accent us something about it no Genesis 6 so what happens after this moment with the Spiritual Beings we saw that humans are really I'll need to teach you a Hebrew word here you learn it in like the first week of Hebrew the word evil or bad or is in Hebrew in English the word evil has a philosophical layer to it of like natural evil inherent evil moral evil and rock and refer to the Rock can also refer to a circumstance or situation that hurts people and it's to is raw so another words in Hebrew the word raw is more focused on the outcome of a Ross situation and so usually Ross situations are caused by people who have wrought intentions but sometimes you can also use the word
 I'll just refer to something that happens to you is English well know we had a bad day
 so raw sometimes mean but that means bad depending on context sometimes it means evil to be relevant for the Book of John it okay so the raw of humanity was great on the earth and that every intent of his thoughts was only raw all the time so the Lord was sorry that he made humans on the earth and they teach you this word which is of utmost importance for the Book of Jonah to be sorry some translations have regret you ever regret maybe in the right there and Genesis 6:6 maybe some new translations I regret some of your translation might have to change one's mind so we'll start with that it's the Hebrew word not calm the Lord that he made humans on the earth and he was grieved in his heart so you always said I'm going to blot out Humanity that I've created on the face of the land from Q Beast to human man the animal from the birds of the end to the bird
 the sky is not the fish they're going to be just fine
 for a ham that I even created them except one guy and one overall in the hands except Noah to get it it's the same Hebrew letters with the word play it's a setup we've got some kind of act of violence or fall or evil we have the building of a city we have an outcry of innocent blood and that rises up to God yes then we have a chosen one yeah I was rescued how is he rescued in the story that's going to follow right here through the waters yes rescue through the waters the flood and then check this out is going to be rescued through the waters he's told I look at this Genesis 6:13
 the end of All Flesh has come before me the sentence that must be made over Humanity has come up before me very interesting phrase the end it was the blood of Abel that came up before him and Genesis for now it's the end of humanity a death sentence has come up before me because the Earth is filled with, violence I have to either going to ruin my world I have to clear my world of these violent creatures except for you so make the ark a familiar story so just to register a couple things the rain of God's judgment falls on the earth for forty days and forty nights fast forward Noah gets off the boat and his family were saved this is in Genesis chapter 8 and Noah gets off the boat what's the first thing he does is what kind of they were doing you can build an altar and where is he he's a mountain in the mountain the right to vote lands on a mountain and he built an altar and all
 he all the sudden he just like your starts acting like a priest to priest you like nose clean from unclean animals and then he offers this like offering right out of the Book of Leviticus and you always smells the offering Aroma just like he does in Leviticus and then yeah we had a conversation with him so he said you know what I'm never going to do it again I'm never going to curse the ground on account of humanity you know what I know about humans there are no different from when I just did the flood look at you see that now how many humans are there around and like and the guy just offered in sacrifice and gods like oh no no different this is no this guy is going to be no different so here's what I'm never going to do it again I'm never going to do the thing I just did why did God do the thing that he just did remember the story how it began why did God bring the flood Genesis 6 verse 5 Humanity's only of all the time so
 I was going to come and he sent the flood Genesis 8:20 one God smells the sacrifice and says you know what I know about humans their own leave all of the time so what I'm going to do is never send the flood did you get follow the logic it's a reverse Logic the reason that God brought the flood is now the reason why he's never going to bring the flood and what's the difference in the scenarios Noah offer to sacrifice some very strange Story the thing that is different is God has chosen a chosen one and this chosen one makes an act of intercession in this case a sacrifice and that sacrifice becomes a hinge point in God realizes humans are not going to change so therefore my tack with humans have to change if I destroy humans for their evil guess what no more humans
 you can see that's what's happening here so the very reason but God brought the flood is now the reason why God will never bring the flood and so what on Earth would compel got to do this well it seems like there's a couple things going on all the way back I'm page 1 remember that saying where God said you know who I want to rule this world with forever and ever and ever humans we know that's page 1 name and got school so if he destroys all the humans that's not going to happen so God is honoring his intent on page one to rule the world with humans forever and ever but now we've got we got a problem because the humans that he wants to rule with a really bad and they build cities of blood and the cities of blood just keep escalating and escalating in their violence on and so here's what's going to bring the turn of the tide is a Chosen One rescued through the waters
 who will offer interception and God says I accept the sacrifice and I will no longer give humans what they deserve for the storyline of the Bible so what that leads to is in Genesis chapter 9 in the rainbow in the sky and so on is God makes a covenant promise that he's going to carry his Redemptive purposes forward so right here we've got a story line from Eden to the rise of the City of Violence to a Chosen One rescued from Divine judgment on the city but then that one offers key interception at the climactic moment and God says you know what I'm going to spare and show mercy and move the Covenant Redemption storyline forward to the storyline of the Hebrew Bible this just going to get worked over over and over and over and over and over again so that by the time that you get to the Book of Jonah we can now not just retail it
 we can explore it and creatively invert everything imagine the story where your chosen one is actually worse than the people that he is supposed to intercede for and imagine a story where the people are supposed to intercede for don't actually even repent for very long and what is this rest this thing about going through the waters this is the really foundational here can I think of other people rescued through the waters as Reliance Joshua's generation will go through the waters of the Jordan into the land it's all this is all connected you guys so if we had time will we would do is walk through the story of Abraham let's put let's just walk through the template Abraham's invited into what land a good land of blessing Independence does he encountered a violent city whose outcry Rises up to God
 yeah he does what's the name of that City yep saw them as in Genesis Chapter 18 the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and they're syndics eating leagrave it's like it rises up to God so this chosen one is actually who gets rescued out of the judgment on Sodom is it Abraham Abraham's nephew so then what becomes the one rescued out of the flood of judgment because of why because Abraham gets in God's face here and says listen to let my nephew's there and there's the other righteous people there and you don't kill righteous people right I got. That's right Abraham thanks God's going to be stingy here well what would you do it for fifty at they're not bartering here if they were bartering rights God would like they're trying to meet in the middle God just gives the moon way here
 fifty righteous people in the city yes yes God says 4545 yes 4010 and then it's over and are there even 10 does not even 10 but notice here in the story when God Abraham is interceding on behalf of the city of blood is like Noah he's not offering a sacrifice he's just invited into the counsel of God so that make active intercession okay it was another another iteration can I think of another time when God's people were invited into the good land it's actually kind of Exile down in Egypt there's a famine in the land but where's the good land in Goshen Farrell says come to the good land right so they end up in the good land and then let a few Generations past and then what happens if he comes the city of blood and so will you
 in Exodus chapter 2 well first of all what is ferrous a kill everyone in the waters kill everyone in the waters except one little baby who doesn't get thrown into the waters Yes except here's the thing is that his mom saw that he was good little baby his mom sees that he's good and so she puts him into what is Great American Standard has wicker basket the word basket is the word Ark the word arctiva appears in two stories in the Hebrew Bible story of Noah and right here so Noah put is put into a little mini Arc and he goes through the waters doesn't it and then is precisely is going through the waters that Lance him into where he becomes the downfall of Farrah this so this interesting at the end of Exodus chapter 2 in the course of many days the king of Egypt died and the sons of Israel side because of their bondage
 they cried out and their cry rose up to God this is Abel's blood this is the oppressed of Sodom and Gomorrah do you see how this works here so who's the chosen one rescued through the waters so it smells us but then what is he going to do with all of the people then all the people are going to be rescued through the water and again of relevance for the Book of Jonah is Exodus chapter 14 when Pharaoh chase after them right into the waters what did Israelites say so good they say the word that we spoke to you when we were back in the land of Egypt is it pause it isn't this what we said a long time ago when we were back in the place where we wanted to be it would be better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness just took that line away standby and don't be afraid for today you will see you always salvation Salvation belongs to our way
 and so what does he do he brings a wind and that wind Parts the sea so that in the midst of the sea they passed through on the Dryland so now you've got all of the chosen ones rescued they go to Mount Sinai we could go on I need to find a way to land This Plane but I can't resist this is too good they go to the foot of a mountain and the first 10 rules first 10 terms of their marriage the first two are no other gods no Idols what's the first thing that they do first thing that they do make an idle Exodus 32 the people saw that Moses is up there how long is he up there for 40 days and 40 nights he's up there and I we don't know what happened to them so make us a God who will go before us because I had Moses who knows what happened to that guy so they make this idle
 and then the sound of their revelry Rises up to Moses and God on the mountain and so God says leave me alone that my hate mayburn against these people I'm going to destroy them and make you the great nation oh that's a bad idea says Moses for a couple reasons first of all bad PR with the Egyptians they're going to be like he clearly has a lot of power and then he's going to rescue those people and then destroy them what kind of crazy got his inconsistent with Abraham the promise that you made that you're going to bless the nation's through through this people
 so the Lord knows about the raw that he said that he would do to these people about the raw and who is the one okay so this is so in this story who is the one who's evil causes an outcry dries up to God it's the people who were just rescued and now who is it that standing in the Gap to intercede on their behalf Moses till it's Moses the intercessor and he intercedes and what he reminds God he tells God to change by being the Same by being faithful to his promises to Abraham to check this out the story goes on about Moses intercession inverse 32 chapter 32 he says of the people you guys have committed a great sin I'm going to go up to the Lord and maybe I can work this out perhaps I can make atonement for your sin Moses return to the Lord and settle ass is people's committed a great sin they made a god of gold but now if you will forgive their sin but if not
 kill me he offers himself and sacrifice so we have a prophet who was willing to give his wife on behalf of sinful people because he knows that as the chosen intercessor God will not come if he were to offer himself and What God Says is no that won't be necessary but God does not come and he does decide to maintain his company but these people talk to me hear something happening here this is one story line being retold over and over and over again and this is just mackerel you guys we could go we could go all day in for quite a long time with this I hope you see the story of Jonah here this is God's chosen people meant to be a blessing to the nation's in response to the outcry of the violent city of blood they are rescued through the waters because of somebody is raw stuff in his people and what they're supposed to do is offer interception so that God's covenant blessings can go out to all
 the nation's so this is It's like a it's like the opening Rhythm for The Melody of a song right and it's just the opening 10 seconds and then the rest of the song can work the melody it can repeat it stopped for a bridge come back to it do Little Chorus come back to it so this how the Hebrew Bible works and it's once you get to the Book of Jonah all you need is those first couple lines and you know it's like you know the melody you're supposed to know the melody at least okay that was a lot that was a fire hose including stops reflection so I just think it's just amazing how you know what where the story takes place with Moses and the golden calf notes right after exit 19 where we're God you know it is is making these sort of vows before the people said hey this is this is what I've saved you and that is my purpose for you to be a kingdom of priests and you know obviously with that this ancient Eastern understanding of what the role of the priest was too
 to do everything to be the intercessors between a God or gods and the people and it's like there's this wonderful story and a woman with this with medication might be confused what this is supposed to look like on the mattress gift here's a micro story of Moses doing the very thing for his own people that Israel is supposed to be for all of their brother and sister nation in the world yes you got it blows me away so that forgiveness and repentance can be proclaimed to the nation's right so clearly what it's about I like the piggy back and what you said and ask her can we really change God's mine or has he already changed is mine but it's trying to see if it's in us to try to do that you know the words to be intercessors to plead for someone else that's a great question we will ponder it in Greater that's when we get to Jonas chapter 3
 is that is the question that Jonah chapter 3 is on purpose trying to put in front of us so yes that is the question by the point is by the time we've gotten to Jonah it's not the first time that we bonded that mr. Moses right here puts it front and center in the story but of a Noah sacrifice is the first time that we begin to pain to that mystery why did God change his mind after the flood took a question I'm debating it but his will, but that's the context that the author assumes we already have going for us as we go into the story and if that seems like a lot that you're supposed to already know I know but it seems to me that the cookies are not on the bottom shelf are they this is this takes a lifetime of pondering
