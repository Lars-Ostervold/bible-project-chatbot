everyone is the last episode of the year and I am here with Tim and Carissa and we also have our CEO Steve tell everyone hello and be with you on the podcast first time is everyone's first Outkast that enough time for background Steve's our CEO of actually Steve you have been involved with the Bible project and this in friendship with John and I from the very beginning you've been long for the whole ride and the ride is has been so yeah and you've been the CEO for how long has it been has it been three years will be three years so it's is also coming on
 3 year anniversary year anniversary a lot of growth and change and we want to just sit and think about this year the last 12 months and what we've been able to experience what you all have been apart of and helping resource and pray for and and use and so I wanted Steve here to give us his inside as well as other than the Q and I are episodes most of our content is usually recorded long before the release we release it so this is this a tradition now doing end-of-the-year episode The Journey of this last year that we got to go on with all of you are listeners and supporters and patrons and also to dream about what's ahead for the next year I'll tell you what's going to happen in January
 if you finish the character of God series which comes from Exodus 34 is that right after you and I eat one of those last two right on the different characteristics of the one passage and what God is like 4 months we also did a visual commentary creation Series so the visual commentary we already I think began in 2020 but we finished this creation Series where we did Genesis 1 Psalm 8 Proverbs 8 Psalm 148 what you did Chris and then John chapter 14 like John and now those are all out and it's cuz it's cool Christian series
 yeah we were developing and we we say we we men especially our design team and that was spearheaded by Alan on our team who really developed the visual language for how to create a casual, he got really nerdy about it I'm spending spree loved that series just how it just the doors in the options and how all of life this repeated opportunity yeah that's cool and then we did a six-part theme series on the priesthood of the royal Priests of Eden is the royal priesthood was great about that project was
 me making everything longer and you making it shorter and this is the first time where I thought we could do all that content in one thing video and John was the one who said students 6 videos from 1 to 6 and I was like yes yes I love it that's a medical Syrian feels like like as well sleeper series because as a whole series it's really cool like 30 minutes of contact and I think people are going to realize like what I could do a lot of cool Creek you around this so there it is speaking of curriculum we did so much with classroom as last year we re released two classes that we had up already Jonah infusions and then we recorded and released some of our first new classes in our in our new classroom-style we did a lot on Genesis 16 classes
 on the Genesis grow a lot of those so far this year but we also filmed our first class for the gas Professor so I have the guinea pig as we figure out how to make classroom work production-wise but now he's kind of dialed in what it looks like and feels like we had our first guest professor and then in 2022 we're going to be so mean a lot more guests teachers coming in so, 9 talk to the Book of Exodus so cool so classrooms lot of lot of stuff in the pipeline project for a lot of feedback and just a few weeks ago there was an email that came in that caught my eye and it's from Ross and he says I'm a pastor of a small rural Church in Southern Illinois I've been devouring Bible project
 content specifically classroom and I want to say how incredibly grateful I have offered us this for free before graduating with my VA I made plans for grad school needless to say plans change with my modest salary a new baby the idea of paying for tuition the season pass my wife and I to pull back from that idea then I found a Bible project in classroom the Lord has blessed you all with the vision and education of an Incredible Gift to the church your work here has been consumed in large doses repeatedly by a small church is Pastor in a small town in an obscure part of the country and I'm sure I'm not the only one of my kind I left to serve the church in the body of Christ to take this quality education in give it all away in a provider for free
 the platforms for people to consume but another thing I'm super excited about it but passionate about the Bible project and sharing with them monthly request that they said they could be praying about it and we put something out and we thought maybe fifteen hundred people would respond it's thirteen thousand people signed up to be a part of this Bible project protein thousand city as well as of today there's over 47,000 people that are part of this Bible project pro team and our monthly praying and joining us in this that's a small City that's actually a large city
 speaking of a lot of people being a part of this it's the end of the year and it's a great time just to recognize that it is is this massive crowd of patrons that have come alongside the mission about a project just make it happened and it's been growing every year and we're always Blown Away by your generosity and a really grateful to be able to to do this and be able to essentially I think was cool about the model is that it's like already paid for Content it's not free to make but because it's already paid for we don't charge for it which is really really cool thank you Johnny was some of our guys shared with me a statistic that is pretty significant that this year the average Patron gift made our content available for free
 133 people that's significant because when you think about I think this year I think the number is like forty four thousand total Patriots Shear in terms of folks that had wild interesting correlation between that number and the number of people that are proteins and it's it's the seven-year-old that chanted money he made from his lemonade stand and it's the private-equity guy that says wow this is impacting me and they're not equal gifts but it's equal sacrifice and people saying this is impacting me and I want more of this for myself and a lot more of this for the world again it's it's just the audience is so varied in that there's people that talk about this stuff with their children at preschool kids and then there was another Patron comment that I received earlier this year and this comes in from Evelyn she said Iris
 email early this past January for Bible project I don't know how I got it I'm 94 years old and I just lost my husband not going anywhere because of covid and I am lovely someone knew I needed this Bible project perhaps Jesus our lord and Saviour I am so very happy to have this weekly reading plan in to study and read the Bible thank you all for your dedication and this wonderful project I love that it is it's like we talked about that this is a unified story Jesus but when you see all these Patron, to where they come from a unifying story as well if you have the seven-year-old thank you talk about the guest going out and let me give me exit 233 people that really adds up and we did some work this year to see how many people we think have interact with their content and it's close to
 200 million people write that interact with their content to some degree yes which is amazing get wild how do we count that just show hands I think
 we see how many average daily views we get across to all the different platforms and then we are data analyst for taking a look at that and then all the different places but we get feedback from organizations there's a group called pan do I believe that actually it's Church behind bars or some Ministry like that where they actually have our content on a tablet table to go in to be in prisons were people will they give us feedback in terms of how many times the content is being viewed and then we have a great partner YouVersion that provides feedback videos that doesn't count all the number of times in the feedback we receive from people that say my pastor showed it in church but I would show up as one of you but there may be hundreds or thousands of people that are actually but would you account for it and we use like an algorithm that is it the same way they figure out how much should watch the Superbowl it's like you don't know exactly but they
 have a pretty sophisticated way to figure out pretty closely what it really was around down to God doing this is our seventh year the Bible project and as I'm hearing this and have been hearing some of these representations of that audience has been reached by all this content. All of us who go through this on the on the team in different ways but I just I just I'm so blown away and I've been thinking through the course of our last most recent podcast series on the Paradigm in about how significant the Divine human partnership is to the origins of the Bible to the unifieds his Bible and to the person to appoint the Divine human that is Jesus Messiah and in another way I keep feeling that experience
 project there are lots of great creative Bible teachers in the world there are lots of entrepreneurial tech-savvy people there's lots of artists and you know just our own experience of the project is like why is it that this particular combination of people in place and time we got to make the stuff and then it's affecting so many people like it doesn't add up in my mind and we never set out to reach 200 million people that's just like what's happened and so I just see the spirits fingerprints all over it and all of you know so many of you listening on the podcast you or have been so enthusiastic about this and not just about the project but about taking ownership of it and gauging the Bible in the new way and then you know inviting your friends and family to see things in this new way and experience the content so man I just I'm just
 God's generosity is so overwhelming and my encounter with it I just regularly encounter it in this project and so it's been so formative for me so that's how I'm feeling right now this is when I hear you read page with comments and I think about the amount of people represented their I just don't I don't get it but I got to parently very very creative yeah the look on your face right now it's just kind of shocked I think it's important for me to make sure that we're focused stay focused on our vision in our mission and what better way than to listen to the impact of the tabac but there's a challenge with that and that you can begin to think that there is actually a project off
 the Bible praying to Jesus and Jesus is who changes people's lives there was a comment that came in in March and and deeply moved and I think it's the idea of the privilege to see that transformation and that this just came in from person and Kim and she said this is the first time I'm actually Understanding God's word in the past I was told to stop questioning simply drink the Kool-Aid and then I would hope that things would turn out but I never felt like I belonged there was even wanted by God except for my volunteer time at my money your podcast in your videos of turned everything around I can't tell you how much I've cried and relief with pain and loneliness loneliness leaving me enjoy beginning to Bubble Up thank you so much for giving me a direct unfiltered connection to God's word in a way that I can hear it digest it and begin to live it it's like Jesus is the Living Water
 we're just a channel we're just a group of people together this time to get to be a part of delivering this stuff is so impactful so we never forget you keep reading those so next year we got a lot of content planned and we've already talked about this new Journey Through the Bible that were going to do in the app next year the app releases and we'll be doing the Journey's don't come out every two or three weeks we'll have a few new theme videos podcasting through all of that as a car casting through it we have more classes coming out in classroom and Scooby a Richie year and we move as fast and as hard as you want us to so every year we just see kind of where finances are at with what you're all are are are doing and that's how hard will go and it's been a blast and we have another great year coming so thank you so much for being
 part of this thanks for sitting down with the Steve on my pleasure and we appreciate your leadership here it's a privilege to be able to work with all three of you and and the rest of the team that is really an amazing group of people and if it's a joy to be able to work with all of us.
