tracing the theme of the anointed one a person who gets the oil smeared on them to mark them as a bridge between Heaven and Earth and this isn't just for the benefit of the anointed one the whole point is that they Bridge heaven on Earth on behalf of many and got uses one I'm half of the many it's always so that threw them you can do something for the money now by mere page number King David story is the most thorough portrait of an anointed one in the last episode we looked at narratives about David's life and we looked at prophecies about how a future anointed one will come from his descendants and what we found is that in David story there are two aspects of what it means to be the anointed one is Victorious confronting Goliath driving out evil from the land and driving out the oppressor right kind of a you know but kicking portrait
 annoyed one and then right alongside that are stories of this patient humble waiting upon God anointed one who refuses to take Vengeance into their own hands is going to wait for God to deliver and exalt him over his adversaries and somehow both of those portraits are alongside each other in David story today we turn to the Psalms and we read about David's personal Reflections on being the anointed one and will continue to see these two aspects there as well we're going to see that same back and forth between the Victoria smash your enemy messiah in the song sprawl and also the crying out on my knees suffering persecuted I'm think I'm going to die portraits of the United one David's emotional experience is depicted in the Psalms give us a glimpse of the how did Jesus interpreted his own experience as God's final anointed want that to be the
 appointed means finding Victory through suffering Jesus expected the worst
 for himself and his followers but also expected the best and Resurrection hope and all of that that's going on in his teachings and stories about him is indeed continuity with these themes about the anointed one from the Bible the story of David in the scroll of the Psalms on John Collins and you listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 hello where in the Book of Psalms today is Grohl of Psalm yeah I say here in the land and we're in the theme of The United so you can try saying the steam of a well I mean it started with us talking about the ritual of anointing smearing oil on someone in the Jewish tradition
 marrying or pouring oil on a person's head is a deeply meaningful ancient symbol with a whole story loaded into it it's a symbol of liquid life God's Heavenly life taking the form of liquid is liquid special oils fragrance oils are like dance it only takes a little bit to do a lot a lot of nutrition in there where you at just came in my head so this was from season I was pastoral Ministry I remember one Sunday Gathering we did and we were
 talking about the theme of forgiveness and confession and so we had little like tables at the back of the Gathering Room where somebody wanted to come back and pray to confess something as kind of a first step of that they need to go confess and ask someone else for forgiveness so this is practice right now in the Gathering Focus looks just like you want to say as much or as little as you want but just to get up move your body and say I have something I need to confess them we have people who would love to pray with you and anoint you with oil. There was a little the little finger dab
 the first person I dab I made a little sign of the cross on their forehead though everybody afraid what he was really cool but the first person that came up I was still kind of learning how much oil off and so like I've got way too much in as I did the sign of the cross in the oil and their forehead it was so much it just started dripping down into their eye and then he was supposed to be the meaningful moment at the Idlewild in their eyes that I've accidentally so that's the image that came into my mind when you said it doesn't take much you don't need a lot don't need a lot like the oil just dripping down their face not. Yeah that's why I that's how wonderful it is that your beard oil is the Eden simple in the Bible of just potent packed condensed liquid form of life cuz of the Eden was a garden and its plants
 all had boils and liquids and it smelled perfume and so on and so that boiled becomes a symbol of both the liquid that God poured out in the dry land to create the Garden of Eden and Yahweh spirit that he poured out into the dirt so that could become a human so the anointing oil becomes a symbol of God's Heavenly liquid life poured out on the land or on humans to fill them with his Heavenly life and in some sense all of humanity is Anointed with God's breath is Spirit yeah we have the life of God we have the Breath of God in our nostrils in but then this ritual of taking oil and anointing someone was applied to the priests because in particular the priests wear this class of people who were specifically set apart within Israel in Israel to represent God to Israel who can meet with
 God and God's holy place and then administer God's peace and whatever blessing his life to the people so to be that person to bridge God and human Heaven and Earth the Divine and whatever we got going on here is to be an anointed 11 smeared boil and said that happened to the priests but then mostly as this theme has developed in the Revival it's in particular was attributed to one man named David and David arises in his real story because the people of Israel want a king to lead them and represent them among the nation's so what the priest
 was among Israel and anointed one within Israel now the king is an anointed one among the nation's representing Israel before the nation's so David gets annoyed by Samuel in private he's a young boy he's the youngest of how many kids has seven brothers having Brothers is the anointed one except for this little private crew and then in the meantime he's slank lieth he's like he starts to get some notoriety saw who is the king is threatened by him and then he's on the run for his life David is Steve it is from Saul who wants to kill him so here's the anointed one who is being persecuted and he's out in the wilderness On The Run waiting patiently to become publicly known as the anointed one and Pub
 glancing around as king so we get these two aspects of the portrait of the anointed one one is Victorious we're confronting Goliath driving out evil from the land and driving out the oppressor right kind of a butt-kicking portrait of God's anointed one kicking out snakes Jesus on the White Horse is what I have to go and then right alongside that are stories of this patient humble waiting upon God anointed one who refuses to take Vengeance in their own hands at least among Israel against there is real life brothers and he's going to wait for God to deliver and exalt him over his adversaries and somehow both of those portraits right are alongside each other in David story cuz after David is exalted to become king he once again leads his real in victory over the edge
 Nations that are around them so he doesn't. Kicking back to somebody kick so it's kind of there's two sides to the anointed one one is Victory and the other one is more of the suffering servant and somehow the Victory and the suffering become really closely connected together David story supposed to do a portrait then is continue to be developed as a scroll we looked at which was you've got this King this anointed one I should say it was going to come from the line of David in fact he's like a new David he's a new Branch from the stump of Jesse Williams David's dad and this King will like fill the land with the knowledge of God and all the nations will come and there's going to be a new type of piece that's even just hard to wrap your mind around because it's just like so different than the way we think the world works and I know that the world work so there's this Victory ramped up and then
 the other portrait of the patients suffering is also ramped up and not this King like people actually kind of avoiding that don't like them and and he's very Meek and you just wouldn't notice them and then he's going to suffer yeah what'd you find out and Isaiah is that he's appointed to both become the faithful Covenant faithful Israel on Israel's behalf but also suffer for Israel's failures on their behalf and that is the strange calling of the anointed servant in the scroll of Isaiah got Victory you got suffering and then it starts to feel like you have Victory through suffering so now it's exactly right yes and if all of this astounding strangely like the story of Jesus it's just important a reminder so this is all pretty Christian free Jesus Hebrew Bible
 Jesus yes we do read the Hebrew Bible in light of Jesus but we also read Jesus in light of the Hebrew Bible and the sense that Jesus makes of why you talk the way he does and why he related everything that he was doing to these writings in the story that's the dynamic back and forth that we're looking at here so we're going to do is going to see that same like back and forth between the Victoria smash your enemy Messiah picture in the song sprawl and also the crying out on my knees suffering persecuted I think I'm going to die portrait of the anointed one and the way the storm scroll work it's interesting because it's a collection of 150 Palms
 it's been very intentionally designed as a collection as a collection and little sub collections within sub Collections and at the smallest level of each individual Palm is its own literary work but then groups of Psalms have been knit together through repeated words and little hyperlinks forming little bundles and when you begin to read psalms within their bundles in might have what came before and what came after you start to see little cyclical storylines and they all revolve around the same themes that work in the story of David and it has a scroll so we can talk about the whole Psalm Scroll of course right now it's really I just thought we would just read a handful of Psalms and noticed this kind of back and forth and pay attention to that juxtaposition of Victory and suffering so great place to do that is to start off with the first song that mention
 the Messiah are anointed one and low behold it's on two and then also look at the song right after it which is Psalm 3 and you see some interesting things going on so so
sound too should we just go for it
 John why did the nation's Roar
 and why does the people's meditate on empty matters
 what's the opening question of Saint to question as you pick it up you know I mean weed we just got done with the whole firstborn series and the reason they are that we meditated on was we don't believe in the generosity of God no bleedin abundance of goodness of God that's why we roar
 the nation's Roar let's let the poem the poem will begin to Nuance the answer may be a part of it the kings of the land take their stand in the rulers take counsel together against Yahweh and against his mushya his anointed one saying let us tear apart their bonds let us cast off their cords from us so they feel you know what's going on here are apart their bond is the backstory here so in the framework of the Hebrew Bible use Now read the Torah and you've read the prophets former and latter & Blum scroll starts the third collection is the head Scroll of this third and final section of it's not called the writing's so what you know is that the anointed one
 connected to royal tea or rule over the nation's is connected to that Future Hope for descendant of the line of David but this anointed one all the nations will come and they will be like he has the knowledge of God and there's going to be peace to think about Isaiah chapter 11 the 11 there's other parts of Asia where the Nations stream in and there's peace in a few. Nothing here it's like they're like no we don't want that I want to live under the rule of Yahweh anointed one yeah what are you going to put us in your service right no way snapping off these Bonds in what sense is anyone feeling bonded by Yahweh and now these things are there like we don't want to serve you
 butt butt supposed to be imagining image of kings of the land when is ever the kings of the land been like dominated by Yahweh okay yeah yeah so we're remembering back so 1 is the stories about David there was the. Of his High Point 2nd Samuel chapters 5 through 10 when David establishes Jerusalem as the capital and he begins all these hostile Nations and they're all sibling Rivals Edom in the ammonites in the moabites in the Philistines on the coast in the air men's up North with all these hostile sibling Nations that have been just crushing Israel for centuries and David's the first one who turns the tables versus them so you got those doors on the brain and then the prophets took that memory of the David of the past and projected that hope forward
 and I see the day when y'all way with Elevate the new David over all of the Ninja future moment that is a scroll hadn't really maybe in least in any of passes we read considered we just got the moment where the anointed one comes and everyone's like yes this moment before everyone's like what what are you going to do there are a handful of those moments in Isaiah that it's not the most prominent but here in the Psalms scroll but also I mean unisoms comes after Jeremiah is he killed and 12. There's a lot more a lot more that stuff where the noise had one who's going to bring peace but there's going to be a time where the dance the Lord his rule is going to create conflict today everybody will want to participate in the new thing that Yahweh does through his anointed one especially those who have the most to lose
 the current Kings of the land are invested in the status quo and how the world works and when y'all Way Comes to challenge them through his anointed one they're like nope not down for the first opening of the poem you're right there's a whole backstory there that you always wants to restore his Reign and rule over the land through his chosen one and the nation's don't take kindly to that so that's the nation's and they rebelled against the highway and then you get a quote of their rebellious speech the next three lines of the poem for the next three parts go in the same order but have you always responds so he's going to have a response then he's going to rebell against the rebels and then he's going to give a counter speech to their speech
 so much for the one sitting in the skies he laughs you find this amusing responding in kind it's a measure for measure response all right you going to play hardball then let's play hardball Kings of the earth he will speak to them in his anger and in his hot anger he will terrify them saying as for me I have anointed my king upon Zion my Holy Mountain of the word for anoint here is the verb to pour out to pour out the cord out my king yeah it's not the normal word the Mushy Mushy awkward that's what it is the word pour out liquids which seems to be an implied metaphor of pouring out upon my king. It's a little rabbit hole about that word
 the nation's roaring contrast Yahweh laughing the kings of the earth taking their stand contrasts Yahweh terrifying them in his anger and then their speech saying let's terrible let's Rebelle is matched by Yahweh saying here's my response meet my king for my anointed king and he'll have a thing or two to say or do to that's opening song to
 the middle of the poem then moves to the first person speech of this anointed king he starts talking to you and I had to read her great to hear from that guy so he starts peeking and he says that you know dear reader let me tell you something you always made the decree for me let me tell you about it this is what you always said to me you are my son today I have birthed you the verb to give birth to ask of me and I will give the nation's as your inheritance and the ends of the land as your possession
 you will break them so this is this is the Annoying talking talking to you the reader telling us what you always told him he's relaying a conversation so you said to me you are my son today have you gotten you my son asked if me and I'll give you the Nations as your inheritance the ends of the land of your possession you will break them that is the King's with a rod of iron and like a Potter's vessel you will shatter them that's why I'm so there's a father-son relationship between the king and Calloway and we talked about this last time I guess I still don't fully appreciate it cuz in some sense Humanity in general are the image of God who are all the children of God so in what more significant says can anyone be a Son of God than that well I think
 is the new Adam or the election theme okay we're God chooses one out of the money and makes them a special representative so this is what he always does with all of Israel as a kingdom of priests and then this is what you always does with the family of priests among Israel and now this is what Yahweh does with one royal son among all the nations so we have one metaphor that's used and kind of a level of intensity in a way of like so all of humanity is image of God where all the children of God but then God electing Israel and calling them my son are they might mean that the previous metaphor doesn't stand that all humanity is God's children you've been reusing the metaphor and a new way to talk about it like a more intensity of God identifying with
 what does this is how election works in the Bible and God chooses one I'm half of the money it's always so that threw them he can do something for the money so unique and special son who today I gave birth to for today your identity is as it were recreated and you are designated as my son that is my chosen one who I will uniquely used to bring about my purposes for the many others for them I guess the metaphor Works in my mind if you think about okay we're all God's children but then we've all said like we're gone to the court and said I actually I don't want to be a child of God and I are off and then God's like was okay how about you guys you guys me and my kids because I want to like get everyone back yeah it's interesting you could think of it kind of like take an hourglass
 and then turned it on its side and so the story The Bible begins with all of humanity as the image and children of God
 and then that goes the way that it goes not so well so God knows down and chooses one family the family of Abraham out from the minis family is real and then God narrows it down even more to choose one subfamily
 David and now one figure the seed from the line of David one person but at every step what you always the center that now you're the center of The Hourglass that is tipped on its side but now what we're getting is that through that one you always rule will be extended back out to all of the nation's so through the one God incorporates the menu to become a part of his inheritance and possession again so God's method of repossessing all of the nation's is precisely by his narrowing and if that's the Paradox of election so I guess I don't know how this work okay that's a problem and then in this moment of here at the center we've got the king we're going to go back out to the nation's we can fast forward all the way to the end and find the
 picture of Peace amongst the Nations home to at the very beginning we get a portrait of people going do you're going to be bringing the peace to all the nations like we don't think so what are the kings were the rulers we're not down confrontation around Israel respond when David becomes king and this is how you do Nebuchadnezzar or sennacherib king of Assyria visit the kings of the earth respond that God's going to elevate the king from the puny little State on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean to rule the world it's through this one that God's will will spread all the nations
that's the middle of the Palm that's King now the poet comes back and addresses the kings of the land again the whole Palms a three-part symmetry the begins with the kings in the middle is the sun and it ends with the Kings again so the poet says now King's show some discernment
 you are warned of judges of the land serve Yahweh with fear
 and rejoice with trembling
 so it's kind of like in the prophets the day of the Lord the day of Yahweh is the bad news is good news depends on if you're being rescued or if your kingdom is being dismantled on the day of your way and it all depends on how you relate to Yahweh and we're specifically talking about the people who have built kingdoms that are going to be dismantled so that are response needs to be let's rent a sense of humility and I love the two images Rejoice with trembling just like is a fear yeah cuz this is when the cosmos is D created least a little world that we've built is D created terrifying but also it could be the best news in the world that the kings of the earth don't run the show anymore that could be cause for great rejoicing
 even if you're a king or maybe the last kiss the son lest he become angry and you perish in the way for his anger Burns in an instant owes a good life of all who take refuge in him okay so I mean this portrait is it's kind of a take-charge no-nonsense out of the nations with a rod of iron if you don't serve the sun yeah that guy is business
 Psalm 23 Psalm of David you know when he had to flee from Absalom his son David has an old man David has an old man his kingdom start to slip away yeah yeah and so he fled from Saul in the wilderness than God Vindicated him he had a period of success and then he had a major failure he murdered one of the soldiers took that soldier's wife got her pregnant and that led to the chain of events that led for another Uprising but this time it's one of his own sons and David has to flee Into the Wilderness again and it's all parallel to the fleeing from Saw but now he's playing from his own son
 and so these two Wilderness wanderings of David one from imposed by saw the other imposed by Absalom, bookends around the. Of success in the middle so when we read about the King David from Psalm to you're like yeah King David Guetta yep that's 2nd Samuel chapters 5 through 10 yeah and then next pain but also like he had to run for his life more than once one time from his own son is the van
 oh yeah where my adversaries oh how they've increased many are rising up and saying against me many are saying about my my being my nefesh there is no rescue for him in our ham got done with David has written them off as a stark contrast to the like the last poem which is don't mess like in an instant you're going to be crushed and here it's like they know what you're the one saying actually this is kind of intense like I don't think I'm going to buy has a lot of them and they're out to get me again that is he's not yahweh's anointed one you always not going to say it has not committed to save David
 but you Yahweh are a shield about me
 you are of the so good you are my kavod Hebrew word covered most of our English translations this is burst three of the psalm 23 say you are my glory in English sounds that make sense to you and if you are my glory
 you know that is very familiar with that phrase I think I got overly familiar I don't I don't know what it means I could have Glory or did you say I have glory and it's you it's not very clear in English no vote means honor it's still waiting this word means literally heavy weighting us so it's honor shame with an honor shame society's heaviness or honor glory is referring to the rank they are having society and how people perceive you matter you matter the right now
 all of the public signs the David is a glorious King everyone saying like you don't matter. All the enemies are after him yeah he just fled from the city he's in the wilderness his son is on his throne sending out soldiers to hunt his dad David has no glory right now but not in his point of view and his mind he does still have core but it's not himself or just thrown his City his Royal Court you Yahweh you are my glory the set a rat that's actually a really rather are what makes me madder
 all of my circumstances obviously it isn't how awesome of a king I am because look at where I'm at and what about me you are the thing that defines my worth and my status if not my crown and my Throne you you were the one who lifts up my head that you have looking down and Shane vs standing upright I was crying to Yahweh with my voice and he answered me from his holy mountain
 so David has a mountain that he declared holy for the Tabernacle city of David and now that's said on an LG to God's high and holy mountain which would be his like that Heavenly Temple
 so there's five I laid down and I slept I woke up Yahweh sustains me
 I will not be afraid of ten thousand people who set themselves against me all about
 arise Yahweh rescue me oh my God you strike all my enemies on the cheek you shatter the teeth of the wicked rescue belongs to Yahweh may your blessing be on your people so the wonderful little three-part poem where he has this
 cry for deliverance and people are saying there is no rescue for the sky but then there's the statement of confidence you are my protector you were the one who defines whether I have status or not and I know that when I cry you hear me and so I can lay down and sleep and I can rest even though there's all these soldiers out hunting for me in the wilderness I'll just go get a good night's sleep but then it ends with a petition save me you are the one who strike my enemies on the cheek
 and you shatter the teeth of the wicked and what's interesting is that install them to God said that the anointed one will shatter the kings of the earth and now here's that King saying it's Yahweh who will bring about the shattering of the enemies and rescue belongs to Yahweh the song to have a what's the thing called that the beginning of the poem it does not have a little soup prescriptions prescriptions heading nope nope what's happens to me when I read these back-to-back cuz I think though so I'm too well that's about this future anointed king the capital A and waited King you know of the prophets imagination yeah that's just David wallowing in that moment you realize things are going for for him and it seems like what you're presenting is you're saying both of these come from these moments in King David Psalms
 two at the height of his kingdom and some 3 when he's on the run but then also both of these are taking those portraits and pushing them forward to a future anointed one and I could see that clearly in some too but it's on three I just kind of want to force it back until like this is just David experience by graphical yeah but you're saying this so I'm three just as much is also this hope towards Illinois to the wine that will also be in this kind of experience at Davidson another words this little hyperlink superscription song Stay when we fled from Absalom that's a little editorial note from the compilers of the Tanakh to go back in
 meditate on those moments David's to Wilderness X-Files and that whole story has been shaped from a perspective from centuries later about people reflecting the authors of the story is reflecting on the meaning what it what is the story of David reveal cuz they wasn't the Messiah and they know that God promised the sea would come from the line of David and that that future David story would model or replay the themes in the patterns of the first David story
 and so sometimes that's replaying the victory Parts it's like a song to other times like Isaiah exploring this future David will replay the suffering part of David story so it's more of that the David story and Samuel is a narrative form of projecting into the future what the future David story will be like in the Psalms are doing the same thing that's essentially we're where I think is going to end as you go on Into the Storm scroll I think that becomes more clear will look at a couple examples next but this is definitely how everybody we have any evidence for Jewish readers of the Hebrew Bible in the second temple. Allred
 the story of David and the Psalms this way in the future pointing so the Messiah will both be a Victor and someone who's rescued when others are victorious over him and somehow those to hold together and you said a good earlier that you have the victory portrait and the suffering portrait and they get so juggled back and forth that in your mind you start to merge them together so that the victory somehow comes through the suffering and that's that's what Psalms 22 22 her about should we take a quick dip here to do it
can't read all three of these Psalms but I'm just going to point out a couple things in 20 and 21 so some 20 for the choir director a Psalm of David
 rabbit hole
 May Yahweh answer you in the day of trouble
 May the name of the god of Jacob set you securely on I may he send you help from the sanctuary and support you from Zion may he remember all of your offering and find your burnt offerings acceptable so there's like a there's some we hear us who's talking to you in this pain the poet is talking to somebody saying hey I know that you're in trouble and that you're calling out to God and I'm going to pray for you the God will answer your call from Zion
 may he grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all of your plans and we will sing for Joy over your victory in the name of our God will set up our banners May Yahweh fulfill all of your requests so there's a story going on here but this is like the cheering section out there suffering appealing to God and when you have Victory we will praise God for 6 now I know that Yahweh rescues his anointed one he will answer him from his holy heaven
 with the rescuing strength of his right hand
 you know some people boast in chariots some people posting horses you know we boast in the name of Yahweh Our God people might fall down get down on their knees stumble but we rise up we stand upright Rescue of Yahweh May the king answer us in the day we call so the King has committed to delivering his anointed one that's very clear in this pump but that rescue and victory which will bring praise for those who watch it and see it happen is going to be tested it's going to be preceded by a time of hardship defeat
 of waiting for God to fulfill his promises and it seems like it might not happen but just hang on and keep trying out the oven that's the image here and it's at some group comforting the anointed one I went to like to high school. All game so why they cheering yeah I mean cheering like yeah Rara I like let's go this is like your support Circle yeah this is like a therapy session is like yeah yeah yeah I mean you almost imagine praying this over someone who's like come to you in there like man life is just going to down Truck Line like I like that I've got this going on at that going on like this is kicking my butt and you're like all right let's pray for you so this anointed king has a support Circle
 watch has praised for watches they pay attention and when the anointed one suffers they are right there you know struggling and waiting but when the anointed one is delivered they set up their banners and have a worship session on the song 2121 the same thing except instead of using the word anointed one it just starts talking about the king and about a day when the King dies out and you always going to meet all of the request in the cries of the king's heart and give him Royal Rule and length of days forever and ever going to give this King eternal life song 21 victory over his enemies and eternal life Long Day's new like yeah so I'm 21
 awesome
 stop 22
 for the choir director upon
 I thought you asked why the name the do of the Dawn the do mean like a deer the deer the dog deer of the Dawn that's his name is David I'm actually going to turn to my translation
 my God my God why have you abandoned me far from my rescue are the words of my cry my God I cry out to you by day but you don't answer
 by night but there is no rest for me that's cool we're kneeling with David in the Wilderness at night or in the previous two songs we are sitting where this is like Psalm 3 moment you know where my enemies are saying of me time so we're in that waiting waiting suffering and noticed the psalmist complains you've abandoned me you're far from me but yet he still calls God my God so the relationship isn't so severed you don't actually relate to God's on a personal basis but it's almost calling. My God highlights the Paradox of why are you here now as for you you were holding
 you dwell among the Praises of Israel and you are father's trusted they trusted and you rescued them they cried out to you and were rescued and then use a trusted and weren't ashamed so this is how the supposed to work out why people cry out to you and you rescue them hardly even human anymore I'm like a worm scorned by others despised by people this is all the language of Isaiah reject its servant of Isaiah everybody who sees me mocks me abusing me with their mouth shaking their heads saying if you trust in Yahweh but you always save him but you always deliver him since he Delights in him Isaiah 42
 apply for link where you always said I Delight in My Chosen servant and pour out my spirit on him while all of this like a business with the crowd called out to Jesus like save yourself yes the gospel authors well first of all Jesus is what he says he quotes the opening line of this pain which isn't before he died God my God why have you forsaken me and if you just take that line out of context it could mean one thing as with Jesus it's always triggering the whole context for the whole palm and then import here and so Jesus yeah Christ the first line and the gospel authors
 in there narrating the events of the crucifixion are borrowing whole phrases from the Storm at different points and that's exactly right at 10 but you are the one who brought me forth from the womb
 you made me secure on my mother's breast upon you I was cast from the womb and from the womb of my mother you have been my God
 so don't be far the stress is near and there's no one to help so he's kind of took me turn the ship a little bit in terms of you have described abandonment this all contrast with the past but here I am like I'm a nobody everybody's mocking me and then this last bit about the mother's womb is he he's now appealing and saying we have been closed yeah we have been closed so our ancestors trusted you in the past yeah and you were there for them I've trusted you in the past year and you provide it for me through my mom right you made me secure from the moment I came into this world so why are you far for me now is like highlighting to get the Paradox you so this is a long section that goes on he starts to describe his enemies and they are in the form of bulls
 surround me strong Bulls of Bashan and circle me there like a lions tearing and roaring
 they're like dogs or 17 surrounding me a gathering of evildoers and circles made its first time they've described as people they have dug through my hands and my feet this is a little rabbit hole here it's the word big is that like a it's a figure of speech of some sort it seems to be so it gets translated pierced in our English translation of I pierce my hands and my feet depending there's also important manuscript variants in the history of the Hebrew text of this verse and that's a fascinating rabbit hole but one way or another these animal like enemies who have attacked the other doing damage they're doing damage they divide up my clothes they cast lots for my garments that's picked up by the gospel artist okay and that this key but as for you y'all don't be far again don't be far away
 You're My Strength hasten to my help deliver my life from the sword from the power of the dogs rescue me from the mouth of the Lion
 you have answered me
 from the horns of the wild ox
 so now he's got dogs Lions Bulls Hawks and of wild dogs with huge horns that wants to like or you but notice and that's as the raising of the horns that's a that's a sign of Victory that's right so he's he's liking this victory that he suddenly experiences of the very end of the poem as it is a moment Ray says it brings closure to a moment where he says of all the way the beginning I cry out to you but you don't answer. Answer and then he says you do answer the rest of the poem of there's a lot more it's a lot more and we don't have time to read it you always say that and then we read it yeah that's what you said is all these poems it was right at all so far
 so dear listen to the podcast vs23 231 you should go read it for yourself to pick this suffering
 figure as going into the temple and praising God's name for his deliverance and throwing a huge feast and the takeaway from this lesson of this cries to God and then rescue is that even those who go down to the dust who cannot keep themselves alive even they will get to eat and worship and bow down to Yahweh Ben Yahweh and becomes king over all the nations somehow the way that
 yahweh's kingdom comes over the nation's through his anointed one
 is not just through victory by itself it's not just through suffering by itself but it's through patient suffering and a waiting that takes you right into death but then on the other side through death and dust there's Vindication exaltation and God's kingdom provides A Feast for all the nations even for those who are down in the dust which is an image of the great Victory through suffering exactly so it's exactly the same ideas that Isaiah scroll was exploring and that the David story was exploring as well so to be anointed is this mixed bag of are you almost done welcome I'm calling
 cuz it seems to Mark out people for exaltation that only comes after a lot of hardship it doesn't make sense of a lot of Paul's mentality and his letters and of course mentality of Jesus you so it's really hard to process how upside down this literature is the view of the world created here till so upside down cuz normally you would tell stories of great Kings and great men of the past you know just by recounting their Victory Center conquest and the Hebrew Bible is just really obsessed with talking about how flawed human beings are and how
 yahweh's salvation and rescue for the Human family through this family of Israel always happens through these figures who get marked out for great suffering and somehow through that suffering at least isn't indication for themselves and others in this is all what is packed into that little phrase the anointed anointed one of y'all all right so we've got this do a portrait of the anointed one Victory you can read Psalm 2 and he needs to be like yeah that take charge King yeah who's going to just handle it yep shatter the bad guys take control but so I'm three you've got this picture of a king who is like no my enemies are surrounding me and I need help and then we just read in Psalm 23 that we were at some time we looked at song 20 21 and 22
 yeah that is ramped-up love this person crying out to God feeling abandoned yeah but then this hope of even those who go to the dust will be kept alive and that there will be this great Victory but it will include suffering so we just were reflecting on the portrait of the person who can Bridge heaven in Earth on behalf of the many
 anointed one and how it's this real mix of suffering and Victory
 and it's all over Isaiah and Psalms which are all based on the story of David all based on the story of David who is the kind of most poignant anointed one figure so at least one more turned go to Jesus and what war we started this conversation is saying Jesus is called the Christ and the Christ is the Greek way of saying she actually has an English way of saying the Greek on Jesus identifies with the Psalms and prophecies and he sees his whole life through that lens so that's what we'll explore in the next part of our conversation
 expected the worst
 for himself and his followers but also expected the best and Resurrection hope and all of that that's going on in his teachings and stories about him is in deep continuity with these themes about the anointed one from the Bible and so we'll look at the story and words of Jesus next thank you for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to wrap up our series on the anointed looking at the life of Jesus Christ as a verb that means to be here for awhile upon why is Jesus called Christ if he never had an official oil anointing ceremony in Jerusalem right cuz there was one for the high priest and an ancient Israel there was a ceremony for King's Royal so how can you call this guy messiah in the nice one if you never had that ceremony
