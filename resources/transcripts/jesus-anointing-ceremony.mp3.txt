days our final episode exploring a theme called the anointed so far we've done a survey of the Hebrew Bible talking about how prophets priests and Kings I'll have wheels on them a ritual symbolize that their lives are a bridge between Heaven and Earth today we look at the theme of the anointed in the New Testament focusing on you got that the life of Jesus Christ that is Jesus the anointed one crisis a verb that means to be here for awhile upon why is Jesus called Christ is he never had an official Royal anointing ceremony in Jerusalem cuz there was one for the high priest that's how you became the anointed one pan in ancient Israel there was the ceremony for King's office in a while so how can you call the sky Messiah and anointed one if you never had that ceremony the gospel writers treat the baptism of Jesus like an anointing ceremony or God pours out but not oil
 but his Spirit the claim of this narrative is none of the oil ceremony is a symbol of the original human image of God anointing of Eatin where God provides water on the dry land to grow a garden and then pours out his Spirit on a particular lump of the dry ground that has been formed into the shape of the human but is not yet alive until it is Kristen with the spirit of God that Jesus experiences here after his resurrection his disciples then and every disciple since receives God's spirit as well making all the Disciples of Jesus anointed one you could turn to accept Pentecost which would be the equivalent like a public anointing of many of its significant is that the sufferings of Christ becomes a model for the sufferings of questions because to be the anointed one is to be one outside of Eden who
 Dewar's test of our trust and lesion on behalf of others to make sure your life terrible really try to make sure it's not because of like bad choices that you met cuz I nobody will look at you and be able to tell your suffering a part but there's something that marks the suffering of the righteous that becomes a witness to suffix of Christ's sake and I finished the theme of the anointed looking at the life of Jesus and John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hello we're talking about the anointed the plane this is going to be the last episode in theory
 yeah famous last words were optimistic that we will finish the theme of the anointed today and we talked about Jesus were talking about Jesus as the Christ that word means and she talked it means to have oil poured on you yeah to anoint and so we've got all these word Christ the Messiah anointed it all in the same thing using somebody who in ancient Israelite culture had oil poured on their head the oil that kind of the oiled one yeah the oiled I was just working to Isaiah for a project and there's a line and Isaiah 22 verses the phrase talking about boiling a shield like to make it shiny is that on a wall and it's the verb Masha get mushy off with Messiah smear with oil make a shiny yeah that's completely lost with our word Christ yes
 we didn't Christ anything it's not a verb that sleep or something but you Christen is that part of it
 what is that been hiding in plain sight this whole time
 Christen verb to give a baby a Christian name at baptism is assigned to Drive Mission into the Christian church
 or more generally to dedicate something with the ceremony often involving liquid so yeah good job John I'm going to etymology this
 yeah Old English Christian to make Christian
 okay well interesting to baptized into the Christian Church interesting but was that name is its associated with a water water baptism okay well there you go Christ is a verb apparently in Boulder English yes if you can cry but the price is a verb that means to be a poor Oil coupon
 and we've been surveying the symbolism and meaning of what that oil is and its roots all the way back in the Garden of Eden narrative where God provides water on the dry land to grow a garden and then pours out his Spirit on a particular lump of the dry ground that has been formed in the shape of a human but is not yet alive until it is
 christened the spirit of God and so we've been tracing how liquid and God's spirit are joined in parallelism in the narrative design of the Eden story that God's Gift of Life to the land comes in the form of water and in the form of spirit in the garden so what the anointing oil is doing in these later stories is the symbol of both its a liquid life simple which is why in the stories of the Kings from the line of David when they get anointed with oil later in the biblical story it happens along with the same moment of God Spirit rushing upon them to empower them to be Kings and bring about life and Justice and so on so water spirit oil and the life of Heaven being poured onto something on Earth these are all of the images connected with
 anointing oil in the story The Bible and God anointed all of humanity as image but then there's this particular anointing that happens to the priest in the Kings which is designating a class of humans or a human high priest or the king and saying you in a more special way now are going to represent Humanity to God and be a bridge bridge between Heaven and Earth and this culminates in it was the high priest it was done for Aaron but the character who gets the most page time as an anointed one is King David and really the beam of the the meshiaak oiled won the anointed really centralizes around this idea of of a king from the line of David who will rule and then we looked at was kind of the next move which is they know which ones in a roaster suffering
 yeah we looked a lot at this passages of this Paradox between Victory and suffering that's right so the story of David in the Samuel scroll in the Hebrew Bible has been designed
 in tandem with the portrait of a coming new David that you find in the Isaiah scroll and in the Psalms scroll they've all been designed and coordinate with each other so that the story of David being anointed privately and then Patiently Waiting for God to exalt him as king through a long period of suffering and persecution by a guy who thinks he's the real anointed one then Aunt I know it said that is King Saul and all that stuff during and patience is really key to what David anointing is apparently heaven when it arrives on Earth is very patient and slow and doesn't look like it's going to turn into anything that involves a lot of pain and so that's exactly the portrait of the new David coming to and anointed one by water and spirit in the Isaiah scroll suffering servant and then in the storm scroll to figure of the Messiah or the
 David of the past is the image of a coming messiah in the future so we looked at suffering David Psalms we cried out to God and suffers as God's anointed one but then his exhausted in the end to bring the kingdom of God Over All Nations and bring life out of death to all that's did just that he Revival so it just kind of seems we've been tracing and conversations anointing is about a liquid symbol of the spirit of Life Of Heaven being poured out on the earth to appoint a representative but then that representative brings the life of Heaven to Earth through patient suffering
 awaiting God to exalt them so they can truly reunite Heaven and Earth until all of that you feel like you're already summarizing the New Testament really it's that all that's there in the Hebrew Bible and when Jesus comes onto the scene he talks about himself in precisely and continuity with that storyline in that pattern until the gospel authers talk about the story of Jesus that way to him so I thought we would do in this conversation is just a full the story of Jesus's anointing that we call is baptism in the opening chapter of the Gospel of Mark and then I thought we would just to her some other use of the word Christ or Christian the origin of the word Christian in the New Testament and find the same connection of themes about suffering patients and waiting for God to bring Heaven to Earth and that is part of the calling of the anointed ones so there you go anointing
we're going to look right now at the first 15 verses of the Gospel of Mark and that's the first, opening literary unit let's just go for it see what happens
 the beginning of the good news about Jesus Messiah Son of God opening line and then Greek this is Christos yet that's all English translations will likely say Jesus Christ Cristos is the Greek translation of the word meshiaak correct you got it so the beginning of the good news about Jesus the ones as well the Son of God just as it is written you know like it's written in Isaiah the prophet and then Marco's on to provide us the quotation of Exodus 23 Malachi chapter 4 and then from Isaiah chapter 40 new blend them all together hello in this is awesome rabbit hole that we are not going to walk around it the Blended quote reads
 look I send my messenger before my face who will prepare your way a voice crying out in the wilderness Make Ready the way of the Lord make straight his paths Mark is presenting this
 as a little snapshot of a voice from a Divine figure to a Divine figure a me I am going to send my messenger who will prepare your way and then in the next part of the quote you're told it's preparing the way of the Lord so God is speaking to somebody called the Lord
 about how God's going to send a messenger to prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness look I send my messenger so I took it as you always talking I'm going to send my messenger and how to repair your way so now that's plugging directly to the messenger I'll send my messenger before your way just be you and me talking Tim I'm going to send my messenger before you John bow to the messengers not you it's somebody else who's the you in this context exactly it's God talking to God so if you look up contacts that you always speaking
 but then if you look at the plain meaning of these quotes it's Yahweh will send my messenger there's some messenger before my face who will prepare your way so you always speaking to some but it's called you and then in the next line to make ready the way of the Lord just a Greek word curious which translates the Divine name Yahweh Yahweh speaking to Yahweh I don't know if I did do I need to see it Mark is trying to give us a category about a Divine multiplicity within the one God that is Yahweh yeah I get that but I don't see it well there's a me if there's a you and both of them are too and the me is sending to you a message okay so the me and that you are both y'all way The Messengers not the messenger is just a messenger okay
 there's going to be a voice in the wilderness okay so apparently this little Blended quote it's like a riddle OK and this narrative you're about to read going to prepare you both understand the riddle and the riddle will help you understand the narrative you're about to read and the narrative is when Jesus baptized and it's when a guy named John shows up in the wilderness yelling but the message is a messenger in the wilderness crying out and what's he saying well he's Duncan everybody in the Jordan River announcing a baptism of repentance for forgiving failures and there came out to him all the dude and Countryside and all the jerusalemites and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River confessing their failures so what does it mean to prepare the way apparently it means Israel recognizing that it has violated the Covenant with y'all he going back many centuries
 and if we confess and repent acknowledge we have not been faithful to our agreement with Yahweh then that is making us ready for some new. They always going to make an arm it's what the quote is so a little bit about John's clothing
 camel-hair leather belts I've got questions but we can look it up on E he's he's dressed exactly like Elijah is exactly like her address or any eats off the wild of the land you know like Adam just beat him anyway oh and then you get his announcement there is coming someone stronger than me coming behind me of whom I am not worthy while stooping down to loosen the straps of his sandals you know I've been baptizing y'all in water but he's going to baptize you in the Holy Spirit water and spirit the baptism is about this immersion water which has lots of symbolic meanings
 purification but also Passage through danger and death like in the waters of the Reed sea in the Exodus or the flood I can do an arc is Right passing through the waters of the Jordan on the way to the promised land yeah it's fascinating that nowhere in the Hebrew Bible are you told to do a ritual like this it makes sense with all those themes to see purification rituals yeah is there something that happened in the second temple time that like made this an actual in Leviticus in the Torah there are regulations about how the priests are to wash themselves before entering the holy space and then if somebody's been ritually in pure did did they yeah they bathe themselves on the seventh day as the culmination of their purification so those
 instances of specific washing to transfer somebody from the realm of death or, that's in the realm of life became widespread practice. There's pools of baptism water all over Jerusalem to help people do a washing before they go up to the temple but then also in other places in towns were maybe before the beginning of time of prayer before going to synagogue and that kind of thing okay so to go out into the Wilderness to do this is that yeah that's a unique st. John's pulling up here it says it's a whole nation needs to be purified that's the confessing and repenting but also we need to go back to the place where Joshua let us into the land
 and my Creator the land but crossing the Jordan again is another layer of the symbolism but the point is that in relationship to this quote
 John's being portrayed as the voice crying out in the wilderness is preparing the way for Yahweh to show up yeah that's what you always said yeah with John says there's someone coming stronger than me yeah the strong one the Mighty the mighty one strong one so do you think okay the quote set me up to look for a messenger crying in the wilderness check so now I'm looking for the Lord Yaweh to show up having the way prepared for him now and Tuesday next character introduced to force nine it came about in those days you sure Jesus freak mentiras in English Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and he was baptized in the Jordan by John so Jesus identifies himself with this renewed and washed
 Covenant ready Israel and immediately as he rose up from the water he saw the skies being torn open and the spirit coming down as a dove upon him and a voice from the skies you are my son the beloved one in you I Delight
 then immediately the spirit cast him into the Wilderness and he was in the wilderness 40 days being tested by the adversary
 he was with the animals and Messengers served him
 after the handing over of John Jesus went in the Galilee announcing the good news from the opening line
 the good news of God saying the time is filled full the rain or the rule of God has come near repent and Trust in this goodness so kind of explicitly connected to the theme of the noise thing is we talked about Adam the human Adam being formed from the land and then then his anointing being the Water of Life and the spirit of time out in the wilderness out and that's true I don't know whether that's before being put in the garden correct it outside in the world and God provides water that stature it's the ground and that makes the garden possible but it's the parallel pouring out of the spirit
 into that saturated ground that brings life so the analogy being activated here is that Jesus goes out into the Wilderness and becomes part of a new Humanity being formed their through water baptism but then uniquely what happens to Jesus different from everybody else so John anticipated it he said I'm I'm just doing the water thing the strong ones coming and he's going to have Holy Spirit action and so the spirit descends upon him like a bird so that Bird hovering over the water's very creative will hyperlink to Genesis 1 verse 2 where the spirit of God is hovering over those dark Waters
 and then also in Eaton images being drawn here where it's both through water and the pouring out of the spirit that this new Adam is appointed. So it's an anointing symbolizing a new Humanity been formed yeah but not with oil okay so this is where it again we've been working on a video script kind of summarizing all that's what we're trying to say is that the oil is a symbol of the most original anointing which is water and spirit in the garden and so outside the garden in the wilderness of the human
 is parallel to the birthing of the garden the life of the Heavenly Garden here on Earth and the anointing of the human was giving human life give making the human a living Soul so the first atom yes the first human that thing was symbolized later and taking boil talk about this what's a substance make it like just help us appreciate the beauty of that anointing of the water spirit Garden in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs the juice life juice of thick fragrant life juice of garden plant to know better than that Fame and that thing becomes kind of about who's going to be the the special human who's going to bring us back who's going to kind of reclaim this whole failure which is Humanity's failure to not live with God in the garden and Trust his wisdom and so
 that becomes the hope of this anointed one and now we have Jesus coming and he isn't Anointed with oil that symbol that's been used for priests and Kings but he gets his baptism and just like in Genesis to where the spirit comes down to give life to the form human the spirit comes down and then we get this announcement that this is God's son and this was a see that as the proclamation of like the new Humanity the arrival of the new Royal Priestly human image of God it's so one way to put the question is why is Jesus called Christ is he never had an official oil anointing ceremony in Jerusalem is there was one for the high priest that's how you became the anointed one and in ancient Israel there was a ceremony for Kings involving a while so how can you call this guy and Messiah and anointed one that we never had that
 and the claim of this narrative is none of the oil ceremony is a symbol of the original human image of God anointing of Eden that's what Jesus experiences here it's more like it's what he say ain't nothing but the real thing I don't do is bother with this is not the symbol it's the real thing of which soil is a simple sorry that's why I could 90's pop culture reference but those high school for me so one of the thing noticed how the opening of this unit was with a blended quotation from the Old Testament scriptures but three of them but we're all Blended together as if they're one
 and that quote had to Divine figures all right you write me y'all talkin to a you Yahweh who's going to go on a journey somewhere the way of the Lord so also is a voice from the skies is a blended quotation from 3 Old Testament passages and it again is a Divine me speaking to a Divine you accept as my little more explicit you are my son Jesus so whoever saying this is calling somebody my son father addressing my son so the Yahweh speaking to Yahweh
 in the opening Blended quote is now the father speaking to my son
 you are my son comes from Psalm 24 7 which we read which is about the anointed one. The anointed one came from the line of David the beloved one is the phrase that uniquely describes Isaac in relationship to Abraham in Genesis 22 verse of the suffering take your son the one whom you love and offer him up is that I sent you an offering and then nuid light is lifted from the first suffering servant poem in the book of Isaiah Isaiah 42 verse 1 this is my servant the one in whom I Delight
 and said that quotes are adapted to these quotes are all well the first and third one definitely are specifically about the anointed one in the middle one is about a son who it seems like it's going to suffer for the sins of others but God rescued him from death and is there something here to evit story that he was anointed in private this kind of feels a little bit like that to totally outside Jerusalem it's a secret little anointing like it's almost like if you have eyes to see it here it is even if you were there would you have fully appreciated what was going on kind of think ya details cuz it says when he came up out of the water he saw this guy is being open OST so does that mean he's having a vision and that only he hears The Voice
 so what's interesting is that in the Gospel of John is recollection of the story John says I saw the Spirit coming on him and this is the Lamb of God actually John was kind of on a different plane of Consciousness to wasn't well that's right you standing right there so what other people heard you know the story just doesn't actually I thought it would be cool at the next step to read John's John doesn't have the story we read Mark Matthew has a version of it Lucas version of it John doesn't have a narrative let's just cuz it's a cool kind of another refraction and forth.
 so I'm going to begin after the prologue of John which is versus the 118 we made a video about that but the narrative proper accepting verse 19 this is the testimony of John when the judeans Greek where do you dial to means to dance gets translated as the Jews in her Bible and there's a completely wrong but it's not completely right yeah I couldn't save better so I'm going to say that you did the other day and sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem saying who are you John and he confessed and didn't deny but confessed lesson I am not the Christ look at that out the way and will are you Elijah
 and he said that mean to ask someone if they're Elijah cuz there's a cultural story based on Traditions rooted in the Hebrew Bible where God says and Malachi I'm going to send Elijah that is a prophet like Elijah who's going to prepare the people for the coming of Yahweh and during Passover is in there like it that you keep the seat open for Lila yep yep just remember he didn't die he was taken up into heaven like he knocked so he could appear at any moment to ask him what are you Elijah are they literally being like are you Elijah or they are you a type 0 got it most likely are you Elijah like returned to you yet did you beam down from heaven correct as big as the one I guess unless I don't know why are you Santa Claus it's kind of the equivalent oh yeah are you okay
 Not only was JFK to the GIF JFK was actually never died and if he lives on today and if that was a widespread official story then that wouldn't be good question to ask are you the Prophet by which they mean the prophet like Moses anticipated in the final paragraph converge that character The Profit the most talked about as didn't anyone hear the person that I check this out they asked three questions are you the special expected one from the Torah the prophet Prophet that's the final paragraph of the Torah are you Elijah that's the final paragraph of Malachi profits are you the Messiah opening Scroll of the writings from the song about because they noted one
 if I questioned corresponding to the three parts of the Tanakh then they said to him who are you so we can give an answer to those who sent us and he said he also quotes from the same thing that Mark would become Isaiah 40 I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the Lord just like I said I said so they had been sent from the Pharisees and I asked him why are you Dunkin people in water baptizing if you're not the Messiah or Elijah or the prophet and he said well listen I'm baptizing you in water that's cool but since my parents raised among you stands somebody who you do not recognize
 it's he who comes after me the song of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie response what he said Mark and then the narrator says these things happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan where John was baptizing now the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and he said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world this is the one of whom I spoke when I said after me he's coming A man who has who is before me that is more important than me
 because he existed before me
 I didn't recognize him but so that he might be revealed Israel I came back to icing and water and John testified saying I saw the Spirit descending like a dove out of the skies and resting on him
 I didn't recognize him but the one who sent me to baptized in water said to me the one you see the spirit descending and remaining on that's the one who baptizes in the Holy Spirit I thought I testify this is the Son of God so notice we don't get a baptism story we get a speech from John about the baptism that reflects the same ideas in the baptism story but there's a couple of differences that are important which our teacher know that I'm like class class what do you see what the difference is I'm sorry
 okay let's see well I mean we did point out that John sees the spirit here would talk about that yeah he just highlighted
 yes quotes Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world we get the Divine speech which is you are my son the beloved one and you are a delight and two of those three as members of Blended quote three sources from the Old Testament two of those three are from Genesis and Isaiah which were all about this selected figure out who's going to die or come near death on behalf of others in their stands
 and so what John summary is is the Lamb of God and that's exactly when did Abraham and Isaac story The Lamb is the substitute for Isaac it's a ram the ram but what Isaac ass sorry is where is the Lamb okay so I just saw this resonance here between what John says and the implications of the quote so that's where this phrase come from Lamb of God comes from the 6th or the Lamb of God will it comes from right here when people talk about Jesus as the Lamb of God they're using this phrase right here John chapter one but the hyperlink in the Old Testament from that makes sense of what he saying here is when Isaac asks his dad where is the lamp for the offering is it also hyperlink to just the general practice of taking
 unblemished lamb yes and yep for sacrifices yeah do that can be from a sheep I don't have to be a lamp it can be a Ramekin be a cow a half so bad idea of lambs is specific to the Abraham and Isaac story and the selection of the lamb in the Passover to pass out cuz that's a lame specific again this is very subtle but it's all about the apostles right whether or not they assumed everybody will get the hyperlinks kind of irrelevant they don't let the audience is limitations determine how they right but they vary in these hyperlinks all kinds of implications and deep connections and so incidentally the story of Abraham and Isaac in particular lies underneath of the language used in Mark's baptism story and you're in John speech from John so also just for our connection is also water and spirit is really key
 identifying Jesus as the one the one on whom you see the spirit descend he is the one who will baptize saturate in The Holy Spirits of the association of the spirit as liquid life
 that comes on Jesus the anointed one is now a gift that the anointed one Jesus is going to be giving out to others and we saw that at work and I need those two songs in Isaiah that we didn't have a lot of time to talk about it that's the key to actually put it in our conversation right here is that the anointing the Jesus experienced that made him publicly, well actually privately right up forward as the new human is actually something that Jesus is on a mission to share with other people and this brings us full circle to we started this whole conversation around the ritual Christians anointing each other for healing and calling themselves Christians anointed ones where the anointed one was a person to come and Lead so why are these followers of Jesus Calling themselves
 anointed ones and and anointing each other with oil so let's make that move we've looked at two passages in the gospels were their identifying Jesus not as one Anointed with oil but as long as I wanted with the real thing the water and the spirit
 that sets him up to be the one who will suffer never anointing and suffering is key to the portrait of David and then and Isaiah and Psalms and so do you know what this is going to take away the sin he's a lamb is going to die yeah that's that's the role of the Lambs the role of the Lambs to die for the sins of others and so that's the portrait of the invocation of the anointed one and what Jesus is going to do and what the apostles assume is that vocation is not only for Jesus or rather that's a vocation for the people of the anointed one that is Cristiano's anointed ones and this phrase Christian appears two times in the New Testament in the Bible is the Christian book and the word of his two times Bible trivia question
 Bible trivia games out there this is probably one of them where does the word Christian use for the first time in the Bible that has the Ring of a great question totally now there's a rumor that because the school we went to kind of had a Bible trivia kind of thing where life and like somehow someone was crowned like the Bible trivia champion of the year when you when you enter the contest contest even go
 psychic it was like I only had like Chapel you know once a week chapels was this event I think people nominated somebody nominated me and there were like 6 people at a table and you had a buzzer it timed and the announcer with just start reading some sentence out of the Bible and you have to know where was the first person to tap and the name the book chapter and verse excuse me book and chapter by chapter and yes I I want to remember what the winning dollars
 what was the what was the quote you should create some trivia again will you put on the box I created Bible Noma 2003
 more like night is 99 99 99 99 so that so yeah that's right you already Kristen championship by the time I came champion of trivia
 what are the last year's title Acts chapter 11 chapter 11 and actually well
this is about the birthing of a community of Jesus followers 10 the city of Antioch and tuck you is what it's called acts till today and not turkey so this is after the guy named Steven got publicly executed in Jerusalem that happen all the way back in Acts chapter 7 but there is a big scattering of Jesus followers cuz it was you know who picks up attacks 11 verse 19 those who are scattered because of the persecution has occurred in connection with Steven made their way all over to Phoenicia Cyprus and Antioch speaking the word to No One except Jewish people so these are Messianic Jews in Jerusalem and so they go to their networks of synagogues and Jewish communities you know in the cities in the regions around the word being so happy to see him speaking the word no in the book of Acts to speak the word
 is shorthand for to tell the story about the life death and resurrection of Jesus however men of Cypress and siren who came to Antioch and they began speaking to the Greeks also announcing the Lord Jesus and the Hand of the Lord was with them large numbers believed in turn to the Lord and the news about them Reach the ears of the church at Jerusalem so now he's got a couple hundred miles north at church communities full of Israelites and Greeks call down for us so the Jerusalem leaders send-off Barnabas who's an important early Messianic Jewish leader off to Antioch he arrived there he witnessed the grace of God he was stoked
 he began to encourage them all to remain true to the Lord he was a good man you know full of the Holy Spirit many numbers were brought to the Lord
 and then The Smiler commentary and he stopped himself I need some help and there's this guy is Rogue figure who just became a follower of Jesus who used to actually help followers of Jesus get arrested I'm going to go get that guy next door Barnabas left for Tarsus to find saw such a rat story got this new community bursting-at-the-seams yeah Multicultural all these languages to get Greeks and people from Cypress and siren mean Messianic Jews they're all like eating and each other's houses and raising money praying for sick people and they're healed and like what do I need some help to guide this community I'm going to go get this form a Pharisee name saw her at the think about that whole little story so when you found him he brought him to Antioch
 for a whole year they just met the church and taught people how to understand the story of Jesus in light of the scriptures and how to follow him and the disciples were first called Cristiano's in Antioch and hanging out for a year with its Multicultural group of Jesus followers learning how to read the Bible learning how to live in community by the spirit and at some point the term emerged for this group yep that's right you know what I noticed how is Luke draws attention to the fact that these were Messianic Jews who had gone to Antioch and first season they only met with their Jewish brothers and sisters were talking to them about Jesus but then as more people arrived more Messianic Jews arrived some of them started going to hang out in the Greek part of town
 and then those people are stopped on Jesus we have this growing Multicultural movement and then that is what gets identified as Cristiano so here I'll just have a quote here from Ben witherington outstanding New Testament scholar I love his commentary on the book of Acts Acts of the Apostles he just kind of do a little extended, here on the origin of the word she says the term Christian 0-1 not least because it suggests a group distinguishable from the Jews presumably because of the large number of Gentiles in the church involvement and I can we can solve that because before that if someone was wanted to talk about with people like a group of people who fall in Jesus name I just called juice they would just call them Jews who are followers of the way or who follow the Nazarene referred to in the first
 pictures of accident but now there's the new social phenomenon happen cuz it's not just Jews its Jews and Greeks so what do you call this group now I like Greeks we mean of Greek citizenship or Greek nationality Greek language primarily all kinds of nationality is cultural background there cuz the Greeks ruled the world at this point so notice also the wording and axes the disciples were first called Christians in action of the words this was at the other people used to refer to them Ben witherington scan on a spell that out he says the analogies in Greek are with the term herodian the term used in Mark to describe people who are part of the basically the court and crew and friendship network of King herod's okay you can call them
 people who are part of the Court crew and friend group of Caesar Augustus could be called in Greek agust d by agust D on Christian people who were identifying with so they were probably pretty regularly at this point talking about Jesus as the Christ, the people are like who you talking about all the the Christ people the people who fall of the Christ a Christian earlier maybe before the church really Grill you could just call them that you dial the juice who confessed crystals for it but not all of them too but do you know they meet in the synagogues and hang the suffering outside or the most distinguishing factor is that they're they're Jewish yep that's right that's why I had a few more specific they're Jewish people who are following this juice later that was around not too long ago
 yeah so what's significant here is Cristiano is the origin of the word Christian is that it doesn't come from how followers of Jesus described themselves as it comes from how other people viewed them as a social group distinct from other social groups, namely a multicultural House network based movement that Christian is so the term occurs in only two other places in the New Testament acts once in Peter saw three times to take an earlier in both play it's a term found on the lips of others speaking about Christians
 the others interested in early Christians describe themselves they spoke of themselves as disciples Believers holy ones Saints brothers or sisters followers of the way where Nazareth it doesn't appear that Christians use the term Cristiano of themselves before the second century and it's a guy named Ignatius of Antioch Church leader in the mid 100's who uses the term frequently to describe himself so something happened in a hundred years where the term stuck and what kind of like somebody calls you a name and then eventually you hear it enough and then you to start using it yourself. That's at work it's an interesting. I mean that's what we're about an hour earlier the ending Cristiano
 cuz I had other Saturday on August Dion I suggest that the basis of identification wasn't ethnicity it was your what was perceived as your social adherence or your religious loyalties it was a social group NADA NADA ethnic group and that seems to be the origin of the term and what made it stink from you die away or is Riley tie Israelite or Jewish so that's just a little bit just a regular session on the origin of the word Christian cuz it's a main word in our world today still
 well I mean that doesn't close the loop for me because we're trying to get to is why did these people actually think of themselves as anointed ones like putting oil on each other and like there was a it seemed like there was this set of Jesus is the anointed one but he started a new Humanity that now we're apart of and we actually are I mean all the time about being part of his body and there's this like the sense of identification that goes pretty deep yet like what happened there so I think two there we need to go back to John and maybe sit down here before act so we had that opening scene of Jesus go Saint Mark and John of Jesus being baptized the spirit coming on him and that was his anointing so to speak so at the conclusion of Matthew Luke and John there are narratives about Jesus commissioning his disciples
 out into the world in different ways and John's commissioning is a direct recall back to the description of Jesus baptism and so it's in John chapter 20 and it's after Jesus has appeared to the woman in the garden she says Are You The Gardener and it's Mary so there's that scene that just happened so he's appeared to Mary and John 20:19 it was evening on that day the first day of the seventh of the Sabbath
 and the doors were shut because the disciples for fear of the Jews they're scared and all of a sudden Jesus was their standing in their meds saying shut them when you said this he showed them his hands and his side
 nail marks in the big gash in the side and the disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord and he said to them again Shalem Shalem Us in peace to you are you wasn't speaking Hebrew Jesus Book just as the father sent me and when what was the moment of public or private private calling of the sun into his journey bins are just as the father sent me I also send you
 and when he said this he breathed on them and that word breeze is hyper linking back to the moment that God breathed Spirit of life into the dirt same work dresses to yep so just as Yahweh Elohim breezed into the dirt to animate it and make them living beings yep to make it Living Image and representative so now the sun making the spirit right that empowered him to be the anointed one and he is sharing that Spirit anointing he breathed on them and said to them receive the holy spirit so this is a great it's just all so it's great cuz it's a short scene and it's Jesus passing on his Spirit anointing to his followers you could also then turn to act this like a private anointing and then you could turn to accept Pentecost you which would be
 like the equipment like a public anointing a relation of many yeah but they're a Pentecost it's mixed also with temple presents Divine Glory symbolism of the fiery pillar of cloud & Fire coming to inhabit the temple except now it's coming to rest over many temples of human Temple so that's the connection even though Jesus doesn't say now you are the Christian way he's sharing with them the the spirit anointing that he received and now it goes on them and this is also connected to do in I don't know if I don't know if this is going to take me to look at it or 71 but in those Isaiah prophecies are some about these Servants of the anointed one and I don't remember a passage it was but
 there was this identification with the anointed one like they actually became like doing in the way to type things yet on behalf of the anointed one yeah that's right that's such an important part of Isaiah this foundational for so much of the New Testament I just keeps coming up I feel like I'm the last year when we talked I only feel like it would just be good to see how that secret works and he is at the remnant thing I've got a point in having appointed Israel this is the argument of Isaiah 40 48 is that already has a servant is this real but Israel is blind and deaf in his proven itself unfaithful to the Covenant and has ended up in Exile and so God raises up by his spirit is Isaiah 40:8 someone who just calls himself me and Isaiah 4816 here I am and you always spirit and then 4949 that individual is called its
 you always says to them you individual anointed by the spirit you are Israel and this person becomes is real in the form of one and then goes into the suffering servant Palms where that anointed one is rejected by his own fellow Israelites
 Passat that he's cursed by God but in reality his suffering is bearing the sins of Israel and therefore of the Nations and then there's a group that looks on the suffering of that one and has a conversion of their imaginations that's like oh my gosh is all Isaiah 53 is a group of people who had their imaginations converted to realize that that one is actually God's anointed one and so they begin calling themselves the servants the seed those who listen to the servant or the remnant and is it Isaiah 60 we're like ours is 61 where it's like the anointed one is like this Priestly figure yeah and then at some point in the poem it's these followers of the Annoying ones are also now these kind of Priestly yeah yeah the spirit of the Lord is on me he's not to me is a piece of good news so that's yep and it's that figure and Isaiah 61 later says he's going to dress is going to take p
 in Israel for morning and poor and hurting and he's going to give them joy and dress them in the same road Priestly robes that he's wearing and make them Oaks of righteousness is going to make them yeah like new trees of Eden in the New Garden sprouting with righteousness and Justice so it's that idea that the one noted one shares his anointing with the others and these are also the Rebuilders of the city we look at that in the City theme of ancient cities or did they have the restoration project here at that place where he Revival bundles all the teams together and so when you take the anointed one out there's all these other things of the servant and the remnant in the seed in the one in the menus aren't they know all together but yeah so one last text to look at this is how we land the plane remember the the phrase Christian appears three times in the New Testament twice an axe Once In The Blood of 1st Peter
 and here all really all the themes come together 4:12 he says beloved ones don't be surprised at some Reading New American Standard the fiery ordeal or the cusp literally the test of fire the best of fire something about a test video does all about that other ends like that image of the testifier Flaming sword or it's the fire that Abraham carries up to Mount Moriah to Sapphire in the test of fire which comes on you for your testing so member testing isn't a trap for the opportunity it's opportunity to make public before God and to yourself the truth about yeah yeah yeah could you build your house on Sand or do you build your house on the rock so don't be surprised at the fact that you're facing a test as if
 some strange thing is happening if your imagination has been shaped by the Hebrew Bible story of Jesus you know we're outside eating it's terrible out here and if we pretend it's not we're treating ourselves and the test will come where it'll Joe what what are you building what are you building what do you really trust and when do you think true life really consist stuff so when your life gets horrible don't it's the test so what he says here to the degree that you share in the sufferings of the Messiah the sufferings of the anointed one so that the little potent little phrase there he assumed some storyline
 we're if you know who's Messias you know that to be the anointed one is to be the suffering one who suffers in the test
 so he says agree that you are now you're if you're annoyed with your suffering is not some unique suffering this is aligning yourself with the Messiah that's right so he says the degree that you share in the sufferings of the anointed one keep on rejoicing because that's a revelation of his glory you will rejoice
 if you are reviled or like publicly shamed for the name of the Messiah in reality you are the best one yet. Did you have a good life to be cursed is actually to be blessed because the spirit of spirit anointing the spirit of Glory of God rests on you make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer or a thief and evil door Troublesome meddler I see there's a way to suffer that's not the suffering of Christ there's a suffering of pain I think the suffering of yeah that's right you filed for murdering his brother so make sure no one suffers for like you know acting like an but then this last line is anyone suffers as a Cristiano's
 he is not to be ashamed but is to honor God by this name so it's significant is that the sufferings of Christ becomes a model for the sufferings of questions questions because to be the anointed one is to be one outside of Eden who indoors test of our trust and lesions on behalf of others so make sure if light your lights terrible just really try to make sure it's not because of like bad choices that you made
 cuz I nobody will look at you and be able to tell your suffering apart you know but there's something that marks the suffering of the righteous that becomes a witness to
 loving Christ
 it was interesting the word Christian is used in this passage the last time the word Christmas used in the New Testament yeah you made a point of saying the other time it was other people saying these guys are casinos here is Peter if you are publicly shamed for the name of Christ which I think is parallel to suffering as a Christian I assume we're still about how other people see you okay that interesting it does all come together the suffering theme that we was kind of right in the center this conversation which was a surprise for me connected to David suffering to this future anointed one suffering to how did use us his way was one of not ruling through just taking power but his rule came through suffering and then Peter here saying
 like don't be surprised that you're going to have hard times it's connecting to answer that same the original anointing of water and spirit went down to the dirt
 current me to the lowest place it was the anointing was of the lowest thing. The high posed to have an above but if we need to season the first anointing of wits the later and I think they're a symbol or of the lowly and the lowly suffer with the trust that they will be empowered and Infuse by the spirit and lifted up into the life of Eden that they the trust so what we tried to do here is take a word Christ in Christian
 that is very common in modern Western culture has many associations and we've tried to relearn what all of the things you should think and feel when you hear the word when you trace idea through the story of the Bible and I agree it's surprising and profound I don't have any hopes of redefining the word the imaginations of our culture something but Mom here like for you to me and our listening audience that we can begin to think about what it means to be an anointed one and a Christian and why do you know the biblical story I think that gives
 leverage for the spirit when we're out like doing our lives to be able to process in some moments where we like is this the moment we're having to come to Earth through me if I call myself and anointed one you know in a difficult conversation or a meeting stranger so I think maybe so thank you thank you listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week or beginning of brand new theme study which were calling the city the ideal for human existence in Pay just want to do the Bible is the garden the opposite of city in Twin Cities get introduced their entirely negative and they remain mostly negative throughout the biblical story so that by the time you reach the last page the fact that God's Heavenly realm that's going to merge with us to be the new creation is depicted as a city I think it's surprising surprises
