chaos dragon is a symbol repeatedly employed by the authors of the Bible to talk about the spiritual evil that corrupts God's good creation the dragon features and all three of the big prophetic Scrolls that is Isaiah Jeremiah and Ezekiel last week we looked at the dragon and Isaiah and this week we turn to Jeremiah and Ezekiel for both Jeremiah Ezekiel the same basic idea that we saw on Isaiah is a play that Yahweh is going to hand his Covenant people over the consequences of their centuries of thankfulness and hand them over to the power of a pain but God will hold Babylon itself accountable for its evils even if it allowed babylon's evil to be an agent of divine judgment if you'll live through the Babylonian captivity and at that point in history the only other Nation powerful enough to rival Babylon with Egypt don't you can imagine that both Babylon in Egypt feature prom
 Nelly and Jeremih and ezekiel's writings and perhaps unsurprisingly at this point the prophet called them Chaos Dragons both their rise to power and their fall from power is just going to bring disorder death and Chaos do the co-authors use Cosmic imagery to describe them for modern readers it feels strange to talk about a nation and such Cosmic terms and it also feels strange to talk about the collapse of the nation as the end of the world so why do biblical authors think this way well they have this view of reality that there are forces at work animating behind the human power structures that are also agents of death and Chaos alongside these humans and I talked about the cash dragon in the Scrolls of Jeremiah and is he killed and John Collins and listen to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
okay Tim John hello hello this is been hard for me for some reason this whole theme of the Dragon but very interesting and we're going to keep plowing forward through some of the ambiguity and discomfort and just kind of keep reading tax and we're going to counter the dragon in the Bible but as we encountered the dragon of the sea serpents it's also associated with other I need to turn words using is chaos creatures and one other very important chaos creature in the Bible is the rebellious host of Heaven bright stars above the rulers above were the sons of Elohim is how they're described in Genesis 61 and is a relationship between the Leviathan and the realm of the chaotic Sea and the rebellious Hills of Heaven is the creature of the sea
 are they just two ways of talking about the same thing or are they complementary ways of talking about a deep nuance and we need a really appreciate it man that's a great question John like what you asking that makes me realize I have seen these two images of the Deviant star rulers above and then the chaos creature in the waters below as Associated impaired as they are in Genesis 1 in the letter a design and therefore just kind of acquainted with each other different ways of thinking about the same thing cuz the darkness is not God's creation it's the opposite of creation to pre-cruise estate and so are the chaos Waters so I had to also emerge those as two ways of thinking about the same thing okay. If nothing this and then when God begins to separate out Realms and
 orders there are creatures on the Land There are creatures in the sea creatures on the land and creatures up in the sky and the creatures in the sky are not bad and the creatures in the sea ER not bad but then as you read on to the story The Bible their deviant stars and their deviant sea creatures and their storylines begin to overlap more and more be described analogous ways we saw that in our last conversation and Isaiah where a rebel King over the nation's who wreaked like unimaginable violence in the ancient world is described as a rebel star
 and then the downfall of all human Empires that wreak havoc in the land is lay in the black been described as God slaying the dragon and swallowing up that and swallowing of death itself okay so it's a true merging I think maybe what's helpful is for me to think of it this way
 and we talked at length about this in the god series when I look up at the stars I don't think of them as creatures I just think of them as hot in the balls but that's a very modern literal way to think about them a more ancient what we might come Mythic way of thinking about them is moloch way symbolic way is a Spiritual Beings and that doesn't mean that Spiritual Beings aren't real because those aren't really Spiritual Beings it's to say that it's a way for us to think about something that is very real but with something symbolic that we can wrap their minds around and didn't see and that the Stars about so you've got the modern conception of Heaven which is you know where in a galaxy and spiral galaxies with plasma balls one of billions of these yeah
 spinning at different scales at unimaginable speeds like a hundred thousand miles an hour around the arms around the Sun yet it's something something real fast if we are just cruising through the empty space in the same way there's a modern way to think of the ocean right which is like I have a glow by you know we had with name dumb we haven't explored all the depths the Ocean than me that's pretty pretty radical but we have a way to understand it but then there's the symbolic a Mythic way to think of the ocean which is it's about chaos and death in the nothingness that wants to come and take over the land yeah the only modern equivalent I can think of is not even empty space beyond the Earth but rather
 the edges of the known universe into which it is expanding and whatever that is whatever that it would be our mental equivalent of what the waters is but what's really about the chaos wires is the nothingness is coming and crashing up yeah yes, threatening us threatening us speaks to our reality that's right of reality of the dangers of death constantly threatening so there is something very real a force an authority a power its Cosmic and these are two different ways to think about it stars above the serpent in the sea they get merged together and then other images are employed
 to get us to think about it to the other be snakes or scorpions Lions play and then eventually is all gets to and the Revelation some like the great red dragon guy with haven't had this paired up with another beast that's something our represents a human Empire or we'll get there so I know what to get bad so I think more and more of his appreciating this is the thing about the chaos creatures we can highlight the serpent yeah but you can't stop there cuz it's not as simple as that. The only one it's you could say the most primary and yeah is it the most primary in other words there aren't nearly as many biblical passages about a rebel star you have Isaiah 13 and Then star imagery is just more subtly related you have the rebel powers of Heaven that appear in Daniel and other two is apocalyptic literature but somehow the dragon imagery
 does really took hold and maybe it just speaks to the fact that it was just a really popular symbolic story ancient world cool image way more widespread and David image again I just referenced in our first conversation for me know maybe I second the work of a scholar medad Richie who's done work on how many visual representations of the dragon-slaying Miss we're around in the ancient world and surveys for yeah totally yeah that's Robert Mueller sprays and it's very likely that people encountered a picture
 on letter seal on decorative wall pictures like many times in the course of their life who was a well-known story whereas it seems like the rebels Star Story was with and maybe that's because to really sit and study the patterns of the Stars requires a lot of leisure time for a few people at the Leisure to it's not as sticky of an image to as like a dragon. That's okay. As a Jeremiah and Ezekiel we talked about Isaiah in the last conversation what I want to do is just look at some Dragon imagery in Jeremiah and Ezekiel
 Jeremiah and Ezekiel were contemporaries they both lived in Jerusalem during its like last days as a city in terms of an independent Kingdom so this is in the late 60s and early 500 both of them lived through the Babylonian Siege and invasion of Jerusalem and they suffered different sites though Ezekiel was taken captive in the first Invasion taken off into Exile in Babylon and 596 and then Ten Years Later
 that line came back into straight-up destroyed the city and I'm Jeremiah Was there through all those invasions and then was actually kidnapped and taken to Egypt by a bunch of Rebel Israelites who didn't want to live under Babylonian occupation so they both have very strong views of Babylon significant was that when Babylon was doing its thing the only Regional player that even if I had the possibility of standing up to Babylon was Egypt in the South and so Egypt and Babylon by Loom large in their poetry in the writings so what I want to look at it actually look at a poem from the end of Jeremiah
 if it takes all of our sea dragon imagery in an interesting Direction and then I want to look at ezekiel's depiction of pharaoh king of Egypt which also develops RC drag imagery in it interesting coming that way
so for both Jeremiah Ezekiel the same basic idea that we saw on Isaiah is a play that Yahweh is going to hand his Covenant people over to the consequences of their centuries of faithfulness and hand them over to the power of Babylon but God will hold Babylon itself accountable for its evils even if it allowed babylon's evil to be a agent of divine judgment on him in the phone so the culmination of Jeremiah after announcing the Babylon is my servant but I'm going to use to bring judgment on the Nations and is real around them the last poem is about the downfall of Babylon itself so Jeremiah 50 and 51 are these really long poems about the downfall of Babylon we don't have time to read them all I'm just going to pick up in chapter 51
 verse 33
 this is what y'all May almighty God of Israel says daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trampled the time of her Harvest will soon come threshing floor trampoline anybody having done it this is where they bring in the weeds yeah you could bring in eat in which case you would probably a stomping on it might work having your Ox step all over up my work better having an AUX grinded in a circular Millstone be like the mouse and that's threatening it if that's thrashing it trampling is what you would do to grapes okay yeah so and it doesn't describe which is happening here if it's a Wii Harvest or the grape harvest the point is is that it's getting thrashed and trampled but why is it called the threshing floor it's the thing being thrashed oh yeah it's going to be a place where thrashing takes place
 what would be the place of the threshing yet there's 34 Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon has devoured us I took him out he threw us into confusion he made us like an empty jar like a dragon he swallowed us he spilled his stomach with our Delicacies and then beauteous out what's the word there for Dragon tiny a stunning and Ivy's just says dragon
 and Ivy says like a serpent he swallowed us a servant so they're serpent meaning Sea Dragon running yeah Bible has the monster New American Standard has monster All of Me Like a Monster swallowed has ingested us and then vomited us out until like you didn't like us or is it like he got all the nutrients and then I don't know how that image works there or is that talking about like capturing them and then sending the next time I will defend your cause I will avenge you speaking to Jeremiah representing the Israelites I will dry up her see I will make her Springs dry select the home
 the Sea Dragon itself will be dried up yeah we're tapping in here to the imagery of Yahweh overcoming the water's splitting them and drying them up to make the Dryland Miss we're going to see God's going to come out to create a desert this is interesting thing about our chaos Realms images interesting study and how those images relate so Babylon will become a heap of ruins a haunt for jackals
 object of horror and score in a place where nobody lives for a funeral Ernest yeah if your people will roar like lions they will growl like a lion cubs okay so the Seas going to be a Wilderness Wilderness the city will become a ruined Heap where do jackals live and no one lives but then there are people there cuz their roaring like lions
 but while they are aroused I'll send a feast and make them drunk so that they shot with laughter and then sleep forever and never wake up okay Feast that makes them drunk and make some all happy and party and then they do the death then they die but yeah that's what gets dried up the city becomes a heap of ruins that feels like now a desert Wasteland jackals out there man I was snowshoeing with my kids up in Mount Hood National Wilderness over the weekend and we were trying to make a little fire and winter gear turns out it's very difficult to sustain a fire in the snow and we're having a snowball fight and then we just hear this sound this unearthly sound it sounded like
 thousands of little girls screaming at each other and a half and then one like for about 10 seconds and then it stopped and we were all just cuz they're too well staring at each other like what what's that we weren't that far from like a ski area and then it happened again a closer and Rome is like are those wolves and then just going to relax coyotes eat other coyotes but it was there is this like a solid 10 seconds where I was like what is happening it was so terrifying that we weren't in the desert if you know but their Wilderness creatures and so it whenever jackals or hyenas are mentioned in the Bible That's creatures of the night or do you probably don't see them if ever but you hear them mess these ghastly screaming creatures of the world
 well yeah that's what it means to become a haunt of jackals objects of horror also Lions desert creatures jackals and lions cuz Lyons are chaos creature and habitats of the night in the wilderness
 yeah then you have this imagery of like a feast in a party but really you're just drinking yourself to death to never wake up so all of a sudden the dragon has become a desert yeah and we have to remember I think you talked about this particular in the song of songs like biblical imagery the point on board at understand that sense but if you're trying to create a complete picture mental picture mental picture yeah I'm going from my Cassie to Wilderness there a jackal died in 08 now they're feasting like yeah yeah and I'm trying to create a narrative that that all works yet and yes the visual Storyteller visual storyline that one thing turns into another just give that up and just think about okay how do all of these ideas how do they Compound on each other more and I like more what is involved with the symbolic meaning of each one and how does meanings overlap
 and all the sudden lions and jackals live in the wilderness which is what the sea dries up and turns into it's the opposite of a garden where you have grapevines to drink wine and be happy instead it's like an anti Garden where you have a party all right but then you sleep in the dust of death and never wake up cuz that's a good reminder to ask about how the meaning of the symbols connect not about how the visual symbols connect otherwise it'll be chaos if you keep going the sea will rise up over Babylon the Roaring raised by his write-up will cover will be desolate a dry and desert land
 this is such a good example in the first sentence of the Bible now the land was wild and waste and darkness covered the surface of the deep Waters so which is it the desert or the other Wilderness is it a physical Waters Jeremiah 15 verse 42 and 43 describes Babylon is getting drowned in a flood and turning into the desert in the same moment like in the same parallel lines I will punish Bell in Babylon Bell is the akkadian version of the Hebrew word bail so it's the Babylonian way of referring to their storm. OK Google, two punish Bell in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed
 play love it I thought Nebuchadnezzar swallow this up no it's actually is a chief deity the god of Babylon swallowed you up so we're emerging the rules about having the rulers below the Nations will no longer stream to him the wall of Babylon will fall you get the idea we could read on but it's just the same imagery of merging rulers above and below merging Wilderness in the sea and the desert creatures and sea monsters the coordinated meditating on you earlier how did these images relate of a rebel star and above and below another way to say that is the monster in the realm of the chaotic CB coming in the monster within us right I see thank you what I meant minute ago is that earlier in this poem it said that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon swallow
 is the dragon but then later in this time. Says I'm going to punish Bell the god of Babylon and make him spew out what he swallowed you like white Who Swallowed the god of Babylon Bell or Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon lyrics I guess what that's what I'm saying is you can ask him question Who Swallowed us up Nebuchadnezzar where the sea serpent yep that's right same question is the same as B&A is the same as c a r is both the dragon and he is depicted identified with the god of Babylon in some way he did make a big statue be bad down to after all so maybe this isn't the focus is on and pathetically cultivating symbolic imagination that can use what feel to us like contradictory
 images to refer to the same reality there's another let's get in that helicopter and fly over to Tel Aviv in Babylon not the modern Tel Aviv mystery on the first Tel Aviv which was a Israelite refugee camp outside of Babylon yep that's left that's where we meet is he kill in chapter one sitting by a irrigation canal at a refugee camp Papillon so is he Keel rights lot of poetry about Babylon. Same people in the same time frame and specifically he really has it out for Egypt cuz we can try to post itself as a rival power to Babylon
 and so into ponds in particular he's going to he's in Babylon but he's all bent out of shape about Egypt should he be more frustrated with Babylon of anti Babylonian Empire system Ezekiel strong in Jeremiah especially near the end but less so in Ezekiel does he kills more bent out of shape about Egypt Jeremiah is too because Egypt was trying to lure Israelites into alliance with them to rebell against Babylon so when I'm going to focus on we've already had a couple times in the series from Ezekiel 29 where is Ezekiel describes Ferrell as the sea monster to read it quickly what I want to read more as the one after that
but that has the zika 29 verse 3 reads that says the Lord look I am against you Pharaoh king of Egypt the great sea monster Italian the one lying down in the midst of his Nile streams are the twist is that the chaos waters are the Nile river which were viewed as a God in the Gyptian religion the River Nile is it's a Divine Source of Life from the gods and hear some people think that is Ezekiel has a mind like crocodiles which is possible and they figured in the Egyptian imagination and a big white cuz they were big monsters creatures but the tiny in that we know from the larger Hebrew Bible is like way more like crocodile on mutant version
 the so-called crocodile he lies down in the midst of the Nile streams and who says to me that is to me God the Nile is mine I made it for myself listen I'm going to put hooks in your jaw bones and make the fish of the Nile stick to your scales as I bring you up from the Nile and I fling you into the desert where the fish of the Nile will stick you in the fish of your Niles dreams on the surface you'll fall you'll not be gathered you won't be assembled into the animals of the field in the birds of the sky is I will give you a stood well just been way that is exactly what David said the glass I will give your body and the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the land so that's 29 he Compares Pharaoh king of Egypt to the sea monster
 Book of Exodus did that back in The Exodus story this is a new Farrell much later on okay but and Ezekiel 32 a few chapters later he takes last self interesting was Aretha first two chapter 32 God says Ezekiel raise a limit over Pharaoh the king of Egypt and say to him with a Fierce and strong lion among the nation's you have compared yourself that's a Yoda way of talking you have compared yourself with a fierce strong lying among the nation's you think you're a lying but what you really are is like a monster that I mean in the seas
 thrashing about in your Rivers making the water muddy with your feet making the rivers turbot stirred up silty
 so what you like what is this a lion versus a dragon really fascinating so what is unclear in the poem to follow is whether this is describing the capture of a lion with a capture of the Sea Dragon so I will spread my net over you I would be really effective way to catch a lion cuz you don't have to go near it since we got to get close to the thing
 in the Assembly of all the peoples and I will bring you up in my now. Like some English Bible has my Dragnet this is like a fishing net fishing net so here let's look at the Sebring right here cuz there are lots of different words for net lease a few different words for net and whether or not it means an actual Fisherman's Net may not totally clear and Ezekiel 26 it's a CNET bacchic it's a CNET but in Ecclesiastes not necessarily seeing that in Proverbs chapter 10 it's a net to catch his birds and then Micah it's a net to catch as people what's the word Taran Taran to the first met in first three is ratchet and then the next net is an indifferent English translations it's not translated Dragnet
 if it's not so again I'm kind of posing this is playing with the images are we catching a lion or be catching a a sea creature so we have a nut catching here depending on your translation it might make you think that it's a fish net but both words can be used to describe catching lots of different kinds of creatures verse for I will leave you on the land and cast you out into the field that is the Wilderness and I will call the birds of Heaven to dwell on you and Status by the beasts of the land with you all lay your flesh on the mountain and still The Valleys with you refuse I guess like after cleaning it smelling the land will drink your blood as far as the mountains The Ravines will be full of you who think about the Cain and Abel story of what Canyon did the able spilling his blood in his blood
 but now here is Yahweh confronting the chaos creature and bringing life to the land with its blood when I extinguish you I will cover the skies and darken Their Stars
 I'll cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not give its light all the lights in the sky is all darken and set Darkness on your land Well that took a turn on yeah I feel pretty lost so okay he's a Egypt is a lion you thought you were lying. You were lying you say you're like a lion but you're just like a sea monster is thrashing about in the rivers
 okay so I'm going to catch you with a net throw you on the ground and this is a common image now of like his body becoming the feast event for the events this is a very common motifs in the dragon-slaying is it away it David said glass to that's what David said yep and then there's imagery of like its body being thrown on the mountain while taking sides being thrown into the valley and it's blood like filling the land which is connecting us the idea of the violence what you did the others spilling their blood in the land through your Jeep and armies storming around doing nothing now what's you've done to others will be done to you so that's a lot then I'll suddenly shift and now we're going to talk about the Stars. So I thought I was talking about some chaos creature that's being destroyed
 that's enough for me to try to wrap my mind around and meditate on and that somehow Egypt is there lie the king of Egypt is this chaos serpent being flayed out onto the land and is a feast but now all the sudden I need something about the stars and what's happening in the sky mini says I will cover you at the extinguishing of your Heavens so now it's the Stars it's the sky it's the Egypt is yeah let's see the capturing of the Sea Dragon is going to meet his Doom Rats on the literal level is anticipating hey you Ferrell you're you're revealing its Babylon and you're trying to get God's covenant people to get on your side no man you're headed for the downfall you think you're like a strong Lion in reality here's what you are you're an agent of
 death and Chaos mail and your like Cain you've been murdering your brothers in the name of whatever deity or cause that you think you need to kill other people for and so I'm going to treat you the way you've been treating others I'm going to catch you in the net toss you into the field and your body like translating the ruins of Egypt will become plunder and benefits of the nation's I'm trying to be here for you this is your translation I will cover you at extinguishing your Heavens let's go to 47 when I extinguish you when I put out you yeah I know you're like a light yeah you're like a like the four shift when I extinguish you I will cover the heavens and darken the Stars so I'm putting you out to rest we just saw it
 that was think of that is like taking your light out and at the same time I'm covering the heavens and darkening Stars which is a cosmic decreation image and son is going to be covered the moon's going to be covered and we talked about this already the lights represent the power and authority of the Heavenly Creatures being able to display God's Rule and God's lights and so for them to go out is its reversal of the creation order they represent God's order of seasons and time to sow biblical poets in the prophet used symbolic decreation imagery to talk about the cosmic significance of what today we would read a newspaper
 headlines of like the downfall of a leader or governor and both their rise to power and their fall from power is just going to bring disorder death and chaos and then the local officers use cosmics imagery to describe that why why do they do that well they have this view of reality that there are forces at work animating Behind These human power structures that are also agents of death and Chaos alongside these humans and that's just how they see the world and so they use this imagery of what we would think of as the end of the world to describe the end of pharaohs world and the downfall of another agents of the Dragon why is darkening the Stars the end of the world
 oh cuz the Stars the sun in the moon are all programmed to run in their courses to separate day from night which is one of the fundamental structures of order in the world that's a difficult to imagine it so the key put the lights out then there's no more lights coming on it's just darkness I will darken over you that's what all the shining lights in the skies I will darken over you will see a darkness in your land we're going back to day one of creation and let there be light is gone there is one in for creation regards light and then setting the lights in the sky okay we're just feeling all that back
 so at one sense it's decreation and another sense we are talking about this alliance between the human evil and the rebellious Heavenly evil right yes that's right and that is it's implicit here in describing these human rulers in the language of these Cosmic cast creatures and overtime in the Hebrew Bible does Cosmic cast creatures will begin to be described in other ways that when we made it in the New Testament will be like in the fusions 2
 Neil said hey you all not Israelites just Greeks and Romans lived in Ephesus you used to be dead in your transgressions and your sins in which you formally walked according to the course of this age
 according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit how early are the prince of the power of the air of the spirit that is working in those who are disobedient and listen we were all formerly living that way a power and a spirit Spirit and power that's the prince of the air
 so that language from Paul is the result of lots of meditation on the meaning of these chaos creature images in Hebrew Bible by Spirits you kind of went out of your way to talk about these are creatures have bodies but they're different for Millie different bodies is what I think of spirit I think of disembodied I know that's a that's a hang up we have okay. Speedy return and whatever we think of spirit is the opposite of him bought it but that's the opposite of how
 most people in ancient world imagine that they imagined Spirit as just a different body different type of body in that body that can more real than our bodies cuz we just have bodies made of dirt they have bodies made up like God stuff Divine stuff like yeah okay we're not there yet but we're another stopping point yeah the Bible is okay it's hard to breed yes it is John it's not easy to read cuz we're wrestling with not just trying to sympathetically think about chaos creatures were in chaos Realms but we're talking about also how the Bible uses apocalyptic simply don't symbolism of the stars going out decreation which isn't merely like the end of the world as we might think of it
 but also is the end of just a king's right yes that's right and it all hurts my brain yeah maybe it's cross-cultural communication is cross cultural Community has my brain yet in a similar way is like trying to read Shakespeare in junior high such a different way of seeing the world than what I'm accustomed to I'm done with you to take a lot of work communication takes a lot of work and that is essentially what we experience and understand the communication of people from a long long time ago yeah but if I'm a disciple of Jesus I believe that what those people communicated is something that God wants his people of all times to hear and so that it's worth the work parently cuz if dragons are there and they want us
 well that is the thing that I think we are comfortable and I think this comes across and I like horror movies oh yes yes like they are our cultural equivalent of telling the dragon slang yeah right and we get it if you watch it and you're just like just horrified but kind of like captivated but then disgusted and and and it's putting you in contact with something Primal Primal and Primal stuff to The Human Experience and a poem about taking a dragon up and playing its body and slinging it and feeling Ravines with blood that's the equivalent of life
 okay but it's all pointing to something as is not an exercise of pure poetry of Pure Imagination yes the Bible wants us to encounter something very real and meditate on and make us wise wisdom so that when we look out and we see individuals communities or nations with a flagrant disregard for human life swallowing up people resulting in this or the creation of communities they want us to see that it's not just stupid humans
 there's something even more Sinister that would drive somebody to think that doing that is good in the name of some bigger cause and they wanted to trust that that force that seems to drive every generation of human family and self ruin power of the air Prince of the power of the air that it's real that it has destructive agency and the stairs are numbered and that's what it means also to live in the biblical story and how bad is your imagination
 and that's a different way of viewing reality than the ancient Israelites neighbors Pat and it's the seedbed of Hope for the night I hope that new creation okay well it stopped here or going to look at one more Jonah Jonah Jonah get swallowed by a whale huge fish okay for the changes genders in the story oh yeah
