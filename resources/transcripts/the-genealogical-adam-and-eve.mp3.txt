text listening to Bible project podcast is a John and on Tim and today we have special episode where we are going to interview a scholar by the name of Joshua's woman is a professor of biomedical engineering at Washington University of Medicine in St Louis the first time interviewing a scientist Bible project podcast and will explain why in a minute but we're really excited to talk with him today about the early narratives about Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden in Johnston
 so Temple we jump into this conversation we had with the really great so I just want to I just want to paint the landscape why we're having this conversation yeah that's right maybe the first and in real practical reason is that Joshua researched and released a book called The genealogical Adam and Eve and it's a contribution to the larger conversation about the ad how you read the stories about Adam and Eve in light of both ancient cultural context and in light of modern scientific findings about the development of the species and evolutionary science and so I found the book so surprising and enormously helpful for thinking about that larger issue in the creation of Science and how you read these texts and that's not an issue we've really ever tackled in-depth here on the podcast away from it on purpose because there's been this conviction
 did that if you if you approach these texts as literature it's not trying to tell us about science is trying to help other things and what you want to do with science is another issue altogether so we don't interview scientist but like you said you decided this is a first for us you told me that it was very unifying the book yeah yeah and it's here later in the conversation he's putting forward a hypothesis he grew up in the Christian tradition that had a traditional reading of the Adam and Eve story is that they were real humans created directly without parents or any proceeding species about six thousand years ago and so he had a journey as he went into the sciences and it's into genetics by the way my tradition as well had that conviction conviction come from and why is it significant think it comes from a face value
 reading of the text I mean it's just right there you just count the numbers and you look the number of people and get out of calculator like I like that correct I mean he's being made out of the Dust do you know and put put in the garden and you do the math and so it is very it's an intuitive get to that conclusion and we're all for all descended from Adam we're all under that lineage yes which is a very important theological idea yeah that's right cuz what they did in the garden affect all of humanity in the storyline of the Bible and so if we think that that's an important idea to hold because that leads us to the the second Adam or what Paula called Paul the Apostle cross the last Adam Jesus Messiah what Jesus did it was connected to the failure of the first the first Adam tradition and as he went into the sciences and into genetics he discovered that there's a big culture War happen
 between these two ways of understanding the origin of the human species but also a debate over these chapters in Genesis and how you how you understand them and so we just kind of Define 11 view you could say we should be the kind of the atom in Earth made directly by God with made from the dust into Eden Sabe 11 View and you can see how you get there from its face value reading the story that's why you can't then there has developed in fits and starts over the last few hundred years as the Origin of Species darwinian evolutionary theory all of that comes growing and so the question is well as we learn from The Sciences about the origin of the human species and the specifically with genetics the humans the human genome shares a huge like the majority of our Gina Maps precisely on to the
 love of the great Apes showing not common ancestry and the that ancestry goes back hundreds of thousands of years here so that the growing narrative about human Origins that still being tweaked and developed in The Sciences but at you know it's the mainstream view in the sciences and so the question is how did these two views go together or maybe they just can't right and you have to pick and choose and then there are going to debate with each other as just completely opposing views about the origins of humanity so it's kind of the state of play in our moment right now and that's that's the situation Joshua was raised in two and he began to get really curious and wanted to figure out if there wasn't a different way forward and so what what we're doing here is we're not trying to make a case for a young Adam and Eve Adam and Eve that is what would be another position PE that it they are just
 the two ends of the spectrum we've already painted and then there's are almost every possible logical position has been developed to buy biblical Scholars the Legends scientist working so one way as well Adam and Eve were purely symbolic characters and so where the history really starts in the Book of Genesis is maybe with it was Abraham something like that and it's so or maybe Adam and Eve or symbolic corporate characters is genetic science points in the direction which the experts say it seems to do that the human population never dipped below a few thousand as it was developing from the great apes how do you square that the Genesis story and so some people say well maybe their corporate or symbolic symbols any positions trying to do is find a way to harmonize to hear is to narrative is what we've what you and I typically done it said let's go back from that lets just read these texts as best we can with historical imagination the way ancient Israelites would have read them and
 let other people debate about that other stuff on Adam and Eve historical not historical all the things in between also we're not taking a position on what you need to believe about what science is saying right now that's not that's not our job but that landscape is may I take I take science seriously and I have to have to take seriously that the Earth is old and human DNA comes from the same pool is great apes and it seems it is really old or some people just say I know I can't trust any of that and so there's probably a thousand positions in between two sets right we're not trying to stake a claim of like to read the Bible you have to believe any of these things but specifically with this conversation is saying if you happen to be someone who trusts in the scientific method
 I did what DNA is telling us about human genetics and you also hold of you of a historic historical Adam and Eve that all humans are descended from five or six thousand years ago can you hold those two things together is there a way that they're compatible because intuitively you would say they're not sure you got to choose one's going to choose one yep yeah and so what Joshua has done as he said actually I know how to know a lot about genetics and it just turns out there's a way through this so he's being a true scientist here he's saying here's a whole set of data actually a set of details in the biblical narrative that tend to be under emphasized in this in this whole debate and there's also a whole set of features in genetics and genealogical science that tend to be under emphasized in this debate and when you put those biblical details
 and he's under a size five facts together you get wow a workable hypothesis of how these two seemingly opposing views can actually work together in a really interesting way and so I said he'll talk about it the way he came up with this hypothesis who is he who has learned it from these test-driven this hypothesis with workshops a Biblical Scholars scientist the illusions of them saying it's a bit surprising like I was surprised and I guess a lot the last thing I say that with practice into the interview was just hypothesis is actually unifying you could hold you could actually be compelled by his hypothesis and hold of you anywhere on the Spectrum on either end of that Spectrum could actually be persuaded by it by his hypothesis was so surprised and just found it so helpful and so unifying I just felt like man Bible project podcast listeners I just
 like y'all would really benefit from hearing from Joshua and hearing about his research and the conclusions that he came to so say yes let's jump into a conversation with Joshua
 alright Joshua swamy. Thank you for joining us on the podcast today to be here yeah man these are both really exciting and complex topics we're going to be addressing today so before we get into the nerdy stuff that's really exciting I would be curious to learn more and I I know our audience would be to just about your background your face journey and how did you end up in the Sciences doing what you're doing but with this desired to create another another part-time job your stuff of researching and writing a book on Adam and Eve and science yes I'm a scientist I work at Washington University in St Louis at the leading science institution I am a medical doctor tube and I really spend most of my time during the day when I'm not doing this really working with a small group of scientists trying to discover really cool things in the world using artificial intelligence in medicine and chemistry and biology that's what I do when the computational biologist that way and why I do it at
 wait for it I mean God made needed to be a scientist and it's weird. But that's the way it is but I mean I got to find myself here but I'm also Christian I followed Jesus said from the song coming and I believe that Jesus bodily rose from the dead and I got to tell you how much I love her science but I see nothing in science of a of the beauty I found that Christ didn't you say you were made for it is this like little tiny Joshua who's like they expecting frogs but nobody had to tell you you just wanted to or like what is what is the scientific Instinct look like to discover that in yourself I didn't know it at a young age that's part of what is so surprising about it and now I wanted to be a medical doctor when I got into pre-med I found out that I mean to be medical doctors for me and became very clear I be bored out of my mind I'm thinking how to go back and I was kind of exploring things you have to do go to medical school start today in a research
 and the promise that you know if biology education at that point is a lot of really squishy stuff things like frogs right but I was much more mathematically inclined. Like the computer program and I was much more interested in going and finding out new things rather than just memorizing a long list of you know names of every little nook and cranny in your bones and so I didn't realize it but it turns out that there's a real need particularly then with the rise of iron for Maddox and you know I graduate in 2000 that's when the human genome was sequenced as I was in my PhD when the chimpanzee genome was sequenced in 2005 that turns out that you really need people who understand biology that why you sit to the further human health but also really good at computer programming in mathematics and I think in that sort of way and all the same things that would have made me really dissatisfied with a long-term career just treating patients turns out to be what actually made me come alive and research
 fuel didn't even exist when I was born there is no way I could have even dreamed to do it so that's why I said I think I'd made me for this really need to hear you had it sounds like a very committed to following Jesus from I guess I'm assuming young age maybe I should make that assumption that at some point so maybe tell us about that but also at some point how to integrate what you believe and follow about Jesus with everything that you're learning at the young adult does he go into the Sciences was born into a family of Indian immigrants so have kind of that that cross-cultural experience kind of embedded there's a second-generation ER and my family was a creationist and that's kind of how I was raised and it just seemed like when you read scripture it just seemed like Avenue really resented it just seemed like you know they were created to know about an. That's that's what we believe that we didn't it wasn't as connected to like the fundamentalism potential you know in the in the American church I was just that's kind of how I think many International believers
 read scripture and another kind of grew up I kind of had not pulled toward science and it was a constant place of insecurity it was an attraction insecurity and fear of not knowing how to make sense of what I was learning about on the Discovery Channel alongside what it seems to be scripture is telling and I just was always growing up in that tension and slowly for really helped honestly was learning more about how different people read Genesis in the church and also in history and I remember there was a key point where I learned about Augustine's literal interpretation of Genesis and he's really fast and it was Genesis wrote several books on it and one of them was on a literal interpretation of Genesis when you looked at his interpretation and I remember coming across this in college actually I realized oh my goodness his interpretation of Genesis is literal but it's nothing like literal interpretation has been I've been told as I look at scripture scripture really did tell me things but it didn't box me into particular point of view as I had been told
 more more realized that the issue wasn't really with a conflict between scripture and science evolutionary science that's not where the conflict was it was really more with in a man's interpretation of scripture which was often in conflict with science but I wasn't down to what another you know Christian thought Genesis said I was really down to what Genesis itself said and that was really freaking tired to go back and I should read it for what it actually said and now that there wasn't nearly as much of a conflict there what's an example of a literal interpretation that Augustine made that is different than a modern literal interpretation well so for example he says that he forgot to take it literally is a day's couldn't have been I'm in the morning and now I can't be interpreted as a literal morning and night because of son didn't exist there is no more for the Sun but he goes on about that I just think that doesn't make any sense I look for when he goes to is looking at how about Carnival Liberty before the fall and he Mesa
 he says that they're just really no way to make sense of what you're going to take it literally you really have to believe there's kind of hurry before the fall that was really important for her to think about Genesis is how the curse comes to Adam about that he says you know the day that you eat of the fruit you'll surely die that's what God says the fact matter though is that Adam doesn't die that day in fact he lives for centuries after that text because I said oh wow there is a certain sense to what he's saying he said well the fact of the matter is that you know God said that and it has you that's why she would happen but what was going on is that Adam had a physical physically live but had a spiritual. And then here's the move that he makes which I thought was really really anything but that's the thing said from God's point of view from God's point of view spiritual death is more literal and tangible Than Physical death
 and so that was the bigger deal we are focused on the physical death but to take this literally means that it's actually the spiritual death and that's more literal and that was like totally backwards from the way how I would understand it but in a lot of ways not to say that we have to come to that conclusion necessarily but there's some really solid theological grounding to that that really brought me much more closely back to seeing not what I've been told scripture tells me and what I've been told scripture rolls out but what is it actually say and is that really a conflict and what is it really teaching me and as I start look more more scripture I just could not find the conflicts that that everyone else has a certain of any one that I had received earlier yeah so one of the things that the story says is that God created these two humans Adam and Eve and you wrote the book genealogical Adam and Eve the spread of Science of universal ancestry it seems like you were very convicted that
 Adam and Eve were actual humans an actual history relatively recently and this book is about figuring out is that compatible with science is that a good summary of how would you summarize your book and then what why a conviction that Adam and Eve are literally humans in the story about Adam and Eve because I think the last Autumn Jesus is far more important than Adam and Eve don't make sense Jesus does so I think that's really important so I really wrote this book really is a service to the church doesn't really disclose very much about what I personally think about these things but I think whatever your point of view about Adam and Eve is that from an objective point of view can look back at church history and what Christians today think with your crush or not I think we can conclude that the majority of Christians through history of really understood Adam need to be relatively recent in the past to Noble created without parents and ancestors of all of us
 turn on the starting point so you can call that the traditional View and maybe they should have supposed to use wrong maybe all these Christians just had it wrong denova that sounds like Aladdin Yeah Yeahs from new right from new okay we're both ideas like so it appears a lot of doctrinal statements of without parents and taking up a different psychological doctrinal statements right right now some Christians don't think that's for sure choirs one or all of these things that's fine but I think we can say that most persons think that and not most people thought that if that's true it's in direct conflict with evolutionary science and I will try to science really teaches that we share common ancestors of the great apes and that our ancestral population was always a large group and it never was until a couple and I heard over and over again if these things are in Conflict but they're really not it turns out that really both things could be true at the same time and that's really what the book is exploring at maybe you end up rejecting the traditional view of Adam and Eve for some other reason maybe you don't trust scripture or maybe you think it tells us something differently that's fine but you can't say it's because Evolutions true that Adam and Eve in that sense
 let us I want to buy one that goes all the way around you can't say that you know evolution is false because of that a new story either there's some people me included that really trust scripture oversee and if you are convinced that scripture really teaches Adam and Eve and not really traditional view that is not in Conflict Evolution so you might still reject Evolution for other reasons but that's not a valid reason to reject evolution
tell me really understand the apparent conflict because I'm not super smart about these things when you say like so an evolutionary theory humans evolve from a population of and that you said that there that there is just a big group of not quite sapiens yet who then through that kind of what genetic line humans evolved out of but you can't like go to to exact people and say that's when Humanity began yeah how does that work pretty good description of what evolution account at the course of Christians we know that it wouldn't be a random that God is involved somehow if that's how God created things he's involved somehow. Right so we're not talking about a theistic Evolution kind of go with me on the story this is a thought experiment so it's okay at the stable if you're here and you think I'm Lucian is totally not that's fine we're just playing science fiction and Magic Nation game right
 play it's a hypothesis you're creating a way to account for certain information and you're convinced that this kind of dichotomy or tension between a literal reason Adam and Eve and then I evolutionary explanation of human Origins you convinced they actually aren't at odds with each other in the way almost everybody thinks they are you how to propose how those two could be true at the same time is that a fair description between idea of death we share a common ancestor with a great apes and Adam and Eve have no parents like those things can't be both share the same time and you read how Jewish and Christian interpreters have looked at it certainly over the last five hundred years from well before Darwin and even going back thousands of years there's been a big question mark about what's going on outside the garden when you read Genesis 2
 one of the things when I start to read Genesis really a lot more closely in high school was when you read it closely you realize that Jesse's to is spending a lot of time working out the borders of the garden and then you read Genesis 3 the way how they do the fall comes with a curse comes to Adam is because he's removed from the garden and they even have to put a person there at the boundary and so clearly there's a boundary there if there's a lot of person is an angel there right with a sword clearly there's a boundary if there is an angel there and so then the question becomes well I mean if you're reading scripture clothes label what's going on outside the garden and I'm not the first person to wonder about that question people wondering about that for for ages then it comes up in different ways there's questions about Cain's wife has questions about the Nephilim there's questions about about the extent of the other rats and you know that is part of the Genesis traditional part of what makes Genesis such a compelling an attractive book is that it doesn't give all the answers is it has is a kunai these the spaces of a spaces of Silence where
 were invited to wonder and did not place of wandering you know we can start that Wonder together about what what if God had created a larger population in a different way outside that Adam and Eve encountered when they left the guard and they're offering starts in a breed and those lines and mixed and that's how how we got here it's because we descend from out of me but we also descend from other parents from the great apes that God still created those people but just created them in a different way so that's the basic idea and Beyond Cain's wife when Caine goes he's worried that people are going to kill him because he was being exiled that's like what what people out they're going to kill him that's one thing we've wrestled with as well thank god endorses is fear by putting a mark on them so yeah that's right I'm worried about I'm going to put a mark on you and then he built the city which means you know the Hebrew word doesn't mean Metropolis but it means a walled enclosure with a bunch of people in the class of questions
 listen to the point where I think a lot of people who told me what scripture says we really start to struggle a lot and they would start to do a lot of back flips to explain it I mean you wouldn't tolerate any advance for any gaps in Genesis one but when it came to Genesis 4 + 5 then there's gaps everywhere there's reordering things and it doesn't make a lot of sense there in particular because you know it doesn't make any sense of Abel Cain and stuff we're not the first three sons of Adam and Eve it doesn't really make sense why their lineages are followed and no one else I mean you would follow the first born son or a first one that actually has an inheritance to the first one dies or gets exiled right and then also Enoch Enoch really seems to be the first son of Cain and then later on it talks about how Adam and Eve had many children but doesn't say that beforehand so you have to do all this reordering that kind of somehow come up with a clever Gap Theory to make sense of an M&M made
 give me nothing scripture doesn't speak with precision and these things so I can so we can definitely rule it out but it does seem like a very inconsistent hermeneutics that they were going to apply of being very rigid in one place but then very very flexible so young adult Joshua is noticing all of this and so what I appreciate about your book is you do you say I'm not like a Bible scholar but anyone can read these texts closely and notice these kinds of glaring things right there and so these it sounds like what I'm hearing you say is this problem at eyes the particular view you were raised with about the early chapters and then as you begin to go into the sciences and further interest you begin to see there's there's actually a way the gaps than those early Genesis narratives and what you're learning about human ancestry there's a possibility here it's actually hard to say or anybody when it comes to anything in the Bible I think we're forging a new A New Path or a new idea here but I think you're kind of done it and I just never
 the way that you are putting pieces together scientifically and then how it fits with these real obvious gaps in the narrative so kind of explain you're pointing out the biblical features that made you noticed that maybe point out a big part of your book is what you call the difference between the genealogical approach to human ancestry vs. a genetic and why is that difference important and why is it led to some dead ends in the debates up to this point I think about science and Adam and Eve in the conflict are the for the coherence if that's what they want to make is they go straight to talk too much Maddox most of us have heard of Y chromosome Adam or why I demand or mitochondrial eve and some people try to associate Adam and Eva. That's all a bunch of people focus will that make sense or doesn't make sense and there's people who have basically made their living or doing one way or another just on the genetics of us the thing about it though is that scripture doesn't really talk about genetics
 pertaining to DNA genetics might appear in in script look ma no jeans for example in reference to Jesus and a couple places I'm out of hell are you guys can track me but whatever their meaning when they talk about the word genetics before hundred fifty or so could not possibly be in reference to DNA anything prior to a hundred years ago where there's a reference to the genetics really can't possibly be two DNA deoxyribonucleic acid sure and so this is a really loud to a real cultural Gap and I do a real deep confusion I think you can say about the conversation or people conflated two very different types of ancestry by DNA and genealogical ancestry which is which is a more ordinary understanding
 for the layperson I don't know if the distinctions going to land so they seem like two different ways to talk about the same time thanks and you have lots of illustrations and it took me actually a number of your illustrations to really sink in so yeah but this is really crucial and it was surprising for me like you say in the subtitle of the butts to help us understand the difference I think it's a really great object lesson honestly about how culture shapes how we see things and then people from other cultures are just not going to see it and I do think growing up an immigrant family did you have parents using words and strangeways compared to all your friends and you try to navigate all that and sometimes I kind of felt that's what was going on here so it looks like about this now you have parents both of them are your genealogical ancestors your mom and your dad you have two of them you got about half of your DNA from each one of them each one of them kind of gives you half of your Dino is it about half it's not exactly 50
 chromosomes of a bigger than the Y chromosome you'll see a mitochondria from your mom your mom and average gives you a little more than your dad and then also there's recombination which is breaking up your genome has been randomly Andrea sorting them so it's it's never perfectly 50% but it's about that amount make sure to the key thing though they're a hundred percent your genealogical ancestor but they're only 50% approximately 50% your genetic ancestor if you pick up any part of your DNA it'll either come from your mom or your dad won't come from both of them and have to go back another generation now you have for ancestors were all your genealogical ancestors they're all connected to buy reproductive physical reproduction this isn't some like weird esoteric spiritual description this is like literally physical reproduction or biological reproduction mall for those people is responsible for using you for being a friend and then you go back another generation it's now eat and so it's about one eighth than 1/16 1/32 in this is a crazy thing that is super Nana to the point I was a biologist of the time when I understood this
 the professor and I talked to other biologists professors and unless you are a train to the population geneticist and how to talk to you most people are just as surprised even if they're biologist it turns out that just in a few hundred three or four hundred years the majority of your ancestors actually gave you a zero DNA zero we'd understand him as a genetic goes I could totally not into Anna finding it just turns out that they really are connected to us going to send you it wouldn't be something north of zero just like but an actual zero amount of only so many pieces of your there's a okay who's 46 chromosomes right in 47 if you count down and I'm wondering if I got the numbers right pieces every single every single time my child is born so each chromosome just gets split into two or three pieces there's maybe around like 120 or 150 pieces every single
 every sometimes this happens and so that's not that many and so a certain point it just becomes more likely than not to just gotten no big chunks of DNA from anyone so therefore no. Shut the heck up interesting so my grandpa on my dad's side found a family tree that traces the Collins name all the way back to a guy you came over to you asking like The Sixteen hundreds from England and he's a call in and actually he was a John Collins it was his name so you're saying is very likely that I might have zero of his DNA depending on how far back and other details it's entirely possible or maybe even most likely that you have none of his DNA but he is my ancestors genealogical ancestors or maybe it said we're talking now we had to be careful about another distinction between written records
 write an actual history what happened so when do you really know if everyone was there wasn't an adoption involve there or there were an infidelity and recorded genealogist we know that they're full of it hurts right but we're really concerned with in this book is the true history of reproduction that gave rise to us that we can't actually see we got probably an imperfect representation of the written records in the language that isn't of DNA like when you read through Genesis I went through and actually listen out all the genealogies are in that there's a whole bunch of them and if you go to the Past like I was going to do this actually more broadly and then I realize wait a minute there's going to be so many genealogies here and I could probably still a full page of just references to genealogy there's a point where this is going to get a bit ridiculous sorry limited address to Genesis and there's still quite a bit there and then you know it also comes up in Luke and in Matthew where you see the genealogies they're clearly for some reason
 for some reason these chains of physical descent or important to the authors in a way that's probably we can understand in some way but it's also probably a little bit foreign yeah especially in our individual stick American culture or we try to think that were entirely are self-made people independent of her parents right I'm an Indian right so I think I come a little bit of a different perspective I mean I'm connected to my parents in an important way and I wouldn't even be in the United States if they hadn't decided to move here I come here so I can hear it something out of their decision but regardless that was important to them and I think that's part of the task of reading scriptures to figure out why that was important why do they care about it and they're not talking about DNA they're just talking about Offspring and parents and parents giving rise to offspring in a way that's how it goes
 I know for me and I want to keep kind of clarifying the difference in why the difference between these two ways of thinking about ancestry or significant for me I had been I don't know ever since College trying to keep Pace with the discussion about this question and so I didn't read heavily in genetics but anytime a Biblical scholar was interfacing with genetic science and writing a synthesis I would try and read or listen, stay tuned to their end so where I had landed from you know what kind of the main Scholars I have been following was a genetic conclusion about the basic population of the ancestors of what we call Homo sapiens never dipped below a certain point based on what the genetic statistics say about the produced The genome that we have today and I started hearing that and so I just thought well that I guess I guess that's it and so what I appreciate about your book was your offering to go to a different perspective and you also
 take issue with what has become a pretty common position not cuz you're angry but you just you actually think there's some flaws in that approach and then reading Genesis in light of of that conclusion so that was significant for me I'm guessing it'll be significant for some of our listeners so maybe I'll put those pieces together Adam and Eve have been wildly overstated independent of what we just discussed me so Bill Crag wailing cry guy says the book is coming out this this fall with the scientific content I really help them with the kind of really navigate that I have to be really helpful reference point for a lot of people in the broader Community but if we're going to say let's just say even though I don't I don't actually think the evidence is there quite a ways and put out a homo sapiens don't arise individual couple I think they really keep point that we can't remember is that no science doesn't actually tell us what human is there's no definition for human and science
 scientists can agree with one another but even if we could agree and say that there's really no reason to think that the scientific definition of human correspond at all to the correct hermeneutical or theological definition of you and I think it's your kind of allow there to be a separation in those terms to say that maybe scientists are using that term in a very different way than our are the theologians then then you realize there's all at once again a lot of other conflicts that really doesn't have to be there and I think allowing for that difference was really missing a lot of these scientific arguments so they all really depend on really you know dopping a very scientific biologically to find a use of a term that's also very usually far more narrow than even most scientists use the term and saying that that's what human is you will have to agree with us about 20 minutes and if that's what human is then all these things happen but from the store thoughts that that's just not what scientist are allowed to do we're not allowed to come to the Illusions and tell them how to define such a
 not allowed to do that and so I think there's a legitimate autonomy that really needs to be respected in this interdisciplinary stain for were able to say to people who are looking at different aspects of reality right and say you know you know we're asking a question what it means to be human if there isn't some simple closed-off answer that I can give you the option of going to be the one definition to rule them all. They agree to anything Siri what's the definition of human that's precise for the purpose that you're using it for in in Theology and I think that there are there are some really good ways to think about that that starts a really make sense but now they're going to be different than the scientific definition of the term Homosapien but you guys are biblical Scholars where in scripture does it say Homo Sapien or are they just doesn't say the terms I mean really on the process that I was really privileged to be invited to a cemetery and I was talking to a couple other Scholars they were biblical Scholars and theologians but I had their head spin
 I say we know we should probably first start by recognizing that Genesis doesn't actually include the word human in it just doesn't and then they'd like to do a double triple thick like what do you mean I said it was like the word for human kind of mankind it's a dog that's not human the fat Homosapien the financier post that's just a. I mean it seems like his talking about Adonai is lineage that gets translated in our moments but that's not a dumb and then I really actually are more expertise than I am right we have imposed our cultural understanding of Trends on to them it's just an apple thing to do but this is a very foreign tax is not speaking in our language very playing about this then it seems like you're saying there could be sapiens around it could be that God then formed out of nothing all right with not with no parents Adam and Eve
 call them the image of God and then you're saying their genealogy which very much could have been her mixed in a recent science makes pretty clear that they did in her mix but that's okay and then they did it with the sapience especially if yeah if it was very recent and Homo sapiens been that genealogy that the Bible is interested when it when it talks about a Dom or Humanity made in the image of God Scripture once again like you don't even have to go to any recent texts that it's not talking about him and just talking about it. I'm talking about the people that are associated with a dime and it would leave me a big? I think the original readers probably had a sense that there are people outside in a way that was probably lost its more of a? I think you know you don't know if there's people outside but scripturally focus is telling that story and you know once again if you go to the Genesis tradition people wonder about that for a long time there's been a long
 for longtime people wondered about the cosmic fall them happen before Adam and Eve cuz this is another key points to a lot of times I was told will this is the story about you wanted the world but if you read this story do you see the serpent actually tempting Adam and Eve first so what actually caused him to fall first it wasn't a decision that caused him to fall and so people look at that and said well maybe there was another fallen angel that it happened beforehand and then kind of God kind of coming in and met ear R Us into this with this perfect Temple of the garden ride and he's kind of creating a sacred or cover dental Humanity there that has a purpose to spread out across the entire Globe to think that this is the whole story I think really undermines a logic of the whole book is its it really seems to be very clearly coming in Maddie arrest in the middle of things and telling us that I think to John's and then I want to tie it back into the kind of father with red so the difference between will you calling a genetic approach to try an
 how biblical Adam and Eve every single human has come from to exact exactly from these two would know everything that's important takeaway at this is another big moment for me for your book and you repeated many times as you're saying the science of genealogical ancestry actually makes it completely possible that a single couple could become the ancestor of everybody on the planet in that amount of time that blew my categories I had to come though I had no concept of what he's kind of two days but of course on the hypothesis that it's these two inter mixing with another population that's outside the garden will talk again later but just got that part that blew my mind that there's a lot of surprising once you get the distinction straight and you're trying to say okay so when I don't care about genetics now and we're going to look at you know do you know how to clean ancestry a really important question becomes is like will you know if we take Miracles off the table for a moment not to think I wasn't
 I want to see what science says happens on its own but a natural at workings of the world how long would it take for Adam and Eve's Sage of six thousand years ago to become ancestors of everyone like what's our best estimate and the turns out that this is really close to some really well established by names that were in the literature from 2004 and 2018 I wrote a paper that really extrapolated back a little bit and kind of answered a lot of the objections to it but it turns out that in probably less than four thousand years Adam and Eve in the Middle East would be ancestors of everyone so that means before a Paul writes Romans before Jesus is Ascension before he dies on the cross and is raised again 3 days later I before I'm the gospel at you know before Peter is even considering admitting Gentiles into the church and before they're even thinking about actually taking his commission seriously to spread the gospel to the four corners of the Earth to the ends of the Earth before all of that and Eva would be
 ancestors of everyone and so when scriptures talking about a Dom then he's really talking about all of us and so then all of the major theological objections to understanding human as a descendants of Adam and Eve really melt away so turns out some of these questions were addressed before in this definition the human is not my invention it's actually in church history and was first considered and a context where people saw the new world and they said well those people clearly don't descend from Adam and Eve cuz we can imagine how that happened they were wrong so maybe they didn't send from Adam and Eve and maybe there were some people out there that God created a different way and they still existed and that was pretty much universally condemned in the church even as far as a radical in for example of the Catholic Church they would call her radical and it just turns out that they were wrong about the science fair if Adam and Eve really loved that when they discovered all these people in the new world will they would still be descendants of Adam and Eve and so all the objections wondering about whether or not people are alive on Earth today still fit into God's salvation plan
 they're just because they're irrelevant so it allows us to really take a hold of that old definition of human that's scriptural definition of human and a way that avoids all of the theological pitfalls that caused people to reject that we reject the recent Adam and Eve I would say it was there was a big splitting that happened in a lot of ways when touring of traditions to talk about three main splits but but one of the main splits or splintering was between you know Catholics that took them or mythological view of Genesis because of this and push it out of me really really anxious it wasn't just a discovery of the new world was also discovery of things like neanderthals is called the problem is antiquity of man and today they were comfortable just staying well most of them Genesis is Tilly mythological week and neglect all that and put a really really ancient because it's really critical that we all descended from him and then what we might calm or Protestant understandings of scripture which were much less inclined to depart from
 but for those that were engaging with mainstream science had them warm or grapple with this reality that they were adopting of you that much of the church and considered heretical so I said John Walton on the great example of a so he does not actually have a radical view to be clear and I'm not going there at all but I'm just trying to point out with the with the Gap is so let me know she's inclined to more recent Adam Adam and Eve are real people and real past and you know if you're going to look at the time. It's like it seems like an elf Neolithic time. Now Dennis Alexander would say the same thing too but then they thought incorrectly. If they put out of there then we would all descend from that so they had to come up with a different theories of original sin different ways of thinking of all those sorts of things and all that just becomes unnecessary because in the end
 even if out of me were recently installed to send from them and so that's split ends up becoming a false choice you mean you can really you could really have both if you want it
just to flip it over and I was pretty sure I knew the answer but I was I wanted to ask you a question when you're saying Adam and Eve in a recent pass could buy the way human genealogy happens could become the ancestors of everybody but that could also be true of the couple down the street. From Adam and Eve I would be true of that couple to in other words it's not a static entity like there are still ongoing ancestors of everybody that exists in every generation is Humanity goes forward but right turn the most recent common ancestors of everyone that's not what we're saying the only condition just teaches that we all descended from them so what would make them special wouldn't be the fact that their ancestors were other things about the story of The Narrative and about CLA
 Circle and spiritually to pop in there that that make them important in a way that the people next door warrant and that also means to that it's not the science fixes their time at six thousand years ago 15 thousand years ago twenty thousand a hundred or even five hundred thousand years ago from a scientific point of view there's individuals across the globe at all those time points and it's not fine tune and doesn't require any Miracles is just what we expect scientifically and so it just turns out that rather than being this really tricky thing to work out it just turns out to be a boring fact of population genetics if Adam and Eve exist then we all descend from them yet and not only that we probably don't have their DNA so we don't have any evidence to tell us one way or another so how do we know that we would all descend from them is it that we could or that we know that we would also if it depends on the timeline we're talkin about so I think if we're talkin just $6
 years ago it'll be hard to imagine a scenario where we all today don't descend from Adam and Eve it's hard to imagine a scenario that we don't Aldis in two thousand years ago there is a possibility that I mean there is some debate about some outer region places I mean I think the main place where there's a debate is Tasmania and there aren't quote on quote I can't even use these forms pure-blooded Indians right now so that's the reason why that goes away but you can say possibly an exception to the rule and I don't think it's a problem even if that is really the case if we really think that they have full human worth and dignity and I really comes out at the ology it's only less of a problem than we thought that the majority people across her that didn't descend from Adam and Eve if there were recent right but if you are more than 20,000 years ago I think it would be hard to imagine a scenario where we didn't all descend from Adam and Eve I mean if you start to get to the point where I might start requiring very creative potential of miraculous
 it becomes too technically like impossible to find inform scientist that would dispute it at 20,000 years ago all the dispute that I know about for 6,000 you're really centers around around of isolation of Tasmania and not really isn't an issue about a neighbor about 10,000 years ago so other than isolated populations just the fact that you have six thousand years that it just becomes a mathematical almost certainty that everyone comes from the the same two people six thousand years ago if you sing scientifically right cuz we're trying to deal with not with the general pattern but would the flukes and what we can tell me like one of the ways that this was tested and where there's hard evidence behind it and it wasn't clear when I was first proposed in 2004 was my lucky an ancient DNA so what ancient DNA is is that we can actually dig up remains of people across the globe from different points in time like thousand years ago ten thousand years ago
 years ago there's thousands of genomes and actually been dug up and we'll do is we'll take these remains in my ticket to Thor Bowen will grind it up and extract DNA from it and you can dance sequence Tatyana and that gives us information about the past he would write Rotorua excellent book called who we are and how we got here and he's want to Leading researchers in Harvard he's actually been going through and and getting these and trying to reconstruct the past since 2004 over the last 15 years as we looking more and more these ancient genomes is that really and no population that we've had a lot of data for that we've looked at and we seen any long-term isolated populations with a long-range mixing across the globe everywhere and we see things that match history we can see like slave trade we can see the Silk Road we can see Genghis Khan's you know in the Mongols running out but we also see things that aren't in history books like that about 4,000 years ago is one of a large number of ships went from India to Australia for example there's really no written records of this and then
 several of the European populations that had a strong mythology of isolation of a certain type of pure-blooded nests that all turned out to be not since they were all men are mixing with their neighbors yeah and and so it turns out that the pattern for human which is very different than other animal that's one of the ways were somewhat unique is that we're just interbreeding everywhere across the globe where are actually linked together until a common evolutionary fate we don't really have isolated populations if there's an opportunity for you to be reading over let you know long distances we will usually take it and so that means that there's a really good evidence against isolated populations and almost every place we looked and so that's why I start to become entering the realm of you know very hypothetical counterfactual stories you might come up with see said multiple times and this is a hypothesis nature of it if Adam and Eve were to have existed in a recent past name leaves six thousand years there's nothing extraordinary about the process by which they could become the ancestor
 of everybody alive even two thousand years ago there would be their genetics might have disappeared probably just disappeared like a drop of water in the ocean right yeah right so on this is something and you did say this multiple times but if I remember correctly cuz I I listen to it before I went back and walk my way through a reading it was you or not trying to prove the existence of an Adam and Eve what you're trying to say is the genealogical account does not prove but it's impossible to disprove the existence of such a couple in six thousand years ago and for you to say it's actually that plant that's super important for everybody on all sides of the debate and I found that really interesting to talk about that more everyone has had a false Priests of position does a scientific evidence indicates this that science will tell us about Adam and Eve that's just been the strong
 but I won't come to and it just turns out to be a very reasonable presupposition that's false we have many presuppositions on that when we learn about scientifically we just buy another intuitions are wrong and this is just one of those places where our intuitions are really really wrong and that's okay but I think it really Alters the conversation so we will talk about it a little bit it's a fact that matter is is that you can affirm all of evolutionary science and that doesn't reflect with a literal reading of Genesis and it's actually connected to the the Genesis traditional just recovering stuff that was already there you know then you know that's no longer valid reason to reject either account I mean I don't really interesting an interview with an atheist who was the next Christian who part of the story of leaving the faith was seeing all the conflict between evolution which is oven is for and then that's the story and that was one of the reasons why I left the faith and I know this is part of the name I mean not everything is becomes an atheist for that reason but some do
 face but that's not a very good reason anymore like we have a lot of people I knew and I know that reject Evolution because of the other conflicts that they perceive with a traditional reading a Genesis you know you can sort of like I'm not trying to convince you it's true but I'm just as basic coherent that's no longer valid reason to reject Evolution way and you know maybe we can sort ejected we can understand it with less fear and realize that there is no conflict there if it were true and there's a lot of Christians that came to a friend Evolution but took more mythological views about science as for what they did I think that's a real problem actually this point because maybe they're right I mean maybe scripture doesn't box us into thinking Adam you were real people on the recent passing maybe but you can't say that that's because of science that you got there let me know I would be a really bad science I mean I think the reality is is that science doesn't tell you that and so can a lot of ways I think it ends up upending even if people end up in the same position
 I think it has to have to alter their reasons for why they're there and not some I think they'll so why it's why it's been simultaneously attractive and controversial and maybe even heated at times by different people because you know if you need to seriously at the reasons why they say they hold the positions they have if what I said is true that means that they should probably be really thinking of all the way to even talk about Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis right he's given reasons why he thinks that he Unearthed creationism is true but those reasons don't apply anymore I mean those things are so then why is it important that the sort of stuff that has to be worked out now crossed I think the whole conversation so it sounds like you're experienced over time is like watching two people get into an argument but you know that actually they just fundamentally haven't understood each other or this thing that they're fighting over
 not only that it's not just that they're getting an argument it's the same argument it is like Groundhog Day they're like four decades like long before I was born people are fighting the same argument stock. That's what's so exciting about this is that supposition that I want to look at it closely we find out that we just a misunderstanding science whoever sent us any Scripture in right now of for the people that have been exposed to it they're going to disagree on different particulars here and there but I think the agreement that scripture can't be talking about genetics but it might be talking about genealogical ancestry that almost seems to be universally appreciated when people come to see how do I don't know of any legitimate arguments against them or anyone who's trying to argue against that now
I'd like you to comment on that you could quite a bit of narrative personal narrative about how the ideas of the book came into existence the story of research you have steel did these findings in a lot of different cross-disciplinary settings with the Illusions was scientist with historians to just talk about that you've actually been staring taking these ideas on the road for quite a few years now before they took published form so talk about that with other experts and I don't want to be putting out there is stuff that would either get me embarrass professionally or is that would be unstable for the church so I got population genetics has some balls I'm also not a Biblical expert I mean I have a Christian that reads her for the best I can and so I start talking to a lot of activities over and I was like fortunate to get some funding to bring together a small group of Scholars is a bigger is about 35 people or so for two people
 how to basically work shot my buck which I'm very fortunate to have happened as well reasons why I put all this effort into it is because I was in a very unstable professional situation when it happened for some reason that side my control I kind of got thrust into the public when I didn't have 10 year it was something that a lot of evolution or creationism or uncomfortable with it was it was wrapped up in some of the reasons why they asked me who the kind of basically I kick me out by the time I was in this place where I was talking about this thing which really sounds like totally pseudo-scientific right and I was coming up for tenure as I was thinking man this is not the wise way to do it but here I am I need to be obedient to Lord I think he's going to serve the church and I need to make sure that this is a solid and as careful as humanly possible and diligence as I can about you know where tracking my mistakes and backing off claims that aren't true and so I've been really fortunate to be in a community of Scholars that that met me on that
 we figure it out together and it was I got to tell you this one was too risky things I ever did in my career if I wasn't a follower of Jesus I can't imagine doing this because it was too risky to be worth it and I also lost things to write to you know if it's the same token I told you God made me be a scientist you know I think you might need to write this book to I didn't realize it at the time and I really hope with it is just that it's going to serve the church and not it will help clarify this line of unending conflict so maybe we can kind of unsettled at a bit and maybe try to find a better way for one thing I did appreciate and I won't make you try and summarize this part of the book about a big question that arises for people is concepts of sin and these easy to say but hard to Baxley Define concept of original sin and what that means you do tackle that in the book and you do explore how your hypothesis kind of fits with that so
 tease it up so that people listen to ask want to go hear what you say but you do a dress that topic so how did the original sin make sense but no one thinks that have been howling that is a mischaracterization of their views over and over again about that came out recently I buy Donna Phantom on Scott McKnight and it defines his door glad I'm just saying since transmits by DNA almost every review about book by a conservative by DNA exactly so let's just put that aside the question is will have to make sense of this theological simplistic answer is a lot of existing theology covenant theology that just lots of necessary really usually to this sew-in covenant theology God puts into a contract essentially into the Covenant with Adam and Eve that if he sends there's going to be consequences for his descendants and so it's
 my DNA is just the contract and so he breaks a contract and then that happens and that's kind of how it happened to the original sin is really how Adamson affects us through that contract that's one way to understand. I think there's a deeper question here to really pursue theologically where we certainly thinking about what inheritance has and what is it that we inherit from our ancestors and to really go deep into that question I was in a lot of churches I want to we really focus and talked a lot about the Paradox between Justice and mercy right now God is infinitely Justina infinitely merciful person but Justice requires punishment and mercy requires withholding punishment so how do you reconcile that tension right I think that tension is deeply embedded in the story of scripture and it's part of his rise to the logic of the Gospel one element that we tend to neglect in the church is that how in this Paradox which we see is two part I think of the tripart to the third part 2 of inheritance and inheritance is intention with Justice because
 we punish the parents it's also going to affect the children even though they did nothing wrong and how inheritance is intention with mercy and how if we show Mercy to one generation that actually is unfair to the next and so if we were to punish a one generation for what they did it would be it would be a complex relationship is exile were you see Daniel like lost and found out a lot and he's done nothing wrong and he's being faithful in this world because that's not just in the important ways yet there's a mercy that God gives and it's funny that's how I came I think this is one place where I will a Shoal of my cards when I read that Paradox that struggle where Augustine looked at God telling Adam you'll dad is very day I think maybe we can understand that it's physical dust and realize that what's really going on is that marrying
 what's going to happen the rest of Israel that maybe Adam really deserves death and that really was the law that he would die that very day but then when it happens. God extend Mercy instead and let somebody in Exile rather than be executed and so I think. Then put some helmets on him and his progeny of God actually followed through with that judgment we wouldn't be here at least I'm going to be here in our current form and I think we can start to Think Through the Theology of the illusion I'm just kind of spitballing to some extent here but I think that's the big invitation to start thinking about the Paradox not just of justice and mercy but also of inheritance in one saying what's up many things I appreciate it about the book but one main theme was the kind of what you're doing right there your hypothesis actually could fit nicely and be at home in many different theological traditions and many different approaches to lots of Genesis 1 and 2 but all of the pieces of Genesis 1 through 11 or the Bible
 and so that's a real heart beat for John and I was the Bible project just show how the actually the main themes of the Bible that the main things it's doing can sit at home in all of our Traditions but we mostly focused on the boundary line issues cuz that's you know where we gain Identity or I don't know it's what gets the most likes so in one sense there's something new and exciting about your hypothesis but there's also an unremarkable quality to it because it's not like a new position it's actually a way of reading things that are there that could be a home in many positions and I just found that really refreshing it says that God makes his wisdom known to the Melaleuca many-colored A diversity of the church that's a little bit of a borchardt quote which is worth one reading it in a season three times the dance. Pick that up on when they're trying to deal with this deeply Evangelical problem of how do we deal with an extensive of the diversity of the church and the unity of the first together quotes
 which really and it's a literal translation when he says many colored and what he's saying is that the same for static about the diversity of the church I'm another way to put it as I would say the scientist or does a human is that part of how we know we're engaging reality that there's many descriptions of it that are all coherent and that there's something more real that comes out of it when there is a great diversity of people that have encountered the same loving God and not the reality that we've lost in the word zones for a long time because the County's splintered and what you're describing here it is I think a rebinding of the account are we going to gracian of it where it's no longer that we all have our mutually personally individualize accounts in a corner somewhere that you know you have for your reason like you like chocolate you like ice cream I like brother that we're all maybe the opportunities are gathering around the same thing now and start trying to understand it may be in different ways and maybe in our different understandings of that elephant in the room is lying then we can start to try to piece together that larger reality and I think that is the
 jellicle Instinct tried to understand that there's something legitimate about even the people who disagree with us and we want to try to wait the kind of piece together the whole story of elephant together that's well said and such a rich book there's so many things that we could still talk about I appreciate how you've tried to capture the heartbeat of what you're doing in the in the corner ideas this book took a lot of work it's just very clear when you read it so thank you for all of that for it you put in I think it's a really important contribution to this whole whole set of issues. Thank you for your work to in for inviting me to your audience for the handle you guys think of it all right good to talk to Tasha
