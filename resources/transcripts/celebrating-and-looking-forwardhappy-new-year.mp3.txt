hey Tim hey John it is the end of the year which means and staring at us right now cross the table ever so gently a gentle 423 in Lebanon future 2024 put in my mind what I meant was 2023 here you know what year you want it to be yeah but it's about to end and we want to take a moment on the podcast to reflect over the year what has happened but we got to make as an organization and muscle the things we've experienced and that we fly
 about our mission will we see God up to in the world and how we're getting to be a part of it. To take stock a little bit getting ready for some kind of New Year's resolution or something like that you guys do New Year's and be thankful for either of you in that way a little bit you know what you might start now Steve well I don't want to be a punchline Steeler but it's something we're doing collectively as a group oh well going to yeah well it take some discipline talk about that okay so then let's get into it so I mean what do we do this year it's kind of think about the year one way to think about this year was we talked through for big idea
 is in the Bible this year and we hope theme videos generally but we talked to him on the podcast and then we make this culminating video that tries to distill all those tend to remember what the 44 themes you know I wouldn't you wouldn't have unless a few minutes ago you would have put a list in front of me so now I do so on the podcast we talked to the difficulties of the first born than the anointed the city and then the chaos dragon to the firstborn series the thing that really stuck out for me the most and Steve we talked about this was the story of Cain and Abel and you showed me how canes cut jealousy towards a table was really the belief that there wasn't enough favored against all gods favor for a ball and it was like wait on the
 born I'm supposed to get God's favor she's kind of like wants God's here on his own terms he's not getting it and so he decides to take blessing on his own terms and in a way as hangers about why can't I get the favor I feel like I deserve and then in God's response to him was that like my gifts are for you to even if it doesn't feel like it in this moment right or did you say literally you two will be lifted up yeah if you do good won't there be exaltation lifting up I want to show you favor too but if you don't do good since then is Croucher at the door as meditation literature Styles vary implicit but you know we're meant if we're invited to see underneath that anger is a fear that he's been left out of God's favor and who doesn't know that feeling of seeing people around you to get the good life and you starting.
 wonder if it's ever going to come your way and maybe God's trying to teach me a lesson or you know I think for me it was you know that when we were talking about the idea that it really ultimately came down to the trust God and the generosity of God and then as you started even moving that in the story and saying with this theme all the way back to the very beginning and do we trust in the generosity of God or do we take things into our own hands that is a powerful idea I think John even in the podcast you said wait so all of this everything we're living in right now as a result of us not trusting the generosity of God and taking it into our own hands wow that is a powerful idea and so the first one themes about
 there's an expectation for how I think things ought to work and how who gets what when if so how how generosity is dispersed and so I have my expectations for that and our cultural norms have expectations and there's a steam that God's is kind of like you know what you're going to have to trust me that I'm good, disperse it as I will and most often it's in ways you don't expect consistently likes to shake things up shake up our expectations in a way they can feel frustrating but it seems like in the long game in the life is so many of these Biblical characters it ends up being the thing that forms and shapes their character the most
 into a posture of trust that was a really amazing seem to explore I learned a lot in my Reflections on that seems we walked were together and the video super cool cool graphics we work with the studio ordinary folk yes alright then we did the theme video on the anointed was yeah yeah the liquid Life Of Heaven coming down yeah that's good I know it's a powerful imagery in that I told you guys before but I've made it a practice of reading the 23rd psalm every morning to start my day and the lion that jumped out that I had never really seen before was he anoint my head with oil so he said yeah and I'm being anointed by the anointed such a powerful image has good stuff you had a beautiful video so
 that's actually also if you're paying attention and usually are videos are like a dialogue so we take the vibe of like us talking through it in the podcast we try to capture that same live in like how the video works is a discourse and with that video we actually ended up rewriting it with one voice kind of more poetically walking you through the idea it wasn't our boys it was a friend Michelle Michelle Jones yeah you called it as we worked on it it felt more like a meditation somebody taking you slowly meditatively through and idea unpack to the story The Bible as a great vibe to it I love it I love that one
 tell me the city that was really fun for me yeah we took our time the city of Kane started with the city of Kane how it's like an unlike the Garden of Eden what it represents a study on the development of technology in the Bible because the city is like a huge fabricated thing but then the surprise of the city was how God incorporates it he doesn't scrap this human project born out of violence and fear he incorporated into the New Creation Garden City from me what stuck out was but we ended up and dancing and do what we called the mindset of the city or the logic of Kane which was that the city in the Bible represents a human created Community whose basic premise
 is the fear of death and doing what it takes to protect us in hours even if it means you know breaking a few eggs and fuse goals and that we ended up back at the generosity theme of trusting it all roads lead back yeah I'm a city guy I mean not that I dislike the country when there's something about I just feel most at home in in a city and some of the cities that we live in have been challenging it's just it's beautiful to think that this is going to be redeemed and if that's what's going to happen so encouraging
 okay and then finally the chaos Dragon which actually turned into a nearly like half-year podcast. I'd love to know Steve has questioned the audience why was the cast on the song okay so here's the deal we were told that podcast should not be an hour-long I'd like to make them 45 minutes for a 44-40 45 minutes so tell him you're like well that means we have to go to Les so that means I'm going to be more episodes of me that well that's fine maybe we'll release two episodes a week or something but we'll keep them short well we just can't keep anything short like we would do much to explore we would just always go an hour or more so then we ended up with basically this Mega Siri yeah totally appreciate it
 yes I was lost and your kind of feeling like me and should I keep going or should I just wait and John the fact that you're like damn I sure this is making sense so reassuring if the co-host is saying I'm not getting it but once I feel like once the light went on for you it's like there we were all kind of at this place and you'll begin to see it and then what it culminated in yeah so the video which actually in real time just released today and so Steve I was amazed it was beautiful just the Artistry and anything to do with it was interesting I don't know how detailed you want to get but I mean it was like four minutes long yeah three and a half talking with Patrick the director and he said the script that he you guys had originally delivered was more like 6 minutes yeah that they took
 it's okay what really needs to be said now have just reminded me of the Mark Twain Lane I would have written you a shorter letter but I didn't have time and it's like I just really thinking on that and pulling out stuff that wasn't relevant it just I'm guilty of sitting every video that comes out at my new favorite video but I think and I love the part where you see the dragon slayer there in the Temptation that was very good it was episode 11 of the 11th Hour of conversation was we're John blaq put the rug and then it was one of the many moments so many moments over the years where I realized ice things were clear in my mind and then the mummy start asking questions 11 hours later I was realizing like I don't even know what the clear my my
 anymore and so that that made that serious unique I think probably be any serious was done I just had this intuition there's something here here's how I understand it currently and we truly discovered together I think how these symbols work and that was really rewarding we discovered how to talk about how they work yes how we were going to talk but I think we were ever how it works we discovered how to think about it for me it was a genuine insight into how the symbols work in the biblical story like I think I could get like a doctoral thesis for this work and I think we all can have it if you Faithfully listen to all the episodes in the mail that certificate will be coming to me it was a wonderful experience to go and all the way back to the first part of this project we're somehow talking with you for hours
 over question after question forces of clarity that I didn't even know that I needed for myself and I just I learned so much when we go through these deep study some I was I really enjoyed it and the video really is a less-is-more approach now I've worried this whole time about what I just been calling Dragon fatigue and so when people come to me that I can't follow along and how's it going like did you hang we have some wonderful volunteers to come by and do the office every week to hand write letters to our patrons and some of them are just you know older just really wonderful people who I would never imagine like freaking out about Dragon. Monster. In the bible college students who like creatures podcast
 how's it going okay but it was a shorter video and so there's a thing we're thinking about which is maybe less is more with video content so we're going to try to keep making me a little shorter but that doesn't mean you leave a lot out and so I think we could plug really quick our new guide Pages because if you can follow along with the project you might be aware that we have study notes that accompany videos but they're like locked in a PDF she got like Download a pdf and you can like print it out or like use it on your computer which is like such a like 1998 way of like doing business
 My Generation loves the PTI season and I don't know personal document file what does PDF stand for portable portable document format are okay but now you don't have to download a PDF and actually we have these things called guide pages and so a guy page is a topic we have one for every book of the Bible now we're going to have them for like a team video so does the guide page called dragons in the Bible and it's on our website and basically if you watch the video when you're like that leaves a lot of questions but we we go deep and how the Bible uses Dragon imagery and
 it links to the podcast that links to the video it links the scripture it's really cool at these guys Pages do so check out the guy Pages this year that's what I think we did this year and they're really really great
 doing it took the wind out of this conversation with guide Pages something about the guide pages is that our web team and a marketing team with driving the creation of these because we wanted to respond to what people are searching for when they go in late Church on the internet and that's what was driving it so can we answer the questions people are asking and also if not thinking of you
all right that's the podcast Series in the video we made and you know one cool thing just to keep in mind this is just a growing a growing audience and so we have our YouTube channel an English which is about to be 4 million subscribers and then we have a number of localized YouTube channels another language is I don't know how many but altogether if you add them all up I think it's near 6 million subscribers worldwide for people who are waiting for Bible content entertainment I mean it is entertainment but like it's like I want to figure out how to read the Bible I'm here to like learn to meditate on the Bible is pretty amazing too encouraging me that was one of the things that somebody shared with me earlier in the year when you look at a lot of these numbers you know that 5 million subscribers or the number of videos that are viewed every day
 and you know when you hear those numbers this person said it really screams about and I was thinking she was going to say the quality of the videos but she said it really screams about people's hunger to understand the Bible like that is beautiful all that has happened in the Bible project the reason that we've seen the growth that we've seen is because people are hungry they really want to understand the Bible so much so that don't even listen to two people just talk about the Bible for hours about one topic like dragon and so there's nothing to celebrate some people are following along and podcasting if you were listening along you're one of we don't know exactly how many we know there's two million downloads and streams podcast every month it's a lot of people working to the back catalogue some people are doing a podcast of week some people do more we don't know but too many downloads crazy
 a lot you know one funny thing through the history of the project is I used to speak regularly two groups of people when I was a pastor do they were called sermons and so I don't do that much anymore and not what I I really mostly enjoy being in the classroom being here with you and now it when I think about getting in front of a group of people to give a talk I can't really nervous now because I'm so out of practice and what gives me relief is to think about being in a room with a small number of people having a conversation cuz that really there's just something about a conversation where you're coming from paired to talk about things but you just never fully know where it's going to go and then it's been like giving to me and then I love to think about how that's creating a learning environment for so many different kinds of people you know over these years so and you know we
 did you hear from so many of you hundreds and hundreds of you sent in questions for the Cuban are episodes this year more than ever and it's so fun just to be in touch with the questions you're asking is there the same questions that we're thinking about asking too so we are just really excited about you all listening and as our audience and we're just so glad you're on the journey will ya another thing that we launched a couple years ago but continuing to invest a lot in as the Bible project app yes we are going to have a lot of things going on inside of it now yeah just continues to get better and better I think we are at 180,000 monthly users with close to a couple million total downloads and but there's some things that teams working on this year that I'm really excited about that I think will continue to help people to learn how to read the Bible
 as they're reading the Bible yeah we'll talk about one of those things at the end but we're thinking about now is that we took classroom on the app so classroom is been just something you could do on your computer is kind of bill with the computer in mind because when you think about taking a class of sitting down to take a note yeah, you kind of think of a desktop of experience you got more screen real estate I can put up the screen of Tim's notes and then 10 teaching and I could even have my place to put a note saying you got the whole thing and so that's what we decided for it and it was great and it is great and we have lots of classes you do it on your desktop but it also means you have to sit down and carve out time to do it which is kind of like a psychologically hard yeah I think it requires yeah cutting off a section of time we are dedicating it for that and then what we noticed
 I don't know I guess our data people can notice the most people were going to the web classes but on the other phones have just making it work and just making it work yeah and then they start to say like I think more people want to do it this way so our design team for classroom reinvented the whole design the software behind it to all be for mobile room in the in the industry we don't think twice on the team and the way that those guys design that is amazing I'm a classroom user but in the audio only format cuz I listen to it when I walk in the morning listen to it like a podcast
 do is you might mention something I think it was when you were talking about the photomosaics and how the Bible being like a photo Mosaic it was such a beautiful animal like what is he talking about I pulled out my phone there's the image I have is Right Live at your commercial right now that's exactly right and so yeah so now that it's in the app and on a phone you can find more time and space on a walk doing the dishes on a run gardening driving your car like you can just grab that space now to actually go through 70 level classes and it's working really low so about classroom that came in in the span of about two weeks one from Tracey Caldwell Dyson and she is going back out and
 2024 and she was talking about what classroom is meant to her couple weeks later receive an email from Erin of truck driver who talked about how she listens to it while she's driving and then at night or her days off she goes back through the classroom session and takes notes and it was like in the sky and I'm laying out so fun yeah it really it's amazing I think we just had a hunch and I had a hunch all the years that I taught you know as an adjunct professor at a couple different Seminary is just the amount of people who can set aside the money in the time to sit in graduate school classes it's really a such a small number of people but the number of people who would love to learn at the steps I just knew like more people would be into it and so it's really fun to be able to invite
 people from so many different walks of life into a really Next Level engagement with scripture and its really really fun to hear people stories yeah it was really cool we really thought to contact this year in the app class are you taking me out yeah that's right yeah so class on the 7-Day creation narrative called Heaven and Earth than class from Noah to Abraham introduction to the Hebrew Bible Jonah Ephesians and the overview of the book of Exodus those are all available over a hundred hours of BioLife in discussion discussion with the students here and soon we call it Seminary level unofficially check it because you guys hear my unofficial what are we calling official slogan which were never going to use it so it's not telling you about it
 just you Tim and 750,000 people that are downloading with more Bible and Seminary that's your touch with the tagline because I'm going to use it because it's you know that's not humble but when you go to Seminary you get to take Bible but you take a lot of other stuff is balancing lots of different goals Wright Bible being one of them all the say we're going to have 5 classes 5 like 30 black session classes to go to Genesis 6:6 Genesis 19 Garden of Eden story it's back to the drawing board yeah you're not allowed yet now we don't have anything in like Leviticus yet but, but we will we will
 it's just Bible has written to the Bible and that's what it's about is I think the last number I heard was 800,000 completed sessions which is equivalent to 400000 hours lecture hours of students every month which is like that's a lot I love you yeah, he said earlier Steve something we have been experiencing for a while but somehow in the last year we've gained some clarity and talking about it we are very aware that the spirit of God is up to something among his people and in the world that is connected to with a renewal and a rediscovery of scripture
 as something beautiful and living that connect people to Jesus in a way that opens up people's imaginations and open up their lives and their hearts and minds and that the thing that God is doing and we sent the we are just one small part of that bigger movement but there are so many other organizations that have been the wind in our sales over the years were the main ones is the YouVersion Bible app that mazing people and such at the same heart to make the Bible accessible for free to people but also so many new organizations and then just people in their churches many of it as you all listen to the podcast like we hear from so many of you you're forming Bible reading communities and meditation communities near churches near friend circles
 and like that's where the action is cuz once you like that Curiosity and you see how the Bible works on its own terms it's just too awesome it's so fun so there's a bigger movement that God is up to and we are so honored to get to make these resources and just be one contribution to that and it's been really fun to watch it happen so you bring it up I mean let's sit on that for a second because that's really important thing that we're starting to discover is we want to continue to do our thing and offer these videos and classes and stuff and we love to see the growth of it but it's easy to kind of mistake the growth of that to be like we need to be the thing and where the thing and there's this growing recognition that we're not the thing God's doing something and we get to be part of it
 the way you described it there's the communities of people reading the Bible that's it for me at the end of the year talking about this with a friend of ours to see why it made me realize like oh that's what we're doing it's a project with color project and it was just you and me is smartest and it's like let's read the Bible and let's make some of this content and now we get to see more and more communities growing and what any good like the kingdom of God is not this like centralized like group that like tells you what to do it's like its communities just going after it and so we're really excited to see how we can you just said the power that are that are named Bible project the Bible movement
 started a long long time ago and we're just a project and that that's beautiful so yeah we don't have to stake the amount of enthusiasm for like where the thing it is cool to be able to be kind of an early mover and taking like this taking this way of reading the Bible making it a media making very popular and accessible but we're just we're doing it in our voice in our town from our point of view and our place in the world and even though it's kind of been a big splash it's not it's not the FAE and their weed fully expect and pray for all the projects that are to come you know that are yet to be born and there are like being born right now you know we can tell the stories but that would take all of the episode when I think to their it's interesting when you look at just so in 2024 we will have been around
 10 years and years yeah yeah look at the people that have joined our staff over the last several years our people that God has used this and their lives and their joining the project to be a part of a bigger movement to be part of something that's going on it's just exciting to see for me when you see it how the impact it's having
okay so that's why my next year 2020 for the real 24 let's celebrate but we actually were also working really hard getting ready for 24 which of the project has been coming for a while like we're kind of like 3 years and that is the same amount Sermon on the Mount yes why did you want to do The Sermon on the Mount well yeah I think I proposed it to you about three years ago we should do a whole bunch of resources on this cuz the doctor the first document that I start working on we looked it up yet it tasted to the October 23rd of 2020 so I mean one is subjective reasoning is personally for me The Sermon on the Mount has been one of the most important parts of the Bible and if she has his teachings from when I first started following
 Jesus
 just had a huge impact on me just reading it and it was the first large section of the Bible that I was ever inspired to memorize when I was in my early twenties and so I think just it's always been a big part of my life and then I went into Teaching Ministry in pastoral Ministry I just found like it just kept being the Centre of gravity and so I have the opportunity to study and teach through it multiple times and it's sort of like if you want to get the heartbeat of Jesus of what does it really look like when the Kingdom of Heaven touches Earth in a communal life in the life of a group of people who live out the value set of Jesus like where would you point them in the Bible to like the most condensed place to go and Matthew has done it for us these pull together like the greatest hits of what Jesus would say when he would go into one of these towns and Galloway and Mike what's the essence of what it means to enter the key
 the charter for the the Jesus movement it's laying out of core vision of reality and of what is the kind of behavior relationships and values that make sense if God is raining over that he doesn't happen should you treat people and what is truth and goodness is having was really nervous right now and that's what it is it's a vision of everything The Theory of Everything whatever you want to do use to describe it it's the heartbeat of what Jesus was trying to do in launching these communities of his followers and then living out that vision of reality all the way to the cross and then out the other side into the empty tomb in Pentecost and Beyond what we're talking about it's three chapters in at the age of three chapters about 130 verses of Matthew Chapter 5 6 and 7
 yeah yeah it's a little Universe of wisdom meditation undo itself about what is the good life what are right relationships what is the true in the beautiful What Is Love who is my neighbor who is my enemy Sermon on the Mount so we are dedicating a Year's worth of our energy to make a whole bunch of resources so that we can guide people with how to slowly read and reread the Sermon on the Mount and really meditate on every every aspect of the gym yeah yeah yes sir I have a new move for us to the new move is to spend so much time in one part of the bottom part of the Bible when you say spend a lot of time do you want to share what that means yeah so I'll basically all year yeah we'll see if this was a good move I mean all year and three chapters
 we have to attend part video seriously ask you if all that's going to be releasing every month and a half or so every 5 weeks every 5 weeks. Which is not awkward Cadence we also are going to have another iteration of visual commentary videos come out that'll be on like most of the different parts of the Sermon on the Mount will have an accompanying what we called visual commentary and literary design and things like that and then we're going to experiment with short for kind of insightful content and they'll help you understand specific passage that you're in so most of the videos we make our like here's a theme that covers the whole Bible where he was an overview of an entire scroll what would be a good experience of a piece of media that short that just helps you like understand the passage that you're in or 1 Word in a passage
 hello teaching of Jesus and so we're kind of like we thought about calling visual footnotes because it's kind of glad we thought about this on the table Steve-o's and we're going to space it out space it out and so that these will come out as we're if we're reading Switzerland must love each other here sounds like a whole bunch of videos stacking up in my YouTube. You know that was a bill. But just feels overwhelming so can you help me think about how to streamline all that for you yeah well you can just wait till 2025 and then just go through it all week but if you want to like slowly read through the storm out with us and meditate on it and just squeeze
 as much as we can see what we're going to do is actually going to put out work on a weekly playlist which is what are the videos what are the podcast episodes are parts of the podcast episode where are the calls with all the content that's going to help you read through the part of the same amount were on and it's going to be in the app it's going to be like something you can look at go through module early check them off if you want to do it every week or refresh a new set of things to do so to become a 5-week Cadence going through a part of certain amount will spend 5 weeks and say the movie called introduction which is the Beatitudes and then Jesus calling his hall or something light and so it'll be like 5 weeks of just like turning that over and over and over cuz there's a universe in there and you can find all the content in the app and the weekly playlist in if you don't use the app you can just sign up to get an email and he was out on a website where will just email you all them stuff that we go through that way
 this is a number of our team members came up with this idea that's really cool cuz I assemble music playlist when I'm studying genre something so this is idea of what if you could put together a video a 10 minutes of a podcast conversation via a short essay article and somebody reading the OU versus a Sermon on the Mount allowed and it's about 30 minutes of an experienced what you going to do all at once you can if you could pay that out could do that but what if there were 40-ish of those things through bundled together and organize to walk me through a part of the Bible that would be cool to this afternoon muscle were flexing for building and flexing this year because we have discovered over the years that when we feel like as an organization where like
 right onto our mission is to create resources that help people actually read the Bible themselves and with other people and experience Jesus in scripture and so we want to really zero in on helping people do that in a way that you do for us and we listening to that part of this is my New Year's resolution I have every year and decided something different to read in the morning but I haven't necessarily been good about doing it in community and so this to me seems like it'll be an easier way for a lot of us to be on the same page yeah and reading this together and going through till I'm excited about it and just the fact that the podcast everything is just going to we have together yes the podcast will all year will be walking to The Sermon on the Mount and we're doing some new things on podcast exciting and very next episode
 you will hear a gen one is never done before we got new people at the table helping us read the Bible so that's coming to everyone if you're going to follow along this is Steve's this is your New Year's resolution just give you heads up the first five weeks it's like an overview of how the sermon Works which is like it's brilliant that goes so much structure yeah it's so cool so where you going to spend time just looking at the whole structure of it and so the first five weeks we're going to read cuz it's kind of the greatest hits were going to read some of the greatest hits of the greatest hit the first five weeks while we just focus on the overall structure and then we'll jump in to the Beatitudes in February we produced I and then the the research team that we have here the other Scholars that I work with produced a translation Bible project translation of Matthew 5 6 and 7 and then that'll be one of multiple translations avail
 to read meditate Through The Sermon on the Mount do you know what kind of time is that for folks did it all start to finish probably around 30 minutes of content but the idea is to ship at it during the week 5 or 10 minutes a day and it would be great if you are always kind of most passages of short so you can kind of like read it and then do the next lesson listen to it again and then do the next lesson and it's going to build towards I can't just keep listening listen again or you can just do it all in like 30 minutes or just pick it up
 so yeah 2024 women on the mount we're going to learn a ton because want to figure this out how do we read the Bible together see it that at least two Jesus read it as communal meditation literature that gives us wisdom and do it while loving our ancient neighbor right I'm trying to understand Jesus in his own time and place so that the spirit of God through his words can speak to us in our time and place yeah that's worth trying to do let's like learn to do it while we're doing it and that's The Sermon on the Mount in 2024 and we're excited to do it so maybe it should be your New Year's resolution is well I mean maybe join me John and I are going to be great I'm so thankful for this year I'm so thankful for this team that we get to work with feelings for you thank you John for another year me to Steve wow
 now that I'm grateful thank you I was just reflecting on what you said and that you talked about kind of why we're doing this in Our Hope what can happen end on November 7th I received a patron comment from a guy named Mark and Mark said the Bible project has been one of the most transformative resources I have experienced the videos are for a beautiful overview of Bible themes the podcast allow me to do a deep dive into different biblical Design Elements more importantly I am more in love with Jesus and meditate more on his word because of Bible project thank you and keep going and it's so encouraging because as you said earlier it's not us the spirit of God is at work but what I wanted to the reason I want to read that is just to encourage all of the folks that are listening that are in this with us here some of the fruit here's what's happening but there's more marks and while we still want to learn to get better
 and we want to work with these playlist and work with our app and different things that we're trying to help accomplish that
 everyday I feel like I'm getting glimpses of this vision and Mission that we have is is happening and so encouraged by this but also encouraged by all of our patrons are people that are in this with us and so thank you for your generosity thank you for being in this with us in and we can say we wouldn't do it after we couldn't do it without you know thank you in for. Giving people generously give us money so we can make stuff and then it gets to be 3 cuz it's already been paid for. And it's so cool that this. People doing that with us so I don't think we are honored to get to do this work we love hearing from you and I would willing you know another another year of learning discovering that like Chronicles of Narnia c.s. Lewis Wright and then the last pages of battle

 hi this is Daniel. I'm from Madison Mississippi I first heard about Bible project from a friend use Bible project for personal growth and for discipling in mentoring people that I work with the Bible project to help me through these Concepts when I am struggling with one from the Bible or even when I'm introducing it within a study group helps make the Bible understandable everything about the Bible project interactive features and it shows the theme of of pointing towards Jesus
 we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus we're proud want to project what people like me on free videos so you know podcast classes and more
okay so we're talking about some of them out but we need to start with some Basics what exactly is The Sermon on the Mount and here's how I'm picturing it Jesus went up on the mountain one day and he kind of gave his Greatest Hits to the people who were listening to him and Matthew was like well that's good I'm going to put that in my gospel yeah that's what's around them out is that is one way of imagining what the sermon is and how it came into existence but there's a little more context both in terms of how the sermons fits into Matthews presentation of Jesus and then also how the sermon works together as a whole and then how it fits into the cultural context and historical and political context of Roman occupied for Century you know israel-palestine and that really matters actually
 a lot of the sayings not that they can't speak to us but that if we honor that contacts I think they can speak to us more powerfully okay so help set the picture for me
 where in 1st Century israel-palestine people group who have lived on this piece of land for centuries and centuries going back to Thousand Years of the time of Moses and Joshua but in Jesus day it's occupied territory cuz the Roman Empire like owns you know that whole section around and took it over
 so just imagine your Jesus and his people you are living on your own ancestral lands but you are now reduced to day labor or just kind of scratching out of lower class living in the land of your ancestors with Roman occupiers everywhere
 and you reminded by the presents cuz there's tax Booth texting the fish U-Haul up out of the sea for Rome for Rome all of the you know the wheat is grown in your fields and so on you have a lots of poor and sick people who are falling through the cracks by the droves this is the scene into which Jesus says things like if someone forces you to go one mile talking about a Roman soldier
 about Roman soldiers could commission anybody to carry their luggage so when you talk about people suing and taking your cloak he's talking about actual exploitation of day laborers on these you know Jewish Farms that are now owned by Romans you know Jesus is drawing on actual political social economic realities people stay when he says love your enemies they have some enemies
 there was that a freedom fighters movement Jewish movement to liberate Israel through violent Revolt develops between stacker the dagger men who lived in the Hills there lots of people who believe that Israel would be liberated by God is they just were more observant of the walls in the Torah so these are kind of like your biblicist Century write your Bible and God people and also known as the Pharisees and scribes and actually Jesus shares a lot in common with that crew a lot of values in common but you also differs so a lot of ways he says in the sermon about you heard it said he quotes from the laws of the scripture and I say to you he's in dialogue with those figures
