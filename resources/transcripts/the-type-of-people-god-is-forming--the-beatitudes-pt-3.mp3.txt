this is Bible project podcast of a reading through The Sermon on the Mount the sermon open with nine surprise theme it's about who is a part of what God is doing in the world I'm John Collins and with me is co-host Michelle Jones hi Michelle remember there are nine Beatitudes and they are in three sets of three tryouts rights and today we're going to the second Triad listen to Triad where you get that picture of the type of people that God has for me they hunger and thirst for righteousness they show mercy and the pure of heart so we'll start today with hungering and thirsting for righteousness hungering and thirsting sounds very intense I know people who when they get hungry there just not people I want to be around hangry righteousness yes it's a very evocative image it also begs the question what does Jesus mean by righteousness that's one of those very churchy words that we just can't quite
 what are finger on it refers to the character of someone who is in right relationship with others around them so that's where we'll start hungering and thirsting for right relationships thanks for joining us here we go
okay here's the second try at the good life belongs to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness because they will be satisfied The Good Life belongs to those who show Mercy because they will be shown Mercy The Good Life belongs to the pure in heart because they will see God I love that we get to unpack these because they become so familiar yet I don't know what they mean so much of the Bible for so many people over to Millie erised into me okay so I think I've mentioned in the twenty years following Jesus this is I think my fourth slow deep pass through the Sermon on the Mount stacks of books and that's to keep giving man so the good life belongs to those who hunger and thirst for the first Jesus using a metaphor met by the second line because they will be
 they're satisfied and you get that you're hungry you need food and water you have a good meal and you feel good that's right let's just say he's carrying on of black being without that comes from the first Triad the powerless those who grieve over loss in the world for their one loss and then goes on the outside or something outside to be in a Perpetual state of hunger is not what I would think of as the good life no literal or metaphorical hunger but it's a state of black supposed to stay out of abundance but not just lack when you're hungry you like something and you wanted I know it's the worst thing hungry actually no just lacking something but I was thinking about was up and running more lately and I did some mileage other day and I was going to blister on my toe
 and I only like a couple miles into a pretty long run and it just occurred to me I'm going to have to think about the pain of my toe the entire time and so I was lacking homeostasis or whatever I was like in Comfort your mother I'm liking moleskin the devil saw stuff you put do you know that stuff for hiking all the time feel hotspot yeah I put it on put that stuff on nothing but some water and miles of Trail it's not just lacking it's the pain the irritant and Garrett and have the hunger of lettuce has theirs and knowing that you're perfect image then so good to people who are lacking something but I just locking it the lack irritates agitates puts them in a constant state of tension and aware
 best of the fact that they like this thing knew and what is the thing that they hunger and thirst for its Seas of the Greek word because I assume a British language word for this in the New Testament is righteousness I grew up with the word righteousness meaning the state of being pure and good for God right before God yeah not having flaws so as soon as Greek word when the standard Greek translations the group of words that comes from a root static or its data and to be in right relationship with someone or it refers to the character of someone who is in right relationship with others around them but you can refer to a whole group of people as having a quality at Seneca which means
 all the relationships are Equitable and people are in right standing with one another meaning they treat each other right away and the way that you do right by someone depends on the type of relationship sure you know if you're my brother or if you're my dad or if you are my coworker or teacher or teacher or employer or whatever will be different person back in the groceries print types of behaviors will qualify as doing right by that person so the ways of this word is used most often however in the Hebrew Bible just when the stories are about people who are responsible for creating and ensuring tzedakah in the community and they're doing a really terrible job usually it's my kids
 to righteousness isn't just some abstract moral code that we live by but it's it's actually how we show up for one another we want to dig into a couple more passages illustrate this and to do it I've invited dr. Ben 13 into the studio he's one of our Bible project Scholars I been so thank you help me out here been what should come to my mind when I use the word righteous or righteousness how do I relate to other people how do I show up as you could see it that way in the sense of like I'm a showing up at 11 and kind of way towards other people but if you mean it in the sense of a my showing up with all of my personal Holiness codes in order and I don't really care about other people then yet it's not righteous let's just do an example here right out of Jeremiah Prophet Jeremiah and 22:3
 he is just laying into the king of Judah won't for reasons that will become clear as we're up against thank God has given them the business this is what yokwe says ok Google do justice and Seneca do justice and righteousness like those are great words but it's cool cuz he flushes it out for you from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been wrong stop doing wrong and violence to the Immigrant or to the fatherless the orphan or to the wind stop shedding innocent blood in this city
 that sounds more just to see and what I think of when I think righteous will you caught it right in the beginning he says do Justin Bieber there is much pain. We've got a video on Justice and in it we break down these two words Miss Potts and Seneca and they're always super tightly connected the idea noticed you saying to this King and your town is all jacked up it is messed up and the way for me to not righteous because of how you're relating to each other you are violent you're impressing people you're doing wrong to each other still vague but we get a concept of your Harmon people and you're particularly this is always called out in the Old Testament you particularly these groups are really getting marginalized or shot and immigrants orphans and widows yeah yeah people who are not showing up with the whole bunch of benefit
 you seem to say they don't matter then and he says that is unjust so do not do justice and when you do is what creates righteousness in the city which is notice in this context it is right social relationships right ways of living mutually together in the society will feel loaded but I don't mean it to feel that way you've got widow's you've got immigrants and then there's this it almost seems like there's this need for Equity to to bring these people to a place where where they're not being oppressed or mistreated by us so is that word Equity is it I think it's great that comes you're right it comes with some Modern baggage that could mean different things with it
 but the way you said it was really really good in terms of the so what the part of it I wouldn't bring into it is a sort of homogeneous Bland everybody has all the same amount of everything but it would very much be there is nobody being oppressed there is nobody who is without what they need for life and flourishing yeah there's there's no scenario where somebody is just rocking and rolling and somebody else is starving let's just do nothing about it absolutely as you say that like Good Samaritan Parable or something like that but yeah another great word that I really would kind of cling to in this conversation is mutuality what it does is it says am I looking at a person as better than me or worse than me and then as soon as I'm doing that I'm out of a right way of related because I'm measuring them according to
 sing I can see your whatever God wants me to say to the human you human are a miraculous image bearing creation of Yahoo a and therefore you are worth loving blessing caring for and never to be oppressed harmed mistreated taken advantage of or a great word is consumed other times the prophets talk about this there they will say when unrighteousness is happening it's like you're devouring each other rather than blessing and encouraging and enlivening one another okay commercial so let's let's do one more verse Psalm 11 seven Yahoo a is righteous anger who made everything in and of himself his character is that he is always right Lee related to you and me and everybody and then and it's
 is soap still in the same verse Yahweh is righteous and he loves righteousness he treats people right and therefore he loves it when people do right by each other so when we are righteous we are Imaging God when we are not righteous we're basically saying kick rocks God when it says Yahweh is righteous and see how I treat people right he loves it when people do right by each other and if you always The Giver of Life he loves it when we do right by each other why does he love it because we're obeying his Rule now because he knows that when we do right by each other
 ending oppression blessing those around us we're coming into fullness of life and so are they that's his well is a vehicle for his love life if it's not just a rule to obey it's a way of write relating with everybody I love that thanks been thank you
Psalm 24 verse 3 who can walk up to the hill of Yahweh who can go and stand in the Holy space of Yahweh who can get in the temple in the throne room of God which is means that it's Eden imagery right in the place we're having dinner there one who can return the past by the cherubim and get back into Eden yeah yeah there's some 24th portrait the one who has clean hands hands of innocence and a pure heart that's going to be the next beatitude are the one who hasn't lifted up there being two any kind of falsehood they don't sueros with the seat they don't try and manipulate other people to convince them that you're being truthful
 they have integrity they're the same on the outside as they are on the inside that person will receive a blessing this is the better have a roof and righteousness from the god of his Deliverance you will receive righteousness and your behavior it's something you get out of get from God yes being counted among the righteous it's about a declaration that God makes when he looks at someone's life and says that someone has done right by me cuz it's really hard to know just by observing each other's Behavior who God would count as righteous or not in fact this is just his point many times over is that we are terrible at this earning weather people are at the righteous with the wicked interesting we often confuse them
 it would be obvious you would think but why what are you going to get into in the sermon is that you can do what looks like the righteous things be where he says in chapter 6 of doing your set of call your righteousness in order that other people will see you and then think highly of you and they see calls that kind of person to hypocrite sew-in Abraham story Abraham is powerless and his wife are powerless to produce a child and what Abraham does is trust that God's promise even though there's lots of reasons not to trust there are some reasons to trust God has been faithful to him after that point but there's lots of reasons not to and he trusts got crazy promised that a nation's going to come out of you and your wife and God stops The Narrative stopped since 5:45 and God reckoned it to him as one who does right by me he declares that this guy who trust me or something you can't do for himself.
 what it is right by me I mean that's what it means to do right by me that is this is the person who then will do right by others correct which then Abraham doesn't fully succeed at he has successes and failures leading up to his final wishes to success in 22 where he surrenders the life of his son back to God the ultimate Act of Faith and his face has rewarded with a with a promise and then the Apostle Paul will pick that up he sees their super important insight into the whole story of the Hebrew Bible the one who God will count as righteous as the one who does right by me is the one who speaks everything on God's word and promise and just trust in him
 and for Paul that's what it means to give Your Allegiance and trust and faith to Jesus Abraham trust in God's promise God like this is what I want I wanted that trust that faith that allegiance to me so I declare you as one who does right by me but the idea of being a righteous person and doing right by God means you're going to be doing right by people people correct that's right and then you get these narratives of Abraham not doing right not doing right by people totally yes that's right and then and it all culminates this climactic act of surrendering all of that back to God again on the trust and not did the right relationships that he developed amongst people so which is it is it doing right by others or is it trusting God exactly that it's the same word
 is to be righteous and do righteousness to be so money does right by God is to be someone who does right by other people but you got Abraham who is be my god wow not being right telling people what is the prize that on the basis of trust God will declare the ungodly to be people who are in right standing with a man that is a generous extremely generous and kind of got one who justifies the ungodly Romans to Nuance is the meaning of the word are there actually really close together to be declared righteous by God
 means to be someone who did right by God which means that in your life you will do right by other people who are made in the image of God that you are doing right by by doing right to them so just as you're someone who is not taking care of the poor and the oppressed when that person meets God and God is going to declare them as righteous as he says no you didn't you didn't do it didn't do right by me cuz you didn't do right by them so that's that first kind of layer of righteousness doing right now what if that person said yes yes God but I do trust you and I have faith in you I see that I screwed up screwed up to but I want to surrender then with God say I'll declare you as righteous as a first response is I'm not God so I've no idea what to say about anybody you know there's a subsea name of this about God is the one who searches the heart Proverbs songs about this this is about why God test people to discern what is in them
 it's kind of thing so yeah I think God in his wisdom and generosity will be just and fair and generous with how he evaluates people but he evaluates us he's evaluating us but that's the point is there's this moment where God will declare you're standing totally called questions in the Christian tradition and you can see James and Paul reflecting and working all these all these themes that the fact that God would be generous to me and Overlook my failures but the moment that becomes an escape clause for me
 to be uncompromising then I need to get some beer and trembling attention that the biblical authors refuse to the salt for us cuz I think it's the drama of the Life of Pi is to trust that God will be generous with me while I pursue righteous webs while I do righteousness my arson and just expect God to check me off the list because of some prayer didn't told me that's when the good life belongs to those who hunger and thirst for rightness right chesnes first of all if you hunger and thirst for it it's showing that it's something that you're not seeing or experiencing right relationships are not happening yeah this thing is is it's not something you have in the present which which compels me to think it's that first meaning of people doing right by
 each other and therefore right by God yeah there's a serious lack of that that I see out going on around me and it puts me in a constant state of agitation and anxiety and discontent the blisters forming the blister yeah the blister they see a world of people who are being deprived of righteousness righteousness and they see people taking advantage of each other and they see people doing it justice and they see some people ignoring it all and doing great looks like they're doing great and it's just grease them it's another one of these paradoxes this is similar to The Good Life belongs to those who grieve because you're grieving over the lack of a of equity of Harmony and wholeness in relationships and which is the saying is yes yes you're grieving yeah yes you want that if you're hungry you desire
 is a time and a place when there is True Justice ultimate Justice when everybody does right by everybody if you are not hungry and thirsty for people to do right by each other you're not paying attention if you're hungering and thirsting for it and you developed the pallet for the kingdom of God and yeah you're ready yeah that's right
so righteousness doing right by God doesn't bother me too much I think the thing that sticks uppermost in my brain is that hunger and thirst mean it's uncomfortable
 in other words it should bother me when the world isn't lined up with God sense of what's right and wrong and when people aren't treating each other right and the same way I make moves to get water and food like I don't wait for somebody else to take care of me and listen my baby I need to be intentional and active about helping to set things right you got to get in there like John said get some blisters
 okay let's move on take a look at the next beatitude religious word alert the good life is for the merciful
 second part of the Triad The Good Life belongs to those who show Mercy because they will be shown mercy and Jesus teachings of forgive you don't forgive others you will not be forgiven in fact there's a famous parable of the guy who's forgiven a debt yes and then he doesn't forgive a debt owed him correct and the conclusion of this is the guy who holds the debt saying to the guy was a money saying shouldn't you have shown Mercy to your fellow says I showed Mercy to you since the same word so yeah mercy here actually has a very specific new on forgiving it that it's forgiving someone has wronged you are OSU that's the specific meaning of Mercy in the gospel of Matthew wrong has been done to your house do you make right relationships when there's so much chaos yes you have to find a way to
 yeah forgive as Bishop Desmond Tutu said except in South Africa there is no future for the human race without forgiving there will be no way forward for us on individual or corporate levels without the practice of forgiveness nuts huge theme in Jesus's teachings you the Greek word Ella has which we talked about and past conversations in a word study about loyal F in Exodus 34:6 serious the Hebrew word chesed which means love generosity and loyalty that was translated by the Greek translator so Septuagint with a variety of words but the one the most common once was a Greek word l o s mercy and so the question is is Jesus talking merely about forgiveness
 is he loading this Greek words with its Hebrew meaning of tested so what's interesting is that in the gospel of Matthew this word appears quite a bit LOL you record with the ideas of acid do for example the multiple stories healing stories where people who are in really desperate situations call out to Jesus and what they asked us to show us a Las son of David so this is what the Blind Men say to Jesus is usually translated have mercy on us or the Canaanite woman think his daughter is sick have mercy on me so it sounds weird in English because we think have mercy on me means I did something wrong please forgive me it's like Uncle was like Hey listen Jesus you don't know me you don't know me and you don't owe me could you show me this kindness by restoring my body that's what they're asking up over and above
 when you're staying show me Hesed treat me like family treat me yes treat me like you would have family member that you're going above and beyond so that within our social relationships within the biblical imagination there's people is that you are already connected to and you have a duty and obligation to them okay so it's like you got your neighbors and it's like do right by your name that's right that's right you got your family and your close friends and it's like I'm going to just do right by you I'm going to go above and beyond yes I'm going to align myself with you I'm going to show you so much favor and Grace and kindness and love it's based off of this familial loyalty that we have together that's happened that's right okay having that kind of love towards and other exactly the ultimate goal and purpose of Being Human image of God is to love God and love your neighbor and
 so this Shades very quickly into Jesus's commands to love using the Greek word Agape which is gets us into a whole other discussion but the ls Greek word rendering the Hebrew word chesed is about that familial bond which makes it amazing in later and Matthew when it Canaanite woman comes up to Jesus would you show me and so I just I'll just it would invite the reader a note taker Psalm 136 has the worst acid in it in more times and one litter a unit in the whole Bible and it retails the story of God making creation and then of God calling and liberating Israel From Slavery and bringing them into the promised land in rescuing them from their enemies
 and every single line of the poem is punctuated with the line is Hesed into hers forever so the whole history of Israel is seen as a gift of Mercy that is loving kindness that is Israel didn't deserve it yeah we didn't have to do it but he just did it because he chose to and he's just that that's how I said do you want to do away with Mercedes I think we should find another English word familial love to wear T what we at with hard with the word mercy is it doesn't mean we're talking about what's hard with the word loyal love is it still needs a lot of explanation I think Buster those who and kindness doesn't go far enough what a word about how you treat your family generous love
 how good is life for those who love generously they will be shown generously as an aspect of it mean to send to love people that are closed in and when talking about generous over bundle of now we're getting it at Lawson in Love play throughout the series I've learned so much from the commentary on multi-volume commentary by WD Davis and tell Allison about Sermon on the Mount and they Sunrise Alice this way they say I lost Cano's the idea of loyalty in a relationship
 hence it would seem that Matthew was persuaded that while Jesus and his followers in their acts of mercy and loving-kindness were demonstrating their loyalty to God
 that there were weightier matters of justice and mercy for a loss and faith that were neglected by Matthew and Jesus's opponents verses throughout the gospel of Matthew this word mercy and it's connected words imply that merciful action is the concrete expression of your loyalty to God and that what God demands is not so much activity directed to God but loving kindness directed towards other people and their eluding here to another line in Matthew where Jesus quotes from The Prophet Hosea and says to the Pharisees God desires Ella has not sacrifices
 which Jackson doesn't mean God doesn't want sacrifices but it's in comparison if you're going to surrender something to God you can do in the form of sacrifice and that's good and right thank God right. Stuff that up in Leviticus but if you're comparing offering a sacrifice versus the opportunity to surrender yourself in an act of generous love towards another God will say do that one every time I come off as a sacrifice later
 The Good Life belongs to those who embody Hesed love the ones who treat people like really close family with outrageous generosity in their love that Israel never deserve that but God was always faithful to give that dog is loyal love punctuated their whole story is actually just one story God's loyal love goes on forever that's the story and Israel's life and in fact all of our Lives punctuated Thatcher's
 here's our last Beatitudes for the day the good life belongs to the pure in heart
 here's the last one of the little Triad The Good Life belongs to the pure in heart because they will see God
 remember how the first tryout ended with a quotation from The Book of Psalms blessed are the outsiders they will inherit it was a handle and it's a coffee face quotation from Psalm 37 Jesus concludes this Triad with another copy and paste quotation from Psalm 24 who can walk up to the hill of Yahweh and stand in his holy space the one who has Clean Hands and a pure heart who has not lifted up his being a falsehood or sworn deceitfully he will receive blessing from you all the way he will be declared righteous to be in right relationship with God this is this is the generation of those who seek Him of those who seek your face oh god of Jacob The Good Life belongs to the pure of heart they are the ones who will look upon the face of God
 looking upon the face of God in the Hebrew Bible isn't that a very dangerous thing to do it is but it's only dangerous if you live on the outside of Eden cuz if you're in Eden you're walking in the pools are in your walk-in you walk in the talking that's right to see the face of God is shorthand for to gain re-entry back into in the revelation 22 when having a nursery United his servants in the moment
 hyperlinks are happening in your brain
 so this is the reunions heaven on Earth he showed me the water the river of the Water of Life coming from the Throne of God and the lamb to the throne of the New Jerusalem is now with the tree of life is at the center of Eden flowing out of it. Life isn't sprouting up because the tree of life from no got no birds in this New Jerusalem eaten at the center of it is a thing from which flows the river in the garden the tree tree here it's Throne of God in the lamb and that's because it's the holy of holies 3 there will no longer be any curse the Throne of God and the lamb will be in it his servants will serve him they will see his face to have access and re-entry back into Eden
 is an offense to look upon the face yeah yeah it's the hyperlink to Moses on the mountain show me your face and he says you can't cuz here you know outside of it and it's dangerous you'll die like the back of such a great metaphor for the Indescribable so this is this getting into the Holiness theme this is getting into it is but it's using Purity language language lacks you do
 as to symbolize the state of my heart so I wash my body of physical and purities before I enter into the temple Courtyards that's very common and you do it as a symbol of I want to shed myself of death and mortality and also love my own moral failures and come into your presence in a state but the trick is to know it's a symbol and external thing that you wanted to be true of what's internal as well I get this picture of Purity being went when everything is right and that an in Purity than even the smallest thing that is introducing chaos and disorder and do something that is good and and right and I can I get this picture of an order to really be in God's presence
 like any amount of impurity is going to let us get magnified and and like it means that my behavior that's observable to others is doing right by God and doing right by others and that it's matched completely by my internal life and motivations that are doing right by God cuz I think we all learned pretty quickly you can fake it we learned how to manipulate others so there you go that's it Jesus is putting his finger on that this is one of those moments in the sermon where you like oh man well cross me off that list I can get with the hunger and thirst for righteousness but this one for to be connected to my true motives
 oceans yeah this is super tall order so in one sense you're like okay I get it that's the purpose of humanity that's the relationship God designed Humanity for and so that's this ideal but then you you think about it practically I think about it and I'm like how many minutes of the day should I even say I'm anywhere near what this is something for let's say like the purpose of my day was it wholeheartedly to try to be pure of heart all day I wake up and it's all I'm thinking about my focus all day how well could I do it well think of it this way this is the third of try out here and the previous to worry about doing right by others
 generous acts of love is hard enough but in other words I think the fact that the purity of heart comes as the third one to conclude all these behavior is what we're talking about here isn't just Behavior its character core character of a person and I know that one of the important contributions of biblical thought to the world and that the Protestant Reformation really kind of zeroed in on alongside God's generous grace and mercy is the compromised mixed confused yucky nature of the human heart depravity as aware and you cannot overemphasize that to the Gris of actually not being faithful to the full portrait of human nature in the Bible cuz Heavens are a lot more in God's eyes than depraved but that moral compromise nature is really a big emphasis in the biblical story and
 realistic true the song says give me pure yes that's right that's right David in Psalm 51 after murdering Uriah and committing adultery with Bathsheba ask for God's forgiveness and so cut by your mercy create the Genesis one language what I need is a new creation like for Mike or my thoughts my desires and my feelings create in me a pure heart so we need a pure heart and the pure heart is the entry card to returning to Eden on 24th idea of going up to the high mountain where you go into the holy of holies this is all about the return to Eaton cuz the temple in the Tabernacle are symbolic Eden's so this is about going past those chair being in the fiery sword
 that's going to be going to cut away some stuff that you might think it's really important to who you are but God says he got to you got to lose that stuff if you want to be with me and I want you to be with me so let's find a way to purge that stuff in a way that doesn't kill you that's potentially God's mission in the storyline in the Bible took on a mission to make us. It's fine it's possible that you were just lamenting so it's just the whole kind of rambling response to you lamenting like is that even possible and there's one sense in which I'm not sure I can do that but then there's another sense in which it's important to recognize the biblical authors and God really thinks humans are capable of this
 they're capable through God's New Creation power and presence and mercy and the power of God's spirit but it's what we are made for
 they're made to be pure of heart
 god is on a mission to make us pure of heart
 and our next and final segment lets listening as Dan gumel talks with one of our Bible project artist about how she chose to portray this idea of pureness of heart well here but it's Dan, and I'm sitting here in the Bible project kitchen because it was a little bit too loud in the animation studio and I'm sitting in front of mine Rose mayor someone talk about that image that you guys associate with being pure of heart sell in the shop what we're doing is watching The Scholar interact with her own perceptions of what it means to be pure of heart this one really raises the bar to be part of this revolution my heart needs to be so pure I could look directly at God so the way it's drawn up as you have this tall scholar figure in these very impressive religious robes and he's standing on this load pedestal and then this light shines from above and he kind of has his chest puffed out like swelled up and is looking up at this light
 this illustrates The Scholar presenting himself to God like check out how good I am doing and this little bubble that pops up of a hard on his chest is his own idea of what he is Jesus knows that all of our choices are good ones are often driven by mixed motives also the platform like swivels and he is now facing away from the light he's kind of hunched over in the shadow so like he's older more crouched over and it's a little darker the penny you want to show everybody your good face but you also have a a backside and sometimes you could you don't even know what's back there and so if you if you flip anybody around you're going to see some stuff that's not as appealing and that's not what you would be showing God that's the inverse of what you want to show anybody the problem that we're trying to illustrate in this shot is
 the idea that we can get away with our false presentation it's about being honest with ourselves
 I thought I'd cool well thank you Rose
that's it for today's episode next week we'll look at the third and final Triad which focuses on being peacemakers and uncomfortable but crucial way of life for those who follow Jesus biblical peace is not the absence of conflict it's the presence of Harmony
