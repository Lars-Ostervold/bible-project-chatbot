in the story of the Bible horrific things happen to people in cities cities bring out the worst of humanity but the Bible doesn't give up on cities in fact cities can be a place where the best of humanity and shine and the city that gave us a glimpse of this possibility is the city of Jerusalem established by King David to be the home of God yet even Jerusalem fails and that leaves us wondering what kind of City can we hope for when the prophets specifically Isaiah look forward to the ultimate heaven on Earth City uses the imagery of Jerusalem but it's clearly Transcendent of any Jerusalem that Israel ever experienced and Isaiah the prophet describes New Jerusalem at the place with the light of God shines and members all the nations come to the city to bear gifts so it seems
 text Matthew saying through the narrative argument that Jesus is the New Jerusalem not whole bundle of images is wrapped together with one reference in the story which is our son of Jesus never become the ultimate place where Heaven and Earth unite we're God and Humanity do all together but then jesus takes this idea a step further and he says to his followers you all are the New Jerusalem the claim that Matthew made about Jesus in the birth story Jesus is now making about himself and his followers what Jerusalem was called to be where the Nations he is claiming that he and his new blossoming kingdom of God Sell Groups are to the nation's us Jesus and the New Jerusalem I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey Tim hey John I was having drinks what neck-deep in a series of discussions about the city is that an image where like Marshall and and holding my head is up above the water and I'm waiting through or am I like an ostrich with my head in the earth up to my neck. The actual image in my mind was I've two little boys are both love to swim and they're getting better you know 911 now so they're like they can swim on the ground but for many years it was me standing right at neck level but hovering around them cuz they wanted to be deeper but sometimes they couldn't make it work and so it's awkward to be in neck deep water because you're actually kind of immobilized but you're trying to
 on your tippy toes it's just an awkward scenario so I'd be able to deposit my mind we are in an awkward place because we've been talking about the city and the theme in the Bible that God created humanity and place them in a garden plus garden and it's when we left the garden because of our Folly and violence and yeah are nearsightedness and are grasping after wisdom on our own terms it's outside of the garden the Wilderness afraid for our lives of time I came in here building the first city to protect ourselves and as you trace a story of the city in the Bible for the most part cities become this extension of our worst intentions magnifying our violence and despite our best intentions and like cities become
 emergent thing that's like multiplying our evil at a community level multiplying are good and bad but also are good and we have talked about that and then today we had to stop talking about that yeah it's good to remember it well there's not that many stories about it being City they like started creating instruments in music music and Metallurgy for you know making farming equipment and maybe some Shields helmets the point is it's not a it's not complete evil that's not complete good like humans it's a mix of good and bad so I can human and makes good and bad as humans together is a mix of good and bad that then gets multiplied as an extension of ourselves which is also our self the cities this actually this sci-fi novel called the city we become really fascinating
 sanitize New York City as always there monsters that like are an extension of the psyche and City
 you're Googling it's a really popular author denesen and teach him a lesson 2020 interesting as this idea of it like the city becomes the city is awesome in Cumming a monster that's what this book is about yeah I wonder if she realizes how like they were called she was in the same place or tendency towards good and bad gets magnified and when that happens the bad gets magnified tends to overwhelm the good and that's portraits of the city that we seen right on throughout to Duquesne Babylon Sodom and Gomorrah Assyria and even Jerusalem enters into that portrait the Jerusalem becomes a duality
 Jerusalem becomes a two-sided City so to speak with two possible Futures there's a future that God has destined for it to become the central point from which God's peace and shalom in life flows out to all the nations and All Nations will come up and do it and he referred to the poultry if Isaiah that we talked about in the last episode and this is this like almost part of me naive hope that we can like somehow have the city on the hill that will be okay but Isaiah's hope it's not that humans can create this this is something that's going to bring about yeah but isn't that what God try to do with Moses on Mount Sinai all right yeah sure sure is this what God's spirit came out on David and like made him gang member
 Hebrew Bible so unified story what it means to read it as a follower Messiah Jesus is it all these Cycles
 are pointing forward to a great need for someone to come to be the human and do what no human has been able to do and so now it's like what we need is a city that can be the city early we need the human body need the city need the city we need that human scaled up to a cosmic City it can be for the world with no given city has been so there have been more weekend is all go just Flee for the hills and just showing live a quiet life stream one thing we haven't really talked about is kind of the the back and forth between the city and the Wilderness cuz it's always in the wilderness where God takes his chosen ones to test them and kind of recreate them and then give them another
 shot it but it is interesting than going into the city then being exiled from the city back in the city iCloud of study these are part of that so when the prophets specifically Isaiah look forward to the ultimate heaven on Earth City he uses the imagery of Jerusalem but it's clearly Transcendent of any Jerusalem that Israel ever experienced the portraits of the faithful Jerusalem and then Unfaithful truthful and it's going to be purged and burned and recreated to become the New Jerusalem and that's in contrast to adjust the fully human city that is Babylon that is going to be given over to Cosmic ruin and be no more and be no more that's right so The Tale of Two Cities and those two cities Babylon and Jerusalem both Unfaithful Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem
 and Babylon just keep recycling through the Poetry of Isaiah we just touched down in chapters 12 and 13 okay in the last episode 2 recap last episode is ghost cities are corrupt one city I would like this core Remnant will remain a faithful version of itself will come and actually become a new Mountain where all the nations will then find peace the other city will just be no more that's right the God wanted to build that humans ruined he's going to purify it and make it into the Heavenly city on Earth but the human City that had its origin. Lee in the human imagination Babylon is just going to be no more.
 Tale of Two Cities so as you get into the latter chapters Isaiah whatever they want to do is that's just a touchdown and Isaiah 60 and then take all of these themes into the opening chapters of the Gospel accounts about Jesus and what we're going to see is how Jesus describes who he is and what he's doing by now sing the arrival of the kingdom of God and starting these little Jesus communities in the towns of Galilee he describes that whole little set up he's doing with the cosmic imagery of the Heavenly city has finally touchdown using primarily the language of Isaiah so we turned our attention
Isaiah 60 begins a three-part literary unit that we call Isaiah 60 61 62 to look out of Palms, beautifully designed and symmetry is in hyperlinks of course the Hebrew Bible 60 is the opening opening form of this and it opens arise Shine for your light has come
 and the glory of Yahweh has risen upon you new day yeah this is the language of day one of the seven day creation story like this one what would you like to get in at the always like he's the source is like the glory of Yahweh has risen somebody's being called upon to wake up to get up and let Yahweh is light and glory shine on you so who's the opening line just doesn't safe because look Darkness covers the land sick Darkness over the nation's salsa Genesis one but y'all way will rise on you
 and His glory will appear over you
 and all the nations will come to your light and Kings to the bright light of your Sunrise you are the light but you always like kind of keeps going back and forth stink so the idea is the kind of the default are beginning stages Darkness over the land Darkness covers of the nation-state you and then the land is set on an LG to the nation's Darkness covers the land thick Darkness covers two people but then there's always going to stay let there be light in his own glory. Is that like will be that light but then that light will become focused on you and shine upon you and then the year will become a beacon of reflection about light out to the nation's two Summits of the nations are all going to come to the light so this
 fully hyperlink back to the poem in chapter Isaiah chapter two that we read and reflect on the previous episode yes which just to recall saying that in the end of days the mountain of the House of Yahweh must eventually called Zion and Jerusalem it will be exalted as the tallest mountain and all the nations will River like a river but going uphill stream into it and Yahweh will render Justice between the mall and they'll be peace forever and ever and then probably says so come in light of that hope Israel let us walk in the light of Yahweh so not Israel needs to walk in the light so the light here is God's glory but it's also kind of like the way of Yahweh laugh it's his Torah is also the light you walk in the
 it's his wisdom so okay sorry detour Genesis 11 Genesis 1 whatever 3 let there be light what is the light right because the sun isn't created until Monday for 4 as a symbol be a reflection in her way or a hooker and a violation of of the greater light let there be light yeah we've talked about that before you kind of said you know in some ways of talking about at ordering time you know but here the imagery really feels like it's about Yahweh it's about yeah well how's the always he let there be me it's not what he means no no no no let there be light but the light in the darkness light yet so the light is yahweh's glory and wisdom so it's like let my glory and wisdom invade the darkness Head Start. They won they won look at another words is meta using
 imagery of light and dark as to describe something else non-existence non-being Miss order chaos and then I mean injected with being and existing existence and order in the grain of the universe wisdom like how things operate what may be like you know cosmologists would call just like the grand unified theory or some other things work and why that's right but like we're not talking scientifically we're talkin metaphysically it's exactly talking about like what is the grain of what is good and bad what it how does this all work this represents the thought of ancient poets and philosophers and theologians the biblical authors
 and that they're talking about the stuff that's Universal Studios human questions about the nature of reality and there is a state of order that represents a mind and a purpose that brings order and reality and we have our own human versions of that and we build stuff to be purpose and an analogy there is this great Cosmic order that we're all a part of but if you notice it tends to all just fall apart unless you constantly bring new wisdom and purpose in order to it and that intuition is filled out on a yacht metaphysical Cosmic level that there's this default of the darkness and Yahweh is the originator of all Beauty order light goodness and any light or goodness our order that we bring is because you always already shine his light on us some 36 by your light oh God
 light yeah not immature profound yeah so here Yahweh is lending his glorious light to a you
 and that you was lit up in the midst of the darkness of that all the nations want to come to be in the light of God's New Creation Sunrise is also this use it becomes part of this person who ever were talking about is their Sunrise ski play shining like figure out who the you so you lift up your eyes all around and see all of them are gathering their coming to you your sons are coming from afar your daughters are being looked after carried on the hip so it's idea of your children are returning to you you're lost children of Adam and Eve's lost children Jacobs lost children Benjamin device Joseph to Egypt will I ever see them again so it's using the imagery of children there was lost children of Noah's ya parents losing their children to tragic
 that that's all everybody is coming home now we knew that the nations were going to come but the children are the nation's exactly right okay yeah yeah this isn't like this is the universal family of humanity right now the well we'll see his you as far as kind of a specific cuz there is a specific you that has been exiled here this is Israel I've been assuming this you and your children are being carried back then you will see then you will be radiant you'll start when you start ER in this poem but you owed and more your heart will tremble and open itself wide your heart will become wide know that's scary
 well that's not open her to go but I think it's something that you have hoped for
 I like to think of it like it's a tragedy of a loss of someone you love that kind of wounding or traumatic experience I think fairly commonly closes off right because ourselves to the World Riley close ourselves to relationships cuz it's risk but when you see
 thing you never thought would ever happen the restoration of a relationship or the person you thought was dead but they're actually alive and they want to see you and they're coming it's like your heart can open again is this also perhaps a metaphor of the heart is the city gates are opening up it's going to be connected to open gate a moment shrimpling if the gates are trembling that's like an invading Army and you open the gates that's like biting a minute it's like the thing you never thought the reunions person you love that you never thought you'd hold again and your Arms This is not the Army this is a family of God, please respond and is an interesting but that's also other spots we have when we're terrified for a yeah there's a lot to meditate on their why will you be shining with your hair
 open wide the abundance of the sea will fall upon you
 The Wealth of Nations will come to you know this great notice how the waters are set on parallelism to the nation's like to see washing-up over you is that an analogy to all of the nation's bringing their abundance and honor to you so the backstory presumed here is Jerusalem was stomped on by a Syria barely rescued in the days of Hezekiah that story is told in advance and then stomped on by Babylon and not rescued you and all of its wealth plundered so this is the great inversion all the wealth that the nation's took from you will wash over you like like waves a multitude of camels is coming take like a caravan this is but a freight train your world
 an ephah from Chevy these are all the Eastern desert tribes for Israel they will bring gold and frankincense for claiming the praise of Yahweh the flocks of kedar is released in eastern try to these are also all tribes that were estranged from Israel throughout the story of the Hebrew Bible verse 11 your Gates will continually be open like your heart day and night never shot to bring you the Wealth of Nations the Kings shall be led in the children of those who oppressed you
 they will come vending low and those who disrespected you will bow down at the soles of your feet they will call you the city of Yahweh the Holy One of Israel and the sun will no longer be your light by day
 and the moon will not give you light at night Yahweh will be your eternal light and y'all will your glory the sun will not go down the moon won't Wayne Yahweh himself Superior turn the light so the Eternal this is a very poetic cuz obviously yeah I mean I don't know it's hard for me to imagine yeah like a day we're like the sun is no longer the source of light yeah but it's still around and then never said yeah that sounds like a new creation
 it sounds like a different type of creation type of creation Isaiah 65 R17 look I'm about to create a new skies and a new land
 former things won't be remembered they won't come to mind but rejoice and Shout over what I am about to create I'm about to create Jerusalem as a source of joy for people as a source of rejoicing and it goes on to talk about how in the New Jerusalem nobody's crying nobody's dying at a young age everybody gets to plant their own garden and eat the fruit the wolf and the lamb will feed like they are one the lion will eat straw like an ox vegan vny Indian Lion and the Serpent's food will be dust no more evil no more destruction on my Holy Mountain that snake dead in the dust
 easy to eat and have a drink here so notice a new creation is set on in parallelism to a New Jerusalem pretty Cosmic none of these are the passages that the source of the hope that becomes in the New Testament does it talk about in our last conversation about what Paula call the Jerusalem above where the Heavenly Jerusalem that Jerusalem and its ideal State really is it becomes equivalent with a new creation yeah because you know it was God saying to recreate having a new heavens and a new Earth then you would imagine a new Garden right that's where we're going to go cuz we had the first Garden Avenue Garden but instead the images of the New Jerusalem Jerusalem in the city that is described as a garden full of full of people who don't die
 it's full of people who have enough Gardens to eat the fruit all the animals live at peace with each other and with you and that snake just dead and dust
okay so remember when I kept talking about like what if you know what if Adam and Eve stayed in the garden they would need places to live they would need to build some infrastructure yeah this is describing their yeah that's right like I was going to have their little house and was going to be able Vineyard and everyone's hang out with animals there's not going to be evil like just describing what the Garden of Eden could have become this the Garden City but it's it's it's a city that's right so what what began as the garden that was my intuition was like hey they're going to hang out in there going to create a city there but remember City in Hebrew Bible means a walled cities of dwellings and close by walls and here very clearly the wall doesn't have Gates that are close to walls have been decommissioned decommissioned cuz the gates are always open yeah that's the idea
 so you like Wheel City still a city that's right so what God began with was the garden what humans made was the city when God restores and cecile's and redeems the whole mess all the Cycles what you end up with is not just a new garden and not just a new city it's the Garden City it's the the Fall Guy category Incorporated what humans and his brother will you guys planned for evil Yahweh is able to get into a plant for good something really important for you to say look when I say hey we would have built the city you say well you know remember in the Bible a city is a place of the wall so it seems important to you to say I need to be a reimagining of what city is provide good yes the city can be a mother said he can be an extension of ourselves that / 2
 us and those for vulnerable and brings peace and prosperity City canned and Creek culture and music and art and you know I can do all these things but the category would that we start with is another thing to be a place with a wall to keep the others out keep us safe and we'll make ourselves great we'll make our name great we will build a tower to the sky like that the category of city that we start with it when I'm saying hey imagine Adam and Eve and generations after staying in the garden they're going to build not that type of city right but they're going to build what we would call Community of town I'm happy to call the city I just the point of the city to retrain our imaginations is walls city is a series of a bunch
 dwellings encircled by a wall Isaiah 65 it's still called Jerusalem still a city it's just still has walls and so the city they are yeah that's right yes they are and they're stupid they're still using cardboard City member in the laws of the Torah about the king of Israel was to your right so God is health is they want a king will do things here but the king's is to not amass an army not a mass money and not too political marriages which is everything that are backwards can so it's sort of like four halves of forward right it's like that so you just can't you just want cities let's City different like a city like I like we've been talking about is a natural extension of what it means when a lot of humans are living two
 you can't but help sure if a hey I'm going to go and I'm going to sleep over here and here's my love Vineyard and my family's Vineyard and as yours hey but we also need to get to each other so here's a little roadway and hay when we like have a surplus let's put it all this other place okay here's some like some places to put that and we don't need that they could come and take it from here cool let's have a system for that in like your building but we would call a city that's right but not yet you're not done yet cuz then it's the but that group of people 30 miles away man they're traveling hate us and they're constantly stealing our stuff so now I got to build a wall and you're saying that's inherit to a city the word year Hebrew word e l means a walled enclosure of dwelling butt 65 to the Jerusalem Jerusalem
 exactly so it's the decommissioning of the walls in the new city I'm just trying to honor that emphasis that what you're saying is absolutely true but it wouldn't be don't have to do all the walls if you never built in the first place and you'll still have a City built by our definition of city but not by the Bible definition of City not by the definition of cities it took for granted wishes of the Hebrew word means which is a wall it's really just about what the wall represents why you need it and the fact that the Garden City is the city you know what the commission's walls and that's that's all that's the ring home for us cuz we didn't grow up in the city with walls and most people don't know but that would have been a fundamental significance to people who wrote and read this text
 so let's hold all that in mind that he has a hope of a New Jerusalem said he's going to create that new creation and New Jerusalem and recreate that new Eden and I'm pretty skeptical having read up the Isaiah of human's ability to create that on their own I can try and then get a little taste but inevitably it's going to go the way of Babylon so this hope and particularly this language and imagery found in Isaiah scroll was fundamental to how Jesus came onto the scene described himself talked about what he was doing
 though he didn't primarily use the language of City founding a new city what he said was that he was announcing and assuring in the arrival of God's Rule and Reign a kingdom kingdom the kingdom of God now it's about how Jesus and the gospel authors use this hope for the New Jerusalem New Creation new Heaven and Earth Jerusalem as inspiration to describe the significance of who Jesus was and what he was doing
so we're going to begin is with the famous story but actually it was just in the process of preparing for these conversations that will hold new thing struck me so I liked Sport with you this is Matthew Chapter 2 so this is not this is Jesus this is right after he was born in the end of chapter one and in Matthew it's Luke's account that has the shepherd the shepherd's to come and it's Matthew's account that has what would have called the the Magi of people from the East the wise men and what's interesting is you know the Magi it's late Jesus is already been born and some time has passed this is why in the Christian calendar Epiphany is 12 Days After Christmas which is celebrating the arrival of the Kings but on our Christmas cards to all been matched in 31
 so he's describing the significance of the birth of the Messiah and after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea Judea is the Greek pronunciation of Judah in the Old Testament in the days of Herod the king
 Magi from the East arrived in Jerusalem
 I will say when we read Isaiah 60 I was like oh the Magi from the East the brothers from the East, bringing their frankincense is gold an American Standard gives us a little footnote cuz what's Magi like a thawed where I ever use the foot and it's like a full little explanation a cast of wise men specializing in astronomy astrology and natural science so these were the renaissance be called by the same related title in the book of Acts Simon Mongoose for the magician and it's not a compliment in the book of Acts oh yeah he's in touch with powers of evil but it's somebody who is in touch with the Divine in some way most likely but really what we would call physical sciences astrology what we call astronomy following the patterns of the Stars
 and then doing that as communication from the gods or other types of divination yes at taking what we would come physical sciences but then embedding it with him Divine meaning that's right so these types of figures were often counselors or advisors to King but they were not themselves this is why Herod the king wants to hear what they have to say that's their job and it doesn't say it just says okay see you soon the whole We Three Kings of Orient are ya this later. I'm kind of a tradition okay well we know is a crew of ancient sorcerer astrologers to consult with Kings show up in Jerusalem from the East meaning from Syria Babylon like where those places are where is the king of the juice that has been born
 okay of the juice we saw his star in the east and we have come to worship and we cannot forget in the Greek New Testament the verb worship prospered until third word for to bow down and kneel before the worship is kind of a paraphrase cuz you can bow down and kneel for all kinds of reasons of your Legions that's what you doing but you can possibly know for other things too so we have come to bow down to him
 Herod her this and he was troubled
 yeah you can make sense and all Jerusalem with him so he gathered together the chief priests and the scribes and he enquired let's go back to the Hebrew scriptures again where is the young Messiah from line of David to be bored and they're all dudes go read Micah the new David and me Bethlehem this is all my pear face
 Sahara secretly called the Magi and he determined from an exact time they saw the star
 and he said go to Bethlehem and search for the child when you find him, tell me cuz I want to bow down to him as well so they heard the king they went their way. Do it. The star which they saw in the East went on so you've got this light this heavenly light has appeared and its guiding them but true slim the light shines in the darkness guiding them to Jerusalem and then it guides them look at the language it went on before them and it stood over the place where the child was and when they saw the star they rejoiced very much with great joy and after coming into the house they saw the child Mary's mother they fell down on the ground they found down they opened up their Treasures bringing him Gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
 so and Isaiah 60 the light is a cosmic Sunrise the light is Yahweh Yahweh is Yahweh as a sunrise yep that's right of New Creation yeah here in Matthew to the light is a star that's a pretty diminished light my skin stands on your point of is diminished in terms of the Sunrise it's sure to like medicine or you're saying hear it's ripping on this idea that the light has come so Isaiah 60 you always Glory will shine over you and Nation specifically Kings will come to the bright light of your son right okay so it's not a Sunrise it's a star but Heavenly Delights in the logic of the Genesis one-story Yahweh is the source of all light and then David and stars are an extension
 viewpoints of them as delegates symbols of his own light so the light of a star is an image of you always liked the logic okay so Isaiah 60 was all about Kings and rulers Nations coming bringing gifts this why we called Kings yes yeah so what's so cool is it in Christian tradition the Isaiah 60 hyperlinks have been so strong that they've actually changed the identity of these are a combination of Isaiah 6 + 2 + 2 into 10 since they're bowing down the nations are rejoicing so noticed What's significant here is that the star first goes over Jerusalem
 and only after talking with the current ruler Jerusalem then the star moves it leaves to respond and then it shines over the child and I think that's the really important move on Matthews part in the book of Isaiah this is the new insight you're having City to do was what's the city of God in Jerusalem Matthew has portrayed Jesus as the one over him y'all with light shines as the one to whom the nation's combining down and bringing their gifts and Isaiah saw it was designed the city of Yahweh in Matthew 2
 the light moves away from Jerusalem that's ruled by the place you're just imagining like the star of Jerusalem that makes sense and all sudden moves or where you going yeah star yeah totally what you're going to Bethlehem you're going over this house with a baby and the mountain this is the okay so it seems like Matthew saying Sue's a narrative argument in the hyperlinks that Jesus is the New Jerusalem Jesus is the New Jerusalem now I'm what sense can one person be a city
 Listen to I just want to notice a couple other things in Matthew chapter 4 after Jesus has been baptized and filled his testing in the wilderness in verse 12. Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested he went back up to the galley and that's in the region where he's from and then leaving Nazareth which was this town he went and lived in compression by the sea in the region of zebulun and naftali these are the sons of Jacob tribal inheritance areas from Israel passed
 why did you go there in order so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet to be fulfilled and what did he say now beginning of chapter 9 saying quote land is Evelyn land of Natali toward the Sea on the other side of the Jordan Galilee of the the nation's the people who sit in darkness have seen a great light and the ones who sit in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned and quote from that time on Jesus began to preach and say repent because the kingdom of the Skies has come there
 I could Sunrise but I want you to I want to hear about your heart with your processing we didn't read Isaiah 9 but this is a quote from it a great light is coming if I'm also just thinking and contacts and Isaiah 60 the great light is the new creation light shining in the darkness shining in the darkness and so Isaiah 9 is yet another palm and Isaiah that is working those themes so for Jesus just go to this region and that Matthew is pointing out this is a fulfillment of that fedak hope that the light is coming so Jesus is the light Jesus announcing the kingdom of the Skies coming near is the light appear is the Divine light shining in the darkness and I know from Isaiah 60 that light is shining over the New Jerusalem
 but he's not into some here well but yeah the light will shine in Jerusalem but as the capital of all the way and Matthews taking the imagery from Isaiah that's associated with the city from the New Jerusalem and he's applying it to the person who Jesus is doing this throughout Gala well it's remarkable that also sorry there is the thread of that there's going to be an anointed one and will come and yeah it was that he wasn't called the one but there with the banner we looked at like the manor is the king in the New Jerusalem just saying here's the thing from the line of David who's going to come and ruin the New Jerusalem in and bring us like a remarkable thing is the king's name in Isaiah in the city but the city is associated with the
 the light shines on the city near the city's exalted the nation's come to the city and that's where the king is raining but they're coming to the city and they come in the gate we are never closed right now that whole bundle of images is wrapped together with one reference in the story which is the person of Jesus of Nazareth right after that Jesus goes around and he's announcing the arrival of the kingdom of God he's healing everybody and this is the end of Matthew chapter four now large Crowds Are following him from all over chapter 5 when he saw the crowds he went up
 to the mountain and he sat down and his disciples approached him and we just read the first sentence of The Sermon on the Mount right is opening it and then we're going to sit here in this room in the mail or can I get a very clear connection to the city
so he's going to announce 9 blessings over this ragtag mostly poor group of people that come to him blessed are the poor in spirit kingdom of heaven belongs to you blessed are the unimportant the meek they will inherit the land blessed are the peacemakers it's on 9 blessings then he uses three images and he's describing the people right there you all are the Blessed ones and you are watching the kingdom of the Skies appear here on Earth right here it's happening right here and then he describes the people that he's going to call to be part of this kingdom of God crew by three images
 he calls them the salt of the land you all are the salt of the land but it's the salt loses its flavor how can it be made salty again it's useless except to be thrown out so you're the salt salt only useful if it's flavorful that's a whole rabbit we don't have time to go down because in the salt of the land then he says you are the light of the world a city that's on a hill is not able to be hidden and people don't like candles and put them in their baskets that you put them up on a candle stand to give light to everyone in the house in the same way let your light shine before people so they can see your good works and give honor to Father who is in heaven the light in the city so here he is taking the imagery of the light and now applying it to these what kind of blossoming
 communities a 60-year this beautiful image of God's light rising up and then reflecting off of people and that Reflection from those people becomes the extension of God's glory and wisdom that brings peace to the nation's and so when Jesus says you're the lights yes he's got that image in mind which is certainly why the light in the city images are bound together in the same years are up on the hell yeah this is that a like Isaiah 65 was it where was like New Creation New Jerusalem is risen upon you the Nations will come to your light is on the what GI he's at he's talking to a
 he's not talking to people who run Jerusalem just told he left the Jerusalem area to go up into the hills yeah he's out in the Hills he's out with people who are no way in any position to rule the city and he's saying that this hope of a new city that will the Nations will stream up to like you guys are that starts today so Jesus is making about himself and his followers is a bold
 old clam that is claimed that is making what Jerusalem was called to be for the Nations he is claiming that he and his new Blossom kingdom of God Sell Groups are okay and so you know we have to wrap this conversation up but will continue talking about Jesus in the city but I think here this is a big twist because I'm talking about like actually likes running cities and now Jesus is going you know that hope we have is like that desired City where we build something that's bigger than ourselves that we can can protect us and bring abundance and then the best of it feel like Cosmic righteous version of it will bring peace to all the nations like stop thinking of it in terms of an actual City if we are going to think you're going to build so how are we supposed to think of it
 now I wish we had really compact presentation of the teachings of Jesus that would show what it would be like to live in a community together as if we are, which is just started which is Matthew Chapter 5 6 and 7 of which this is the introduction knife is the manifesto of the way of that Community which is a city but it's not a city no not in the not the way humans typically think of what cities function for what is it it's a it's a family at the community and unity can ship group group of people who are not family but they live in cities in and around the city in a month as a little micro Cosmos who are more the city than the actual City alternative City
 edit City that lives by the ethic and follows the moral compass of a different way of these days if we've been building up to you what is this new creation City and the palace is in the library in the like architecture just add that it's going to be this city and the guys so you guys and how we relate to each other like that the city can we also do the palace you know what I can whatever you do like he's like okay but that thing you said to your brother yesterday and not husband and wife the just refuse to get along and work out there conflicts over finances and
 you know that guy who just won't deal with his own issues of sexual desire and it's ruining all his relationships and bright work on that and how we relate to each other to create a web of other-centered love and mutual support that goes over all the boundary lines of male and female you know I mean like all that stuff dude in Greek and when you do that do that then your light is shining you and the way that we were hoping that the New Jerusalem I wish I would become
 yeah that was for trying to get it there some story driving Jesus that would lead him not just to talk this way but then also to do the things that he did and stayed one was to start the cell communities that lived by the ethic of The Sermon on the Mount which is informed by the tour on the profits but with all the focus is on him as the focal point and the conduit of this
 new way of Being Human you or the city you were the light you were the city because centered around Jesus who is the lights in the city we can seize the city over which the light shines through thinking about cities wrong is defined by the wall in the Hebrew Bible sure the wall is for self-preservation protection and what is The Sermon on the Mount except the manifesto on how to live without that wall it feels foolish to forgive him of your enemies yeah not having a wall as foolish people will take your stuff to fences make good neighbors in Jesus's you give me a give me a coat to people will slap you and you can turn the other cheek and
 but as you do so you will start to create an alternate culture or perhaps that enemy could become a friend
 Baptist image okay well we're trying to pull a lot of meeting out of just one instead of Jesus using the metaphor of a city for this group yes but it's not just you were the light you were the city that he was not for a Bible Nerd Like Jesus is on the US-60 come to her right after Matthew just said Jesus is the New Jerusalem born in Bethlehem so
 if I was tracing this theme for the purpose of trying to be a city planner
 or a mayor right and I'm like and it's going to be a city that could be a city with God's like in Shanghai that can be peace and you get to this and you're like oh man what Jesus seems to really care about is not about what kind of streets or Transportation or what kind of what we would think a typically is going to city infrastructure he's talking about how do how do we relate to each other day today when we're wrong by each other when we are tempted by our own evil like what do we do how does God's light shine through us and it becomes of this more like ethical
 like almost like it doesn't matter where you're living it doesn't matter if you're in a city or in a suburb or in the town or in like in a small Amish community in the middle but remember this this issue of scale with the city the city is just a human scaled up
 the lots of human smooth so one human doesn't need like a transit system you just need like a horse Sarah whatever a bike in my case for a car but you got a million humans and you need transit system how should the system be designed what are the priorities in the values guiding how we make it what neighborhood will it serve what neighborhoods will not serve but that's not what you was talking about he doesn't he's not like and I guess what he's talking about is
 how to create a small community that shaped people's character and their their values and moral values the priorities their view of what's good and bad and if one of those people happen to be a mayor The Sermon on the Mount will shape every decision that makes you about how to help design the transit system right so I guess it's Jesus Jesus wasn't talking to me or is he was talking to a bunch of poor people up in Galilee to about these little communities but the moral ethical worldview underneath it the moral compass
 clearly and transcend first-century Galilee and speak to people all over the world cuz these teachings have been doing that for you know 2,000 years so I appreciate your questions in this imagine if exercised well and so also I think I should be sad I think there's a point here which is Jesus his Focus isn't on Jerusalem it would make sense of Jesus like he does go to Jerusalem so he does have a focus on Jerusalem talk about in the next conversation when like he is talking when he starts talking about God kingdom coming and starting it's like outside of Jerusalem and its and no way the glory of any City it's just a ragtag group of people surprise the surprise blessing
 blessed are the poor in spirit the kingdom of the Skies belongs to them it's right here it's happening right here cuz it's going to become clear to Jesus that current day Jerusalem is ruled by the dogs and the real nutraslim is happening right here in the Hills wherever Jesus is
 you got the city on a hill shining it's light to the nation's I think the claim that the gospel authors in Jesus make we're going to see what Jesus goes on to do with that claimed as narrated in the gospels in the next conversation but I think that's just a few questions these are all the questions get raised and they're good. Meditate on I think before we watch Jesus go to Jerusalem in Throwdown which becomes another Tale of Two Cities in the city that is Jesus versus the city's Western Sizzlin thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're hit pause in before we progressed farther into the New Testament we're going to review the themes and ideas we've explored so far try to tie them all together today's episode is brought to you by our podcast team producer Cooper Peltz associate producer Lyndsay Ponder
