there's a lot of strange phrases in the Bible is an ancient book written in the ancient language with one phrase in particular is both very familiar sounding and also when you think about it actually quite odd this phrase is the son of man if you're like me you heard this phrase many times but don't actually know what it means an interesting Lee Jesus never consciously used the phrase Messiah to describe himself the one term he consistently used to describe himself was the son of his a human the son of man from John Collins and this is the Bible project podcast we've been walking through a series on the complex identity of God in the Bible how the biblical authors wrestle with the Paradox of being able to relate to a Transcendent unrelatable God when God Appears to us how do we
 it's at 10 today we're going to look at one way that happens in the Hebrew scriptures with the character called the son of man has a dream that Daniel has about a figure called the Ancient of Days and the son of man is arguably one of the most important Old Testament text understand Jesus himself so what was Daniel's Vision all about and why did Jesus identify with this character all that and more on today's episode thanks for joining us here we go
 all right we've been talking about God and God's identity describe when I've been thinking about this everything cuz you just a word for making a video about God I could be about so so much we want the video to help bring Clarity to is the identity of the unique identity which is yeah I guess an English that's a way of talking about the specific profile yeah but what does that mean to have an identity I was wondering if that's how we start video Anjali like your human yes and you have an identity as a human you are one humans are not more than one human you know but you're also likes makeup combinations of their temperaments sometimes you don't feel like yourself but the sense of having an identity
 comes from our own experience as humans having an identity and then we have to then we assume well if there's some Divine being he must have an identity like we understand identity and so I think what we're trying to do is go well let's set that aside for a second let's talk about how the Bible talks about God's identity correct and it's going to actually blow some categories in your mind they're going to be difficult to appreciate it because they don't always have a precise analogy to our human experience of identity tell him cuz the word out with him which could translate it as God the word by itself doesn't refer to any particular beings identity being a spiritual being so to use the word God doesn't mean you're referring to any means yeah in Hebrew and English refers to any number of
 beings with different identities so this videos about the depiction of the god of the Bible's Yahweh died in his identity real Jesus said he was in body and in revealing his identity so how can we understand the identity of a being that is beyond us trance send it to us he right and really the only way we can do that is to look at how God and Rex with us write the story the Bible is the story of God interacting revealing working in through Human season human history we were trying to understand the identity of an alien my grace and I'm pretty sure there's this alien race out there if we want to understand it we can't go up to their planet and study them is right we only know about them what they communicate communicate or what we can observe
 my interactions with them yes for my directions yes so we have two then look at the interactions ago what can we then two Deuce about those observations will be tentative or they won't be complete a comprehensive yeah cuz we can't claim whatever the alien says do us in the first conversation we can't claim to their for know their whole language and everything yeah remember arrival he hasn't actually do the very thing that was in my head in your head what the first meeting scene when they meet the octopods I forget about that movie or what where it connects is that the humans come in with an assumption of here's how language works right yes and they have to unlearn how language they understand words and language in order to appreciate y'all this alien species understands where the language that they have to unlearn their concept of time
 these are two categories that we just do you understand based of our own Human Experience earn in order to understand our perception of reality is bound by certain guardrails how our brains are wired to understand and thrive in the world we live in which means we need to understand time as unfold sequentially and we need to understand language the way we use it correct the unique thing about this particular God's identity is what the scriptures claimed to be doing is revealing that got the identity in there to sequence but each of those narratives is depicting a facet about God's character identity and then the challenge is to synthesize it and put it all together what we're going to try and do it will actually end it all culminates the claim at least of the followers of Jesus is that in the life of Jesus
 see the most perfect expression of God's identity that is both continuous and consistent with everything that came before in the story but that also kicks it up onto a whole new level. That's what this was this video to to do you think it's helpful to talk about how we need to deconstruct idea of personhood maybe a little bit or is that just come to after I just thinking in terms of like in a rival they had to deconstruct their perspective of time and language I mean I take page one of the Bible's doing that already when it depicts God is a complex being already on page one I forget what previous episode we talked about the complex portrayal of God in Genesis 1 of God present in the world by means of the spirit of God making things happen in the world by means of the word of God and then when
 appoint a creature that will image and represent this complex God in the world it's a being that is one and two interesting is one to Adam human Adam usually translate as just man in Genesis 1 the word Manuel we've talked about this before for some English speakers that means male human brothers that means Humanity in pieces on page one it doesn't refer to the singularity did Humanity in our image okay so it's one creature you read that sentence you go a one creature Humanity or it's a race of creatures let's make one of them human human in our image to represent the Divine and then what is the concrete representation that Adam is its mail
 female interesting so you're saying there's a there's more complexity even in human identities and we appreciate that is constituted by two others that are one and two at the same time so there's something going on already with the conflict between a love God and the notion of what humans are where one that consists of many others and our Identity or purpose our destiny is all bound up about how we relate to each other and our common store here on the flying space so yes already but even the concept of human identity is our categories more complex Unity that reflects a complex community of God's Own identity so yes there people Christian philosophers and theologians and non-religious who talk about the stuff that's the nature of human identity it's not simple
 all right so we've been talking for nearly ten hours about this stuff and we're not helping every time we start talking rabbit trails that are interesting to us some of the conclusions from haven't gone through all this every Bible text is that God is other he's Beyond us the fancy word for that is transcendent and how do you understand something that's beyond you how do you connect something's be unto you is actually impossible that's an impossibility if it's beyond you it's beyond you but then at the same time this God of the Bible Yahweh does interact with us yes that's how can that be how can a Transcendent being whose other also be with yes and that's a paradox yeah it's a balance beam that's a Biblical authors are walking on I don't think they received it as a balance beam
 modern people tend to see these as opposites for them is just these are both things that are true God is Holy other and he's committed to being present within and working through his creation and so the way is that God is present working with then we explored all those categories sometimes through human agents some they're just normal and flawed or David sometimes they're flawed but more than normal above normal like a Moses figure whose becomes this like salted supercharged that's from the human image bearing side that becomes truly the Human images that God made them to be as a way for God to interact with us on page one of the Bible that the whole design of this thing is that God's Will and purposes in the world that worked out so just threw it threw his human and make sure I understand this then we're saying in order to understand God's identity we have to look
 how he interacts with us it's the only Clues we have the first and primary way that we understand he interacts with us by making us his actually I help us to bear his image and be his moral agents to continue the work of creation and so that the image of God so what can we learn from the image of God about God they got it yeah right look at the image and you see a complex Unity that is one and more than one that's interesting it is yeah it's been my brain for years now and I'm still makes me ponder that and then we see that there's a problem in that we are incapable doing this well but you get this picture of Moses reflecting God's image in such a way that God is interacting with the world through Moses yes in a way that Moses and you
 Highway become like connected really close really close and it gives us the Hope For Humanity to be that way maybe another human who can do what Moses did but then not screw up in the end yeah that's basically the human image Brewing side reflecting the Divine then there's a whole category that we talked about of attributes or representations of the messenger of God that unlike Moses actually seem to be merged into Yahoo his own identity so the angel of the Lord and then God's word Spirit wisdom and so on that these are attributes of God that are also treated as distinct from God and actually have a quote here, that's a Persian a Persian biblical scholar cool
 I'm going to try on some of this work later on this the descriptions about God's spirit in the New Testament and how they relate in my pond to Spirit in the Hebrew Bible is the sun rising in a chapter on the spirit in the Hebrew Bible and he says for biblical authors Yahweh cannot be reduced to any one of the manifestations of his presents he gives examples like his word spirit in his wisdom the angel of the Lord Yaweh is not completely identified with anyone at this is but rather he's dynamically related Yahweh is the spirit insofar as it's him self relating to Creation this is why the biblical authors prefer to speak of Yahweh Spirit or arm or Glory or word rather than refer to God himself in a more direct way by adopting this procedure has managed to both Express the objective reality this is God
 in contact with his creation but at the same time they're maintaining the God himself is always greater than any specific Act of revealing himself I think what I'm understanding by this is that God is so wholly transcended that it becomes an impossibility to really interactive God except for the fact that it's not impossible so what does that mean right it means that somehow. Able to bridge that Gap but when he does what does that mean about God's identity when we experienced bridging that Gap are we Experiencing God as a holy is and it sounds like what mehrdad Fateh he is saying is that you're not Experiencing God I see holy is you are what you say you are experiencing God but you are experiencing God in that specific context of how he's interacting with you how he's mad so that's why the biblical authors aren't saying
 you're experiencing God you're experiencing God's glory because that's the contacts God's armor goddamn spirit and spirit being specifically a context when he's interacting with creation that's how we understand that correct and so to bridge this kind of paradox of transcendence in Eminence you need to also then have this complexity in the way that God's identity is revealed to us and not it could come and be present in a certain form that's not fully him but it is him fully somehow the analogy of God's image on page one if a male human enters the rim truck you could say was Humanity present in the room yes it was a human in the room
 but is that the whole of humans constituted by their whole identity in the room will know you're missing 50% humanity is a really complex whole male and female but to have a male or female in the room by themselves is still to have human in the room now I think there's even a bit of a difference right in that one gods in the room and some form say the glory of God's in the room that is fully God and God can fully interact and there's not a sense that he is also absent in some way like in the same way that the email was absent and you know the Divine glory is going to show up the clouds on fire but even he says listen I know you do well in the heavens and permit all creation and you don't really
 not bound to this building but in the same breath you sing but you are really here and your glory is here and it's really you really you think so yeah and I think just as physical creatures Bound by the terms of our hardware and our bodies this is one of those category breaking things where the Bible's claiming to be describing a Transcendent being who isn't Bound by the same types of limitations but who chooses to take them on yeah which is the Jesus part of the group The Gap so cool I think that catches up so here's a couple things then we're trying to summarize the Hebrew Bible's depiction of God's identity all of this is happening in the centuries before Jesus all of this conversation about human figures who come close to looking like God's character like a Moses, Moses given his physical body begins to change cuz of his proximity
 and then you have all of these exalted Angels right angel of Yahweh who is that it's lots of Jewish literature before Jesus the exploring that what's the different proposals were made in different Jewish groups and so on but the point is is that all of that diversity and awareness of a complex Unity of the god of Israel is all like that's just normal Judaism it's not polytheism right it's monotheism yeah it's the one God of Israel at the complex monotheism the trying to reckon with the portrait of God's identity just like we are and when they want to emphasize that the uniqueness of their God of other gods to say is one God but when they want to talk about his actual identity it becomes a little bit more complex and there's one particular story in the Hebrew Bible it comes from one of the latest
 books of the Hebrew Bible that became kind of like the key text that brought together this idea holding a space for god's complex Unity
in the Book of Daniel chapter 7 say dream that Daniel has about a figure called the Ancient of Days and the son of man because I've never understood what that man means maybe we can get there is mind-blowing I tried to summarize the design of the book and the design of the books actually really important for understanding the Central Perk the symmetry of the stories that's right yeah so Daniels taken captive is exiled Babylon he's from the line of David he becomes a servant to the government of Babylon in Chapter 2 the king of Babylon has this dream about the history of human kingdoms Empires specifically and what is the thing that you season the stream it's a human image huge human.
 made up of all these different parts and materials and the whole thing is it yeah this is like the sequence of human Empires throughout history and then comes in this flying Rock I say meteorite the flying Rock and it's the symbol for God's Rule and Kingdom and because humans are corrupt their image Rock from the other a rock from the other and it shatters human kingdoms and then grows into this mountain that is God's kingdom over all the world so let's Danielle was able to understand what did the king do in the next chapter he wants to kill him what time does the next chapter is he builds a gigantic image of representing his particular Empire yeah the to follow right after another it's great as his dream of a huge image
 the nation's image didn't report him in the dream it represented the right at the top of the head of gold and then the rest of the body is the Empire's to follow for this is all keyed into Genesis 1 the image and ruling because humans are meant to rule as the image but what the story is about is about a human so intoxicated with his own status and power that he is making himself the image and making himself the object of worship so he wants to rule by making every other creature worship him instead of it right like a mirror recognizing I'm just a mirror like Moses if you see I Lori coming from me it's actually derivative
 so that's screwed up and Daniel and his friends like they want their manasi us and so they don't do you know the fiery furnace and that whole think you should just important they're thrown into the fire and then the rescue from the fire so then you get to stories about that King and his father exalt themselves and God says listen you guys are done for if you don't humble yourself and repent and the king of Babylon ends up turning into a beast so he's reduced from being an image to becoming an animal so it's all been ripping off Genesis one the humans are made to rule the animals that's God's image but when they make themselves into God they actually become when humans make themselves. They behave like this so profound super dangerous okay so then Daniel is called to pray to the king of the empire
 is this the king is God a different ways of exploring how humans make themselves into God and Daniel won't do it and so this time he's not thrown into the fire he's thrown into the pit of beasts and alliances and that's all the story about the whole sequence of creatures fantastic terrible creatures bears and leopards but they're all kind of some of them are multiform creatures Leopard with wings and so on but there's four of them just like there were four parts to the King statue sequence of for Empires and the fourth one is the most terrible it's not a need to be Steve ever since it's the super beast and what are you doing is trampling on the holy ones of God the Saints is how it's often translated the holy ones of God here this is where this
 the dream pics up so the forest super beast trampoline and then Daniel says in his dream I kept looking until Thrones we're set up it's like the heavens are revealed he's able to see what's going on here like the power stroke of it's like peeling back the curtain to see Command Center many Thrones yeah so he have been looking at human history and what he sees is human Empires all of slaughtering each other and then there's one big super Empire that's like the crazy beast and then he looks up and he sees heaven the heavenlies around Rim revealed and what he sees ya first of all plural Thrones we've never seen that picture so there's just one thrown up there there's one Ark of the Covenant in the temple is a symbol of the Divine throne and then when that gets politically described as God raining above
 21 throne throne Thrones has multiple G so then the next thing is is the Ancient of Days which is turn the phrase for the Eternal one took his seat so one of the thrones is not filled and what do you look like clothing with glowing white snow his hair was like wool the throne was on fire its wheels so it's a mobile mobile phone like what is Ezekiel Saw the guy. Throne. But then a river of fire is Flowing out of it okay so I think this is all connected to Temple imagery and Garden of Eden imagery if we're having an earth meet together this is the place of God's throne and then the human round the Garden of Eden then out of that round part of the rivers
 the four rivers yes so now the Heavenly throne room is meeting Earth to bring Justice on the horrific violent history of humanity and so now it's not a River of Life the river the river of fire to consume human evil. Standing there attending him that's the Divine council do all of the beings look up for him the courts that books were opened to the court saying yes it's turned into a fine courtroom a Divine Royal Throne courtroom
 yeah Bible okay so notice what's unresolved is the first thing we were told is I saw multiple Thrones yeah so what are those so yeah I've been taken and we know now is to summon all of creation to the final Divine justice so what happens from here is that the super beast is summoned and then killed and thrown into the Flames Before the Throne the super beast who is just the crazy and automation of all the Beast into God and therefore behave like beasts that Vision image is bringing together all of the narrative ideas from the first half of the book of danburite that one's Humanity acts on their own apart from God with their own knowledge of Good and Evil and demand worship for themselves rather than worshiping God they become beasts and that's what these human
 buyers have become the translator that religious language into Political language sure is that when human beings Elevate their own particular cultures and values economic and political systems as if they derive from a Divine source and demand Allegiance ultimate Allegiance as if you're worshipping a. Yeah and when humans treat themselves and they're not pretty but it's terrible humans actually become animals claim being made here it's so profound diagnosis of what motivates human beings to act like animals towards each other and then why do we do such cruel things to each other
 yesterday and it was religious economic political ideologies that were treated as Divine truth and in the name of those we need to get rid of a whole bunch of humans who aren't on the same team if that's what we're talking about and so the Creator who views all of this is beastly Behavior are not human behavior comes to bring Justice to it so the super beast is the calls going to go called for what it is and it's consumed so the super beast being thrown into the fire is the equivalent of the meteorite hitting the tattoo in the King's dream O The Rock Says remember the statue in the house are related it's the same idea that God's kingdom Injustice always coming from front and she's confronting yeah Kingdom suits Rock shattering okay or in this case a beast represent like all of the beasts yes it is in the same way the statue representing all the empires and
 judgment against wrecked that's right awesome so we think yay hooray but what that doesn't do is deal with all of the innocent blood that's been shed by the Beast trampling on as it goes about building at Empire so division goes on I kept looking in the night visions
 and behold with the Clouds Of Heaven one like a son of a human in Aramaic of queso at the bar on the American equivalent of Adam son of a human was coming cause we've already talked about this phrase son of one of the kind one of the kind that literally having parented or birth to or like yeah the sons of God aren't ya God's babies right they are beings who are of the class of being despised by the class of Elohim Yahweh of human is human human and
 he's riding the clouds on man this is all this is a hyperlink to about four other passages where is Yahweh is called the cloud Rider and it's a way of describing God is Sovereign and providential over all of history including whether Cloud Rider who's riding the cloud and all these everywhere else you search out this image in the Old Testament it's very specific image of his Royal sovereignty
 but here who's riding Cloud the human the human and where is he riding the cloud to to the throat yes he's not riding a cloud from Heaven to Earth this isn't like his two special Transportation vehicle rather he rides the symbol of divinity Vines around real well look like he does the human comes up to the Ancients of days and was presented before him so imagine the scene where I figured brought up to the divine's from
 and then what's granted to this human to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom that all the peoples and Nations and languages might literally bow down to him in humans his Dominion isn't every Journal Dominion it will never pass away and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed by human is brought up and where you going to see in the vision is that this human represents the faithful ones of God's people who have been trampled by the super beast the murder is this the persecuted ones who endured the evil and violence of the super faced and this humans one is brought up and presented to God and then God gives this
 human a share in God's Own Divine rule so in a way we're just going okay that's what Genesis to was all about okay that humans share in God's rule yeah yeah so in one sense because it's what's happening isn't it it's an image human human image of God yeah we got this that's right you're going to rule and it's never going to end yes what does vision saying but God's God's purpose to rule the world through humans is going to 68 and the super beasts and babylon's of this world can't stop the divine plan but this particular human is not just described as ruling on God's behalf do you see it's to this human is given God's own dominion the Divine Glory the Divine Kingdom and then all the nations are called to do to the human figure
 Nebuchadnezzar wanted all the nations in languages to do to his image and it's almost like an earlier in the Book of Daniel when you get to the point of him being elevated you're like oh sweet image of God come and get be the new Humanity but then all of a sudden you're like wait a second who is this guy he's in God's glory. He's being asked to be worshipped which is like we've clearly no that's not a human Elevate themselves to be the image of the Divine and call all creation and they're all people to worship himself that's what Babylon did earlier in the Book of Daniel that was a Dollar Tree but now God's elevating God's elevating a human from suffering and in God's prerogative he elevates this suffering Vindicated human to the place that Nebuchadnezzar
 for himself except now he legitimately shares in Divine Rule and he is worshipped he is worshipped as part of God's Own identity what does that unless it's God's will that people worshipped this son of a human as a means of worshiping him and then it goes on to the ending his first commandment you can see why this text generated an enormous amount of discussion in the period before Jesus and then this is arguably one of the most important Old Testament text understand Jesus himself never consciously you used the phrase Messiah to describe himself King because the king word the one term he consistently use to describe himself was the son of his a human son of man to send a man
 and this will see you on this passage to describe what he thought he was up to me and quoting from this passage to describe himself is what got him killed at his trial before the Jewish religious leaders yeah it's kind of crazy for a human to think that they're this human it's right to elevate a human such as that human becomes an expression of God's Own identity and Rule and Glory over the world but that God's the one who does the cement doesn't call themselves they are brought up by God and given the status
So Daniel 7 is just sitting there in the Hebrew Bible and in Jewish culture and once again it generates a lot of speculation about who this figure is
 but there you go and it's breaking the category cuz it's almost like never Moses a send-up Mount Sinai the cloud and it away he is sharing God's glory and in a way God is using him to rule but if Moses came down so cool now you can worship Me In My Kingdom yeah it doesn't sound like the way it was supposed to go down I would have doubted been without breaking the first commandment correct that would have been bad yeah remember that binary view of reality even though and make himself now and within creation humans can't themselves Elevate themselves above the boundary line but now if God would have in Exodus at this point said no we're too many other gods before me except for Moses because he can worship Moses by extension you're worshipping me is that what we're talking about here
 that would be the equivalent and you want to have crazy there's first century BC work called the something of Ezekiel of it's over from a Jewish author was writing a whole series of biblical commentary type stories though and he actually has figure having a dream about Moses being exhausted to the Divine Throne retells the dream of Daniel Moses in there on the throne besides God so that tells us gives us one person who is trying to make sense of all of this and put it together right and so he put it as Moses was actually a human expression of the god of Israel so he went that far to make that claim about Moses so he is but he's saying about Moses what Christians say about Jesus correct that's exactly right now dealing with the same passage correct they don't see themselves
 talking in this way right as it turns out the god of Israel complex identity is such that there is a human who is the embodiment an expression of God's Own identity in creation then so be it but apparently how the god of Israel rolls and once I get to all of this to say this is the contacts into which Jesus comes doing and saying the things that he does this is the context in which the apostles talk the way they do about Jesus and it's not a foreign in position of your later Greek philosophy or Trinity back onto it's not some kind of like well we kind of hit herself in a corner here let's just split gotten the three Divine complexity Divine complexity three and one is a thoroughly Jewish idea rooted both and the storyline of God's identity in the
 Hebrew scriptures and combined with the unique story of Jesus and the church has experience of the spirit at Pentecost all bound together into one now the Jewish Hebrew perspective of the Divine complexity wasn't necessarily three-in-one know it won't make like there was many the glory the name I mean if you counted them all like a dozen or something correct so three in one becomes more of a estimate or something yeah what the New Testament authors are going to go on to do is use every single one of these categories to describe Jesus car except one thing that one gets a little bit of scared it does but in a in a different way so they're going to use the Old Testament language about God's word God's wisdom God's glory the angel
 the physical human expression of Yahweh like the angel of Yahweh and the son of man all these are going to get ya can find into Jesus language about Jesus because his literary fiction like Jesus was a real person and they use all this language to describe this real person then what happened is Pentecost which was viewed as an equally powerful revelation of the god revealed himself in Jesus that God through Jesus has come among us through Pentecost in a powerful new way and then that forms like that third category of Christian description of God is that it's the spirit they describe the spirit to Gees Spirits relationship to Jesus be described in the same language is the Old Testament description of the spirit of God so as the spirit is to God in the Old Testament.
 and got Spirit that's also scared of passages where they just use the two interchangeably and in Jesus spirit and it's just the spirit and then there is the spirit talking and acting as one who is distinct from which we now have a category 4 so yeah if you think about it it says if the Hebrew Bible gives you two part category multi-part Bible gives you the category of God's complexity and that you can interact with him and that he has an identity that's distinct from himself but also fully himself or is himself and we'll see how many forms but the one that becomes the most Vivid and kind of you know just in your face is the Son of Man one and he was like where it's
 so crazy that Jewish authors later we're like oh maybe this was Moses you know that cuz there's some human who seems to be connected to God who is like shares in God's Divinity and so you have the category of God's complexity and you have the category of a human being connected to God's identity and you have this hope that there will be a human who can do that that's the hope of Genesis to that's a hooker Moses a logic of the biblical story logic of the biblical story that that will eventually happen and so that all then culminates in Jesus called himself the son of man and so all that complexity it's boiled down to Jesus and so now the question is why don't we just have a city is summed up nicely and its relationship with the father and son and a bind a Terry ism
 that would be great except for there's something that's also distinct from Jesus and it stinks from the father that is also God and that is the spirit especially as it comes of Pentecost and so is that God as well and if so it's not just Jesus in a disembodied form correct to Nelson week we have three parts correct yeah so it's it's not like the apostles are these Jewish Bible nerds sit around thinking about this and then finally get it it's Jesus it's more like Jesus happens to these people and then was Jesus himself and the apostles are now trying to find language to capture who Jesus was in the way you say language in the the categories in a way but that also somewhat breaks the categories but Daniel
 didn't seem to break Daniel 773 the ceiling so that was historical event that brought them to the new awareness about the identity and then cause them to go back to see the Hebrew scripture is all around him but there was another historical event that there is a Jesus followers experienced that had the same type of shattering and rebuilding a fact and that was the spirits present coming up on that really Jesus followers
 and then as they go on to describe that experience how they describe it is as the invisible energizing personal presence of the Divine with us and who is the Divine the Divine is Yahweh and the son of man Jesus who are the one God then he come and so then you get the Father the Son and the spirit someone argue that Jesus being elevated to Divinity is different than Jesus having always been Divine yes and so that's another category that seems to have busted out in the New Testament or so John the gospel he was with God in the beginning it's right one because in Daniel 7 you don't know that the son of man was with God from the beginning correct that's correct that's right yeah and Daniel 7
 human elevated to share in and participate in Gossip kind of person that just like elevated to yes yes but you've got the whole Hebrew Bible which is also depicting all of these other figures and personified Divine attributes so what the apostles are doing is combining human one reaching up the Moses that human merging with god with these Divine attributes that are like Gods as self-aware the spirit is wisdom and they're using all of that combining it into one figure that is Jesus the Risen Jesus is very clear that they don't think Jesus was just an ordinary human that got elevated although that has been of you with in Christian history that keeps resurfacing and usually it's from people only reading Matthew Market
 without John and then not being aware of this Dynamic happening within the Hebrew Bible and so if you just read Matthew Mark Luke Jesus is just an awesome he's a man who's elevated the place of of like the best human connected to the Divine enlightened that's right whatever you want to say that reading you also have to suppress all this other stuff going on to Matthew Mark and Luke but seems to be claiming more about Jesus than just that as well as all the other things going on in the New Testament so there you go we kind of talked about it all
 we didn't package right there what are we doing going to all the details into different parts of the New Testament and just see this thing unfold great thank you for listening to this episode of The Bible project podcast if you've been enjoying the podcast we'd love to hear it one great way you could do that is to leave a review on iTunes or whatever service you use by leaving a review you get this podcast in front of a lot more people would you do if you enjoyed this particular podcast episode you'll also be interested in our sister podcast it's exploring my strange Bible a collection of pins teachings and sermons over the years he's got a great series on the Book of Daniel that you can find that and finally a quick note that Jewish source that Tim was referring to in the show he called it the something something of Ezekiel is kind of hard to hear it to work by Ezekiel the tragedy in and called exit God that's the least I Tim told me to print outfit
