hi this is Dina Bible project and before we get into the Days episode we wanted to give a quick content morning Miss episode Tim and John start by summarizing the themes from our previous episode and this may be triggering because it includes mention of rape and sexual assault so if you prefer to skip over this part you can skip ahead to the wrestler episode that starts about the 10:55 Mark also later in the episode Tim and John briefly discuss the sexual assault accusation that Potiphar's wife brings against Joseph that's it thanks so much for the show
 our last episode was a heavy one we talked about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah God's judgment against oppression and Injustice it's a low point in the story The Bible it's a low point in the theme from the city but today we turn a corner and look at the first positive example of a city in the Bible and it's not Jerusalem it's Egypt specifically Egypt under Joseph charged who turned the city into a food bank to feed the world in a time of famine under the leadership of a wise even image of God cities can become Storehouse is life so the first Redemptive positive portrait of a human City this positive moment unfortunately does not last long we very quickly go from this era of abundance and white leadership and it turns if you flip from Genesis and exodus so it good to celebrate the good moments but it's also good to recognize how fragile it all
 Bellator pharaoh who doesn't know about Joseph and slaves Joseph's ancestors he brutally puts them to work forcing them to build none other than door houses and cities the storehouse is that Joseph ordered to be bailed led to life and now here's the storage cities that this Pharaoh orders to be built and it leads to the death placement of God's chosen one so now the supply storage is for the benefit of 1 people in one city at the expensive too many today and I discussed the city of ancient Egypt under the leadership of Joseph and John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey Sean hey we ended our last conversation in a really dark place pretty low moment in the depiction of human nature and we've been tracing the name of the city and where that lettuce is two then look at the narratives of of a very Infamous City in the Bible is Sodom and Gomorrah and Sodom and Gomorrah as you've said becomes a picture icon of what's wrong with humans when they get together and cities near alongside Babylon Sodom is one of the worst cities in the Bible Babylon Sodom first and second place over and over at work shopping how do we get through this thing that's what these conversations anymore so often we can start over and we just say okay how did we get here how much are really quick just to kind of Workshop
 when God and humans are together at the beginning of the Bible the idea that heaven and Earth are together that humanity and God can work together to rule creation there's a union is Union of God in man and the setting of that is in a garden in a high place and it's a picture of a type of Sikh temple place and when the city is introduced in the story of the Bible it's when Humanity had been exiled from that place and that the generation after Adam and Eve Cain and Abel we see Cain kill his brother get banished further from the garden and decide I need to protect myself by building a wall at a city and then we learn about Kansas City in the generations that followed that a lot of like Innovation is coming out of the city
 allergy metalsmithing art and music and an animal domestication the Seventh Generation Seventh Generation from Adam out of this character named Lemak we don't learn about a lot about him but his name means let's name is King backwards yeah he's like the distorted King distorted King upside-down can't and he takes Wives has two wives and he has his murderous song saying like I get to kill people and you get to deal with it if God protected Kane which God said he would protect Kane then God will like Avenged me no matter how murderous I am so you just get this picture of like whoa where did that guy get there yeah all the sudden this guy is like drunk with power and violence see how did Humanity all the sudden get there and it's happening in the city and then we get this or the flood which I guess you kind of are imagining that
 whole land is full of come limit kind of people limit type people living in limit type cities ologies you get this one of the sons of Noah Hughes Rascal Rascal he threw his line comes like all the bad guys of the story The Bible so with the line of ham in a pan from whom, Nimrod builds Babylon and then I Syria but then there is another son born of ham that leads down to the birth of Egypt which is going to be relevant for the conversation that we have today okay so both Olive Garden. Cities in the Bible come from one of Noah's sons and he's the son who's he's a sneaky son to snaky son and you're just like me and cities in the Bible
 they're just no good even if it like little bits of good come out like it just corrupt people and it just destroys things and then you get the story of Abraham and he doesn't live in the city he was out in the hills and he's the righteous one that God's going to choose where God's going to use his family to restore what was lost and crush the evil and bless the Nations and then we get a story of Abraham's nephew lot who's hanging out with Abraham in the Hills they have a conversation about there's not enough room out here for both of us spread out a lot goes east to a place that looks like the Garden of Eden
 with a city and there's a city in there there's a number of cities yet number cities one of them called said he goes and he's like I'm a city boy and the city just ruined him well and it was interesting this is the last conversation we just had when he encounters visitors is very generous and hospitable Uncle generous you must be a righteous guy about then when the men of Sodom come and they want to bring the two men who actually Angels out in the city square and getting rape them what's good and his eyes is to say no actually write my daughters instead and the whole scene is just one distorted more like how did you get there locked like how did you get to that conclusion
 for too long you think the bad is good and good as bad and so do the people of Sodom and that it's a limit kind of like moved or just like where did you get the idea that good that would be a solution to this crisis and so I guess what we're saying is the setting of the city is the setting that seems to just corrupt or even just like hyper-inflated The Human Condition to do the cane kind of move that which is to let sin come in and just take over to the point where you're like you know I'll be good I'm going to kill my brother Stewart's your sense of right and wrong and so fastidious man burn them down in today's conversation is the first positive portrait of a city in the storyline of Genesis so you have to read you know 40 + chapters in before you get
 something good about a city so we followed the city to the bottom and we're just I'm just trying to honor the fact that these are the cities mentioned in the first goal of the Bible and they're all hyperlink to each other and it's all bad up through Sodom Gomorrah so you walk away after Sodom and Gomorrah get you know toasted my fire from the skies and you like man those cities are done done with cities let's just can anything good come out of a city can we all just be shepherds in the hill I guess the Garden it is all about the garden there's no City involved in God's future for the human story you think that I feel about walking away from the story of Sodom or so you followed the story through the rest of Abraham's life he dies in Genesis 25 but he's giving birth to a son with his wife Sarah
 and Isaac like his father is a traveling migrant herdsmen and he never enter cities except for one time where he does exactly what father did which is lie about his wife puts her in danger in the replay of the Sun that happens in a city happens in city city of Carrara so got bailed him out of that situation and Isaac goes on with his wife to have two sons Jacob Nissan they're all still living out in the fields in the wilderness migrating around cities but never living in them one of the sons Jacob has 12 sons and a daughter and that's where we're going to pick up the story care
so Joseph story well-known story we've talked about it many times over the years so I'll just summarize real quick to get to the next city that's mentioned in the story The Bible because it's not in the land promised to Abraham it's a city down in Egypt really interesting so the Joseph story you could say I was one Big Arc you can summarize it pretty simply Jacob's second youngest son Joseph has many many sons second youngest son is Joseph and he loved him the most is in the famous Technicolor Dreamcoat and that'll make a colored many colors and that son has dreams to dreams about being elevated to become a ruler over all the members of his family and even over the star sun and moon like Cosmic ruler and his brothers don't like that at all. So they're jealous and they first planned to murder him what they want to do
 instead they throw them in the pit and then sell him as a slave to go down in Egypt and then they take the coat and dip it in the blood of a goat to trick their dad to think that he's been killed by a wild animal, Innovation on the Cain and Abel has riddled with language from the Cain and Abel story yeah cuz it's the blood of a goat that cries out so speaking to the Father the stories are amazing so anyhow you follow Joseph down to Egypt Egypt we've been in Egypt a few times in the store as soon as narrative so far Abraham goes down there if not associated with anything good yeah because it's Exile it's far away from the land that God promised for the family and some meditating on the Bible reading it over and over and over he just going to be the place that enslaves and oppresses Israel this whole story is the long complicated set of events for how they got to Egypt in the first place so Joseph was the first
 who is down there imprisoned but then he becomes the chief slave in the house of a Egyptian official but then there's a deceptive wife that tries to trick him and have sex with him and he wants and he ends up getting accused by her of trying to rape her and then he ends up an actual person so low point so he's gone from dreaming about being the cosmic ruler had hurled the now being set up by his brother slave in Egypt now in a prison in Egypt and he calls the prison pet pet food goes from cosmic ruler over the Stars to becoming an enslaved prisoner in a pit in Egypt but there he encounters two more dreams of two other prisoners and those are dreams about how those two prisoners who used to serve Fair event is Court one of them's going to get executed and one of them's going to get restored
 so the official who gets restored to serve in Pharaoh's Court hears about two dreams that Farrah and the dreams are about seven good things
 towels are stocks of grain that gets swallowed up and destroyed by 7 horrible things 7 nasty-looking cows and 7 to the he's your friend and he says I don't know what does all this mean right in the freaks out trying to figure out what these dreams mean enter Joseph the guy who used to be in Hebrew slave who was in prison with me and he interpreted my dream and he was right I think you should get that guy up here and let's see what he says about your dreams so this is in Genesis chapter 41 42 Joseph comes into the court Pharaoh he gets a change of clothes get some new grubs to go into the Royal Court and he hears the dreams for us tells him the two dreams and what Joseph says the Pharaoh in Genesis 41 is oh listen I don't know what these dreams means but God doesn't God just told me
 what he says is a Genesis 41 verse 25 Joseph the Pharaoh the dream of pharaoh even those two Dreams they're just 11 dream what Elohim is about to do he's trying to tell you there's a dreams the seven good cows are seven years and the Seven good years of grain they are seven years is one dream
 the thin bad cows that came up after them they are seven years and the 7 years of grain that shriveled empty ones they are seven years of famine
 this is the word I'm speaking to Pharaoh what Elohim is about to do he's showing you 7 years are coming 7 years of fullness in abundance in the land of Egypt but after that will come seven years of famine and all the fullness will be forgotten in the famine will bring an end to the land
 so here's what you should do you should find a human who has wisdom and understanding
 and you should set that person over all the land of Egypt and then you should divide the land of Egypt into five sections for the seven years fonus and gather all the food of those coming good years and store the grain under the hand of Fara in cities where it should be kept your house are you going to be able to store such a surplus you don't have yet if a structure of a city that's right you can't produce all that that happens in the farm member firms are associated with cities in the Bible Farms are like the outlying areas of the city that the city protects protects and it's all of the abundance abundance outside of the city but the right close to it in the Farms that produces all of the wealth that allows people in the city yet to specialize in develop music
 in arton will be clear in our modern framework you got the Farmland you got the city and those are the ancient imagination that agent setting the farm in the city are kind of 1 unit yet they exist together the dikotomy they have is the hillside eppard Shepherdsville the nomadic people versus the ones who have settled down to farm around the city so far is associated with cities Shepherd animal domestication is associated with Rural and migrating that's the the main kind of cultural opposition so here cities can actually become centers of abundance and goodness for the preservation of life is interesting because as a nomadic people can't carry around
 yeah you need to build huge towers and said I was totally I think now we can't sit right here from where we're sitting right now there was a day when you could look out the window and we can see where near the river that divides between East and West sides and on the river there's maybe just a mile and a half hour away there's that north of here there's those grain silos I think they still get you so well I think always covered with huge advertising cities and build huge buildings that store lots of foods that sustains life and when you have years of fullness and plenty and goodness those are all eaten words here when City's become joined to serve the abundance that God provides from his Eden store houses in heaven
 since it has become a gift of life to the nation's true doesn't Jesus they don't do that but that's a different point in the story the point is the abundance can deceive the human heart and it can become a little false eaten but he's not down on the pendants to look at the Lowe's in the Fishman for the day do you know so the point is in here when you know a time of decorations coming like seven years of famine what you need is why is human leadership in cities to use all of that concentrated technology specialist position wealth
 to yep creates Dragonology bring a structure the power structure the fact that one king can be like okay he's willing to do mobilize like to be able to do all of that I'm this is the city being used for the preservation of Life as a patient's life what's important right over this but this is the first time a city is associated with anything good is as you read three deaths and this is end up being a really great king Pharaoh right yeah, so just a continues the food can be appointed for all the land for the seven years of famine so that the land isn't cut off that language comes from the flood story of life being cut off so here are the two much Waters of the flood is now being set on an LG with not enough water to bring salmon or both
 what kind of life so this was good in the eyes of a Farrah good plan Joseph said do servants is there another guy like this around who has the spirit of Elohim in this famously is what the second time the spirit the spirit of Elohim. Elohim that phrase was used first in Genesis 1 verse 2 which is the spirits hovering over the Waters of darkness and disorder to bring life and that's there is disorder and coming creation on the way but here's the ruoff Elohim appears and making plans for the preservation of life but using human ruler so they're said to Joseph you know
 I like you kid that follows the fact that he made all this known to you there's nobody as understanding as wise as you so how about this you the over all of my house is that understanding and wise sorry I'm like this to my Kiki words
 4130 Navone comes from the bean route to be able to discern between and then ha being swept in the room not fun on the phone and then how come which is the word for wise and yeah so Discerning and wise so you be over my house on your mouth all my people vote if only in the throne will I be greater than you so just becomes an image of the king
 a wise Discerning image of the king who the king of points to store all of the movies that store cities that will preserve life in the land in the time of famine scarcity here and then it's all about he gets in throned and gold necklaces and rings and he rides on a chariot and everybody kneels before him alright man okay so so we get a righteous leader in a city whose listening to God's wisdom and War in a good spot when you get spots and remember this is the guy who had dreams that God would Elevate him as a ruler not just over the over the sun moon and stars you're like that sounds like a Genesis 1 and 2 image of God supercharged given do you know ruling over he's an image
 God is an image of God and he's an image of pharaoh you know we talked with you as the surprise of the city and it is a surprise that when Joseph shows up in Egypt that cuz we know where this is heading Israel's going to be at an oppressed immigrant population in Egypt that has to rescue that in the central story to the identity of Israel but before that story is a surprise surprise when is your first shows up Joseph comes up out of the pit of Egypt and is elevated to be the image of the Pharaoh and the city of Egypt are you think I mean this a bad City but it's starting out here as this wonderful image of what can happen when humans work with God yeah under the leadership of a wise
 an image of God their cities can become storehouses of life that's the portrait of course it's the Bible like things are going to get all twisted and go terrible again let's just honor the moment this is the first Redemptive positive portrait of a human City but it's a storehouse of life when it's being led by wise human rulers who can discern God's wisdom and so that's a surprise given the trajectory of the city but now we have two portraits what cities can be in God's world that can be agents that spread death and distorted
 knowledge of good and bad or they can become sources of great wisdom and Innovation for the preservation and spread of Life feel like things are on a knife's edge in a city yeah yeah I totally agree it's going great it's right but like man not too many dominoes at the fall before I saw some fragile things are going to get him a bad you know totally yeah I'm thinking about this is going to be some subjective personal commentary so I don't do it very often but you know we're sitting here or record record that is on the second floor so I guess it's on the third floor with a window that used to be able to look at Portland City skyline know our view of downtown is blocked by a new apartment building so I grew up here in Portland and literally in the same part of Portland where we sit here and have these conversations so in the
 70's and 80's and 90's my Heyday cruise around Portland on my skateboard it was kind of CD and sketchy and I thought that was cool although I was into a lot of unsafe situations and I thought that was cool though anyway when moved way to go to grad school and when I move back to Portland in 2012 there was kind of this cultural foodie music Renaissance Era Portland that was kind of the like golden Portland years made famous by that show Portlandia is where young people go to retire because it's still affordable early 2000 in comparison to Seattle San Francisco to go and had a great food scene great music art Senior Life Outdoors the mountain and gray out of Transportation anyway in terms of like to resume
 way out there building hotels everywhere however you didn't have to look far under neath the surface to know that all is not well in Portlandia is long long history of economic cultural ethnic inequities in the design of the neighborhoods the way schools get funded housing costs all these things that wasn't going on Portlandia era what's been interesting to live in the city is with the covid pandemic with all of the social upheavals around the murder of George Floyd and all of the protests and what and Portland you know the center and nationally I mean George Floyd didn't happen here but in terms of like that what happened after that in terms of demonstrations and just what can happen to a city with things just kind of go crazy yeah that's right and became like the the image of like look what the capital city
 so me and it's just it's my first time experiencing this personal and that's why I'm telling this story was what felt like in a very short matter of time downtown Portland became more like a ghost town compared to what it was in the early 2000s and now you walk into the city it was packed with people and you know every other businesses boarded up and closed but looks little plywood mental health support systems in the city of crumbled the financial system to support people who are experiencing houseless nests have all gotten scrambled through covid and so it's just interesting to watch a city turn and all the sudden face all these social crises in a really short amount of time so I'm just meditating on this comment that you made it feels like it's in my own experience
 in the city where I grew up in that I love and where I live but it's true it's like this social contract we all have humans gather together in just a few you know a series of social events and then a pandemic and it all just as guilty of the whole system just is exposed for what it is and inequities that have been there all along Bubble Up Bubble app can become visible unless it's like life in cities
 it's just this more condensed compacted form of the humans experience in general it's like it's intensified both in its intensity on the timelines get compacted Insidious and they can just turn and in a way that's what happens with Egypt at the end of Genesis we we very quickly go from this era of abundance and wise leadership the Portlandia Egypt and it just turns on as he say on and I said Jesse flip from Genesis and exodus so it's good to celebrate the good moments but it's also good to recognize how fragile it all is so it's kind of digression that's great yeah and I don't leave the city a lot or leave that in this area a lot but when I do the sentiment now is always are you guys okay is everything okay up there
 or worried about it that's interesting and there are good people trying to make a difference and there are lots of people who disagree about how to turn the ship around and makes things better and that is also part of life in cities is different people who have different points of view I usually don't know where that conversation is going to go so I just say it's a quirky town but cities in the Bible I think what I'm chewing on is you know as a theme in the Bible we were talking about it as a thing meaning the biblical authors are trying to give us God's wisdom by developing a pattern
 automatic pattern rust to meditate on and at this point we going to have this one little glimmer look like hold this thing that we thought was so rotten and a problem I can actually look at what could happen Something Good Can Happen and so I think part of me would go okay but still it seems like if we were really shrewd about this because we know what's going to happen like even though we could have bright spots and cities still I mean convince me really like maybe we should like we should all just be nomadic people sure do we should all like the city is seems like such a big problem now I also know where the whole story the Bible is going with the garden in the city are merged into one thing that comes out of heaven with the slaughtered lamb sitting on the throne at its Center
 something's happening where the city isn't lost Innovation the beauty that can come out of the city is recaptured and what was supposed to be and in this snapshot seen its of when the leader of the city Pharaoh recognizes the one who got his elevated and filled with his spirit and wisdom to bring about the rescue of life in the time of scarcity and death that's when the city transforms into an arc like Noah's Arc has lots of language here that evoke the language of Noah's Ark specially the packing the ark was food little speech got gas about packing your home food so that there's enough food during the flood and now here it's the city in Egypt to get packed with food under the
 wisdom of this righteous ruler that lead to the preservation of life so they can become a place of rescue or they can become place of death it all depends on whether the rulers recognize God's righteous Chosen One
so there's a lot more we could do there but we're just going to turn now to the next scroll in the story of the Bible Exodus Exodus and
 flash-forward Joseph ends up making Egypt and its cities become a storehouse of Life all the nations start streaming down to Egypt to get food and Joseph stays Everybody Eats like the plan works is the world the world said the earliest do you know that region which is depicted as the world in the story and such a Marvel movie here also his family and his brothers who betrayed him come down looking for food and he goes through a whole ordeal with them reconciled with them yeah restores his family Saves the World by glitches in the story The Bible so Genesis ends now with all of the families of Abraham and called the Sons of Israel down in Egypt That's How The Exodus scroll Begins the opening lines of the Exodus crawl these are the names of the sons of just roll the ones who went to Egypt with Jakob each one in this household
 and you get a list of the sons of Jacob every person who came out of the line of Jacob 70 people no Joseph of course was already in Egypt that was all the family coming to join him so in just in recalling just if you like Joseph the righteous was chosen ruler that Pharaoh acknowledged when Pharaoh did that a blessing to the land through the cities
 46 now Joseph died and all of his brothers and all that generation
 and the sons of Israel were fruitful they swarmed they multiplied and became strong very very much and the land was filled with them is a Genesis 1 the language right by and swarming creatures when multiplying and if they're like the swimming creatures multiplying in the land and the land was filled with them almost every keyword in Exodus 1 verse 7 is drawn directly from the 7-Day creation story of the blessings Lord blessing is not used to you but is it a blessing on it but it's the narrative imagery associated with idea blessing so has become like a little Eden it needing refuge in the cities and become that source of Eden life all around
 receipt now a new king arose over Egypt and problem I have no idea who Joseph was he didn't know Joseph and here's what he says his people
 look the people of the sons of Israel they are more multiplied and stronger than us come let us act skillfully with them it's the word wisdom let's use wisdom here they will move word which word for wisdom here skillfully but what's the word come from the word wisdom so we have play it right here yeah like there's a situation that requires you sing a liability here that's right here's a liability in his mind they're going to multiply
 and it will come about even more with when War happens to us that they will add themselves to those who hate us to fight for us might amuse make a lot but I'm just there my wife says he's catastrophizing and so when those who hate us make war against us they're going to join our enemies and then they'll go up out of the land and we'll lose this you know big resource right here in our midst
 so let's contrast this with the mindset of the Pharaoh who didn't know Joseph
 so Sarah didn't know Joseph said his here's a image of God is filled with the spirit and wisdom and he's got a plan that will bring abundance in life so let's make a elevator that elevate him in a previous series on the firstborn where when God Elevate the chosen one to be a conduit of Eden blessing in the world that forces others around them to make a choice and the first pharaoh saw that and he made the wise he blessed Those whom God has blessed when God said to Abraham and it results in Union across ethnic culture National groups and the preservation of life for everybody
 and this is being painted as sad as it of that
 so there's a lot more to the speech than just what's on the surface there's the murder a mindset yeah whole mindset of fear scarcity of looking at people are different than you and thinking that it's them or me sing it like a zero-sum their flourishing will surely come at my expense how else is the world work but there's this assumption tribalism do you flush it means I want so I guess if I want to flourish I've got to find a way to leverage what's happening with you to my advantage there cuz we both can't win here that's not the real world right that's the mindset so yeah there's a lot to meditate on in free speech that is unstated but that is surely going on this is the mindset of Kane yeah I mean we've been talked about the knife's edge and what tipped you over it's like this attitude of
 we can't trust each other and trust God I need to protect myself is this is logic to myself was God's elevated my brother which I guess means that there's not enough elevation for me to just God has an elevated me yet so and that's what God says to him is he listen if you do the right thing here there's elevation for you as well but here it's made corporate and were really drawing attention to the fact that these are too ethnic cultural groups and it's one group that every culture group is a brother in a sense we all come from for humans real humans so there's a Cain and Abel kind of thing happening here Vero is older brother
 Vero is thinking he's worried and the story like Cain saw that Abel is favored barrows here is looking man look at the favor this morning a little messy bun chance on this immigrant population marks us there just working with this continues they can turn on us so the I get to Portrait here is
 in the life of the city the knife-edge of the city is when the diversity and the difference between ethnic cultural groups that make up here the cities of Egypt is viewed as a threat to those in leadership currently in power and then one groups productivity becomes leveraged or exploited to benefit those in power as the portrait here I mean this is a system there is no generation of huge family that hasn't had its own version of this is like pretty endemic to The Human Experience it is so powerful that Exodus begins with this portrait I mean it's almost doesn't do justice to it to say just evil or selfishness but it's a lack of trust you like I trust so what pharaohs response to this is to begin his response it kind of shows of character
 that's right because you can be like man I'm worried about these guys and there's a number of solutions to alleviate your concern yeah yep that's right and verse 11 tells the deeper story of this guy's character the Egyptians placed over the Israelites captains of forced labor in order to oppress them with their burdens and they had them build cities of Supply storage for Farah pistol and this to the cities and as much as they oppressed them so the Israelites multiplied and just broke out which is the positive image of like spilling over the banks and the Egyptians experience dread because of the sons of Israel
 so here's our storage cities appear in yet again but it's just a sad inverted version of what the store cities that Joseph thought up see that contrast subjects further first 13 Egypt Enslaved the sons of Israel with brutality they made their lives bitter with harsh enslavement with mortar
 and with brick with every kind of enslavement in the field all the enslavement with which they enslave them was protecting an awkward awkward but beautifully designed as a chiasm which is why it feels repetitive cuz it is on purpose every kind of inflamed in the field meeting like in every way you could do forced Labour yeah they're doing it it's right there's a Novation happening here alright but its Innovation for how to enslave and exploit this immigrant population and I just mentioned verses 13 14
 lots of repetition in a pattern them all out these two sentences are designed to the symmetry of a chiasm and the Centerline the very center of it is highlighting that the cities are made with mortar and brick which is hyperlink course course it's a hyperlink actually in more ways than one when Pharaoh says come let us deal wisely with them and then they have them build cities of storage with mortar and brick these are all the key words from the story of the building of Babylon Genesis 11 where they say come let us build the city and they use brick instead of stone and tar for their mortar also this language of enslavement in the field
 is recalling the language of the curse on the ground from Genesis 3 where God says thorns and thistles the ground will produce for you you'll eat the plants of the field and God sent them out to work which is the same Hebrew root word slave service in Lakeport does another word for work which is more related to worship Rights was added to the different words this is it was that service service service in other words David is going to produce in service for another question is if you have Yahweh as your Redeemer and Covenant partner then any avadh work you do for him will bring life to you and I but if you've got Farrah as your master
 then it's worth of the weeds to death not from Vero Beach to lie for Pharaoh that leads to death for you and for you both this language of slavery and the language of building cities with brick-and-mortar I've especially that phrase brick and mortar in building of a city is two stories in the whole Hebrew Bible that use these words to describe this the building cities and its Babylon Berlin Babylon and Pharaoh building the store houses with yes slaves to the Pharaohs Storehouse is here we call the storehouse is that Joseph ordered to be built that led to life and now here's the storage cities that this Fair orders to be built and that leads to the death enslavement of God's chosen one
 so this Fair has painted an exact contrast to the Pharaoh of Joseph's Day
 and this oppression both comes out of in Egyptian City and leads to the building of even more Egyptian cities so now that the supply storage is for the benefit of one people in one city at the expense of the many
 they're just portraits and it's a knife edge between the two of them I like to be set that so I think that's what I wanted to sit in front of us to have this conversation it says if Genesis took us on this long down word trajectory from Canyon City to Babylon to Sodom and Gomorrah and then when it comes to the cities of Egypt we get the good and the bad and that we're just creating more complexity and Nuance to the portrait of of human City and so this city that the Pharaoh want to build become the monument to enslavement and death and so you already created this is the calling of Moses and the ten plagues Passover becomes the equivalent of the flood or the scattering of Babylon to this earlier cities or the fire the Rains Down on Sodom and Gomorrah you and all those get put in the blender
 turned into what we called 10 play
okay sometime this random thought maybe we could end with her love you feedback on so the story of the Bible in one sense is God saying I want to share my power and Rule with these creatures and the story just shows over and over how incapable we are doing that because we want to trust on our own wisdom instead of connecting to Divine
 and God could just say I had that was a mistake I'm done but there's this relentless
 desire of God to make it work so it's almost like the surprise of humanity interesting you know God's going to just do what it takes and I'm going to get messy it's going to be frustrating long timelines involved himself in certain ways it seems like at least I think that's what these moments from the last episode of these internal Divine speeches where it's like depicting the moral puzzle yeah but this whole partnership represents right is God going to be true to his Justice or is he going to be forgiving and true to his purpose and promise to work with me that he and so cities are just an extension of that same problem as a magnifying magnifier and I was thinking about how you know a creature like a like a snail
 like it creates its shell like it's part of the snail but it becomes its home right now and we don't grow cities from our actual self like our fingernails don't like grow out and become like our
 a protective in casing we actually it's kind of crazy thing that we're able to do is like toolmakers users which is very connected to Bing image of God but this is our hell yeah those are like the place we can like protect ourselves if we do when we don't make walls around it for the most part anymore some City still do but the most part not the walls are different now. Kind of different types of wall stipple Matic walls its walls through law enforcement or but you don't have to take too far of a step off what is the main storyline of God working with humanity and how problematic that is 2 then what is got going to do when humans come together and build what's just very natural natural I guess
 what I'm proposing is it is natural for humans to build cities as it is for a snail to grow a shell like what humans are going to do and then I think I just sent me early on his conversation is like of course God put us in a garden like where else you can start but if you're going to stay in the garden long enough right there's enough humans there we're going to be building infrastructure yes you eventually you're going to have a Garden City I mean it's just a notable things like the city is just inevitable given what humans are and that God would partner with such creatures right to continue his work of Creation in the world right now that makes sense it just so happens that the portrait of that occurring in the storyline in Genesis is of cities well-designed is the snail
 shell because now there's other humans are going to want to kill me right yes the reason that you need a shell is cuz there's like Ravens the one that's like come get you in to yourself and kill you imagine you know a creative retelling of Adam and Eve spending Generations in the Garden of Eden need the wall and don't need clothes and we just eat from the trees and it's great for the Cadillac style chili what like is nice I could have my little space right here you have a little space right there we can work together you know like there's going to be a little sure Innovations and they're going to create what we might consider City type of adaptations or maybe not maybe the point is like that's not how humans are supposed to live you know one thing speaking of my teenage years
 skateboarding around Portland one thing I wasn't doing was attending any of my Western Civilization history classes so I don't know I'm just going to bring up like the Romantic Movement in Europe after the Industrial Revolution write so the the little bit I do know and this is what John Jacque Rousseau what his novels and poetry represented was this cultural resistance movement against the urbanization of Europe longing for the ideal of the garden the pasture the countryside and then it had off shoots in Arts and Music it's so I don't know very much about that culture movement other than saying I know what happened but it does rep there's something there I think there's something in the human soul
 that can get easily squelched to extinguished in the suffocating environment of the snail shell creating our own Gardens wanting to have that balance up what I'm hearing you say is isn't it kind of inevitable that is human flesh and do their image of God saying they're going to build places and those places will be organized into those people in that people in it doesn't have to be tribal and that's all a part of the sad human condition but it never did ility to something like the city as humans to spread and do their thing even if it's good you have to something like the city and maybe that's what we're seeing reflected in the fact that when you get to the depiction is New Creation it's a Garden City that's good observation and maybe that's what these two versions of the cities of Egypt rights do for us in Genesis and exodus
 cities can be a source of life when they recognized the Glorious image of God Chosen One That Got elevates To Rule with wisdom then cities become a source of life but it's a nice dads and I guess that's the the wisdom of this portrait of the city okay where we headed next is given we just got our first portrait in the positive City I want to move to a story which is about the founding of the almost entirely positive City in the storyline of Bible which is just one look at the city of God the city of God yes so there's the story about David founding Jerusalem as the capital city bringing the portable Eden the Tabernacle there and establishing it as a city dedicated to God
 and there's all these Psalms in the Psalms scroll connected to the choirs from David's time the priests acquires in the songs that they sing about Jerusalem and it's hard to tell if they're singing about having events got some purpose so what is possible when the city of humans becomes a city of God that's local estate on next well tell me who you are or where you're from but your name my name is guy. My name is Aria one of them it
