all right okay we've been talkin about the gospel the word gospel yeah we've had two recent videos about a word study on gospel words in Greek and Hebrew and then a video on how to read the fourfold gospel and we say we we have them we don't have enough yet I suppose that's what sir.
Don the podcast we've been talking about the gospels as in the biographies of Jesus and then the word gospel in general what it means and today we want to talk about a cousin word that is translated witness yes and so that's why we're going to do this episode yes and we have someone new to the podcast power stations and a recent addition to our team yeah I'm coming up on a year yes it's been on the project team and we've known each other for some years now you're all so you know the honorable title is a Bible scholar I'd like to say Bible nerd I think that is the more honorable title
 about yourself and the reason being is that you I researched the word witness and wrote this script then we worked on together and your voice will be reading the video when nothing to stop for the power project excited to have more than one scholar and writer so and he read the Bible project I get to do both so I love that so much so here I work on classroom stuff and blogs and writing articles and then this is my first video script so working on this the script for the word witness that they were talking about today they require some season of going to school for boys in school for about 25 years of my life and had an identity crisis after that yeah I finished my PhD at Golden Gate
 San Francisco in the Hebrew Bible and my work is mostly in the Psalms of the story that the whole book of Psalms tells working on a number of things one is the classroom and and then also helping us think through how do we how do I get people deeper into learning the Bible other than just watching the videos and it's good reading on the Sims for witness right talk to us about I think that there are two basic ways to think about this word and one is just to understand the basic meaning of this word what it means what it doesn't know how to use in biblical texts and the other way is to think about how it's used in the story of scripture so every word occurs in the context
 and this one occurs in the story of the Hebrew Bible so this is something I love about the word studies here is that you guys look at a word and what it contributes to the overarching story or if it can serve you in this word definitely does so videos are kind of not technically just reading will condense dictionary entry videos the really become stories about the whole Bible and the video does not actually remember why we decided on this word yes witness yes our friend Kevin plow came in the office and would like guys would be great if you had videos on on the gospel or on evangelism and evangelist in the words of Angela and witness mean a lot of things and a lot of different Christian tradition
 yeah and that was like 2 years ago for me witness was a word in a group of church so that was a common word witnessing it was a verb Vale you witness yeah you witness or go witnessing yeah whenever the word witness to come up it was in terms of that share the gospel it was always about like Street the vandalism usually often I mean I told the story with you and Amber times up we had this ministry where we would actually go if people left their address on like a comic card at church we had a team that would go to their house and knock on the door and invite ourselves in and and then witness and we would go to the Romans road and I did it a couple times
 I was in Youth Group and so if a kid came and left a comment card so I went to like kids houses and it was really awkward is extremely awkward and I told before and it's hot story a story but I will tell now but but yeah for me witness is all about that it's about that it's one-on-one convincing someone to understand the gospel and for me at that time the gospel was just what you need to know and believe to go to heaven when you die and I think a lot of people who are there to do a word study on this world because we have to ask that question is this what the word witness means in the Bible or does it means something else and it does have similar meanings but isn't exactly that so yeah that's why it's interesting so we've also talked about how and more non religious environment the word wet
 typically means just to testify in a courtroom or to see something happen and then be able to give an account of that thing some people brought up the latest word or a kind of a quart that has a little more illegal but it's so that you be like it's this goes to court a common term outside of illegal setting or the religious setting gospel singer gospel gospel as in the genre of music in
 I don't know what's wrong or what by the end of this podcast maybe we'll understand what that means
the word witness isn't super common in everyday language for us but it does occur a lot throughout the Old Testament and the New Testament over two hundred times in each so it's a lot he has a pretty common were that's over four hundred times in a lot of different forms in Hebrew is Right noun and verb form Aid and food and then in Greek there's a noun and a verb so there's more to stand there's more Toretto so it's to a witness and then to Bear witness or even to witness something so even if I witness something that works in English if I witness to it it's referring to my perception saw something and then if I ever was as a verb we have to add extra word bear sometimes the word to testify is he has even throughout our English translations.
 that's about how it translated to English word rendering of related to that Greek words so I think it's helpful to just think about the basic meaning of the word throughout scripture because there are a couple things we learned that are related to those common conceptions you brought up John so just like an English to Hebrew words for witness and bear witness they do also occur in a legal setting a lot of the time just so we see that when Boaz buys land from Naomi's family or when Jeremiah buys land these transactions and they call together witnesses to see what happens story about the guy want the nearest Kinsman Naomi want by the land and they yanked his sandal off and spit in his face
 sandal but I don't think I'll have to do that thing for sandal there's a guy who's closer in the family line to Naomi and he's named so-and-so me all money something so and so he named such and such as I never get the proper name and then he he doesn't want to do it cuz you realized I have to take on a widow if I redeem the land that belongs to family and so you said I won't do it and then they say take off your sandal yeah it's like a shaming thing right yeah yeah I know it was the custom in former times in this real concerning the Redemption exchange of land to confirm a matter that a man had to remove his sandal and give it to another
 description actually because if it wasn't this was a means of bearing witness and Israel to take off your sandals look like a transaction receipt to give it over to a d sandals person like that becomes a description of a person is simulator riding in Deuteronomy there's a law when a guy won't redeem a widow from a yeah the family line the priests and the elders this what I'm thinking we'll Summit him to the Town Centre and if you persist in saying I won't marry this woman whose you know my brother was married to his brother's widow will go up to him before all the elders take off one of his sandals and spit in his face this is what is done to the man who won't build up his brothers family line
 and the men's line will be known in Israel as the family of the unsaddled publicly saying we're all witnessing this guy won't inconvenience themselves to help out a family member in the face yeah no more tests and the point is that there are witnesses watching this they see something happen and then they can recall it later for the whole Community knows or whatever so the Hebrew word is aid but it occurs in a few forms and that's one of them to do so someone can stand and give bear witness I saw something
 but in this case a guy walking without a sandal is an act of bearing witness the word witness can also function to mean evidence so it's proof or evidence so the guy without the sandal is walking proof that this thing happen for a while that shame is the evidence evidence of witness translation of Hebrew word still the reason I think this is helpful to talk about is because talking about the idea of being a witness in a legal setting shows that this word it's it's kind of a simple word in the sense that it's defining someone who just see something and then they talk about it or they share about it so it's a little bit different than what you were saying John about
 and it's been seeing or pushing it doesn't really have that kind of connotation it's just seeing something and then talking about the thing you've seen nothing but helpful it takes away that layer almost I guess that's Berryman yeah but then the other part of that is that it's a simple word but it's also very weighty word so being a truthful legal witness carries a lot of responsibility in the ancient Israeli culture so you see that in a lot of different ways in scripture it's one of the Ten Commandments that you should not bear false witness so it's right there yeah yeah 2010 yeah and it's a serious crime and Israel so whatever the false witness is intending to do to
 the other party that's the consequence that they will bear upon themselves if they are found out how much even today the value of the witness to that evidence getting someone hearing from their mouth which is so much weight to that it's a it's a big deal yeah when you do that we have say this is what I experienced specially when it's saying that someone did something wrong
 yeah it was some legal document my wife and I had to sign a free insurance or something and we had to get a notary public witness resigning as I walked a block down here like a UPS store cuz I had advertised on the window get your documents signed here and had to pay this woman $10 to watch watch me some piece of paper and then she put a stamp on it and now I realize that you know if they have they have the most wonderful signatures to be a bird like a notary in a man there so elaborate
this is why the psalmist says in Psalm 27 he begs God cannot abandon him and he says false Witnesses have risen against me so I think when I read this kind of verses in the Bible I don't hear the waiting list of it until I like looking at that with the word witness really means and that if false Witnesses are surrounding this person his life is actually be threatened because of it in more traditional cultures where your public honor is way more tied into your identity a false witness challenging your standing against work to people or try the night take you down so you don't get the promotion or something but yeah probably even more in an honor shame
 people in the community would know what's true or not so it's a waiting thing I think it's interesting that God is referred to as a witness throughout the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament really so what's the effect of saying God is my witness of the question I've been asking as I've been looking at this so here's one example and Genesis 31 when Jacob and Laban make a covenant leaving says to Jacob if you oppress my daughters or if you take wives besides my daughter's although no one is with us see God as a witness between you and me so it seems like it's both because nobody's there but to say God is a witness also implies some severity if you if you do this
 Michelle
 you know like that someone was always watching you and like just kind of private moment and you're like what if what if someone was watching this private moment but you know like this feels so by myself but like what if this was and what wouldn't want to be thinking about my life right now if they were observing it there was nothing it yeah yeah it is a terrifying sight I think that's what Levens talking about I think so I think it might be a bit of it. So yeah if people invoke God is a witness right that's like playing the God card in the Hebrew Bible like Kevin and it's like this or treaties that people are making between each other but what's interesting is that in the New Testament God the Father the spirit and Jesus are all referred to Witnesses
 Jesus yeah there's like a very specific content or thing that they're witnessing about so this is the thing in the Gospel of John the father Bears witness to the identity of Jesus Jesus and the father bear witness to who Jesus says that God sent him the spirit Bears witness to Jesus as a witness to himself I'm so that's a message on a leader say to they say you can testify about yourself and he says well I testify about myself and the father testifies about me too so yeah my Witnesses reliable I am a witness to myself another witness that will end in the legal context in the Hebrew Bible two or three Witnesses were always need it so that's a no
 Jesus also says that and John 8:17 and 18 it says he says in your laws written that the witness or testimony of two people is true I'm the one who Bears witness about myself and the father who sent me Bears witness about me so I think he's the father son and spirit all bear witness to each other yeah you know I've never fully work that out in the Gospel of John but remember it's really a prominent seem like a whole narrative is a new sink through the epilogue at the Gospel of John he says I could have lots more stories about Jesus I have chosen these so that you may trust the Jesus the Messiah of God
 I've often wondered if the witness theme isn't a part of a strategy of the equation it's like the story has all these Witnesses so that by the end of the reader have sex with evidence evidence again is that a related word so that makes sense multiple times so Romans 1 in in the greetings of his letters he says God is my witness that I pray for you or God is my witness how I yearn for you so it almost seems like the city of God being a witness become a little bit colloquial phrase almost like I swear to God except a little more can be used in a less serious way maybe a very serious way the Casual way things what you mean if you really ask the person
 the gods are witness me trust me. What I'm saying is true it's reliable it is saying is because God is my witness saying I'm just looking at least three examples Romans Philippians Thessalonians these were all groups of people that he he says and other places he wants to go see them but for one reason or other he hasn't and I know and in other cases like in Corinth the fact that he didn't go travel and see if church people start to wonder if he was reliable and so I wonder if that became he traveled so much I became a thing where you kind of needed to be like wasn't God's my witness I yearn for you with the affection of Christ and flippy on
 no I can't come see you right now I'm in prison but trust me he said that he was going to come but then you wasn't any was it able to and then people start Dexter if he was reliable this to that you can pick up this phrase and God is my witness
 yeah so that's interesting God can be a witness a person can be a witness of something they see and then another use of witnesses that an object can be a win its own object can be personified whether an altar or a pile of stones yeah I know it sounds kind of weird so it says in Joshua 24 people renew the Covenant Joshua says behold this Stone shall be a witness against us for it has heard all the words of Yahweh that he spoke to us so it was like what it was doing there crazy this is think what happens when you sign a document you think the stone heard what he said I think God heard what they said the stone is a symbol of that
 that's interesting I need to think about this morning I didn't get that one of the Torah any marks the moment with this pillar that was there while it was read every time we come here we were here the stone was here we all set a reset it and the stone will be remembered reminder whenever the people see it they remember all the things that were red so it's a memorial or a reminder but then it's also evident in the dumb people see if they're like oh yeah this thing really did happen it's similar to the way that our signatures function on a document do we have to get you maybe a a cowitness there's a cosigner or something like that. And then the piece of paper is an object
 or something or it or is a witness of something I don't know it's a witness you're right it's testifying to the diploma was there when I heard all night I saw me it's on the graduate but that is what I mean it's kind of hard to give you the yeah yeah and then somewhat related to this idea is in the New Testament The Works of a person so this Gospel of John The Works of a person can testify or bear witness to that person or who they are so they function as evidence so again it's kind of an object it says an action a thing not a person so the works of Jesus testify
 about him. His identity witness is a very is a thing that humans do but if something else is doing that we could anthropomorphize it anyway and say it's being a witness I see Works bear witness the pillar here's and is a witness is a testimony about something or the witness anthropomorphize grills at Home even more which I think is cool
 okay plus outline. Basic meaning that's the basic meaning of the simple word that means to see something share what you've seen it can refer to a person and legal setting an object God God can be a witness so here's the fascinating part though and why I like the word studies we do because this this word does tell the story of the whole Bible especially the people of God in the Bible so it gives us insight into that and something that I've noticed and we talked about this in the script writing is that for these word studies you typically look for whether there's a basic pattern for how this word functions in the story this world does have a basic pattern that follows so the word witness that tells a story that God wants a group of witnesses so people who see him who experienced him
 and then his his desire is that these people would represent him or bear witness to him to who he is and he typically raises up a chief witness to help them do this so you see this theme even though the word isn't used yet you see the stadium in Genesis 1 and 2 and he wants people to partner with him for the flourishing of the whole world so he has you know specific individuals who will owe all Humanity I suppose I'm just wanted to but then especially in Genesis 12 he chooses one group Abraham's family out of the mini so that the money would be blessed sorry to go back it's interesting way to think about the image of God in Adam and Eve as the word witnesses that uses the image which is a representation images of statues represent the person or thing or event that you saw
 so in a way humans are like a living witness to the Creator whom they represent logic I think of the witness so in that sense humans are ya do that again humans are a representation of the Creator if you put the witness in a bigger more basic abstract category of this representation I saw a car accident you know the car accident past you can't go over there but I can represent to you what happened cuz I was there in a way the image of God is a embodied representation of the Creator and so in a way humans are these embodied witnesses to the visible Creator and so is all creation and in a way to
 set reminder to made ya and then he'll use legal language therefore people are without excuse to suppress that knowledge your point is the word witness isn't used the concept of a group of people who represent God creation that's like the foundation it's right there that's the about partnership is the foundation of the whole story and then Humanity fails over and over that the Predator pattern of a witness as a representative ideas when I think of the verb that Leisure translate as to Bear witness to me I think I would say to Bear witness or to represent well it's interesting is when you talk about being representative it feels like you you have to get in the game you you are like an ambassador of some sort of yours is a witness it feels a little bit more
 Nutro like hey here's what I experienced I'm not going to give me judgments just here is my experience that's right but it is you're representing lyrics I'm representing my ex. Correa representing it maybe it's the word represent that in English sounds of being made in God's image then I'm representing the God made me and wants to partner with me and design me in a certain way but you also human is a representation of God to Creation into other people into the animals accept the logic of the image of Genesis 1 and I'm a witness of God's creativity and his and his nature witness witness means both to see and experience feel like the idea of being in his presence and in the garden
 that experience is carried forward through people Garden of Eden and cultivate new land whatever is being his Representatives is images and in a way Witnesses with the idea of Abraham's family being a blessing to All Nations but that theme is there but it's in the story of Moses and the Torah or the law that the idea of being a witness to the nation's or or testifying to who got is becomes a little bit more clear so and the story of The Exodus when God rescues the people from slavery he says to Moses to tell the people this is Exodus 19 4 through 6 you yourselves have seen or witnessed what I did to the Egyptians
 and how I bore You On Eagle's Wings and brought you to myself now then if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my Covenant then you shall be my own possession among all the peoples for all the Earth is mine so at this point if you're like me you're going wait so we chose One Nation for like a special privilege or salvation or what but then the next first clarifies why he chose this nation and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation so here we see God chooses is real for this role of being a servant to the rest of welfare of priests and the idea of a priest is that this is a person who mediates between two parties and the only parties in the story so far are y'all way and the Nations
 Hebrew scriptures is that God selected of people who could experience him and witness him who he is and then bear witness for a specific role but the purpose is that all nations would know that it's because of this the witness of this one group witness isn't used but the theme of the idea Witnesses what the Covenant is about you see you seen the experience may represent this is where the word witness starts pees a lot describe the Torah Dakota in the car now it's the it's the law of the tie rod that is over and over again called the witness but it's usually translated as the
 testimony tablets of the testimony interesting phrase yes that's right over and over again or the Ark of the testimony that Arc of the witness so the tablets it's this experience that that Moses had with Yahweh and the things goes up on the cloud yeah with like the kingship in the power of Yahweh and then the rescue from Egypt and then God talks to him he experiences him and he gives him all of these instructions and this is called a witness to who Yahweh has tablets of testimony has a good yeah yeah sounds like it's a Jones are the testimony to the Covenant relationship that's what's written on them yeah yeah and I think it's interesting to ask her why are these things called a witness what about them
 cuz it's like signing legal document the stones about what exactly is written on the tablets well enough to sit on two tablets summary of representation of discovering agreements similar to you know when you sign a legal document between two parties then the actual text becomes like a witness of the agreement you made but then they put it in a box of testimony Supply this idea of being a witness that holds the whole narrative scripture together and that you see God choose Israel to be a witness to him in order to help other people see who got is and then you even see this through Moses specifically 11 Israelite get called out you call it a chief with
 yeah right and this is because the group of people who are supposed to be the Witnesses are already worshipping other gods will Moses is up on the mountain by Moses has this incredible experience on top of mountain and he's on there for 4 days and then he comes down with he's actually written out on Stone and the things that God told them and so now he's a witness the stones are witness and it's a witness for this group or supposed to be Witnesses for the world exactly when is LuAnn has being a witness it's an interesting concept because the the law of Moses is this story that's peppered with instruction right so I think there are a couple ways that this law could be a witness one is that it tells a story about who got is so it tells the story of an experience with God so through it people
 I know him which is kind of the point of a witness to do and then the instruction in the Torah also testified to the character of God or what he's like that he's dust and you know create this Fair society and wants relational Harmony between among the community and then Moses even write the song that is said to be a witness to the people that tells the stories this is Deuteronomy 31 and 32 the song is called a witness and it tells the story of how God has cared for the people so the witness of the Torah is almost this story that people they experience God through it and they also remember what he's done so it becomes a witness for the people and also a witness against them if they ever stray from God there's this song
 Schism Sunrise just for myself so the storyline of the Torah as a story there is a witness to God's purpose to bring blessing to the nation through this family then the laws of the Torah bear witness to Israel and anybody reads them of God's righteous character of how he wants of people to be organized and then Moses's song and words bear witness against the people of Israel if they fail to fulfill the Covenant and that's all people because it's a witness for our to the people and that when they hear it they are experiencing experience and do I say and then if they fail to fulfill the Covenant then his writings bear witness against them right that's right yeah there's that odd
 Deuteronomy 31 he writes a song can be a witness and then the song that he sings is essentially I mean it begins by saying you guys are corrupt you're not going to be faithful to God you're going to destroy ourselves and God's going to let you do it so it's like kind of like an i-told-you-so before it happens before you go to store yourself I'm going to tell you that I told you so as to Bear witness against you so that you can remember that anyway yeah is a witness about Yahweh and what's interesting is that in the New Testament Jesus says that the Torah Bears witness to him so in the Hebrew Bible we see that it's about this God has a king and a deliver and then Jesus says that actually all talking about him if he says you search the scriptures and it is they that bear Witness
 about me
the prophets also become these Chief Witnesses for Israel said they also see and experience God is King in a similar way to how much did I'm not sign the prophets both the people and the writings are meant to Bear witness or warned Israel about what will happen if they continue to turn away from Yahweh and his taraso a great example of this is Isaiah who sees Yahweh on the throne as the king and the deliver and Isaiah 60 Glory of Yahweh fills filled the temple in this Vision yeah and then Isaiah is meant to Bear witness about this experience to the people and also warned them which warned a lot of times are Hebrew English word Warren is the Hebrew word witness so the profits to the people
 with a with a lot steak Yeah here here's an example from 2nd Chronicles 2419 it says yet he Yahweh sent profits among them to bring them back to Yahweh these witness or warned them but they would not pay attention so or sorry they witness to or warned them thing that we would change it to warned and this contacts but it makes sense but a warning and English doesn't always mean they are witness of something you could just be morning something that you had you know secondhand knowledge of her interesting just understand logically not something you actually were a witness of I'm looking at an ivy as they testified esva has testified as to what translation
 I see the second chronicles 2419 testify against is kind of similar to warning it's a negative word interesting so the profits are also these Chief witnesses that testified Israel about who God is and and testify about what will happen if they continue to go away from him and their purpose is to restore Israel to their rightful role and you see this especially in Isaiah 43 48 so this is where the word witness gets applied to Israel in a really explicit way or really direct way so and Isaiah 43 48 we see the word witness and also the content of what the people are supposed to be witnessing about or witnessing to sew Isaiah 40
 310 through 12 says you are my Witnesses declares Yahweh so hear that words plural so we can assume he's talking to Israel you are my Witnesses and my servant whom I have chosen and here's a content and very well could be a collective so it's singular yeah but it could be the nation or 1 and I think it gets narrowed to one eventually but is it the whole people as a group who you know Israel as a whole is supposed to be the servant and that does get narrowed to an individual that's kind of similar to this idea of a group of witnesses but there's a chief went in to help the people yet so you're my Witnesses so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed and there will be none after me so it's this way
 it's about who God is I even I am Yahweh and there is no savior besides me so there's a unique God he's the Savior deliver it is I who have declared and save and Proclaim and there was no strange God among you so you are my witnesses to Clara's Yahweh sitting that's the clearest Isaiah really a day of 42/48 really clarifies Israel's role as a witness about options that is why they are constantly calling them a deaf and blind which is kind of a problem if the witness is a person to retire but this is the witness car has to work with my God's not going to work at all who will turn
 Israel back into the witness is there supposed to be who will open the eyes of the blind Israel is the servant he says yeah but then the servant is called Israel but then the servant and Isaiah 49 is said to bring back the preserved of Israel so it's not just Israel it's a person or a Remnant or at the chief witness with us and Witnesses this servant will be a light for the Nations and bring Salvation to the ends of the Earth that's Isaiah 49 says so I'll write stories coming together it's cool how you could tell the story of the Bible who was one word
that's so what Jesus says he's doing when he comes on the scene he says that he is at servant and witness he says that in a lot of different ways but one of the ways is that he claims to be the light of the nation Tony says I am the light of the world and John ate here yep yeah that's right yeah so he says I'm the light of the world and then when he teaches in the synagogue he quotes directly from Isaiah 61 1 and 2 to say that he is the servant he's as Chief witness who is expected so he says that he was sent to free prisoners and recover sight for the blind so Open the Eyes of the blind which is what what is a says the storm's to do for every does literally but then also figuratively here this idea of these blind witness has their eyes being opened
 yes it's interesting Dynamic of the gospels he comes as the chief witness to the blind witness all think this is the whole story of the blind man and John has these two layers of meaning he heals the eyes of the blind man and then these religious leaders are all angry about it and then Jesus start calling them the blind one and it becomes this kind of double meditation on who's really blind right what kind of light in this constitutes True Vine that's a threat so Jesus he's the ultimate witness bearing witness about who he is and proclaiming God's kingdom and it's called witness over and over especially in the Book of John so he's talked about that already and ultimately it's his witness specifically that he he gives this testimony or witness about who he is that gets him killed
 at the car show in Luke 22 the leaders say to Jesus if you're the Christ and tell us and he pretty much says that you're not going to listen to me anyway there's a deaf people and then he says they asked him if if he's the son of God and he says yes I am then they said what further need do we have of witness or testimony we've heard it ourselves from his own mouth so it's his witness as the chief witness to get them killed but with ironic is that it's this death and resurrection that his companions witness that caused them to become the witnesses that God had always intended ironic twist and then becomes one of the keep titles to describe Jesus's followers in the world right now and you and you taught me this week kind of skipped over it but Jesus his death as a witness in Greek that's what's the word
 Marcus and that's where we get our turn martyr yes that's right I had no idea I've always thought of her as someone who dies well as someone who who is killed because of their faith or because of things we believe in order for the cause than they they have to think of that specifically about bearing witness to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or two that saying it's Friday dying for that you're dying as a witness it's a cool image yeah yeah it's powerful yeah you're staking your life on the truthfulness of what you're representing even if he's the chief witness is right the faithful witness the firstborn of the dead so maybe those ideas of being a witness and dying are already being connected in that bug
 is his witness and then he commissioned in the famous acts that he calls his followers to be Witnesses yeah something interesting about the New Testament where it says is that just alike in the Hebrew Bible the Witnesses are just simply those who have seen and experienced the resurrected Jesus and then they talked about it so the word witness occurs a lot of times connected to the resurrection in the New Testament so Peter will send a pulse and up and say we've witnessed the Risen Jesus and implied is that now we're talking about it so seeing seeing the resurrection and then talking about it are one event or seeing experiencing the resurrected Jesus like Paul Das but it's just still that simple Act of you just talked about what you've seen but here it just carries a lot more weight because you could be killed for it
 SEPTA being a witness or witnessing is to convince someone in a religious context to quit someone going through the story of the Bible through the lens of witness you see how it's just it's still connected to Experiencing God and then sharing that experience to that we have the word testimony given testimony that's an utterly common thing in your testimony has been detached from witnessing I mean I guess but witnessing really is that convincing testimony is kind of us a nice little share your way to get in the door so that you can then give the logical arguments seal the deal Witnesses about your testimony about you experience something and then you throw a different culture that you did but what I see in your body like
 is there was like a pressure and what I'm saying about powerful experiences I've had in my life I don't feel pressure to share it's just the most normal thing in the world cuz it's a powerful experience the ad did you two talk about it. What else do we have to talk about except things that matter to us just natural sharing about something you've experienced natural like we said it's very weighty it's high as the whole story of the Bible together as like God's plan for communicating who he is as selecting witnesses to share so Jesus becomes a chief witness and then he commissions his disciples to witness it. It's part of being a follower of Jesus is carrying that one thing I'm looking down in your notes here then that makes sense of a lot of
 these other examples where people's actions bear witness to their character yeah to have a good witness could also just be to be a commendable character so it could be talking about something but just like how an object can be a witness maybe it can also be just your person how you represent God by what you do or is that what you're saying I'm going for and there may be some other words to be brought and there's the word tested or documents or documents though which means trustworthy it's has been tested as trustworthy which means that the kind of witness and it's referring to someone's character somebody is having character that is testable and hear people in Hebrews 11 people's behavior act trust in God are a kind of Whitney
 yeah testimony to the god they represent so it's mostly a verbal yeah you bear witness means but the life your way of life can also be a kind of witness to the truth about God's kingdom I live this way because I believe in God's Kingdom Come and Jesus my actions then become a kind of witness it's a great way to frame existence is it not a way that I typically do walk around thinking to myself as a witness I'm just trying to imagine how that might shape me or my day if I if I kind of had that Paradigm to be a witness of something it's an important task you can call to a courtroom to be a witness preparing for that like in your psyche
 time would it take a car accident and then leaving my number and then the person called and wanted story a night if it felt like really significant like this right now and I'm you know someone's getting in trouble because of what I said. Kind of waiting this of of that identity what would that be if I carried that with me I kind of have something going there with the spices in it it's in their name I think related ideas to what you're you're saying would be like representing. I don't know if you or I'm going to be partnering with him I think those are related ideas and in the storyline in the end it out to me
 that within the first 10 minutes of my being awake and walking around the house every morning what I do everyday is make coffee apparently the first thing that I do and so I was just thinking about this for their little observations about me you know over these years my actions bear witness what I prioritize first thing is in a way my actions are a witness that coffee is the biggest the most important thing to me even for man coffee my hopes up but I was just thinking about that pointed out and then I was think about what you're saying my actions are constantly bearing witness about what I value the most what I believe is ultimately to buy opium I understand the other day was like I'll put my socks on standing up in the closet and it goes hard
 because that you usually put your socks on sitting on the bed and I was like you notice how I put my socks in the air like a gang banger paid attention he's looking at your testimony me how I live life what do you know Stephen said sometimes you sit right there on the bed and sometimes you sit over there on that show that's like oh my goodness so all this came from you are kind of going in this direction that if you thought of your day today habit patterns of behavior as a form of bearing witness how does that change your life in your well I wasn't even thinking that but my character is a witness I'm just thinking in terms of my role is to is to witness not into
 if someone and say hey can I try to convince you of something but that my identities could have wrapped up in that I have I have something a perspective an experience that I want other people to understand I want to shape how people see the world and I I mean I think we think of that in terms of being an ambassador of Christ I think is a term that the Russians use but even there at least of these words can get very flat out very quick and just thinking of myself again just if you were summoned to be a witness in a courtroom I would take that really weak thinking about how I'm going to be a witness and the importance of that and yeah a little bit
 what it is and also how when you see the whole storyline of scripture that God wants this group of witnesses who experienced him and then talk about it to imagine being a part of that story line even today that's that's an interesting feeling and thank you for writing a script Yeah Yeah Yeahs video will come out sometime this fall or early winter, and I kind of a dual work-study gospel word study witness a pair and I'm excited for it
