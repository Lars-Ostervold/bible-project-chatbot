God’s Wrath in the Teaching of Jesus  
Character of God E9
October 12, 2020, 43.17  
Speakers in the audio /f.shortile: Jon Collins, Tim Mackie, Carissa Quinn
Jon: This is Jon at BibleProject. I like to picture Jesus as a kind, gentle, peaceful, 
the love your enemy, care for the poor Jesus. And yes, Jesus is those things.
Tim:  What tends to happen, though, for people who get really excited about that 
aspect of His message teaching, we tend to overlook or underemphasize 
a consistent drumbeat alongside that good news, which was warnings of 
that separation act of judgment that was ahead for the Israel of His day. 
Jon: Like this warning. “Everyone who hears these words of mine and 
does not act on them will be like a foolish man who’s built his house 
on the sand. The rain fell, the /f.shortloods came, and the winds blew and 
slammed against that house, and it fell. And great was its fall.”
Tim:  Jesus thinks there’s a /f.shortlood coming, and another 
Sodom and Gomorrah type thing coming.
Jon: You see, God made a covenant relationship with Israel, and Israel has not 
held up their end of the covenant. In the past, this led to the Babylonian 
exile, Israel overtaken by an enemy nation, a /f.shortlood of God’s anger. But now 
in Jesus’ day, the same problem persists. Will Israel /f.shortinally become the 
faithful covenant partner? Or will another /f.shortlood come, this time by Rome?
Tim:  This has taken me years to process. That Jesus’ warnings aren’t 
about heaven or hell the way I was taught to think about it in a 
kind of a more individualistic package of the Christian message. 
He was a prophet to Israel, just like Jeremiah and Ezekiel’s warning 
of a /f.shortlood in the form of a pagan oppressor. And that God was still 
angry, but He sent Jesus as the ultimate act of favorite good news 
to announce good news, to form this new covenant family. But He 
said, “Listen, if you don’t follow me, Rome’s going to take us out.”
 So there’s a whole thread of passages where He continues on this theme. 
When He rides in as a triumphal entry on the donkey and Luke 19, He’s 
weeping over the city. But what Jesus says is, “If you had known, even 00:00:00
00:01:00
00:02:00  2this day, the things that would make for peace, but now they’ve been 
hidden from your eyes. Your days will come when enemies will throw up 
barricades against you, surround you, have you in, level you to the ground, 
you, your children, leaving not one stone upon another because you 
didn’t realize at the time of God’s visitation, that God came to visit you.”
Jon: Today we look at Jesus’ warnings of God’s judgments against Israel.
Tim:  By situating Jesus in His historical context, we don’t lose Jesus. 
We actually get more of His message and more of what His 
heartbeat was about, which was that Israel was destroying itself, 
and He was trying to help them /f.shortind a di/uniFB00erent way forward.
Jon: Thanks for joining us. Here we go. 
 All right, this is the fourth episode talking about anger. Divine anger. 
We’re talking about it because it’s the center attribute that God gives 
Himself in the story in Exodus 34, where God says, “I’m gracious and 
compassionate, slow to anger, full of loyal love and faithfulness.” So 
we’ve been really sitting and talking about God being slow to anger 
for a while because this is a really di/f_f.shorticult topic for people and there’s 
a lot to wade through. And we’re trying to do it in a careful way.
 We’ve talked through the whole story of the Old Testament, and we’ve 
looked at many ways that God’s anger and His judgment manifest 
themselves. We’re not going to do a recap on this episode. So if you haven’t 
been following along, I recommend that you go back and listen to the 
conversation. But we’re going to jump into the story of Jesus and talk about 
how God’s judgment and anger plays there. So we have Tim and Carissa.
Tim:  Hello. 
Jon: Hi, guys. 
Carissa:  Hi.
Jon: Tim, why don’t you get us rockin’? 
Tim:  Yes. I’m not going to recap but I do want to start us with an idea that 
will kind of ski jump up and into the story of Jesus. The storyline of 
the Hebrew Bible on the narrative level of the people of Abraham 
getting into the land, being unfaithful, exile to Babylon, and when 
they return, that’s not that awesome. However, the prophets were 
convinced that God’s going to ful/f.shortill that promise to Abraham. He’s 
going to ful/f.shortill His promises to David and to our ancestors.
 So the prophets, like Isaiah or often in the Psalms, they’ll talk 
about that God’s anger may come. And when it comes, it’s intense  00:03:00
00:04:00  3because He gives us over to our enemies. But He will eventually 
be compassionate or show compassion once again. 
 So, in corporate level, you get a beautiful statement of this and Isaiah 54, 
where God is addressing the people and he says to them in verse 7, “For 
a brief moment I forsook you, but with great compassion...” That’s that 
“womb” word that you let us through, Carissa. “...compassion, I will gather 
you in a /f.shortlood of anger.” Notice the reference to the /f.shortlood. A /f.shortlood of waters. 
“...in the /f.shortlood of anger I hid my face from you for a moment, but with 
eternal loyal love I will have compassion on you.” This is like what the days 
of Noah were to me. “When I swore that the waters of Noah wouldn’t /f.shortlood 
the earth again, so I swear that I will not be angry with you or rebuke you.”
 So notice, we’re going all the way back to that /f.shortirst and most 
cosmic act of God’s judgment in the story. Here, the exile to 
Babylon is being likened to the /f.shortlood. Isn’t that interesting?
Carissa:  Yeah.
Tim:  It’s a /f.shortlood of anger. And just like in the /f.shortlood story, God saved a remnant 
that He showed compassion to so that a new humanity could be born 
out of it. So the implication is here. That’s what it’s like too. You get 
statements of this all over the prophets. That exile was terrible, but it’s 
not the end. You get statements of this on a personal level in the Psalms, 
where the poet will take that corporate story and see it at work in their 
own lives. It’s actually famous Bible verse. I’ll just look at Psalm 30.
 Psalm 30:2, the poet says, “O Lord my God, I cried to you for help, 
and you healed me. O Lord, you brought my life up from the pit; you 
have kept me alive so that I don’t go down to the pit. Sing praise to 
the Lord, you, His godly ones, give thanks to his name. His anger 
is for a moment, but his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping might last 
for the night, but shouts of joy come in the morning.” So good. 
Carissa:  So, in the Hebrew Bible, it’s like the circumstances are showing the 
consequence for worshipping other gods or turning away from God and 
Him handing them over. The circumstances are all about that. But there’s 
this really strong thread of hope throughout and God’s compassion 
that He won’t abandon them because of His loyal love. His chesed.
Tim:  Yeah, that’s right.
Jon: What do you think the interplay here is between... In Exodus 34, He’s 
slow to anger. Here, His anger is for a moment. Which isn’t about 
how quickly He gets angry but how long He stays angry for.
Tim:  Yeah, yeah. It’s as if they’re saying when God does get angry...He doesn’t 00:05:00
00:06:00
00:07:00  4like being angry and doesn’t want to be. So it’s nothing compared to the 
eternity of His loyal love. You could use spatial metaphors. His anger is 
like a drop, but His loyal love is like an ocean or something. But you get 
the idea. The point is to say, in comparison to His eternal covenant love 
for creation, even moments of His judgment and anger are temporary, 
and always aimed at a higher goal I guess it’s the way to say it.
Jon: And what’s interesting, too, in the Psalm is it begins with, “I cried 
out, you healed me.” There is this seek and you shall /f.shortind, knock the 
door will be opened. There’s this like when we ask, when we turn 
back to God, He turns to us. So if God is angry for a moment and 
we turn away from what’s making Him angry, there’s His favor.
Tim:   Yeah. That’s the restorative role of God’s anger. 
Carissa:  Yeah. To my mind, that’s also where it interacts with compassion, with 
the attribute, or maybe other attributes as well. But compassion was 
so tied to the idea of crying out and God hearing the cry and being 
compelled to respond, that if He’s angry, and people cry out to Him or 
turn to Him, they can rely on His compassion, that He hears their cry.
Tim:  We haven’t actually brought this up yet in this conversation, 
but all three of us are parents of little kids. A lot of crying.
Carissa:  A lot of crying. 
Tim:  We’ve been really helped by a series of parenting 
books called Love and Logic.
Jon: Right. Yeah.
Tim:  One of the basic principles is when you’re trying to address your child’s 
behavior, and help them show that it’s not okay to make a decision, one 
model of bringing punishment or consequences is to just assign that 
consequence. But the love and logic approach is it takes more e/uniFB00ort and 
creativity. But to try and show the logical outcome of that decision. 
 So if they’re /f.shortighting and going to get into a /f.shortight over Legos, then 
don’t take away getting to watch TV. Take away the Legos. When 
you /f.shortight over Legos, you lose the privilege of Legos for an hour. 
That kind of thing, whatever. When you don’t get your dishes, 
then you end up cleaning everybody’s dishes for a week. That 
kind of thing. It’s that inner logic of act and consequence. 
 But I’m thinking about these poems that we’re looking at. Even when 
I’ve taken the Legos away for an hour, and they’re weeping and crying, I 
cannot wait to give the Legos back. I don’t want to be angry, I don’t want 
to be frustrated with them. And there have been multiple times where 00:08:00
00:09:00
00:10:00  5I feel like I’m getting punished because I don’t get to play with Legos 
for an hour now. And it’s like, “Oh, we were going to build Legos this 
afternoon and you guys did that, and now we don’t get to play Legos.” 
And I’m bummed. So my anger is also but for a moment compared to the 
perpetual goodwill I have for my kids. That’s what I’m going for here.
 Again, the whole reason I’m bringing this up is even though the storyline of 
the Hebrew Bible ends tragically, there’s also this pattern of God, continuing 
to go back and give another chance, and give another chance. It ramps 
up the expectation. “There’s got to be some resolution here.” This tees us 
up perfectly for the story of Jesus who comes announcing primarily that 
that time of favor, and God’s eternal loyal love after the exile, it’s now. 
Section break  
Tim:  Okay, we made it to Jesus. 
Jon: Right.
Tim:   Well, actually not yet. I /f.shortirst want to talk about John the Baptist 
for a second. So if we just start reading the gospels, Matthew, 
Mark, and Luke, every one of them is going to, in the narrative, /f.shortirst 
introduce us to a guy named John the Baptizer. John the Baptizer 
has a message about God’s wrath, about His hot anger. 
 He famously goes down to this river, and he’s calling people to turn. 
It’s a restoration movement. He goes down to the river, the same river 
that all of the people had to cross through to enter into the land in the 
/f.shortirst place. It’s like he’s rebooting the whole story, and making Israel go 
through the river again. Thirst and washing and repentance and so on. 
 But then he sees a bunch of leaders of Jerusalem and the temple coming 
to him. This is what he says to them. “You are the babies of snakes.” Or 
brood of vipers. Like the lion. But because the baby snakes. You’re seeds 
of the snake. “Who warned you all to /f.shortlee from the anger that is coming, 
from the wrath to come? Bear fruit, keeping with repentance, and don’t 
think you can just say, ‘Oh, Abraham is our ancestor.’ Listen, God could 
raise up children for Abraham from these stones. The axe is laid at the 
root of the trees. Every tree that doesn’t bear good fruit is going to be 
cut down, thrown into the /f.shortire.” You’re like, “Whoa, John the Baptizer.”
 This is classic role of God’s anger that He sees is going to culminate 
in some act of judgment. So the Gospels begin with the portrait of 
picking up...John represents a new Jeremiah, or a new Ezekiel, saying, 
“We’re going to go through it all again. There’s a whole new movement 
of God’s anger coming.” He’s activating the whole story. People’s 00:11:00
00:12:00
00:13:00
00:14:00  6unfaithfulness. He calls the leaders of Jerusalem serpent’s seed. So God’s 
going to have to clean house all over again, just like He did in the days 
of Jeremiah. He uses the language of divine anger to talk about it.
Carissa:  It’s a warning.
Tim:  Oh, there’s warning. It doesn’t have to be this way. It 
could go di/uniFB00erently. That’s a good point. 
Carissa:  Yeah.
Jon: This has always been hard for me. When you pick 
up a gospel and you’re ready to get to...
Tim:  Good news?
Jon: Yeah. I have this framework of, okay, Jesus is coming to heal and to give, 
and to sacri/f.shortice. The way John sets it up here is very di/uniFB00erent. I mean, 
you didn’t go on to read but he...Are you going to read the rest here? 
Tim:  Got it. Well, then he starts talking about “one who is coming after me.”
Jon: And that person...?
Tim:  Yeah. He says is going to immerse y’all with the Holy Spirit. Hooray!
Jon: That sounds nice.
Tim:  Yeah. And with /f.shortire. Well, it depends. Fire burns away 
but it also puri/f.shorties. Remember the purifying? 
Carissa:  Mm hmm. 
Tim:  But then he goes on. He says, “The one who comes after me, His 
winnowing fork is in His hand. He’s going to clear the threshing /f.shortloor 
and gather wheat into the barn, but burn up the cha/uniFB00 with /f.shortire.
Jon: Yeah.
Tim:  I’m so glad you’re bringing this up, Jon. What John is activating is the whole 
Old Testament covenant-breaking, God getting angry and handing Israel 
over. But repent because it could go di/uniFB00erently. And there is somebody 
coming who is going to create a fork in the road moment for us all, because 
he sees himself as just preparing the way. So you’re right. Jesus, while He 
does have good news to o/uniFB00er, that good news is itself a part of a bigger 
package of another prophetic warning. What usually happens is that all 
of this imagery in John’s message gets picked up by especially Protestant 
readers and we just instantly start talking about life after death. This is about 
what happens to you after you die. That’s not what John’s talking about.
Jon: How do you know that? 00:15:00  7Tim:  It’s the leaders of Jerusalem who are coming to him...
Jon: Yeah, He’s talking to the leaders of Jerusalem.
Tim:  ...and he’s telling them this message. He’s another Jeremiah. 
He’s another Ezekiel. His message is for Jerusalem. It’s for the 
people of Israel. And we’re still in that storyline here.
Jon: Yeah. 
Carissa:  So, is that a warning about being handed over? 
Tim:  Right. The whole thing is assumed. What does it mean to say the axes at 
the trees or there’s unquenchable /f.shortire coming and divine anger on the 
leaders of Jerusalem? I’m already supposed to know what all that means. 
I guess that’s my point here is this just assumed that you know the story 
that you’re stepping into. Who is always the agent of God’s anger when He 
gets angry with His people and the leaders of His people? It’s always some 
foreign nation. Some pagan oppressor that God gives people over to. And 
I wonder if there’s any of those around at the moment. Oh, yes. Right. And 
they’re going to play a big role in the story to come—the Roman Empire. 
 So I just /f.shortind is good to translate these metaphors into the concrete, 
historical situation that the gospel authors are inviting us into here.
Carissa:  Yeah, it’s interesting to see the consistency between the Old Testament 
and New Testament, especially along this theme. Because I think a lot 
of times we come to the New Testament and think, oh, it’s so di/uniFB00erent 
than the Hebrew Bible, especially this theme of anger or judgment.
Jon: Let me try to restate then what John the Baptizer is saying here. He’s 
saying to the religious leaders, “I’m asking you to repent.” This isn’t a 
repentance movement. That’s what this baptism is for. But after me, 
there’s someone coming, and He has a baptism of God’s Spirit and 
/f.shortire.” Then he uses this metaphor of threshing /f.shortloor. It’s a farming thing, 
right? This is where you take all the wheat? Is it? Would it be wheat?
Tim:  Yeah, that’s right. 
Jon: You bring it in, and then you’ve got to get the grain away from the...
Tim:  Yeah, you separate. It’s the act of separation.
Jon: Separating the good stu/uniFB00 from the bad stu/uniFB00. And then you’re going 
to burn up the cha/uniFB00 because you don’t need it anymore. So Jesus 
is the one with that winnowing fork. He’s the one going to separate. 
Are you  saying that this separation is connected to divine anger? 
Tim:  Well, yes, that’s right. We have to go all the way back to the /f.shortlood. Even 00:17:00
00:18:00
00:18:00  8though the /f.shortlood was not an act of anger, it was the act of sorrow and grief, 
but it separated those who ruined the land through violence and bloodshed 
from Noah, who was righteous and blameless. It was the separating. The 
point is every time that God brings an act of judgment in the Old Testament, 
there is always the righteous remnant theme that comes out the other 
side and becomes the basis for the new group of people that God is going 
to work with. Really almost every single line in John’s message contains 
the image or metaphor or wording from the Hebrew prophets. He’s like a 
spokesman for the whole message of the Hebrew prophets right here.
Jon: And he’s saying, “I’m asking all of Israel to come and repent.” 
Tim:  Correct. 
Jon: What Jesus is going to do is He’s going to say separate a remnant of Israel, 
who God is going to use moving forward. So be prepared for that.”
Tim:  That’s right. It’s setting you up for the story of Jesus. So you 
can’t end here. You have to now go read the story and be like, 
“How is Jesus going to cause a separation in Israel?” Is Jesus 
going to announce giving over that God’s going to do?
Jon: Yeah. What’s the /f.shortlood that’s going to come? Or 
who’s the Babylon that’s going to come?
Tim:  Totally. All right. Let’s keep going. 
Section break 
Tim:  Let’s go to Luke’s Gospel. When Jesus /f.shortinally goes public in Luke 4, 
something very interesting. Jesus does give many warnings, but He 
almost never mentions God’s anger. He overwhelmingly talks about 
God’s generosity, mercy, care, and love. So in that sense, He’s di/uniFB00erent 
than John the Baptizer. He wants His whole message to be characterized 
as an announcement of the good news of God’s kingdom.
 In Luke 4, this is signi/f.shorticant, I think. He goes to Nazareth, His hometown, and 
He’s given them the scroll of Isaiah. He opens up to what we call chapter 61. 
I think you just know it as that part of the scroll. We didn’t have numbers. 
So He starts quoting, saying, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me. He’s anointed 
me to give good news to the poor, to proclaim release to the captives, 
recovery of sight to the blind, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor. 
You rolled up the scroll and said, “Today this is ful/f.shortilled in your hearing.”
 If you go back to Isaiah 61 that He’s is quoting from, He left out one 
line from the paragraph that He just quoted. Does that make sense?00:20:00
 00:21:21
00:22:00  9Carissa:  Yeah.
Tim:  He ended too early. The line that He left out, the /f.shortirst half of it is to 
proclaim the year of Yahweh’s favor, and also the day of our God’s 
vengeance. He leaves that out. I think this is highly signi/f.shorticant.
Jon: He’s (unintelligible).
Tim:  Oh, yeah. Got it. Okay. I don’t think that’s what’s happening. 
Jon: Okay.
Tim:  No, He was not afraid to take people o/uniFB00. I think he’s signaling something 
here. That He’s going to start a movement that He sees is happening within 
a really narrow window of time. He’s going to start this movement that He’s 
going to call the Good News movement. And it’s going to be for all of the 
outsiders, for everybody. The current temple regime says is on the outs 
with God, and they’re good with God because they run the temple. It’s the 
opposite, Jesus is going to say. So He’s going to have this little window of 
time before the day of vengeance comes, which is that day of wrath that 
John was talking about. The only thing He has to o/uniFB00er for this new thing 
is good news, man. Good news. Let’s have a good news party before...
Jon: Before the vengeance comes?
Tim:  Before the vengeance comes.
Carissa:  So He’s not saying that He’s doing something to deal with the 
vengeance of God here. He’s just saying this is the good news time? 
Tim:  There’s two stages to this. 
Carissa:  Okay.
Tim:  And we are at the favor, good news stage before the time of 
anger when Jerusalem will be handed over to its enemies.
Jon: In Isaiah, one of those two senses are paired. What is it referring to? How 
can you have the year of Yahweh’s favor and the vengeance of God?
Tim:  Totally. It’s called the Day of Atonement is what it’s called. I’m still working on 
this, but it’s becoming clear to me that the Day of Atonement is like the key 
to everything. But I say that about everything in the Bible. Because the Day 
of Atonement is the day when the blameless lamb is o/uniFB00ered up and goes up 
to God to represent me before God and all of its blamelessness. And God 
chose favor and accepts me because of my righteous representative. But on 
that same day, as the day of God’s favor, the other goat is loaded up with the 
sins of Israel and sent into exile into the wilderness. The day of vengeance. 
Jon: The scapegoat.00:22:53
00:23:00
00:24:00
00:25:00  10Tim:  So they’re not separate things. When God deals with evil, He will be 
both merciful and just. I think that was buried in that little line right 
there. That’s my hunch at least. I think that’s how Jesus viewed it as 
well based on how He echoes and plays the Psalm in the story.
Section break  
Tim:  Okay. If you just follow Jesus’ teachings from here, I just want to refer 
back to previous podcast series, maybe like our Luke, Acts series, where 
we really hone in on Jesus’ message of good news and announcement 
for the kingdom, inclusion of all of these undesirable people. This is 
the stu/uniFB00 that people love about Jesus. It’s the stu/uniFB00 I love about Jesus. It 
makes me proud to be associated with Him and to read the stories.
 What tends to happen, though, is for people who get really 
excited about that aspect of His message and teaching, we 
tend to overlook or underemphasize a consistent drumbeat 
alongside that good news, which was warnings of that separation, 
act of judgment that was ahead for the Israel of His day. 
Carissa:  Yeah, totally.
Tim:  I’m just going to have a look at some di/uniFB00erent examples. For example, the 
Sermon on the Mount ends with a warning to listen to my words. It’s the 
famous parable of the house on the rock. “Everyone who hears my words 
and does them is like the person building house on the rock. Everybody 
who doesn’t is like the person who builds her house on the sand.” Then he 
describes the /f.shortlood—the rain spell. The /f.shortlood came. Wind blows, slamming 
against the house, it fell, and great was its fall. There’s a /f.shortlood coming. “If you 
don’t follow my way of being the New Jerusalem, the light on the hill to Israel 
that God wants to have represent him to the nations, if you don’t do it my 
way, the /f.shortlood coming, and it’s going to take away your house. It’s a warning. 
Carissa:  Yeah. So the purpose of these is more clear. John the Baptist and what 
Jesus says, they’re warnings that are meant to cause people to repent. 
I mean, I guess that’s clear in the Prophets too in the Hebrew Bible. 
Tim:  In this case, what it means to repent is to live by the Sermon on 
the Mount, and Jesus’ way of embodying the kingdom of God. 
But it comes with pretty high stakes warning at the end.
Jon: Right. 
Tim:  When Jesus in Matthew 10, sends out His disciples so that they go start 
announcing the kingdom like He was doing, He has this whole little 
section where He says, “Listen, if there are some people in a town that 00:26:00
00:27:00
00:28:00  11don’t want to listen to you, they kick you out and they like, ‘We don’t want 
to hear what Jesus has to say. We don’t want to hear about the kingdom 
of God,’ then there’s that famous line, “Shake the dust of your feet o/uniFB00 at 
the city.” I don’t know why I’m laughing. I think it was really serious.
Jon: It’s just funny to think of someone doing that in a real way.
Tim:  Totally.
Jon: “Oh, really? You don’t want me here? Well, I’m just going to shake sandals.”
Tim:  But then what he says is, “Shake the dust your feet o/uniFB00. Truly I say 
it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of 
judgment than for that city.” Oh, well, we know how that went for 
Sodom and Gomorrah. So Jesus thinks there’s a /f.shortlood coming and 
another Sodom and Gomorrah type thing coming. The only way 
to avoid it is if Israel starts living by the Sermon on the Mount.
Jon: Because that’s what they would be going out and 
teaching people city to city as well.
Tim:  The Sermon on the Mount. That’s right. To live by the Sermon on the Mount 
is to live by the ethic and the values of God’s kingdom. Matthew 11, there’s 
two towns that kick Jesus out. They didn’t listen to His message. One is a 
town called Chorazin, one is called Bethsaida. He repeats it. Actually, He 
sounds just like Isaiah or Jeremiah here. He pronounces woes over the 
cities. He says, “Woe to you Chorazin. Woe to you Bethsaida.  If I had gone 
up to Tyre and Sidon and did the miracles there, they would have repented 
long ago.” He goes, “O Capernaum, if I went to Sodom and did miracles, 
they would have repented. But no, you won’t be brought...” Oh, this is 
interesting. Look at this. He says, “No, Capernaum, you won’t be exalted up 
into the skies. You’re going to descend into the grave.” He’s not talking to 
individuals here. He’s talking about a whole town. He’s is going to the grave.
Tim:  What does that mean? 
Jon: I don’t know. What does it mean?
Tim:  I’m trying to set up the puzzle here. Jesus keeps thinking 
that something terrible is going to happen if Israel doesn’t 
follow Him and live by the Sermon on the Mount.
Jon: There’s a storm coming. 
Tim:  There’s a storm coming, a /f.shortlood, /f.shortire, descending to the grave. What 
is it? Well, let’s look at a couple of statements where he becomes a lot 
more clear. This is in Luke 13. This is only in Luke. So it’s not one of the 
more familiar sayings of Jesus. Some people come to Jesus and they 00:29:00  
00:30:00  12tell Him a story about some Galileans, who had gone down to Jerusalem 
to o/uniFB00er sacri/f.shortices. These Galileans had their blood mixed with their 
sacri/f.shortices by Pilate, the Roman governor. They’re alluding to a riot that 
took place in Jerusalem. Josephus the Jewish historian talks about this. 
Jon: Oh, okay.
Tim:  It was a riot that happened in the temple, and Pilate just sent 
in the guards and they just slayed everybody. So when he 
says their blood is mixed with their sacri/f.shortices, it’s literal.
Carissa:  Wow. 
Jon: Hmm.
Tim:  The Romans sent in the tanks and just mowed down a bunch of 
people in the temple courts as they’re bringing their o/uniFB00erings.
Jon: Oh, wow. I thought it was talking about some just strange cult practice. 
Tim:  No, he’s referring to the tragic outbreak of 
Roman violence against the people.
Jon: Okay. 
Tim:  And then Jesus said to them, “Do you think that the people from Galilee who 
just happened to be there o/uniFB00ering your sacri/f.shortices and they were caught 
up in this riot, do you think that they were worse o/uniFB00? Greater sinners than 
the other Galileans because this happened to them? No, I tell you. Unless 
y’all, unless we all return, you all are going to perish in the same way.”
Carissa:  So here He’s specifying more that they will perish 
at the hand of Rome or the leaders?
Tim:  Yes. He’s not talking about heaven or hell.
Jon: The storm is the destruction of Jerusalem. 
Tim:  This has taken me years to process. That Jesus’ warnings aren’t about 
heaven or hell the way I was taught to think about it in the kind of a more 
individualistic package of the Christian message. He was a prophet. More 
than a prophet, but a prophet to Israel, just like Jeremiah and Ezekiel 
warning of a /f.shortlood in a storm coming in the form of a pagan oppressor. 
And that God was still angry. But He sent Jesus as this ultimate act of 
favor and good news to announce good news, to form this new covenant 
family. But he said, “Listen, if you don’t follow me, Rome is going to 
take us out just like Pilate did to them.” So there’s a whole thread of 
passages in the Gospel of Luke where He continues on this theme.
 When He rides in at the triumphal entry on the donkey and Luke 19, He’s 00:31:00
00:32:00
00:33:00  13weeping over the city. We depicted this in the video. I’m really proud of that 
moment. His tear drops down. This is what Alan, one of our animators...His 
tear drops down onto the burning of Jerusalem. So what Jesus says is, “If 
you had known even this day the things that would make for peace, but now 
they’ve been hidden from your eyes. Your days will come when enemies will 
throw up barricades against you surround you, hand you in, level you to the 
ground, you, your children, leaving not once a stone upon another because 
you didn’t realize the time of God’s visitation, that God came to visit you.”
 So there is one more. Actually, He does come to the vengeance part. 
When He is announcing the destruction of Jerusalem in Luke chapter 
21, He says, “When you see Jerusalem, surrounded by armies, He calls 
that the time of vengeance, the days of vengeance. Which remember 
in His quotation of Isaiah 61, He left out the vengeance for this 
moment. So I don’t know. These passages made me uncomfortable. 
I underemphasized them for a long time, and I realized I need to stop 
doing that. I need to really understand what Jesus was getting at.
Jon: He was saying, “Look, I’m bringing this ful/f.shortillment to the story of the 
Hebrew Bible into the whole story of Israel. And the story has been 
that God has made this covenant with us as the nation of Israel, and 
we keep turning away from it. So there’s this pattern of God’s anger or 
judgment, and a remnant that comes through. John the Baptist sets 
up Jesus as this is kind of the /f.shortinal...This is the /f.shortinal time that’s going to 
happen. That there’s going to be a threshing and a separation and He’s 
going to be like this climax of that. These warnings to his fellow Israelites 
are in that light of like, “This is happening, this is go time. This is it.”
Tim:  In the light of that, what does Jesus have in mind when He says, “But 
if you listen to my words, you’re building your house on the rock. The 
winds may come and the storms rage, but that house will stand.” Why 
is living by the Sermon on the Mount...If all Israel were to do that, why 
would they avoid getting toasted by Rome? Are you with me? I’m trying 
to play out like what did what does Jesus think He’s doing that? 
Carissa:  Is there a related question what was Israel doing that was 
going to inevitably cause this Roman attack?
Tim:  Yeah. What path is Israel on? Like Zedekiah breaking his treaty 
with Nebuchadnezzar, what is Israel doing? Well, man, there’s 
revolutionaries around. Rebellion is in the air. Isn’t it interesting that 
a huge theme in the Sermon on the Mount and in Jesus’ teachings 
is about non-violence towards your enemies? Nonviolent resistance 
to structures of evil, and to love and bless your enemies?00:34:00
00:35:00
00:36:00  14Carissa:  So now it’s this guy on the margins, one of the oppressed people 
who are saying the solution is to love your Roman enemies. 
Section break  
Jon: So we’re talking about Jesus, though, in terms of this peaceful, political 
revolutionary character. It’s actually cool. It’s nice to set that stage. That 
when you said that there’s rebellion in the air, you can kind of picture Jesus 
walking through these towns and or being at Jerusalem and realizing like, 
“Oh, man, things are tense, and this can all fall apart. So I want to help 
my nation live in such a way that we can bless our enemies, and then 
actually become the people of God that we’re supposed to be.” But if we 
stop there, it feels like we’re just making Jesus just a sin of the Prophet.
Tim:  That’s right. So we can’t stop there. We have to take the step. The next 
step is when Jesus rides into Jerusalem crying. That’s His moment of 
realizing that the leaders of Israel have rejected Him. The moment He 
rides into Jerusalem is the point where He realizes there’s no return. 
He went around announcing. John came giving a chance for Israel 
turn. But He goes into Jerusalem knowing that it’s game over. 
Carissa:  It’s like the end that has come up before Him.
Tim:  Yes. The end of Jerusalem has come up before Him. So what he is 
going to do is He times His arrival of Passover, and He is going to put 
Himself in the place of His enemies and force their hand to kill Him 
so that He can o/uniFB00er his life as a righteous intercessor on behalf of His 
own sinful people. And in so doing, He sees Himself drinking the cup 
that Jeremiah talked about. The cup of the wine of God’s anger.
 I think that’s where we can go just in our next step. I think I want to go and 
read some stories about Jesus in the Last Supper. Once you see them in 
light of this whole theme, they just really kind of shine with new meaning 
and signi/f.shorticance. But I think it’s good just to take a pause and recognize 
that by situating Jesus in His historical context, we don’t lose Jesus. We 
actually get more of His message and more of what His heartbeat was 
about, which was that Israel was destroying itself. He was trying to help 
them /f.shortind a di/uniFB00erent way forward, and He realized that human nature is 
too consistent. But that didn’t prevent Him from trying to stand in the 
gap on behalf of His sinful people. And that’s the next part of the story.
Jon: Great. Thanks for listening to this episode of the BibleProject podcast.

 We’ve recently launched season Seven 7 of our videos on YouTube, and 
we’ve got two videos out already. They are the /f.shortirst two characteristics of 
God that we’ve been talking about in this series. That He is gracious and 
compassionate. You can /f.shortind those word study videos on our YouTube 
channel, youtube.com/thebibleproject, or on our website, bibleproject.com. 
Next week, we’re back to talk about Jesus taking the cup of God’s wrath.
Tim:  He intentionally goes to Jerusalem for Passover during the feast week 
when they celebrate their liberation from a pagan oppressor, Egypt. 
His point is that the way I’m going to become king over Israel and over 
the nation is by drinking the cup. So all of this has huge implications 
for how we should talk and think about how Jesus understood 
His death. What did Jesus think His death meant? How did he talk 
about it? And how does that /f.shortit into this whole conversation?
Jon: Today’s episode was produced by Dan Gummel, our show notes from 
Lindsey Ponder, and the theme music from the band Tents. BibleProject 
is a crowdfunded nonpro/f.shortit. We’re in Portland, Oregon. We make free 
resources so that we can all experience the Bible as a uni/f.shortied story that 
leads to Jesus. Thank you so much for being a part of this with us.00:41:00
