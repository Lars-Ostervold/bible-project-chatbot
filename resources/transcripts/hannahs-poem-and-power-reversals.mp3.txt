we've been tracing the theme of the firstborn in the storyline of the Bible if the theme about power it's a theme about how God chooses to work with the least likely people in today's episode you will continue this theme in the scroll of Samuel where we'll find to rival wives are not siblings but they're pitted against each other in a similar way and will focus in on Hannah she's the favorite wife of her husband but she's unable to have a child so she makes a promise to God if God bless her with the son she will give her firstborn son back to serve God and listen to remind us of Abraham and how God asked of Abraham to surrender his firstborn son Isaac at the test and then the story of Hannah she's promising to pass the test even before God gives her a seven the twist here is God had the forest the surrender of
 perhaps on Isaac she's so amazing and she surrenders her life or future fortunes and says even if you give me a son I will surrender a so she's like Abraham when he finally passed the test God give Hannah a child she sing the poem in celebration of home about how God loves to choose the load then as promised and I get Samuel over to work in the Tabernacle but it turns out that the priest in charge Eli he's been turning a blind eye to his truck signs hear the story of this oppressed woman in paint and the story of this team franchise but lazy and self-indulgent priest and his son they live out exactly the inversion that and the pain talked about but it's also really at the heart discuss desire to exalt the humble and bring down the high in
 and that's how I always doubt bushes that the order of the world that's a powerful things meditate on the downfall of Eli and his sons of the tragic story because they're from the tribe of Levi who are an early example of God raising up a group of people who are the late comers and giving them power and responsibility the story of Eli and his sons shows us that God chooses people he still gives them a choice and this is a real tension that we used to go out the biblical story of Yahweh given genuine agency to his partners and when they really blow it now you can really really love it and you always will hand people over to the consequences of the same time you always won't withdraw long-term Covenant promises and purposes of people can exclude themselves and participating in the filming of those purposes
 priests the boldness of Hannah and the raising up of Samuel to serve as a priest and judge over Israel I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
John high and we are doing our thing the thing now right now in this moment is I think we're calling the first born ya know as we've explored it is broader than just stories about first born Sons but The Core theme is about the persistent pattern that God has in choosing favoring blessing somebody who doesn't seem to deserve it and elevating them to a place of prominence leadership or is often called the status or the right of the firstborn for example all of humanity of creation and not send on the last last board forgive me the last born of Creation in in the 7-Day Narrative of Genesis 1 and creatures who God says you're going to rule
 disguise in the land will rule the land real as the creatures and the creatures up in the sky and that the Elohim the hosts of Heaven they were created first they seemed a little bit more important yeah it's certainly more glorious more glorious now more powerful so that theme continues as than God continues to select someone the latecomer the second-born the you know the story of selecting all of humanity to be his image awesome but then he continues to select humans from among all the humans and that's connected to this theme of that through seed of the woman through one line of humanity God is going to raise up a messiah yeah that's right which by definition can only come through one genealogical lineage so we're tracing a lineage from which this snake crushing size in a cup
 and so who's got going to pick is he going to give the inheritance and the blessing room which is lineage will come from to the powerful to the first or not it will be seen as we've gone through the whole Torah now is that the theme is that God chooses the latecomer the second-born or the one of our status as a week 10 simple as got uses the lower one they turn out to be great even though they're not the most powerful know they oftentimes are the biggest problem like Jacob got his deal with them so the first version is problematic Elder sibling who doesn't get picked up the cane pattern the Jacob pattern is the younger one who gets elevated and chosen is actually like a chump and like not a very good person but then there's also
 somebody who's not the firstborn but they're also not the chosen one but they want to be so they do something you know terrible to grab that status and that's the ham pattern Genesis 9th we got all these variations that start to happen as each generation goes forward is really ripping on the relationship that siblings have with each other when one is going to be selected out to Carrie on some sort of special vocation and Mission and so in a way then it's a weight has to think about just The Human Condition and how we deal with each other when there's status issues and then also the fact that all of humanity is in some way it's Justin brothers between plans and some sort of sibling rivalry yet yeah every rivalry is certainly in the Bible
 yeah without Nations and people groups which is actually the case to just in a more genetically complicated way you know but now the the tonight record can show us but the basic intuition that's actually true that we are we are all related I'm thinking back to our conversations with Joshua's want me to ask about the genealogical Adam and Eve if I was an interview we did a couple years ago I still think about that conversation so that's the theme that were tracing and we win the last episode got up through essentially The Sibling stats in the stories of these rivalries in the Torah with Aaron's sons and ending with talking about Moses and Aaron yep Israel as the firstborn over Egypt yeah yeah and then Aaron's sons and their kind of birth order and the dynamic between them
 we're going to go in this conversation is touchdown at just a couple spots we could stash in the profits for a long time and I guess I'm going to force us to just condense it into one conversation famous last words but the story of Hannah and the birth of Samuel at the beginning of Samuel scroll is a fascinating creative Twist on all of these twists and that's deeply connected to the story that will lead to the rise of David Samuel will be picked to go anointed Israel's second king but as far as God is concerned it's their first real king who will do what God desires in those two stories have the second version of the firstborn and got the elevation of the unexpected one like that the heart of these two stories in the sets the pattern continues the pattern will we get carried on into the writing prophets about their expectation
 becoming a Crusher who will be in a similar Samuel and David like and most fight kind of figure
so this is a story I don't think we've ever read aloud and meditated on so excited one of my favorite stories and he would love this so we are at the beginning of Samuel scroll Israel has crossed into the land that's Joshua and when we get to Joshua we get into the section of the Bible call the prophets and we call it the former prophets in the latter yeah yeah where the former part of theirs for collections in each parts of the prophets the former prophets for Scrolls Joshua Judges Samuel Wings by Maxwell the last two too long for one scroll so that they got divided so they can six girls but as for literary works in the butt of their all United Joshua tench of Samuel King and then there's for collections of the writing process Isaiah Jeremiah is Ezekiel and then the 12th the 12th for former Prophets
 so we're right in the middle ish of the former prophets correct scroll Israelites went in to the promised land they were met with great hostility by all kinds of tribes the most Canaanites and God enable them to overcome their enemies rescued them from destruction so they could settle in the land judges is about this continue to cycle a melody of Israel turning away from God giving their allegiance to other gods and raising God raises up little mini Moses's to deliver the people first. Until they give their allegiance to the gods again so when we come to the Samuels scroll we're coming right out of Judges which is essentially a period of moral and religious disorder among Israel and so there was just a Civil War at the end of Judges that nearly annihilated one of the tribes Benjamin
 you have lots of people were giving allegiance to lots of different deities but the store is going to be gone with one family that has remained loyal to Yahweh and it's about their family store that sells Samuel begins Samuel begins in the setting of the judges. Really in a way that the Story begins with the birth of a figure who is the last of the judges at the where is actually named did not list of Israel's judges and it's describes what he does but Samuel represents a pivot between tribal leaders that God raises up like Moses you know spontaneously as more people judges are these like a tribal Chief a chieftain's Yep they're empowered the Litas real for a temporary period of time but what Samuel will be the last one of those and we'll he stands at the threshold of this real transitioning into a unified Federation of tribes under one monarchy
 which is kind of like a tribal Chieftain but more centralized more established and a Samuel ones them taxes so that's kind of deciding him so this is the first story of Samuel figure out the threshold transition figure know there was a guy certain men from promise I am Sophia from The Hill Country of after I am that is adjusted son of Joseph happening north of the city that will become Jerusalem but recent haven't even become the Central City at this guy's name was elkanah with means Alice passionate passionate the passionate one God the passionate one could be all the Creator depending on what can I mean
 or what were you think it's from is the son of Johann the son of elihu the son of toe who the son of Zeus of the tribe of Ephraim now he had two wives the name of one was Grace favor the name of the other was Coral
 Selena
 which is the reward for coral Coral like in the ocean like coral reef Coral favor and coral Coral she had she had no children she's the favored one we don't know that yet well her name is favored turn out that she's special one so we're clearly in the realm of the theme of the firstborn two wives and children ones not so we're back here to Abraham's two wives Sarah and Hagar and then to Jacobs two wives and that for sure like you'll see this story is modeled on both of those steps of rival wives in Genesis so in this case the name of the wife was no child so Hannah is being likened to Sarah in the story and also like him to Rachel who had no children
 what you were both a favor but but they were both the favorite
 now this man how can I would go up from his City every year to worship and sacrifice to Yahweh of hosts in Shiloh to find out that the Tabernacle in the tent is located at this town Sheila nuts where the liturgies and worship for the always taking place at this town should also know that working in the tent there and Sheila are the two sons of Eli called me and then toss their priests there when I would offer a sacrifice at this annual Feast you would give gifts to family
 and you would give portions to penina his wife and all her sons and her daughters but to Hannah he gave the double portion because he loved Hannah but y'all had closed through them
 is the dishes every word here is like a glowing glowing hyperlink yeah who's favored given the double portion which is what you give the firstborn yes there's a lot in Deuteronomy talks about if a guy has two wives and he loves one more than the other he can't give the firstborn double portion to the sign of the wifey love it's the unloved wife has the actual first born son but here he's not giving the inheritance was son but you just giving you the wife that he loves here cuz she doesn't have it anytime soon so it's funny cuz he's not actually doing what the law in Deuteronomy says you're supposed to do is there supposed to not do what you're supposed to not do
 is give the double portion which is the right of the firstborn to somebody who's not the first 10 in this example if Hannah was have a kid later and elk and I was like well that's my favorite wife so now that's my favorite kid but he's not supposed to treat her kid like the first one correct but he doesn't get the double portion that sun gives it to his wife he's not doing with the so but he's so taking a thing is you would you have to really be familiar with this literature to even notice that but this phrase double portion is not a common idiom so it just occurs in a few places but the last one of them so what's interesting is the wife's name that he loves is favor and he clearly is showing favor to her but what's interesting is
 their economy and their social economy having children is a sign of favor and so she appears to be the unfavored one in the eyes of the people of Okinawa
 really interesting anyway you always not showing her favorite and here ya Yahweh Yahweh close to me with holding the favor of the Fruit of the Loom
 mursix now Hannah's rival she's not even called her name and she just called that Liz has been called her rival enemy yeah, well we talked about like other kids on the playground I don't know where it came from and you got it from reading the Bible arrival however would provoke her bitterly irritating her because the Lord the closer one but you know also handles getting a double portion that irritator to Southpoint Southpoint cuz I'm not because she's getting favored so just noticed we're just the so clearly this is about to rival wise yeah you weren't siblings but this is all the themes of the firstborn rivalry that we've been seeing all throughout the tour
 so it happen year after year you know when they would go up to the 10th that Feast as often as she went up to the house of the Lord she that is Coralwood provoke her that is and so Hannah would just see what just weep she wouldn't even want to eat and it's a feast and so Al can do for sensitive husband says Dora Hannah why are you crying why don't you eat why is there evil Badness to your heart
 aren't I better than ten Sons for you better to you than ten Sons what chump just like the jumpy thing lesson lessons and what not to say we can't have any children and your husband is like a my come on I'm better but you got me wow wow
 did get a clue of the sensitive comment because it's by the way if you're not reading along that was not in the text that was a job that was sarcasm oh yeah that was insensitive and that is what I meant not much really by using sarcasm and then Hannah Rose after eating and drinking and she loved and Eli the priest he was sitting by the door of the Temple of y'all but by the curtain
 and Hannah was just greatly distressed and so she's praying to Yahweh and weeping bitterly
 and she made a vow promise Yahweh of house she said if you will look upon the oppression of your life your maidservant interesting cuz that's Sarah oppressed Hagar exactly the same word same word as okay so what Sarah my favorite wife who had no children for Abraham this is what Sarah did to Hagar the slave who did have Abraham's first born so here is a Twist on the same exact we're used to twists and now it's the unfavored why is my favorite wife to her husband but it doesn't seem like you always shown her favor cuz she hasn't had kids you got to put the same thing with her yeah that's right so but she's the one he's the one being a press instead of being the one
 Presley pressing you. So exactly so she's like Sarah but also like Hagar this is what the Hebrew Bible scholar on Grossmont because this Dynamic analogy in other words there's a hyperlink that's comparing character in one of the local story to an earlier story but it's it's not just a 14-1 slot another words that character can be linked to multiple characters in the previous story so here she's both Sarah she doesn't have kids and she's like Hagar she's getting oppressed by a rifle example. So she says please do not forget your servant but please give your servant the Sun and if you do then I will give him do you have a
 all the days of his life and no razor will ever pass over his head and the razor B is up in the Nazarene valve yep the Nazarite vow was any Israelite does it have to be from the tribe of Levi but can take on themselves the calling and Holiness and lifestyle Hedgesville high priest I see so if God gives me a son I will pass off the Sun to the service of God as working like a high priest even though he's not in the tribe of Levi yep that's right so fascinating here is this is about if you give me a first born I will surrender first born back to Yahweh
 and this is a thing as well yeah this is Abraham and Isaac same rights as a scheme to get a first born son and oppressed the Egyptian immigrant in the process and so what y'all asked for is give me that send back and then Yahweh gets back what he was going to take the life of the Sun by offering a substitute and then they would we should be anticipating okay read a story like that and a story where she's going to get a sun she's going to give the sun over yeah and then something special is going to happen the twist here is God had to force the surrender of Abraham's first son Isaac here she's offering a few she's so amazing like she could do it she can respond a lot of ways here she goes to the temple the tent and she surrenders her life or future fortunes and says even if you give me a son I will surrender into you so she's like Abraham
 like a favor him when he finally passed the test so she's passing the test even before I didn't she didn't need that a test cuz he's just surrender at all for the test is the baroness oh thank you thank you that's exactly right the test is think that's great that's exactly it two times we've been told y'all way closer with that puts her in a very difficult situation the theme of the test is this awkward we're like is God doing that to be mean did I did he said this person up just be cruel and this is what we talked about name of the test which is not the intent in the orchestrator of a test you're trying to get someone to fail we call it a trap but if you are
 giving someone the opportunity to grow and patience endurance in virtue and loyalty then those same scenario that looks the same from the outside could actually be a test which is maybe just to name you know this is a very sensitive topic for the men and women do you know inability to have children very painful to both wisdom in the story but also I think it's important to be sensitive and not try to interpret especially for someone else that every difficult thing they've ever gone through is
 adjust a task is Justin yeah I got the really generous is really hard to feel that way when you're in the middle of some of these scenarios and who takes the tournament to know but the narrator is telling us that situation animals and this is how she responded with yeah
so I came about that she continued praying for y'all at you I was watching her mouth and she was speaking in her heart so her lips were moving but her voice was not hurt and so real I thought too much of that time in Hawaii
 so you are a sad woman how long will you make yourself drunk put away your wine and had a reply. I'm a woman oppressed in my spirit is this Russia presents. I haven't drunk either wine or any alcohol here's what I am doing I haven't poured out a drink for myself rather I am pouring out my nefesh my very being before y'all went
 that's a beautiful scene don't take me for a worthless woman who would like to come into the temple trunk I have spoken out of my great concern and over all this pain and provocation that I'm in so we have I said Go and show them may the god of Israel grant you your request is Sebastian and she said let your maidservant find yeah I am this is a short neck is a noun but it's her name so let me find something in your eyes and she went away and her face was no longer stand
 what's the story with the next sentence they Rose early in the morning and worship and return to their house and Ramon and El cunado new is wife that's a hyperlink back to Adam and Eve Adam and Eve and the birth of Cain and Abel and the Lord remembered her this is exactly what happened to Rachel in the story of two wives and then she conceived as a son and she named him she knew well because I shunned well schmoo l l. Oh, Saints. Lessons and then she makes a weird fly because I have asked requested him from the Lord who listens because I have asked Yahweh salt
 so then what happens if she doesn't go up to the annual sacrifice cuz she spends the first couple years just with her baby nursing and caring for her baby but then when he gets old enough when she's weaned ground up and down I'm skipping down yeah what they do is she finally when he is like a little boy she brings him up and they offer a bowl as a sacrifice and they bring the boy and Anna see if he likes sitting there and she says oh you know my Lord as your soul lives I'm the woman who stood here years ago remember me remember me praying and I was drunk yeah I prayed for this boy and Yahweh gave me my request which I asked for and so now I am dedicating him y'all this is Abraham
 offering up Isaac he's search he's surrendering yeah and I dedicated him to Yahweh and as long as he lives he belongs to y'all and you Worship the Lord there and then she sings a song becomes a straight-up musical at the first we're going to talk about the story went out how this kind of creates another twist about the story of the firstborn yeah this is a story where while it begins and tension and conflict the character the main character here is just from the get-go just like passing the test and then following through that feels like a new thing we have to do it again another story it's like there's so much scheming and there's so much like rivalry that just get so hairy and nodded and like
 lost in spite of everyone God comes through and here's one where it's like you get a character who she's a pressed like she's going to this test and she just like flying colors yeah cuz yeah it's like she's a bike very saintly kind of picture he sent Hannah say Hannah absolutely yeah she's impeccable like she is this model of both trusting and Yahweh even when it feels like you always the one who's withholding favor from me not truly the irony of her name and then she says even if you were to show me favor I would surrender that thing that you gave to me show me favor
 yeah she's like the opposite of Abraham and Sarah the opposite of Jacob and Leah and Rachel she's awesome what else can you say and what's amazing is that it's this woman of low social standing and she's the one being exhausted in the narrative as this model of faith and Devotion to y'all by that surely part of the dynamic is she herself is like the favorite chosen one as a model of devotion and Trust even though the whole story is about how she's not perceived as the favorable one by the community now it's interesting as as we traced the steam so far it's always been about who's going to carry on God's blessing in order to then be the lineage which Messiah comes in this story is not about that not yet
 that's perfect E-Z Up for the for the poem what the pollens all about what I mean I mean because Samuel is not that's right that's right but he's going to anoint he will be the one to anoint David becomes a lineage yeah so what school is she becomes this model
 of trust and that trust ends up putting her and her son in a role that will result in the lineage of the snake cuz you're getting kind of like kick start again in the wear-and-tear stalled out for lemon rolls where's the lion of Judah and Joshua a couple places where the line of duty and judges here and there but you just kind of been on pause and then the resurrection of that yeah Judah and the promise of the king from Lion of Judah die really becomes the focus in the story of David and it's this woman and her son that are the crucial kind of hens to kick-start the theme again yeah but three favorite here it isn't even necessarily to be part of the lineage of the snake Crusher is just to Aid the lineage
 okay so that's the story of Hannah would set us up for how amazing herb softest Chris isn't 1st Samuel chapter two and maybe let's just say let's notice something think about the narrative circumstances that she just had and then think about how the narrative circumstances fit or doesn't seem to quite fit with, okay I'm not saying it doesn't fit but it's it's in the way that takes some adjusting of your expectations and then Hannah and said my heart exults in the Lord exalt I don't use that word that means celebrate my heart celebrates and Yahweh
 my horn is lifted high in what's the horn again give me a video about this I made a video about a horn you and Theresa made one of our Psalm 148 horn yes it's victory like when a bowl of lifts its horn in battle that just one yeah it's like to board is sending me something like that or like knocked it down and then so there's a symbolic a listing of the horn Victory is celebrating and my
 horn is exalted I just got Vindicated over against Coral who has bunch of children
 my mouth can now speak boldly against my enemies because I rejoice in your yes you are your deliverance or rescue so she's depicting this is a moment to stand up proud and all of her Rivals and enemies plural
 there is no one holy like y'all were indeed there is no one besides you nor is there any Rock like our god this is the lion that comes right out of to the most important poems in the Torah and the song of Deliverance that the Israelites thing after they rescue from the sea come there is no one like you no one like you and then Moses's last poem and Deuteronomy 33 he talks about God as being the rock like him there is no one else hears Hannah affirming just like God rescued Israel from the sea against their enemies and just like God brought his real through the wilderness
 so now here she's making a similar statement and after she's just identifying with the whole Legacy of redemption start addressing her enemies you should not boast so proudly particular penina what's-her-name coral Coral yeah that's right totally but she's already talked about like to chat multiple and then like Victoria's in the arena against her enemies you know I'm so now she's got lots of deities like look down on her is that the idea here we're going to see is she sees what just happened in her own family story
 Cosmic significance she's interpreting and talking about it as if it's like this Cosmic Victory like Israel getting rescued from the sea and so it's it's great cuz it shows our imagination is shaped by The Melody of the biblical story so cool are you might argue it's a little overdramatic so you should not both so proudly you should not let arrogance come out of your mouth because y'all he's a God knows
 and with him everyone's actions are being weighed in the balance
 the bows of the Mighty Warriors they get shattered
 and it's the week the feeble ones they are the ones who were putting on strength like armor so there's our Fame notice those of the mighty Oar shattered the feeble and on strength to keep going those who were full now have to hire themselves out for bread so you used to know where every meal is coming from now you're going to become a day laborer Evan you're not sure you know maybe you'll get some bread and even by those who have been hungry their hunger will see even the baron one will give birth to 7 but the one with many children she will languish she's getting ahead of yourself here just had your first one the number 7 symbolic 7 fullness yep complete yeah
 tell her she does feel complete she got the son she wanted ya noticed this really feels like how Jesus begins The Sermon on the Mount yeah those that like the hungry those who hunger for righteous or righteousness they will be filled you know the Meeker the unimportant will inherit the land actually this is more like Jesus sermon on the plane and Luke 6 or he provides the inversion of all the Beatitudes for those who are hungry will be filled but those were filled with a hungry you're saying that thing on the first one thing yeah where's a roofing of its meditating on yahweh's ways in the world they consistently identifies with the hungry and the weak and oppressed and the one of low status and elevates them and those who are of high status their status doesn't mean anything and so he'll bring down from the throne and help box
 so now all the sudden the theme of the firstborn where to get meta and we're just talking about how God works in the world in general so if she goes on
 Yahweh brings some down to death and makes others alive
 he brings down to the grave and erases up death Resurrection that's like the most extreme form of Yahweh associating with the low and the oppressed the Yahweh would even side with the debt over the Against the Grain Yahweh makes poor and he makes wealthy he brings down low and Alyssa pie
 he would even do that y'all at would even raise up the poor from the dust of the ground
 most desolate Place lift up the needy from the ash Heap and he would in Throne of them with Nobles so that they inherit the firstborn and inheritance that they are the ones who inherit the seat of Honor as they're so you get this whole string of inversion
 and she's getting really Cosmic are ya think of the different categories she talks about Warriors so the bows of the mighty Oar shattered but it's the weak choir that actually a strong then you have food and then you have kind of like the turn the other cheek kind of thing the week or you oh yeah yeah that's right so being folder hungry being Barren or having many children death or life the grave a resurrection poor and Rich poor in the dust versus up high on the throne so it's all these inversion yet and she's obstructing this is a meditation on what the stories
 all the cycles of the melody throughout the Torah and the prophets have been teaching you up but she doesn't hear they upset this is kind of the me what was formative consolidates all this together and what we start calling the upside down kingdom in the gospels but it's this idea so she goes on she says the pillars of the land belongs to Yaba he set the world on them here why bring up the pillars by the way the pillars are something that I've I think a lot of people aren't that familiar with the land itself sits on a yatch then keep it elevated from the chaos Waters right house or structural roof the Seven Pillars in so this is a metaphor
 for how the tablecloth is imagine that the dry land is elevated top of the cath Waters and Yahweh is the one who makes those pillars and keeps them firm they believe the dry land and all order and life could that any moment be totally overwhelmed by death and disorder if God has created the structure yeah yeah I went to exist but what's funny is this is too funny of ironic kind of twist cuz he first think how does this fit in conversion when you think of inversions you think of upsetting order strong or weak and the King's get humiliated in the poor become the rulers like that upsetting the world order will maybe in a way like taking dry land and setting up on pillars to stand up both of the chaos Waters is also disrupting its going against the forces of Chaos
 I think this little lion is talking about yes Yahweh is the keeper of order but what if the way that he keeps order is by upsetting human order I think cuz it's all about inversion subversion upside down y'all we doing the opposite of what humans think but you always the one responsible for the order in the world what is his way of ordering is having to disorder are distorted or that's the idea okay yeah there's 9 he keeps the feet of his Godly ones that the stability image
 but the wicked they are silenced in darkness
 where does not by strength that people prevail
 she's feeling this in the moment you know yeah it's like the wicked you know I bet she could like just travel a couple miles in any direction and find some scheming manipulative and violent men like doing a Lemak thing and it's been like okay so this is what Sarah does this poem is programmatic for the rest of the Samuel scroll what she's giving you the program and her story has been set in front as the template and the Bold audacious claim of her poem is actually in reality
 the way y'all way works in the world is like waited for me
 and yes and that's how the world is ordered by y'all way confronting human disorders though it's actually what she's about to say is this is how Yahweh actually really works in the world and if you have eyes to see it you'll start seeing it everywhere and just think about what the Samuel Scrolls going to be about going to be about the rise of Israel's first king a guy named Saul
 and then it's going to be about his slow tragic downfall
 because of his the slow Turning Away of his heart and so you always raises him up and then he brings them down and then it's going to be about Yahweh taking David Who's down and dust of Love status and he raises him up and the slow-turning of David's art and then he goes down and so really the whole Samuel scroll is the study of two kings that both our exalted and both fall but in really different ways and they embody what Hannah says about his pain and then look at what she says that she says Those Who contend with Yahweh will be shattered
 against them he will Thunder in the skies Yahweh is the judge of all the ends of the land and he gives strength to his King and he will exalt the Horn of his Maya is Anointed one
 then how can I went to his house, and the boy stayed and served for him with you life
 so it's going to be this rise and fall of inversions that will finally result apocalyptic here I mean like yeah because this is an audacious that's great word hope for how the story the human story will come to fulfillment is with God judging the Earth with Justice he is King with his strength and this Messiah being Victorious but that's not the reality on the ground she's experiencing that it seemed a little way that our battle moment of Salvation and now it's getting Cosmic she sees in her life experience this plot Ark Ark of the story
 that she's like this is what y'all have planned for the whole Cosmos just like the world is the venue people in their power games but actually all he loves to do is to take the powerless and put them in charge but you know what even that can become a roller coaster But ultimately there is coming a day that is captured in this moment which is the birth and the arrival of now it's chosen one and she paints a picture forward to final Justice the arrival of the king who will stand Victorious over the nation's
 it's just such a man Hannah the poet oh man that's like you make my ass this problem has it all and you know I said we were going to talk about the story of David and then go. We need to we need to stay here you want to know it's super awesome. Okay what happened to Samuel Osborne and all of a sudden Samuel is compared to the two sons of Eli and they're too they have a rivalry and they have a rivalry and their stumps mean they're stealing the sons of Eli are there stealing from Israelites and they're like literally bullying Israelites coming to give their offerings and so what y'all way orchestrates in the next few chapters is the exaltation of Samuel as
 the real leader of the Tabernacle and The Outsider than in this scenario comes one exalted to the place that the Levites should occupy but there's no qualified Levites and they're all corrupt with the funds the two sons of Eli off me in 55 and then I'll see what happens if the Philistines attack the steel the ark and the infant car seat and Eli all died in The Fallout from that battle and then the ark is delivered back cuz you always sends plagues on the 15th but without an ID but without becomes striking is really fast and so they are comes back on a cart and you know Samuel and they're like there to guide it back in its Tabernacle so Samuel both Hannah and Samuel become these exhausted
 Commerce over what you think is the firstborn
 and set the story and it set the tenor for what the rest of the Samuel school will be about which is mainly of story about the rise and fall of Saul first king and then the rise and fall of days as king
 so if Eli's sons are also about the theme when we didn't really dig into that but it makes me think of aeryn sun totally yes Aaron's sons who go in with Strange Fire and then they're like yeah disqualify the killed yeah yeah and you ought to I mean not help the infant has Eli Sons there's all these hyperlinks in the stories about them to that weird story in Leviticus 10 and you've and this is maybe getting out of this team perhaps but you've also connected Aaron's sons to and ice inside the fire before and acts and that's a strange story in the book of Acts where these two characters are just struck dead and yes really severe sudden and severe and if that were all now
 supposed to be priests in the Tabernacle which we are also the Tabernacle cuz we are in Christ and all these all these things belong together then we need to be a certain type of priests and so is there anything there with I mean it's interesting that Samuel is not a levite but he comes in and kind of like takes over rescues that position of taking care of the Tabernacle something there about the not chosen one or Not Elected one coming in and then take the place and actually be come the elected one well forward I didn't plan on this thread so after he learns about what his sons are doing and he's like stoked on Samuel yeah you know what a good relationship like The Intern
 but it actually sounds like a really terrible but he doesn't really disqualify them or take them out of service until a profit this is called the man of God comes up to Eli and just speaks you always word to him like a profit and we always really really like severe against Eli and so here I'll just want to read from the speech cuz it like Anna I think we'll give it ain't like what you're asking about so what you always says through the prophet to realize that's that's all right after the prayer this is later in Chapter 2 of Eli finds out about West's son's doing right right but like and then later in the afternoon man of God says yeah I didn't I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt in bondage at varos house didn't I choose them that is the Levites from all the tribes of Israel to be my priest to go up to my alter to burn incense
 where the f word did not give to the house of your father all the offerings like the meat you know for the sons of Israel why do you kick that My Sacrifice like you throw it on the ground and kick it like it's trash why do you kick it my sacrifice and offering that I've commanded in my dwelling thought your Divine my dwelling why do you honor your son's above me making yourself fat with the choice offerings of my people is wrong so this is the story about Yahweh has elevated the tribe of Levi Third born
 of the sons of Jacob to a place of honor to be the priest and then all this is about this is like the Jacob pattern the one that God does choose an elevator right so this is the really fascinating line so there for Yahweh is God of Israel to Claire's I did indeed say that your house and the house of your father would walk before me forever
 I promised you perpetually priesthood but now he always says far be it from me it's those who honor me that I will honor him and those who despise me will be treated us despised the days are coming when I'll break your strength and the strength of your father's house there will be not even old men my house you'll see the distress in my dwelling and inspite all the good that I might do for Israel and an old man will no longer be in your house but it goes on to say like you're going to die your sons are going to die and Bruce 35 I will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do what is in my heart and in my nefesh my soul and I will build for them a Perpetual house
 and he will walk before me as my anointed one or he will walk before my anointed one always there's a translation rabbit hole right there but since we what he's saying is like you've been relieved of your job yeah and I'll raise up I raised your family up raise the poor from the dust I can raise a new priest from another line so Eli becomes the negative example Hannah's the first positive example and now he lies the first example of the high and mighty brought down but the power of this line I didn't tell you that your family would be the Eternal priesthood but now I'm saying that you're not going to be that
 damn didn't nothing comfortable yeah I think so too I promise and you know what you blew it the reason why I'm reading this is it has that severity do that that's like the death of Aaron sons and Mike ananias and Sapphira and this is a real tension that weeds throughout the biblical story of Yahweh giving genuine agencies to his partners and when they really blow at man like you can really really love it and y'all will hand people over to the consequences in the Fallout from that I thought yet at the same time Yahweh won't withdraw is long-term Covenant promises and purposes but people can exclude themselves from participating in The Fifth Element of those purposes
 and now we're back to the themes of black food Wilderness generation you know that doesn't get to enter the promised land Moses doesn't get to the promised land and this is a tension that's brought up again in the letter to the Hebrews in the famous morning passages Hebrews and I don't think it's a tension you can fully resolved we create theological systems I want to Solve the Riddle and it seems to me the point is to let this challenges and challenge every generation to reevaluate be self-critical be like Hannah and surrender yourself to always Mercy again but I don't also want to like cover over the severity you know of the challenge here so I don't know what all I've done is respond to what you realized I had write an answer in this is connected to the same right where it's like
 I'm going to elevate someone on a select someone and well as Detective theme but it's a Twist on The Core theme with K member of God said to cane you know I favoured your brother but if you do good isn't there exaltation for you to send is a Croucher at your door you can rule it it's like you have like the Beast you have a choice to make your buddy and so in a way it's a little different cuz he lies from the tribe of Levi and as God said is I had already exhausted you you were the the latecomer that I got it but you didn't do right by me and so it's not a license to just do whatever yeah you didn't rule the Beast and so you will be brought down instead of exalted
 well we didn't get to David no well then I think we'll just we'll make David the next conversation cuz we can't not talk about David so we'll we'll do the David just not hear the story of this oppressed you know woman in pain and suffering and the story of this enfranchised but lazy and self-indulgent priest and his sons they live out exactly the inversion that Anna's poem talks about but it's also really at the heart of God's desire to exalt the humble and to bring down the high and mighty and that's how I establish has the pillars order of the world such a powerful thing to meditate on
