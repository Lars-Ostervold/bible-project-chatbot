 E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
2 
 Jon: This is Jon from The Bible Project. Today on the podcast, it is the first in a new series 
on How to Read the Bible. If you're like me, reading the Bible is difficult. It usually 
involves sitting alone at a desk or on a couch, opening up to some random pass age 
and hoping it makes sense. So today, Tim and I are going to talk about different, 
more ancient way to read the Bible.  
Tim: The purpose of the Bible is to be read aloud to God's assembled people, to both tell 
the story that reminds them who they are, a nd also to invite those assembled people 
into this covenant relationship with God, not just so that they know God but so that 
they are transformed by this relationship and then become God's representatives to 
the nation.  
Jon: How was the Bible read origin ally and what is the primary purpose of reading the 
Bible? Here we go.  
 This is kind of a new type of project we're going to do. Because normally we'll take a 
book of the Bible, its literary structure and themes and design, or we'll take one 
specific theme  or motif that goes through all Scripture. Those have been the subjects 
that we talked about. But we want to talk about this idea of why it's important to 
read scripture out loud together.  
 That's not a theme of the Bible, per se, but it's something we're  interested in. I think 
we should talk a little bit why we're interested in it, but that's what we're going to 
talking about. Reading the Bible out loud with each other.  
Tim: Having the Bible read aloud to a group of Jesus's followers and no teaching, no 
sermon. Just hearing a big section of the Bible read aloud.  
 Actually, there's a bit of personal history that's just now occurring to me. When I was 
a fairly new Christian. I was in my early 20s, Jon and I were both a part of this 
community connected to ou r church and the ministry outreach esc ape order called 
Skate Church. This group, I  don't know, maybe 80 peop le or so-ish met Thursday 
nights in the gigantic living room of our house for years.  
 I remember one of those Thursday nights, some guy came and just recited the whole 
letter to the Ephesians. And that was the main gathering point. That was Jason 
Nightingale, came to Thursday night.  
Jon: What did that take? Like 15 minutes or something?  
Tim: It wasn't that long. He both gave a little thought or ex position after it, but mostly it 
was just he was pointing out key themes that repeat in the letter to the Ephesians. 
But just the act of having a whole book of the Bible read aloud as the main thing, E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
3 
 that was brand new to me. I'd never been exposed to anyt hing like that. It was a guy 
named Jason Nightingale, who's ministry is to travel around the world reciting whole 
books of the Bible that he's memorized.  
Jon: My first experience, actually, with Jason Nightingale I was 17. I went to this 
conference in Portland, Jason Nightingale did the Revelation.  
Tim: The whole book of Revelation?  
Jon: The whole book. I remember it was difficult for me to pay attention the wh ole time 
because I'm 17-year-old. But it was captivating. I don't remember anything else 
about that conference but I remember that. I was fascinated how he had 
remembered so much. It was really a new experience to hear all that scripture read 
out loud, lik e that. That was my experience.  
Tim: I agree it was really remarkable when I first heard that too. Then what I did with that 
group is for, I don't know, maybe a part of a year, about every three months or 
quarterly, we would get a friend to open up their house on a Friday night, and we 
just gather whoever wanted to come, and we read each of the four gospels aloud in 
one evening over the course of that year.  
 Just two and a half hours, and we just sit in a huge circle and just take a turn. Read a 
whole cha pter. Then get together with some friends in one long afternoon, we read 
all of Paul's letters aloud in one go. Anyhow, this became a really powerful 
experience for me so much so that it motivated me to memorize myself the Sermon 
on the Mount, and then I d id the same thing like, recited it for that Thursday night 
group.  
 I'm so glad I did that. Having all of that in my head, not having to, like, "What did 
Jesus say again," but just it's in there, it's been the greatest gift to me over the years 
to have his  most famous teachings in my memory. Anyway, that's a bit of our 
personal experience.  
 As we've been doing The Bible Project, we came across someone who wanted to 
give us some encouragement and this is his whole deal.  
Jon: Bill, he's out in New York and we went to visit him. He's just like...I think it's at lunch 
on Fridays.  
Tim: He's a businessman. He opens us his office.  
Jon: And just come to the office and then they play the Bible with a specific app that he's 
all about, Word of Promise, which is like  this Hollywood version.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture

 Tim: It's dramatized.  
Jon: It's dramatized.  
Tim: I see.  
Jon: There's an actor for every character and there's a little bit of music in the 
background.  
Tim: It's an audio Bible just playing in a room.  
Jon: So they just show up t o play the audio Bible and eat a meal, and then they go, "Cool, 
thanks for coming." There's not necessarily discussion afterwards. People will stay 
and talk, but it's not mandatory.  
Tim: Just hearing the scripture read aloud is the thing.  
Jon: And Bill is  saying, that's powerful, and we just need to do more of it. I hadn't really 
heard anyone else advocate for that specifically. At the same time, he was telling us 
that, we had already planned this Revelation event where we were having Jason 
Nightingale com e. And so we did that.  
Tim: At the end of 2016 when we premiered last read scripture video about the 
Revelation, we showed and — 
Jon: And Jason Nightingale recited the Revelation.  
Tim: All these years later, we invited him back, and he came.  
Jon: Yeah, and he did it. It was exactly as I remembered it. It was awesome.  
Tim: It was incredible.  
Jon: He looked like he had not changed at all, which is strange because that was 20 years 
ago.  
Tim: He kind of looks like a kind Hells Angel. Like you shake hands with him, and he's very 
tall, he's a big dude. He could kill me with his pinkie  of finger. But he's so kind. Then 
he gets up and starts reciting a book of the Bible. His voice is such, such a powerful...  
[crosstalk 00:07:25]  
Jon: Then we started experimenting in the office were on Wednesday mornings now we 
get together and we listen for an hour. With that Word of Promise app, we listened E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
5 
 through Mark. It was a really cool experience. It just hit me how when you hear this 
kind of one sto ry after the next and just let it absorb, you just get different sense of 
the story. And Jesus really came across this pretty rough writer.  
Tim: Especially in Mark.  
Jon: He's like no -nonsense. Not meek and mild at all.  
Tim: There are many Christian traditi ons where reading of the Scriptures in the worship 
gathering plays a role. But in the history of the church, it's taking the form of these 
things called the lectionaries, where there'll be a reading often from the Pentateuch, 
from the prophets, and then fr om the Gospels. There will be selection.  
 They're usually bigger sections or sometimes smaller, but the practice of having a 
large section of the Bible just read aloud is not a practice. It's widespread in any 
Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox Christian trad ition as a regular part of the lectionaries. 
Basically, like that. But even then, it's still small sections of a book.  
Jon: If someone tells you, "Hey, we got together and we read through a book," you'll be 
like, "Wow, that's crazy."  
Tim: Yeah. Or why so mebody like Jason, whose ministry is to go around the world just 
reciting whole books of the Bible at one go, and you go, "That's weird." I thought 
about this over time, like, "That's weird that that's weird." I feel like that shouldn't be 
weird.  
Jon: I think one of the things we're contemplating, the reason why we want to do this 
video and have this discussion is maybe that shouldn't be weird anymore. No one's 
really advocating for it. There's plenty of people who advocate for spend time alone 
with the Bi ble and read large sections by yourself. And that's awesome. But there's 
this unique opportunity to advocate for Christians developing this disciplines, 
coming together and reading it out loud.  
Tim: Actually, even though the history of the Christian churc h hasn't really put this 
practice in the spotlight, it's very ancient. It's a very Jewish. Actually, the origins of 
the Bible itself, are wrapped up with this very practice of God's people gathering 
together in sacred moments to hear large portions of the Divine Word read to them. 
So we thought we want to make a video about this.  
Jon: We want to make a video and then we just want to see what happens. We want to 
see if people will start doing it more. If you're using our videos to read through the 
Bible, ma ybe a way to do it is read with other people.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
6 
 Tim: That's right.  
Jon: There's a lot of practical reasons why that's awesome, and we can talk about those, 
but what this conversation's going to be first is you walking us through the history 
of it in Script ure itself and then after, that.  
Tim: That's right. It's a biblical theme study. The whole biblical story isn't unified by this, 
but this is a repeated idea.  
Jon: Repeated idea?  
Tim: It's repeated in the story of the Bible. Actually, the written origins o f the Bible are 
wrapped up with this very practice of public reading scripture to the group of people 
assembled.  
Jon: For a lot of reasons, it seems important. We don't know where it's going to lead 
besides a video, but hopefully, it'll encourage people to  try it.  
Tim: We think that it should be normal that followers of Jesus invite groups of people 
over to their homes for an evening of hearing the Bible read aloud.  
Jon: Maybe we should start with the practical things real ly quick because that's 
where.. .Getting people together to just read the Bible out loud is super simple.  
Tim: Totally.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: It's very simple.  
Jon: Very simple. It's intimidating to think about starting a small group or something.  
Tim: Reading a Bible study.  
Jon: Because you feel like you need to know, you need to be prepared. There's going to 
be all these questions because you're leading it. You're like, I don't know. It just kind 
of has all this weightiness to it. But just inviting people over to your home to rea d 
the Bible out loud, that's it. Show up, let's read.  
 And you don't even have to read. You can get a Bible app and have it play. You 
could do it for 20 minutes, you could do it for 60 minutes, you could do for two 
hours, whatever makes the most sense. It 's really simple.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
7 
  But then also it just develops community in a different way where once you've done 
that and you've come together, it's just natural to then talk about what you...  
Tim: It's like going to a movie. You have the experience together with th ese people that 
becomes a social bond. Also, there's a formative thing that happens to there.  
 Think about an average Protestant, I don't know, but Catholic as well. Where do 
people encounter the Bible? Well, they will encounter it as part of a worship 
gathering or a mass of some kind. In what way? They might hear a section of the 
Bible read aloud as a lectionary, or they might hear a section of the Bible read aloud 
and taught or preached on as a part of a sermon. But just by necessity, there has to 
be jus t a paragraph or a single story.  
 If for years, that's the only exposure you have to the Bible, what's the purpose of the 
Bible? I don't know. What do you mean? Its purpose  it's just you go to church and 
you hear paragraph read. You're never exposed to an ything larger than one 
paragraph at a time.  
 I think that's actually true for many people's personal experience of reading the Bible 
silently by yourself at night, or in the morning or something. And usually, it's — 
Jon: Or with a devotional guide and they  pull out some — 
Tim: Or a devotional guide which focuses on one sentence, or maybe three sentences, or 
a paragraph, or even just one chapter. But the point is, is that these books were 
written books, unified literary wholes that are meant to be read from b eginning to 
end.  
Jon: It'll be like if there was this whole group of people that love to get together and just 
quote lines from the Godfather trilogy or something. That's right.  
Tim: They never watch the whole movie.  
Jon: They would never watch the whol e movie, but they would show scenes every once in 
a while and they will talk about it.  
Tim: That's right. Show two -minute clip.  
Jon: Or someone says, "You know what we should do? We should sit down and watch the 
entire Godfather Part 1." And people will b e like, "What?"  
Tim: "What? No one does that."  
Jon: "The whole thing all at once?"  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
8 
 Tim: What?" Those are long movie.  
Jon: Yeah. That will take three hours. Watching the whole trilogy, that would take nine 
hours. That third one's a beast.  
Tim: But especia lly now in the days of binge -watching on Netflix, people don't even flinch 
at committing four weeknights in a row. You get home from work and you just 
watch from six till bedtime. But isn't it weird that we don't think about the Bible with 
that same kind o f mentality?  
 It's formative and that it can reshape how you think about the Bible if you stop 
thinking about verses, you stop thinking about the Bible in terms of verses and you 
think about it in terms of books, and sections of book and movement, and so on. 
Jon: There's got to be something psychologically different from reading and hearing, too. 
Because I have read like large sections of Mark, but for some reason just listening to 
it was a different experience.  
Tim: It's a totally different experience.  
Jon: And I don't know why. I'm not a scientist.  
Tim: As we'll see, we're almost certainly way more in touch with how these books were 
written and what they were meant to do, which was to be read aloud. There are 
some books of the Bible that even say in th emselves, "This was meant to be read 
aloud to a group of people."  
 This is about reshaping our experience of the Bible, our expectations. It also creates 
new opportunities for the Bible to work on us and the mess with us. It's just through 
the most simple  practice that requires no religious professionals.  
Jon: A religious professional  with no prep - no one has to prepare.  
Tim: It's just the simplest thing in the world.  
Jon: Then you get to do something that you always feel like you don't do enough, at 
least if you are a typical Christian.  
Tim: Yeah, do it together with your friends.  
Jon: You want to walk us through this?  
Tim: Yeah. It's been a while in these conversations si nce I've been able to do good Bible 
trivia. So maybe don't look at notes.   E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
9 
 Jon: Okay.  
Tim: Where is the writing of the Bible mentioned for the first time in the story of the 
Bible? In other words, you start at Page 1, where will you come across, for the first 
time, the mention of anybody writing the Bible?  
Jon: Writing the Bible as in knowing that this is part of a —? 
Tim: Yeah. It's somebody writing and what they're writing is something that's going to 
itself become a part of the book that you're reading. If it's a narrative, we're talking 
about the first mention of the writing of the Bible within the Bible itself.  
Jon: Well, give me an example of one that's not the first that's won't give anything away.  
Tim: Like in the book of Jeremiah, he's told to write down all of his prophecies and poems 
and essays into a scroll. So he does. There is a story about the writing of the book of 
Jeremiah in Jeremiah.  
Jon: Got it.  
Tim: And then a whole chapter, Jeremiah 36.  
Jon: I'm guessing it's somewhere in Exodus with Moses. I just don't know what story 
would be.  
Tim: It's good. Good job. That's great. That's right. It's always pleasant . Many people think 
it has something to do with Moses, but typically I think it has something to do with 
the 10 commandments, because oh, yeah, writing of the commandment and stuff 
like that.  
 Actually, the first mention of the writing of the Bible in the  Bible is a story before 
Israel gets to Mount Sinai, but they're in the desert on the way there. It's in Exodus 
chapter 17. The people have escaped from slavery in Egypt, they've got food and 
some stuff that plundered from the Egyptians, but they're an esc aped band of slaves 
out in the desert.  
 They're not Canaanites but they live in the south. They live in what would be 
modern -day Jordan around the region of Amman. They are called the Amalekites. 
They see this right for plunder and so they totally pounce o n an attack to the 
Israelites.  
 The Israelites have to form an impromptu defense force. This is the story people 
might be familiar with, is that Moses goes up on a hill to pray for victory. When he E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
10 
 raises his hands in prayer, Israel is winning, but then h e's an old man, he's tired. So 
his arms get heavy because he's like, "Oh."  
 Then when he stopped praying, Israel starts losing the battle. It's odd. So he gets 
two guys to help him hold his arms up and then he prays and they win.  
 Then once the battle is  over, Exodus 7:14, God says to Moses, "Write this on a scroll 
as something to be remembered." This is the first mention of the writing of the Bible 
in the Bible. To me, it's interesting because it has nothing to do with commands or 
laws.  
Jon: It's a stor y. 
Tim: "Remember the story." The purpose of writing isn't just for archival purposes. It's to 
actively remember this event. What was this event? God rescued his people out of 
slavery, they're vulnerable, they were almost destroyed, but God intervened and 
rescued his people.  
 The first thing from the story is a very simple takeaway. What do we learn about the 
purpose of the Bible from this first mentioning of the writing of the Bible in the 
Bible? Its purpose is apparently to tell a story so that God's peo ple remember how 
He acted to save and inform the people that he would bring himself. That's the first 
mentioned of the reading the Bible in the Bible.  
Jon: Cool.  
Tim: Let's say that one doesn't go over very well in your Friday night gathering.  
Jon: Peopl e aren't impressed.  
Tim: Then you can follow up with the next one, which is what's the second mention of the 
writing of the Bible in the Bible. Your listeners, [unintelligible 00:21:21] and 
somebody will say, "Moses to also..." The second mentioned of the writing the Bible 
in the Bible does take place at Mount Sinai in connection with the 10 
commandments.  
 Just think of how the story goes so far. Israel has already experienced its great 
salvation event. They sang a song about it in Exodus 15. They've been saved again, 
and so Moses started writing the Bible to tell that story.  
 Now they get to this mountain,  and God appears personally on the mount in smoke 
and cloud and all that and He wants to enter into a covenant relationship with them 
so that He can make Israel into a kingdom of priests, a whole nation that will be his E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
11 
 priestly representatives to the nati ons. We've explored this and many Bible Project 
videos.  
 They assembled. Here we go. The public reading of Scripture. The people assemble 
to hear from God at the foot of the mountain. And Moses — 
Jon: It makes them sound like transformers or something. Ass emble.  
Tim: Wow, assemble.  
Jon: It sounds like a weird word. But that's the word.  
Tim: That's the word. It's a normal English. Assembly. School assembly. So they all come 
before the mountain, and God announces the 10 commandments to Moses. Then a 
few dozens more commandments that are all found in Exodus 20, 21, 22. Then 
Moses, he writes them down. Second mention of the writing  the Bible in the Bible.  
Then he goes down in Exodus 24 to the people. We hear Moses writes up all of the 
terms of this covenant relationship. He reads them aloud. This is the first time 
somebody reads the Divine Word aloud to God's assembled people. And it's a 
marriage. It's a wedding ceremony. It's a covenant. The first mention of the writing 
the Bible is about a salvation story t hat God's people are to never forget because it 
reminds them who they are.  
 The second mention of the writing the Bible in the Bible is writing up the terms of a 
covenant relationship. Then the first time those words are ever read aloud over 
God's people,  it's a covenant ceremony. So the people here all the words and then 
they respond, "Everything the Lord has said we're going to do."  
 This is why when I start to think about this, I thought, "This is interesting video and it 
really ties into —." 
Jon: The w hole formation of their identity.  
Tim: The origins of the Bible are completely wrapped up with the origins of God forming 
a people and the two exist very closely connected. The purpose of the Bible is to be 
read aloud to God's assembled people to both tel l the story that reminds them who 
they are, and also to invite those assembled people into this covenant relationship 
with God not just so that they know God, but so that they are transformed by this 
relationship and then become God's representatives to th e nations.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
12 
  Sociologists have language for this; identity formation. The purpose of the Bible is to 
be read aloud to God's gathered people to help them form a unique identity as a 
minority group among the nations who live by a different story.  
 We can tal k about this later, but following in our day, was combination of this story. 
Following Jesus is very hard. It involves living by a value set that's often not shared 
by the majority of your family and friends. What kinds of habits or practices does it 
take to foster that to make it seem normal that following Jesus is actually the right 
thing to do, even though it's not the story everyone else is doing? It's right here - 
the Bible.  
 It's not you getting a cup of tea and going by yourself? No. It's that you as semble as 
a group to hear the story and to hear the terms of the relationship and what God's 
calling you to as a people. That's the habit. That itself is the ordinance of the Bible.  
Jon: A habit that I was taught in terms of reading the Bible was a very in dividual habit. Sit 
down with your Bible. There are four steps. You observe what's in the text, you...I 
don't know if I'll remember all this. Then you interpret and then you apply. I think I 
missed one because that's three. But I got the application. I don 't know where else 
you go from there.  
 I just remember the whole point was the application. Get to application. This is very 
early. I mean, this is before Bible college. If I ever sat down to read the Bible, it was 
always about what am I supposed to do wi th this? How is this supposed to 
specifically, concretely change what I do today? If I didn't get there, I didn't feel like 
it was a success - like my Bible reading time was a failure.  
Tim: Men, it's a lot of pressure.  
Jon: It's a lot of pressure. Because  often you would just get into observation mode and 
be like, "This is confusing."  
Tim: That's what I'm observing.  
Jon: I'm observing that I'm very confused.  
Tim: Why did this person kill that person?  
Jon: I didn't have a category in my mind of sitting down and reading the Bible and being 
confused is a good thing in and of itself, especially when done in community. 
Because as you read these stories and listening, these stories are shaping your 
imagination in the way you think about the world. Even if you  don't realize, they're 
doing that.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
13 
 Tim: That's right.  
Jon: So success isn't coming to a specific application and then sticking with it. There's 
success and just getting together and reading the Bible. It's like a new definition of 
success that's a lot mo re manageable.  
Tim: And historic.  
Jon: And historic.  
Tim: But notice in this first scene, Exodus 24, where the proto Bible, the first version of a 
section of the Bible is read aloud, what the people do is respond. They respond. I've 
actually come to really dislike the word application in this process of Bible reading. 
Mostly, because I think that term itself has an assumption built into it about the 
nature and purpose of the Bible that it's some kind of handbook and I just need to 
use the right interp retation code and then I can — 
Jon: Put the right interpretation, the algorithm in and I get my life planned.  
Tim: Then I get my life verse or life application for the day. Much of the Bible doesn't 
work like that. You could argue that some parts of the Bib le do, those are that are 
more oriented towards prose discourse, basically, the letters of the New Testament.  
Jon: The sermon on the mount that you memorized?  
Tim: Yes, Sermon on the Mount, but moral or ethical teaching. But Lamentations, just five 
long fu neral poems over the destruction of Jerusalem, what can you apply? I guess I 
need to lament over a city that got destroyed recently. You can look it up on Google.  
Jon: Well, you get really creative and you develop a new skill, a skill in which to apply 
these things in very creative ways. The people who are best at it end up writing 
devotionals. Right?  
Tim: Yeah. And you are like, "Whoa."  
Jon: For Lamentation, it's like, "Think of something in your life that has brought you grief 
and then use this verse in t he way that he repeated this word to process it in this 
way." And you are like, "Oh, okay." That's cool but it takes a devotional writer to do it 
well. 
Tim: There's a reason why teachers are said to be a group of people God raises up for the 
church. the Bi ble is hard. That's a gift. And anybody who's doing that, that's 
awesome. I want to cheer them on.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
14 
  But at the same time, for me, the concern is, I think just application is just the wrong 
category for what most of the Bible is, which is narrative and poe try makes up nearly 
75% of the Bible. That's why the story is suggestive to me in Exodus 24. "The people 
respond." I like that word "response."  
 Lamentations forces a response. Response is different than application. Response 
means, oh, this work of litera ture is supposed to do something to me and I'm 
supposed to react to it in some way. It is trying to do something to me.  
Jon: I was kind of like, "If you're looking at a painting or something, you respond 
emotionally and intellectually to it, but you're not  applying that to yourself."  
Tim: But let's just say a visual image, like a flyer or a promotional flyer for a world relief 
organization. They'll show you a picture of a real destitute village and some hungry 
people. The purpose of that image is for you t o respond. Is to go to this website and 
find out how to volunteer, how to get involved, what to do. But the purpose is for 
you to respond with action and service and generosity.  
 But if you go stand in front of a work of art down at the Museum of Art, it' s also a 
visual image that is trying to get a response out of you but it's not at all the same 
kind of response.  
Jon: The kind of application is not very well defined.  
Tim: It might get you to start thinking about the meaning of your life or whatever. It can 
take so many different forms. That's the question is, different parts of the Bible are 
trying to get you to respond in different ways.  
Jon: And there are some parts of the Bible that just want you to absorb the story like you 
would absorb a piece of a rt. Then there are some parts of the Bible that want you to 
actually make a change or decisions.  
Tim: A specific behavior.  
Jon: Very specific behavior.   
Tim: There's no one size fits all when it comes to hearing the Bible read to you or reading 
yourself a nd application.  
Jon: So you like the word response because it's broad?  
Tim: Because it's broad, and because instead of the Bible as a handbook, and I go apply 
the interpretation code and find the thing I'm supposed to do, the Bible itself is an E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
15 
 active real ity. It's an active word that doing things to me. It's acting upon me. I'm 
being read as much as I'm reading the Bible.  
Jon: I see.  
Tim: It's reading me.  
Jon: Application is all focused on, "What am I going to do." Response has this category, 
which is, "What's naturally happening because of this interaction?"  
Tim: That's right. So response. The Israelites at the foot of the mountain, they just heard 
the terms of the covenant. Their response is, "Everything you said, we're going to 
do."  
Jon: It's appropriate response.  
Tim: But when they hear the book of Lamentations read aloud, that is very different. It 
puts you in a completely different headspace.  
Jon: You wouldn't say, "Everything that was said, I'm going to do," after reading 
Lamentation.  
Tim: No, you would. You would say — 
Jon: You'd be worried if someone said that. You'd be like, "Hold on. I thank you miss the 
point there."  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. That is just its own idea that the Bible read aloud forces a response 
from the group of people w ho are hearing it, but different parts of the Bible will 
generate a different response. That's just a simpler way of honoring what the Bible 
actually is and is for.  
[00:34:23]  
Tim: We've got the first writing of the Bible in the Bible and the first time t he proto Bible 
is read aloud telling the story, inviting people into that story, and then — 
Jon: Having some sort of ceremony.  
Tim: A ceremony where you're called to respond, whether you're going to live according 
to this story. As you read on in the Bible , this thing about remembering the story 
and remembering that you've committed yourself to this story and these people 
who live in this way, this is big, big deal, especially in the book of Deuteronomy, 
which is the last book of the Torah.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
16 
  There's a huge theme. The word "remember" occurs dozens of times in this book. 
Remember what happened at the mountain. Remember what happened at the Red 
Sea, the Sea of Reeds. Remember what happened at the Exodus story to Pharaoh. 
Remember how he provided for you in the wilderness.  
 There's this motif that in your homes, in your families and with your friends, you're 
constantly retelling the story and talking about it and thinking about it.  
Jon: To keep the memory fresh.  
Tim: To keep the memory fresh, yeah. For example, D euteronomy chapter 4, Moses says 
to Israel, "Look, I've taught you the decrees and the laws God commanded me so 
that you'll follow them when you go into the land. Observe them carefully, for this 
will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations who w ill hear about how 
you live, and they'll say, surely this nation is wise in understanding."  
 Again, this is about the scriptures read, when they're remembered and responded to, 
they form a people who are distinct and that the nation's look on and say, "Wel l, 
these people who live by the story, they're different and they're wise and it's 
compelling. It's the kingdom of priest’s idea.  
 Then it goes on. Moses says, "Be careful, watch yourself so you don't forget 
everything you've experienced. Teach your child ren and your children's children after 
them." This is passing on the story which Jewish culture has absolutely mastered.  
 We're talking about one of those ancient people groups from the ancient world that 
still has an active religious liturgy that it's mo rphed as time has gone on, but it's the 
same basic things that they've been doing for millennia. And they've been able to 
maintain their unique identity no matter what culture that Jewish people have gone 
into.  
Jon: What actually happens in synagogue? Is there aloud reading of the Torah?  
Tim: We'll get there. Yes, that's right. That's where this is all going. Where we end is in the 
first-century synagogues with weekly reading aloud of the Scripture. But it has deep 
roots all the way back to "remember the s tory." That's a big theme in Deuteronomy.  
 Near the end of the book of Deuteronomy in chapter 31, this is where we first kind 
of land here. Moses is going to die. He's going to pass leadership on to Joshua. So 
what he does is he writes what I call the pro to Torah - the version of the Torah that 
he contributed to and shaped directly and then passed on to Joshua and then the 
later prophets after him who would shape it into its final form.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
17 
  But he talks about how he gave this proto Torah to the priests and t hey're to keep it. 
Then every seven years, they are to have this huge assembly. Here's the passage. 
Deuteronomy 31. "Assemble everybody, men, women and children, even the 
immigrants who are living in your towns, so that everybody can listen and learn to 
fear the LORD your God and carefully follow all the words of this Torah.  
 The children who don't know this Torah - the word "Torah" here means teaching, 
instruction - the children who don't know it, they need to hear it so that they learn 
to fear the Lord a s long as you live in the land you're going to." Mount Sinai was 
remarkable. We assembled everybody to read that but now we're instituting this as a 
practice here every seven years."  
Jon: So this is like renewing the ceremony every seven years?  
Tim: That' s right. You're reenacting what happened on Mount Sinai when we first entered 
this covenant relationship. Now, every seven years, we're thinking in someone's 
lifespan, then they're going to experience 10, a dozen or more of these ceremonies. 
It's all about  shaping you to live as a unique kind of people together with your 
unique mission.  
 There's a Jewish scholar - I have some quotes here - a Jewish scholar who has some 
great insights about this practice, which is very ancient. Jeffrey Tigay. This is a 
comme ntary on Deuteronomy.  
 He says, "This public reading of the teaching - which is what the word "Torah" means 
- public reading of the teaching is part of what he calls the democratic character of 
biblical religion. It addresses its teachings and demand to a ll of its adherence with 
few distinctions between the priests and the laity. And it calls for a universal 
education of the citizens and law and religion."  
 So, I think, if children, this long sections of the Torah that are just like civil law about 
what to  do with house robbers and building parapets on your house and when your 
donkey comes and eats my wheat, children, you know, what's going on here? So he 
says, "It's the entire people, not just a spiritual or intellectual elite that are God's 
children and c onsecrated to him. Biblical religion is for the people as a whole."  
  He cites this really interesting example. There's a third -century synagogue. One of 
the oldest synagogues that's been excavated, it's in a town called Dura -Europos 
which is in Syria. I don't know what kind of condition that town's in right now in the 
mids t of the war.  
Jon: Dura -Europos was the name of the city?  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
18 
 Tim: Dura -Europos. It's called the Dura -Europos synagogue. Whether that's the name of 
the town or it was at earlier stage, that's a good question. Google it. Anyone 
listening, Google it. the Dura -Europos Synagogue. It's some of the most ancient 
Jewish art that exists.  
Jon: How do you spell it?  
Tim: Dura is D -U-R-A. Then Europos, just spell Europe. It's some of the most ancient 
Jewish paintings that exist ever.  
Jon: There's a lot of them.  
Tim: All of them are artistic retelling of stories from the Hebrew Bible.  
Jon: Nice. It's like the first Bible Project.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. I forget when it was discovered. It's generated whole field of 
scholarship because this gives us a window into how Middle E astern Jews 1,700 
years ago thought about how they interpreted these biblical stories.  
 This is Roman Empire era, so they're all kind of depicted as looking Romanesque, 
wearing tokens and that kind of thing. It's really interesting. The reason why Jeffrey  
Tigay brings up this is because there's a picture of somebody with an open scroll 
with people gathered around him reading the scroll aloud.  
 There's been a lot of scholarly debate about what is this image referring to. Some 
people thinks it's Moses readi ng the Torah aloud, some people think it's Ezra, and 
other people think that it's a depiction of what would happen in the synagogue.  
Jon: This one's called "Ezra Reads the Law."  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. There's no little caption at the bottom saying what  these are 
about. Tigay makes interesting comparison here. He says, "There's another sacred 
building and Dura that was a Mithra temple, which was the anc ient pagan religion, 
and it  is of a magician in his sacred robes, and he has a scroll in his hand while he's 
amidst  the people and it's closed.  
 But here in the synagogue of Dura, you have a Jewish man and around him is a 
crowd of people, though I don't see the crowd in that picture. His scroll is open in 
front of the people. Tigay just mak es this interesting observation and he thinks this 
is what makes Judaism unique.  
Jon: So that was unique in that time?  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
19 
 Tim: In the Roman era, there was no close connection between religion and texts. Jewish 
culture from the beginning tried to, first of al l, have everybody be literate so that 
they themselves can learn how to read and participate in reading the scriptures 
aloud.  
Jon: But what's not unique is, correct me if I'm wrong, is every culture uses oral 
storytelling to form their identity.  
Tim: That's correct.  
Jon: That that's not unique. But the fact that they write it down and they encourage 
everyone to read it together and to be literate, that's unique.  
Tim: That is unique. It has been unique in the history of Jewish culture.  
Jon: Why is that s ignificant? If I have access to the stories orally, why is it so significant 
that I have access via scroll instead?  
Tim: That's a good question. You're right, almost certainly through much of Israelite 
history, this oral memorization existed alongside...be cause written texts were still 
expensive to produce in ancient history, it's much easier to commit it to memory.  
Jon: Can you imagine living at a time where it's easier to just commit something to 
memory than to write it down? So backwards in my experience . 
Tim: Yeah. I mean, that's most of human history.  
Jon: That's most of human history?  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: We now live in a time in human history where it's far, far easier by orders of extreme 
magnitude to write it down and to remember it. Now, we don't reme mber anything  
Tim: Now we write it down. Kind of it exists in the cloud, in Google Docs. You're writing it 
down, but where does it actually...That's a good point. It's a game changer printing 
press.  
Jon: I just have to remember the distinctions. Get back in the brain of ancient worldview.  
Tim: This practice of every seven years reading the story of the Torah aloud — 
Jon: The teachings?  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
20 
 Tim: Yeah. The story of the Torah, the commands in the Torah aloud to t he people — 
Jon: And the stories in the Torah?  
Tim: Well, it seems like the proto Torah that Moses shaped was mostly...We know it 
involved that story of them being rescued so it was some narrative, and then it was 
also the terms of the covenant - what we ca ll the laws of commands. So whatever 
form that was, he passes it on.  
 Joshua, when the people cross the Jordan River and they first go in the land, after 
the battle of Jericho, they stop and they do this. They read the proto Torah aloud to 
everybody. This is in Joshua chapter 8. And you can see why.  
 We're now crossing the boundary into the new horizon as people, we're going to 
remember who we are, where we came from, why we're coming into this land, what 
this is all about. What's fascinating is then you k eep reading into Israel story, 
centuries go by and there's no mention of this practice. Centuries go by.  
 The next time this public reading of Israel's divine scriptures is mentioned is late in 2 
Kings. Like a generation before they went into exile. Josia h. He discovers some proto 
Torah scroll in the temple that's been forgotten. This is the minority report thing that 
what Moses was calling Israel too ended up being a minority view.  
Jon: A forgotten seal the way.  
Tim: A forgotten minority view. That's rig ht. So that by Josiah's time — 
Jon: Their view of their history and their identity was not shaped by the Torah.  
Tim: It was not shaped by the Exodus story or the covenant at Mount Sinai, which 
explains why most of Israel's history was one of polytheism. Jo siah finds this Torah 
scroll and blows his mind. He rips his clothing apart. He's so grieved to think that 
he's participated in distorting their heritage.  
Jon: He responds.  
Tim: Yeah, he responds. You would never walk away with that application.  
Jon: Yeah. "I think I'm supposed to tear my clothes is what I'm getting from this." That'd 
be a great devotional...  
Tim: It would be.  
Jon: "Read the Sermon on the Mount, and then tear your clothes off."  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
21 
 Tim: So what he does is he gets all the people together and  he has the priests read the 
Scriptures aloud. Then they're like, "Oh, all the people, Oh, I can't believe it. We've 
gone to the wrong." And it's a big reformation. He calls it the reformation of Josiah. 
That's another mention here.  
 But think of both of those stories. Joshua and Josiah, they're at their key transition 
moments in their history where either they are looking forward, "let's remember who 
we are as we go forward into this new thing," or for Josiah, it's looking backward, 
"and let's remember wh o we are. And oh, my gosh, we have not been faithful to the 
story and why God formed us in the first place."  
 These are two things that the Bible does to God's people. It can remind you who you 
are as you go into new territory that's unexplored. And so you 're looking for anchors 
to ground your identity and why you're here and what you're all about as you move 
into new experiences. That's Joshua chapter 8.  
 But then other times in Josiah story, it's you realize you've lost your way or you find 
yourself in a set of circumstances that are not what you ever wanted. And so hearing 
the scriptures read aloud it's like smelling salts wakes you up to who you really are 
and how I've been living in this way that's completely inconsistent with my true 
identity. That's w hat the reading of scriptures in public can do to people. It's 
powerful. It can both remind you of where you're going and where you've come 
from.  
[00:50:04]  
Tim: So the last story in the Old Testament about the public reading of Scripture is the 
one that brings it all together. It's in the book of Ezra and Nehemiah, which are one 
book in the Hebrew Bible. After the exile to Babylon people come back. Life's hard in 
Jerusalem but they're rebuilding it. Some wins, some losses, some compromises.  
 What they en d up doing is, in obedience to this practice of Moses talked about so 
long ago, they gather all the people around. And we're told about this little stage 
they make in the public court. They make a little podium or a wooden podium. The 
priests are all there  and the Levi and Ezra and Nehemiah and they gather all the 
people, children, men, women. Everybody's there.  
 Nehemiah 8:8, "They read from the scroll from the Torah of God, making it clear and 
giving it the sense so that the people could understand." This  is the first example of 
Israel after the exile coming together around the scriptures. But they're doing more 
than just reading. There's also — 
Jon: The interpretation?  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
22 
 Tim: Yeah. The people are expositing. They're giving the sense. This is the origins of 
preaching the sermon. The origin of the sermon is right here. Where did this practice 
come from?  
Jon: It's interesting because sermon is so ingrained into our tradition and it comes after 
already an established habit of just reading scripture aloud. "And n ow let's exposit it 
a little bit."  
Tim: That's right. The practice of just reading aloud is what came first. Late in the game 
come the idea of "what does this mean for us?"  
Jon: Or let's talk about it a little bit. Now, it's kind of the other way around. It's, "Hey, 
we're going to get together and talk about the Bible and we might read some...  
Tim: Or put a sentence of the Bible up on the screen and then give a long talk about it. 
Listen, this isn't about holier than thou. "The church is all gone astray." That's not the 
point.  
Jon: Because it's great to do that.  
Tim: Sometimes that's what community needs. But it is good for balance and for just so 
that we don't have historical amnesia. To remember the gathering of God's people, 
to hear something is a very  ancient practice.  
Jon: Exposit is also cool word because it seems like it must come from some word that 
exposes - just bring out what's there. Because I was youth group hero guy so I —  
Tim: Meaning you were super faithful?  
Jon: Yeah. I'd be there every week and I would start to even learn how to do expository 
teaching from my peers.  
Tim: Because it's all modeled for you.  
Jon: I remember the very first Bible study I wanted to do it was at school. It was some 
school Bible study thing. I wanted to do a fea r of the Lord, and it was me trying to 
come up with ideas for what I thought the Bible was saying about fear of the Lord.  
 So it became really more like me coming with ideas to the text, and sitting and 
letting the text speak, trying to expose what's in t he text. That's the habit I 
developed just naturally, somehow. I need to have some sort of idea and then find 
verses that helped me. You reinforce that idea. Versus "let's just read part of this and 
then see if we could expose any of the meaning through li ttle dialogue."  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
23 
 Tim: It makes you realize nobody comes to the Bible without a whole framework of 
preloaded assumptions and ideas. It's actually very hard to read the Bible without 
imposing on everything we already think we know. Because usually people are 
exposed to the Bible within a community, a church community or synagogue that 
you're either raised in or you become a part of. And really, what you learn first is 
what you hear taught all the time.  
 If what you hear taught all the time sometimes mentions the Bible, then what you'll 
learn is that framework or that scheme. Then you might get the gumption to actually 
read the Bible for yourself, but it's really hard to hear it.  
Jon: Yeah. Because you're trying to force it into that scheme.  
Tim: That's right . And so you end up marginalizing huge sections of the Bible because 
they don't fit what you thought this was all about. So it's very difficult to undo that. 
That's why the idea of having a big section of the Bible read aloud I think sounds 
weird to us bec ause most people will walk away with so many questions, and usually 
being confused and bothered by things.  
Jon: After a sermon, you're supposed to leave with less questions.  
Tim: And after sermon, you leave with clarity and conviction. I'm not saying that' s wrong. 
I'm just saying it's just different.  
Jon: We are very sermon heavy and the danger seems is mitigated. Any danger that that 
presents, which is now you're starting to impose ideas that aren't actually in the text? 
If that happens, a good way to mit igate that is read large sections aloud together.  
Tim: Yeah. That was some of the heartbeats behind the Read the Scripture series and that 
Bible reading app.  
Jon: So every seven years they're supposed to be doing this at the Feast of Booths. Is that 
the on e where you make a shelter?  
Tim: Yeah. You make a little shelter in your yard.  
Jon: And that happens every year. But every seventh, one of those, you're actually 
supposed to gather and read through the teachings.  
Tim: Correct.  
Jon: But then there's no e xample of that being done or there's no reference.  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
24 
 Tim: From Joshua, people entering the land until almost the exile to Babylon with Josiah, 
there's no mention of — 
Jon: But Josiah didn't do it during the — 
Tim: No, he just had an emergency meeting.  
Jon: Yeah, he did an emergency meeting. He didn't wait for the next.  
Tim: The emergency reading of Scripture.  
Jon: But we could assume that it probably was done, we just don't have records of it 
being done in the Bible itself.  
Tim: Yeah. And at least for the pe riod of the split kingdoms, it wouldn't surprise anyone 
to think that it was being neglected. Because, look at the spiritual and cultural status 
Israel.  
Jon: But during the first generations in the promised land or something, you can imagine 
it being done .  
Tim: Yeah. Yeah. The way Joshua frames it is the transition with Joshua's death. After 
Joshua - this is how the book of Judges opens - a whole generation arose that didn't 
know the God of Israel or anything that he had done for them.  
Jon: And how much time would have passed there from Joshua to then?  
Tim: Immediately.  
Jon: Oh, immediately?  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: Oh. 
Tim: Yeah. This is Judges chapter 2. Joshua dismiss the Israelites. They all go back in the 
tents. The people serve the God of Israel throughout the lifetime of Joshua and the 
elders who outlived him and saw everything that..."  
[crosstalk 00:57:41]   
Jon: so one generation.  
Tim: "After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another 
generation grew up. They didn't know the God of Israel."  E1: Ancient vs. Modern ways of Reading Scripture  
25 
 Jon: So the children were not participating in the — 
Tim: Yeah. The point is, is very quickly within the course of just a couple of generation of 
Israel being now settled in the land, they forget who they are, they forget their story, 
and they forget the kind of life that they're called to in relationship with God.  
Jon: Thanks for listening to this episode. We're going to finish this topic on reading the 
Bible aloud together in our next episode, the second in the series of how to read the 
Bible.  We'll see how Jesus started his ministry during a public reading of scripture.
