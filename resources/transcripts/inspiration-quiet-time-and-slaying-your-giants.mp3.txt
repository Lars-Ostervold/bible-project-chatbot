so today on the podcast we get to do a Q and our question in response episode we're going to do questions that are apart of the Paradox series to we're going to look at questions for the first half of this series the first half of the of the pillars and with me is Tim Mackie and Chris went up into these questions thanks for joining us here we go all right question number one is from Grant in Texas so I'm Grant from Denton Texas John and episode 1 of this series you shared your story of struggling with a quiet time Bible study Paradigm every part of the story runs so true to my experience so I was disappointed that it ended with you as a post Bible Christian can you continue telling the story what advice would you give to someone who is struggling with his Paradigm do you maintain something like a quiet time Bible study now if so how is he
 the matured and if not what is he replaced it with thanks so much she was probably an outflow of that journey I don't like to give up on things and stubborn that way and so I continue to like to talk about the Bible and try to understand that even though I was with frustrated with reading it and one of the people that I got to be that way with with you Tim and that was always a really rewarding experience and still always really believed that the ideas in the bible really important I don't know how I held that information with like Bibles not part of my life any more bad ideas in the Bible and poor by post Bible question that the Bible is not that important in my daily life
 you got to know the right answers though got to know the right things foundational things that you think are good beautiful true yeah but the way the Bible tries to tell me that is frustrating and so yeah to hide other people seem to get it so maybe I could have talked to those people and they can explain it to me and so you know that the first idea of this project was just a theology YouTube channel just to talk with Scholars and try to understand how they understand the Bible and then explain that to others conversation we had about the idea doing this was you coming to me with an idea of YouTube channel with a sarcastic title call see ology is boring cuz I was bored but I knew that I shouldn't be yeah right and so but then you Tim we're like oh look I have a lot of cons
 we can make videos about and this wouldn't be presented like the list of things videos and so we don't need to go and interview people let's make this content and that we were Off to the Races and you focus me on I've been very shaped by Systematic Theology and that's that was the lens by which I was trying to understand the Bible question and then you approach the Bible with that question to try to answer it right and then try to systematize creative could have very clean the illogical grid by which I can understand everything and I was given that grid and then I was told to go and read the Bible understand the Bible through that grid and it just didn't work. Just put in I couldn't make it to work together and only people that could seem to have a knack for the Bible that I didn't have but then you really resented me on biblical theology which is a different perspect
 let's come to the Bible and try to engage the Bible through its own texture its own grain what are the questions it's asking or dressing or dress and we never thought to ask answer that's been really rewarding in terms of like a quiet time I haven't given up on that I'm really bad at any sort of routine actually my personality like I I've actually I've wondered before I don't think I have any routines in my life I don't answer that don't answer all day you eat everyday yeah eventually eventually all eat during the day you'll get to work and we'll be eating lunch and I will brush my teeth everyday but but sometimes it won't brush my teeth before I go to bed and annoys my wife's on the scale of routine you are more on the less plan
 yes it is a good question because it's probably a lot of people are like that or for whatever reason or another don't resonate with this discipline is quiet time of readings for sure so I'll just give myself a pass like that's okay that doesn't have to be my ideal really with anything that requires like a routine the way I get things done as I just I do with my energy for that day I do it there's a fly in that for long stretches another will hack is when when you're procrastinating on something make yourself do something else that you would otherwise be procrastinating on that seems a little less intense so like what's the minimum amount of thing that I do have energy for that I can that I could do anyways yeah when I read the Bible it's not everyday I try to look read in the larger larger chunks like read a whole letter of Paul all at once and try not to understand every line that's where I was going
 is I would try to understand like every single line what do you mean by that what you mean by that and then I'm down the rabbit hole and I'm confused and frustrated and so being okay that I'm going to have a lot of questions and then having a community of people that I can read the Bible with you two trying to do that with my family as well we just read the Bible together so those are the new habits and what are the goals we have about project is to create bottlenecks of scripture people who are dedicated to like kind of a intense maybe slightly obsessive a huge part of my life become so enamored with areas in an area
 and then perhaps you have it so I think once you get there if that becomes you and this might be controversial but I don't think every follower of Jesus is necessarily going to be like a bad Waring Bible nerd totally understand who Jesus Is In following you at least need to be really familiar with his life and teachings and liked what you did and then to make sense of him and why you you know follow him thank you do what you do about him being some wider story but it doesn't mean yeah that everybody's going to have the same degree of steps and time commitment into understanding Bible and that's called the body of Christ you know summer different Limbs and different parts and nuts of all things work together for my life is to know God to love God and help other
 now I'm laughing more too I think that's a pretty General goal that most Christians could adopt and that doesn't mean you have to do Bible nerd it doesn't mean you have to be quiet time and means you value knowing who God is and and that does mean similarity with the biblical stories and I sent but it also means finding ways to connect with him that don't have to just be reading scripture be like for me I love prayer walks it's really hard for me to sit down and just focus but I love like going on a walk and praying or thinking or reflecting with a friend about scripture or yeah I just I don't think it has to look the same for everyone but knowing god and loving God receiving his love I think is a really important part of the Christian Life Bible married if you want it like own that and hopefully there's a lot of people listening to this part of the project could just follow Jesus really yeah I want the Bible to be I want I want I want to dive in deep
 I think it manifests in different ways for me I'm not going to I'm probably going to be the guy is going to learn Greek and Hebrew and go to school but I think that the Bible as literary art does come to life begin the shape of me while in this community of people who there's some people who have done that and so that's that's really exciting so I would call like I actually now feel like I've gone from being a post Bible Christian some would say yeah I want the Bible to be one of the one of the biggest passion of my life and have a vision for that and so it doesn't mean they know that I'm going to learn Greek and Hebrew or how quiet time every day but reading long stretches and in Reading Community our next question is from Emily and Kansas this question comes from one of the First episodes cuz I don't remember being in this conversation so hi Tim and John my name is Emily and I'm from Kansas City to questions how Adidas
 guide the difference between the scriptures being inspired versus an errant to someone who comes from a tradition that emphasizes inerrancy also how do you inspired scriptures differ from other writings were people are reflecting on God and like for example how do you spell it's today you are contemplating God as they write differ from the biblical authors inspiration and what role does this play when considering which writings to view as most important for gaining insight into God's intentions thank you that's a good question. There's so many questions in there just always has a note that there's been so many questions sent him over the last few weeks and so Emily question is a great summary of what a lot of lot of people were asking Emily finger on the pulse yeah exactly so maybe some definitions so inspired is a term it's an English word that's a translation one way to translate this time
 on the Paul uses in Tucson on second letter to Timothy Ray says all scripture is stay on this stuff's Greek god spirited workout threes we had a whole conversation. That really wrong so it's important when Paul's writing that he's thinking primarily of the Hebrew Bible or most likely the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible cuz he's talking about the Bible that Timothy grew up reading with his mom and his grandma and orderlies hearing you know what synagogue in church and that's significant because it means it wasn't just those original words in the original language but also translation of it that are inspired that's right can imagine the voice in the message from God coming through human writings in Hebrew and Greek and he also believed we had a conversation about this and so did Peter and John that's through their guidance and instructions to the early Jesus followers that the spear
 God will also speaking through them and what they were riding to the Jesus followers so inspired is just referring to this conviction or confession that these writings in a unique way as a result of a human and divine Partnership of human and got spirit so that what these people wrote is what God wants his people to hear to leave them to the Messiah and to know what it means to be human in Earth City is it actually a different term that addresses whole different thing altogether that's interesting maybe it's cuz they both have the word in low as it emerged in people's minds private and also because I think they're both trying to get at the question of the authority and truthfulness that means it's a Latin terms means without error or making no mistakes so in error I think it's Latin to buy fruits so it's an old idea
 in the Christian tradition but it became that Rose into prominence just in the last 75 years of slow in Europe mostly America in public debates that we're being had about the authority and the truthfulness when you're talking about doesn't make an error or does that not make an error we're talking about issues of truthfulness reliability reliability truthful is to be reliable with the same thing so what's funky about the term in there it is it's a reverse way it's a negative it doesn't have errors you could just flip it over and when you flip it over and think about this idea then we come to where scripture itself without spoke Aguilera for it that scripture is truthful and so here you did work study video on this yeah faithful or I'm in the Hebrew word that means reliable trustworthy but it's a relational word so
 when you say that someone is truthful you know you would what you're saying is what you're saying corresponds to fact but maybe I'll we might think of it sounds like scientifically accurate and precise know that's right that's kind of associations of the word truth but as you're pointing out in the video and in our discussions about that video I mean it's it's has to do with relationships and that someone is trustworthy to be who they say they are what they say they're going to do and so that's the term used so there's the most famous lines are in Psalm 119 the longest chapter in the Bible is lions that some of the most famous King James line by word is truth the sound of a tie words is true but it's the word Emmett from him could also be translated your word is reliable and trustworthy but that raises the whole question of trustworthy to do what
 in what way and did what what like how do you define an error if you're using that idea of the last century were mostly focused in the historical truthfulness or the historical reliability of biblical narratives particular inspiration and there is he got joined and it's kind of a logical argument will if God is truth in Assassin's Creed cannot lie or make an error than God's word whatever he says will not lie and will be entirely truthful and will not make any errors and so let me get that makes sense but there was an important Moment In the late 70s where a large number I should know more about this if I'm going to bring up the podcast but a large number of Steel I think mostly for America came together in Chicago in 1978 I think it was and drafted a kind of a temp to be a unifying statement about these in there and see debates
 you can look it up it's the Chicago statement on a nurse yeah that's right it's talking about these ideas but there's one section of it that gets to the Scituate historical truthfulness and it's there's a lot buried in to it and for me I was always interested in that one paragraph where it's talking about how to claim the the scripture is telling the truth specially when it tells story doesn't mean that we should demand that the biblical authors write historiography the way modern modern westerners think of historiography and so that they would use around numbers or symbolic number with it they might summarize or use artistic and stylistic conventions and how they tell a story and they can describe things from the eye of the author rather than from scientific fact inerrancy shouldn't mean that we demand that the biblical authors correspond to our ways of writing writing literature important
 a graph that I stopped and there have been now whole books on that so yeah it's Article 13 of the Chicago statement thank you Ray Lubeck it stuck in my mind forever way to bring that up so in many ways I'm not an expert on this so if you want someone drove in a Publisher's has a great they have a whole series of books called Counterpoint series we're looking for reviews on Five Years on that they have a book called five views on biblical inerrancy and it's all spectrum and they're all people who love and follow Jesus and he believes scriptures are a Divine human but they have different ways of framing up how you define an Etsy and that diversity is important because you could on one Spectrum say every detail as stated verbally must correspond to historical reality like you're watching video camera footage and on the other end of the spectrum you could say he's had a different mode of right
 and they use a lot of symbolism stylistic literary and creative elements and yet it can still claim to be a faithful a truthful representation of the events and there's a whole diverse set of positions along those two spectrums and them the Christian tradition has room for a lot of different viewpoints but the Baseline is that it's a truthful presentation you don't mean precisely accurate in how it would have happened in the time-space Continuum that is one way to imagine what truthful could mean another way to imagine that truthful could mean is that it is a truthful in that it's relaying something that happened and it's relaying a faithful interpretation
 about the meaning and significance of what happened so the meaning and significance is truthful reliable who did and said these things who was publicly executed and that he was his body was recreated they rose from the dead in the tomb was empty the meaning of those event was not self-evident to any of the people who watch them happen it took them a long time at least 40 days then for some longer to sort out the significance in the meaning of what happened but we have this debate about the the phrase three days three days three days and three nights is on the third day Friday right Friday afternoon to Sunday morning and you debating about rotations of the sun and the sky it's a shorthand phrase full of symbolic meaning from the Hebrew Bible and that's the kind of thing the Raptor
 we are the we need to allow for a category of truthfulness but that doesn't put a modern set of expectations of historiography fathers and I take me a long time to settle myself into that and so it was very disorienting for me when I first started trying to learn about all this but that's inspired in there it will you had another part of your question that we can talk about just curious how that plans with you to review review for the salt on them I've got questions but I don't know how many questions we want to get through with bulimia says it's really important like you said it's really important that a man named Jesus who lived in the Middle East lived and died and I kind of thought he said that's why he was recreated but the way that the narratives of Jesus's life were crafted You could argue they were stylized heavily
 don't like tennis for accounts and their differently there is a lot of people who try to bring Harmony to the gospels which seems like it's not letting the gospels do with the gospels are trying to do another project so I guess my question is how do you wrestle to the ground as you're reading and narrative what are those things were to you it's really important that this thing happened with this person lived for this event took place versus I'm okay with the stylized version and is it just the Jesus was recreated is that it and then the rest you can hold Loosely or is there other characters and other specific events that it's like that needed to have happened in and then how do you get how do you decide what where to draw the line well I mean what we have received is an Israelite family history and if I'm not in this for
 that I'm grafted into that family through is ripe Sia so there's a the Spectrum reviews on this personally it matters to me that this isn't just a work of fiction create a section with just a few connections to the store whole realities and even you know part we had Joshua swamidass genetic scientists on the podcast why was because he was addressing the genealogies and the notion of ancient genealogies and in a way that created a new category for me especially about the historical reference of the genealogies going all the way back to these figures named Autumn and fava Adam and Eve who would have existed in history before the Hebrew language even had the form to say the words of dhammapada another words their names in The Narrative are their names
 form yet and so I took for me and matters that there's a historical reference point for this family history going all the way back to do its beginning but the way that that family history as represented as a highly creative literary form the way that refers to what we would call historical events and people and saw on I've become more comfortable with the connection between the literary representation and whatever the historical reality is that the biblical officers aren't giving his video camera footage the best metaphor I know how to use they have a family history that I think is anchored in history but the way that they're portraying it literally just to help later generations understand the meaning and they use literary creativity to do that when do the same thing when we retell our family histories I do and it's different because this is different culture and way of writing but I think we can relate that there's truth is a true story but it's Style
 stylized and I think it's it's going to an extreme to say well if it's so literally creative than that means it's being just made up and it didn't happen what happened exactly as represented in every detail including the literary creativity and I just happen to think there's more more views possible to extreme we were just having a discussion about the age of certain characters in Genesis 1 through 11:00 and we're at the ending of a literary unit in Genesis 1 through 11 you often find the number 77 for 777 and so you know it was someone so actually 777 or was that a literary airbrushing to create the literary pattern for the reader to notice this development of The Seventh-Day rest and so I become comfortable with airbrushing of details to make literate patterns work but it doesn't mean is that person ever
 existed it means that a Stories being told in a certain way to make a point and that's the exciting part of literature that's artistic and stylized is that there's meaning communicated by by that Artistry so I hear you saying you're at you're comfortable with some airbrushing they're not using a Photoshop filter would that creates an entire character that's not historical sure and even think about how the process is work this week it actually gets in some of the questions that were coming into about how oral Traditions turned into written traditions and oral history and so on but once again this isn't about wasting an agenda on to the Bible it's exit we're trying to do the reverse and we're just saying what were the processes that God used by the work of the spirit to produce this family history that leads to the Messiah and I think we need to Humble ourselves that the way that this family produce retained told its history and shaped it could be really different than how we would do it
 they were happening today and it's honoring that historical cultural difference but I am I recognize that there's a lot of different views on this within the bigger stream of Christian Orthodoxy throughout history that has always been the case since it doesn't like novel very old conversation yeah I think for me an important question to ask is what is the author's or what what are the author's intentions and portraying this actor event in this way and what kind of literature is this that I'm reading and what does that mean so is when we re Genesis is this history is a narrative and what are the literary markers that tell us that when we read the gospels about Jesus and it's what would you say is it's a biography biography and communicate truth in a certain way that's different than maybe the Proverbs that are communicating truth in these short
 things or than a parable that Jesus tells that's going to communicate truth in a different way so I think Chandra how literature communicates and how what the author's intentions are are really important for me to try to figure out why but what things we should take in what ways do the trick is how do we know an author's intentions but we have to go after the cues near actual Scrolls or how later Arthur's reflects oh and when Paul says to the Corinthians that if Christ was not raised then our faith is in vain he's saying this is really important that we take this as historical fact I used to try and rank in the Bible is like what that one's got to be truthful or else it all falls apart but that's why I'm not so much
 there's a part of me that still wants to do that I become suspicious of that to you myself because all of a sudden it's like my very limited life experience and brain is trying to sleep then you're equating truth in history again and see if we can verify it's a family history that's been passed down to us it's not like we can go time travel and check what we can do is when there's different accounts of the same events in the Bible which there are we can compare them and what you see is differences in details the point to a lot of this literary creativity what do people try to verify through archaeology and you can in a very rough and general black there was a davidic kingdom yeah we verified that is awesome and it references the House of David and
 it's cool but like that doesn't tell us anything about the literary portrayal of the House of David in the book of Samuel and and how accurate those words there's no rock you can pick up that's going to tell you about that it can just tell you that there was a Dometic Kingdom I've heard people argue though that like like The Exodus that if that many people did travel through the Sinai Peninsula we would find something that which we would find something in the Shadowland in archaeology example that narrative is a good place to see that there's a variety of positions where you can affirm that historical event happened to the ancestors of Israel but the way that is portrayed in the narrative you could take a variety of positions on it that the apocalyptic creation decreation symbolism has been ratcheted up to 11
 narrative to communicate theological points and the better part of the presentation of the narrative and how that relates to historical events will I think there's some complexity there but it doesn't mean that nothing happened it's like asking in what way is this true rather than imposing our Viewpoint of Truth on the issue right there and this is not one that's easily resolved but I do think one can come to peace with a spectrum of positions that a firm the historical truthfulness of the Bible but that don't force us to bulldozer ignore the literary creativity of the biblical authors have their cake and eat it too but it does just lead to there's just so much we don't know historical knowledge isn't like science can't repeat the events of the past and verify them archaeology and historiography our disciplines that can give us tools to think reasonably and critically
 but it's not like I said experiment that you can reproduce in a lab ultimately there is a level of trusting the testimony of the biblical authors about these events and the meaning of these events as long as long as we've got another question from Trey from West Lafayette Indiana that we know Jesus use the same Canon we do because he refers to the law of the prophets in the Psalms and Luke 24 could you explain how we know that the song before the entire third section of the Hebrew scriptures I would have expected him to say something like the law and the prophets maybe the writings are the letters if that's the thank you so much for your podcast on all your videos yeah. Quick question shortest answer is your right and Luke 24 Jesus just mentioned this to pass the test where he refers to the Hebrew Bible because of the tour in the profits in two times and then the tour of the prophets in the Psalms and what's interesting is that that Torah prophets Psalms also
 corresponds to how the Bible nerds who produced The Dead Sea Scrolls so other second temple Jewish communities around the same time a little bit Century before Jesus also referred to the Hebrew Bible as the tour of the prophets and David but then you also have other historians are Jewish writers like Philo and Josephus and what they described the three-part collection they do use the store out of the prophets and the other writings or name the writings right away calling at the katoozian as a shorthand the writings for that third section of the Tanakh just seemed like it was a crystallization in there a term that developed if you can develop post Jesus even though we know it was being used by some people in the time of Jesus another little clue is in Luke 11 Jesus's is announcing a prophetic Oracle of Doom over the towns of Israel that
 accepting his vision of the kingdom of God cuz he's convinced they're going to be destroyed by the Romans did they keep going the way they're going and he talks about how the blood of all the prophets is going to be held accountable by this generation and he talks about the blood from Abel Genesis 42 the blood of Zechariah and they as a little detail you know this Zakaria who was killed in between the temple and author not necessarily from the book of Zechariah that narrative that he's referring to is near the end of a Chronicles scroll and in a very common Jewish ordering of the writing's Chronicles is the conclusion of the third part of the collection of names the beginning of the writing songs and the concluding book of the writing's the beginning of the Torah
 yeah for able to Zechariah is he saying the whole Hebrew Bible from the Torah to Chronicle the shape that he had yep that's right because Chronicles comes last only in Hebrew ordering a variety in medieval manuscripts there's a variety of ordering for the writings that's third section but we know that one of them was the ending with songs and ending with Chronicles and that seems to be but these two mentions that seems to be what she says has in his mind to the why would you use Psalms of the shorthand for the entire collection it is the first book of the writings and it's a really big buck in the writings may be just as a synecdoche so as of what is that a kind of a metaphor in part to describe how I feel like I got no wheels but you're talking about a car so he's a part to describe the whole so I think it's that kind of thing and actually that's what happens when the New Testament and Jesus
 is the phrase the law and the prophets to describe the whole of the Hebrew Bible or to say David for ancient Jewish writers to use David to describe even the whole book of Psalms or the writings in a part one author to describe the whole day but didn't write all the songs so go out there is used to describe the whole Tanakh as a synecdoche listen to Moses than you would also accept me I wonder if he's referring to the whole of the Hebrew Bible or if he's just a friend to the Torah part for the hole there's a passage in John chapter 10 where Jesus quotes from the Psalms but he says isn't it written in the Torah anybody calls from his home so yeah it doesn't seem like the the terms to refer to sections is as what he say is as clear and categorized there was a looseness in
 variety of terms means instruction and so that can become a shorthand for the entire of zebras you mentioned what Psalm 119 earlier and it's always refer to the Torah the Torah Torah right that's one of the term but also of judgments and three steps and statue other than your word and so on and whenever I study that passage as a as a young Christian going up to the church for us we would talk about the whole Bible when you read Psalm 119 how I love your teachings we were thinking about Justice Revelation was the psalmist they're thinking always specifically about the Torah where they thinking about the whole riding she's like there's the song scroll by the introduction someone and and two together and then the design of the book of Psalms Psalms scroll have five macro parts
 as a symmetry around the prophets matching the five girls on the other side namely the Torah so that the Tanakh opens with the five-part Torah and then the third part begins with a five-part Psalm scroll to me as a signal that the final shape of the Psalms is it self-aware of the whole collection this question merges right into the next one from Cody in California by Tim John and Carissa this is Cody from California I am a long-standing Avid listener of the Bible project podcast and am truly loving this Paradigm series my question is this should we call the Bible the word of God yes there are hundreds of moments it was in the Bible where it says the word of the Lord came to so-and-so or thus says the Lord and so forth for the Bible never actually calls itself the word of God it even refers to Jesus as the word in the Gospel of John and was so much human influence upon the writing a composition and arrangement of the literature that can
 prizes our modern Bible I'm curious about calling the whole thing from cover to cover the word of God is that right all right thank you so much for all that you do
 Cody would have precisely worded questioned so that is the fun question and it's making me look up the word of God and search it throughout the New Testament to see what it refers to I did that yesterday remind myself of it cuz I remember I remember this but I wanted to upload the facts so you're right Codey the phrase word of God in the Old and New Testaments primarily refers to either a narrative with somebody's telling somebody he's with the message of about Covenant faithfulness of the profits to the word of God comes to sound so do I say I do in the New Testament of the phrase word of God or they spoke God's word is a shorthand for telling the story of Jesus as Israel's Messiah who's crucified raised from the dead gift of the spirit and so on that in the book of Acts Paul and Barnabas will arrive and they share the word of God photo sharing a summary
 or the good news or the good news you have a good news about Jesus is a sickly and in Paul's letters the same same thing tells the Thessalonians you know when we came and told you about Jesus you received our word not as a word from humans but as a word from God and then Jesus you know called the word in the Gospel of John John to John and Revelation weird about shorthand for the good news announcement that tells the whole biblical story as a story leading to this world there are a couple uses however I'm where I think the idea of calling all the scriptures by the sprays the word of God developed from so for example in the letter to the Hebrews the pastor has this whole discussion long discussion about Psalm 95 as giving God's word to the community that he's writing to wherever they were living and there's a point in Hebrews chapter 4 where the pastor just called song
 85 you just as he calls it the word of God those to whom the word of God comes which is the people and writing to so there a song that has the word of God and what's interesting is earlier in Hebrews chapter 1 and 2 he's quoting from the Psalms and there he calls the Psalms just David he says as it says in David many quotes yes so David can stand for the whole song scroll even though he's only named in the masoretic keep Route 73 of the of the Palms but then two chapters later he can call a Psalm of David but the word of God so the biblical authors don't have a conception where if it's connected to one of the human authors it's less Divine or we shouldn't call it the word of God they does Opera what does paradigm that God's word uniquely was communicated through these texts written by humans so you're right and noting the calling of
 word of God is a it's a step that doesn't quite happen in the scriptures themselves but you can see where the Logics going and work where it comes from the same way that's on 95 is a word of God than every Solomon is a word of God yeah that's right and then if the Psalms are word of God then why not the other writings in the Bible also be the word of God to the point where in the Bible is the word of God yeah the phrase word of God though feels like it's become a little bit abstract to set the right or it's just it's become Christian needs to wear I'm not even quite sure what that means but it gives the impression of dictation straight from God and for that reason I would prefer to call it scripture and the word of God it seems like the way the authors are using it as it's more to talk about the message or the story of scripture the biblical terminology
 just the scriptures where the writings and even though cuz the word the Bible does not occur in the Bible scripture the word bible means scroll and it was never all on one scroll it wasn't a collection of Scrolls and then much later in the Codex toast Jesus so even though we called the Bible project the Bible's project or the Scrolls project but the scriptures the word of God in our cultural context can actually miss communicate this important biblical Paradigm of it being a product of the human and divine is exactly what Cody was bringing out that it is there is human involvement human partnership at the same time the benefit of calling the word of God is that it truly is a Divine Divine anthology of Scrolls also don't know if it's not as
 awesome game. Wow classic concession concession concession is that it's both at the same time in the one doesn't minimize our compromise the other which is a hard balance to strike in our imaginations I think cuz we tend to think that if it's one that's somehow minimized the other examples where the Prophet hears from God and then delivers our word that seems like casually transcribed in a way it's kind of like this is the thing I heard I'm just going to tell you the thing I heard when Paul goes and tells the good news to a new community he is using his creativity to summarize what happened and why it mattered but then his use of creativity and his summarization is called the word of God says both using is there in the Bible itself but I agree with you Chris today so I think what we typically think of them we say word of God in a modern setting is more of this transcribed like God said it's very specific way
 and then we just wrote it down without using our creativity the phrase can under a size the human element of the Bible to I think is not just it is not necessary to minimize the human involvement but I think it can have negative effects over the long-term mainly setting people up to think that the Bible is more Divine than human and then when they're exposed to the human history of the Bible if become scandalous when I don't think it needs to be an argument for calling it the word of God but allowing the idea of what a word from God is to be more of a collaborative partnership and and about the the message about the Messiah the story about the Messiah has never had a council where they drew up a theological dictionary of their terms they used a variety of terms to describe lots of ideas depending on the context that they were in and show me the the most
 example was always that the primary title Jesus used to call himself was the son of a dumb son of humanity but the apostles and their writings never call him that they called the Messiah was Son of God which were the Great titles that Jesus explicitly tried to avoid using in public but both are true but just based on the different contexts in the moments in history different vocabulary serve two purposes and so the same way of how we refer to the scripture is I think I can vary depending on context got a question from Heather and Maryland hi Tim John and Carissa my name is Heather Morton and I live in Cheverly Maryland my question has to do with the second temple literature that influence Cheese's in as early followers were Protestants mistaken to remove these books from the scriptures you think our relationship with God or a Biblical understanding is diminished by not having them in our Bibles thanks so much for the series in finding it really helpful
 yeah great question yeah really good question maybe one place to start is it is a clarification so this broader set of texts from second temple period were widely disseminated in Greek translation along with the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible after the the writings of the Tanakh the Jewish Bible 39 bucks it's the same books that are in a Protestant Old Testament just a little bit different numbering by the Protestant Division and then 24 is it up in the Hebrew Bible after that and before the New Testament before these were all there was a collection of Scrolls so like since you didn't find all the girls together in one collection this idea of what the collection is where the boundaries of the collection are that felt maybe a little dirty and blurry because
 certainly there is opportunity for it to be blurry cuz it wasn't ever Bound by two covers in a Kodak sit in that early second temple. However I do think you can pay attention to the structural clues of the Tanakh and we would you are paying attention to her earlier about the the Psalms at the third section begins with a five-part scroll Psalms matching the five-part for a at the beginning of the collection Chronicles is a retelling from Adam to the Exile in the return from Exile so it's very much a concluding type of story so I do think there's intelligent life in the design and collection of the Tanakh however did all Jewish communities perceive that one and then two were there some Jewish communities but also reviewed other texts of more recent origin that they didn't conceive of as part of the Tanakh where they stopped the boundaries were blurry and so they held other texts having a Divine human origin and
 answer that question is yes and whether it's the Messianic Community Jude belongs to for Enoch was very clearly revealed he wouldn't quote it otherwise the Dead Sea scroll Community there was a school called the temple scroll that's an amalgamation of all of the apocalyptic Temple Visions in the Hebrew Bible to talk about a temple that is yet to come and they accept this as a as a word of prophecy about the restoration of a new Temple when the Messiah comes and they held in very high regard so the trick is is right from the beginning of the Jesus movement there were a variety of community America was never centralized after its scattered out of Jerusalem and there were communities and you can trace their history into the second third fourth Century that held them or blurry wider selection of Greek scriptural writings but there were always voices to that said now but the Jewish communities always held this particular section the Tanakh
 a unique divine-human words is different from all the others and Jesus and most of the Apostles theme on that train because they use unique vocabulary when they quote from the Tanakh that's different from when they will borrow language from Seth writing so I'm compelled that there was an entity called the Tanakh the 24 Scrolls but that doesn't mean that every Jewish Community recognize that is a firm boundary line and that even some of the really messy and communities this has been an issue of debate and so in the medieval early medieval codexes codices of the Greek translation of the Bible that were produced by Christians of these all have both the Greek translation of the Tanakh and other second temple writings in them and the New Testament writings and so when the English Bible started to be produced the earliest Geneva Bible the earliest King James Bibles had this wider second temple literature in it and it was the Catholic Protestant debates
 add to the production of Bibles that put these books separate as an appendix was happening in the first decades after the printing press and then as the centuries went on they were just removed altogether Protestant Bibles so it's important to say when Protestants removed them one since it's true but in another sense they were just recognizing something that the some questions and I stopped namely that that's not is a very unique revelation of God's word to his people that's different from these other books I tried to talk to you long time but maybe the biggest takeaway from this is It's Complicated and it's not it's not simple and this used to bother me for a long time I mean it really bothered me well so it's complicated to try to put your finger on exactly what should be considered scripture or not is everything it's complicated because going back to the origins of the Jesus movement there have been different
 opinion but the differences don't mean that there's no such thing called the Tanakh it's about these other texts that were revered alongside the Tanakh in summerly Jesus communities and that has been the case from the beginning of wisdom Maccabees they were revered by the Jewish community and later communities and to go back to Heather's question they are useful and super helpful for even if even for Protestants their helpful for contacts for theology for early interpretation of scripture for all of those things so even if Protestants say this isn't part of what we'd consider scripture or authentic scripture they're still very useful I think that's important but it is a genuine difference in the Christian tradition and the trick is there's no one form of these extra writings there's a traditional Catholic Bibles just called the
 did Rob Cannon but in most forms of the Orthodox tradition there's a couple more clean jubilees and the in one in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church there's a couple more Enoch into beliefs and in each of those expanding Traditions it's saying in these books we hear a word from God by which we evaluate and measure claims about the will and purpose of God in the world the word Canon means it's a Greek word that means a measuring line or an eval evaluating line and so the confession has been that the Canon of scripture. It's God's people to measure what we can say reflects the will and purpose of God so the trick is what collection is the measure and there's no a lot in these books that liked is really out of the ballpark completely you know how to do Canon or extra books that's like woo-hoo that's coming out of left field
 most of it is just developing what's in the top in the first place terms of ideas but there are some parts that came out as a debate between Catholics and Protestants and that's what led to the bank when you're asking a question are they scripture some things that are helpful to consider are the shape of the Tanakh so the the seams of the Tanakh that are seemed really intentional like the beginning of the prophets Joshua 1 the beginning of the writing's the end of the Torah the prophets and the writings all pointing to this leader to come and then when you hear the New Testament authors reflect on the Hebrew Bible they do refer to a three-part collection not a four-part election so if they consider that I'd be curious to know how people who include the deutero Cannon as part of the Bible how they see that wedding within the Literary story as far as its macro design it did it have the same
 kind of features in Sims or is it different qualitatively like Judas or Tobit so awesome it reads like it's written by people who knows it's not so well and they're just work in the design patterns Judith is all about the main character Judas which is the Hebrew word for Jewish woman and she is the Mets Crusher she's the seat at the woman who is the seed of the woman depicted as of course you're just becoming snake Crusher and the snake Crusher the snake is an amalgamation of Assyria Babylon and Persia been like 23 big bad empires in the Bible do you like a man that's just work in the same team but you eat mac and cheese and Maccabees reads like a propaganda document for the Maccabee in raising him the command room in Revolt in the 160s and it's you're like wow this is this is a different pool I'm swimming in right now so there is there are differences
 even within the doodle Canon what detects agendas are and what they're about and it's all Illuminating to help us understand the wider cultural context in which Jesus was born and into which the apostles you know riding doing nothing but it's a genuine difference and as much as I've worked on these questions I can reach this point where I don't know what else to do except to say that this is the genuine difference between Catholic Protestant Orthodox Traditions but there's so much to be unified about in terms of the main content of all this literature in the main thing leading the Messiah that for me the unity of all across the Traditions is what's much more striking than the differences but I know other people feel differently okay let's take another question this is from Willie and John my name is Willie but I am originally from Florida
 I wanted to get your thoughts or a composition to me the arbitrary picking up the names of God to ascertain the origins of a dog is too far-fetched but do you think there's any validity to that theory even though we understand the Bible if so how do we uphold inspiration by one most strong the composition of Victoria Austin used by many minutes to Divine authority of the Bible thanks for everything you do this weekend and yes this is a question about the sources behind the the pentateuch or the Torah and what that means for the authority of it as a text and whether it's necessary to affirm that Moses was the author of the Torah for it to have Authority for the author of all the material in the form that we have it today
 16 or Siri Siri call Willie just anchoring in some earlier parts of the pillars of the Paradigm in the our conversation so just say that a Biblical author has used many sources to make a Biblical book there shouldn't be anything controversial about that that's how Scrolls were produced in the ancient world as long as we see the writing process as this act of Revelation from God and that time as opposed to just the event or one inspired author it's the actual writing of the text so an author a later author who adds to it and editor shapes it all of those processes are part of shaping God's word through his Spirit yeah even if one does hold to a Moses authorship of all of the pentateuch in his final form you have to take on board the Moses received Source material
 for all of the stuff that came before him cuz he only appears in the second book he was my life for everything that came before him so he asked who had sources for that and you have to know that someone came in after an added at least a few things in the story of Abraham and Isaac Binding of Isaac there's a little detail in there that's an illusion from an author an aerator who's standing centuries after Moses cuz he's referring to Jerusalem as the place where Yahweh will provide or be seen by his people there's lots of little things like that throughout the Taurus SHO a perspective from a later Israelite history so we don't have to limit inspiration to the name doctors even within the Bible itself there is references to a tradition of scribes and Prophets alongside we're coming after Isaiah refers to his disciples in the Book of Proverbs there's a whole section that says these are the words of Solomon that the
 end of Hezekiah assembled and that's like centuries after some of it so the Big Lots or trying to hide their composure many sources so there's this one particular Siri you're referring to the Willy call JDP this is a fascinating rabbit hole in the history of the vehicle studies I'll try not to go on for too long cuz I've been really interested in this so discussion about the source material of the Torah in particular that goes it's very ancient a very ancient conversation but in in Germany in the 1800s it took on a particular Focus the scholars who are really the engine behind what became known as the documentary hypothesis which ADP number Scholars Katta Buddha somebody graph graph and then bail house in the highway is bell housing and for them it was both about using Divine names as a way to peel a part the sources and try and reverse-engineer the Torah but it wasn't just that
 it was a whole model of reconstructing the history of Israelite religion that's what they were really after and they had a concept that Israelite religion developed from Keith's email individuals who are inspired by the prophetic Genius of God spirit that encounter God and led the people and then what happened throughout Israel history was a degrading of that into a form of legalistic religion and so they align the sources jedp in this order from like Poetic prophetic inspirational down to legalism in pharisaism okay and so the last Source p is most of the ritual stuff in Leviticus and so on and so in that whole model is a deeply anti-semitic agenda and deeply on historical understanding of the history of Israelite religion agenda oh and very much and agenda yeah that fits into
 nothing in Germany 1800 just about trying to identify sources the history of kind of Tu Calor Torah composition history of the scholarly debates about that have continued to rage and even though jedp has a particular hold in certain universities in America most of European biblical scholarship has moved on to other models for the composition of the Torah so there is a real interest in what is the source material and how am I able to find that there might have been different maybe communities of material that were brought together or whatever when you read in Hebrew and really begin to go in detail in these texts you can often see the literary themes of where the action ended and we're a new source was spliced together you can see the handiwork of it's cool it's cool to see part of the shaping of the thread the overall story but the fact that it was
 from sources doesn't mean that it's less inspired if we mean by inspired a Divine and human partnership one of the most compelling arguments to me for this Divine hand at work in the text that is written and shaped by a variety of different authors I mean more than 50 different authors and editors and yet it is a unified work I mean can you imagine trying to do that over so much time today with so many different authors trying to write a religious political historical document still have it be unified so if you're interested Willie they're very expensive scholarly volumes that will get you up to date on the debates about the composition of the Torah in particular so Thomas dozeman or Mattias armed guard attitude really recent volumes about scholarly conference
 omnisexual that makes missionettes but it's a conversation that keeps evolving because what we're doing is trying to reverse-engineer content of an ancient scroll and it's it's a guess it's an informed guess game that many points and so the series keep developing but no matter what Siri you adopt it shouldn't I think caused us to question the the category of being Divine and human
 all right let's do question from Finley my Bible project on Finley from London England the churches I've been possum use the Bible to give life lessons the story of David is used to tell us how we can rely on God to overcome my challenges was Moses is taken as a lesson in using the gifts God has given you despite of limitations to make a difference in your world this approach seems to be the norm in church preaching but it's not about the Messiah is this the wrong way to go about reading and applying scripture or is it legitimate space for it thank you, probably interesting cuz I think what we have said up till now is that wasn't the purpose of the stories was to to give you a less helpful approach that the story of David we talked about this David slaying Goliath I've heard many sermons of taking that to be like what are the Giants in your life and what are the five smooth stones that you
 to find you know and that's will miss what the story is designed to do however the Bible than is wisdom literature total and that when then you reflect and meditate on the story and what it's doing then it will actually give you wisdom for how to live your life and develop your own character and Slater Drive like that is true so I think there is something there but it but maybe we're just missing the 1st beat of that progression goes back to the Bible as Messianic literature are a part of our Paradigm we address this issue so Jesus if we take seriously the Jesus in the apostles say what is the Hebrew Bible about the story about the Messiah that leads to the Messiah who enters into death goes out the other side so that new creation can be released to the nation's so that's what they say it about
 so whatever lessons I has to offer me it's seeing how the story of David and Goliath fits into the larger themes of the Hebrew Bible as being leading to the Messiah and then once it's about the Messiah then it becomes about us because we are if you're followed Jesus you're part of the body of the Messiah and so it's as messy anak literature that offers wisdom to me and I think that's important because who who does one identifies the giant what's the Giant in the story of David and Goliath the Giant Goliath is if you've been tracking with the narrative patterns from Genesis Goliath is a narrative image that is bringing together a whole collection of bad bad guys forces throughout the story beginning with the snake because his armor is snake like tracing
 Narrative patterning of the snake throughout the tour and giant leading up to that point which is also then the Nephilim in the Giants and the great warriors of old or also in the narrative argument of Genesis 1 to 11 in are connected to the to the to the archetype of the snake and so once you have reptiles and Giants and that's a pattern that keeps repeating and all kinds of stories to write the Torah and Prophets when you get to the David glass story a he's facing off against the seat of snake it's a story about the conflict between the seat of woman the Steve's neck so what is the Messianic reading of that then I'm not Messianic reading as well so you read her or listen or like David and who's your Goliath but in the Hebrew Bible it's creating this portrait of spiritual evil that hijacks human communities and Nations institutions represented by the violent Ward leader do
 and so to me it's crucial that we read this and why it has its Messianic fulfillment cuz Jesus was facing his Goliath in the form of the Roman and Jerusalem power Ray James but crucially he did not Chop off their heads and pack for him he wouldn't be faithful to his calling as Messiah if he didn't chop off their heads the whole point was that he let them chop off his head so to speak and if you don't read the David glass story through that mess and I cleanse then you get the opposite wisdom from it that you're supposed to be interesting and so when you get to Paul who says you know our enemy Ephesians has our enemy of the following Jesus has never another human and powers that are behind everything we see around us and that's all right and if you have a sword it's the good news and you stand against it you don't go on the offensive so that's a Messianic
 meaning of the David story but when you don't read the Bible as a story leading the Messiah I think you end up with the wrong life lessons or maybe some good ones didn't come with wisdom that then if you go well let's make sure we first read this through the lens of this mess and I could have sure you might be like okay cool we can actually firm that's right some of that was them but the fact that the Giants and our lives are spiritual Powers you know you can you could you could get there and you're not reading it to Messianic lend you still might be like what are the things in my life and you realize it is powers and principalities in your life that you need to fight against but I like how you brought that up to him that how you do it becomes very important is easy to miss if you just focus on the story of David and don't read it through the lens of let's do one last question and it is from Carrie
 how do you help somebody who has no interest in reading the Bible after being in a church or a tradition where the Bible was weaponized against them and used to harm them how would you invite them to see the Bible as a source of good and flourishing thank you so much such a huge fan of the podcast such a good honest question question really important I think this is a lot of people's experience whether it's from a spiritual tradition that they come from that was abusive in this way or some other form of abuse or trauma that is going to affect the way we view life and when we come to the Bible it's not an easy text to read they can be really trigger yeah it's already a challenging text to re-engage with full of alot of dark thing and then I had this type of experience that can write itself into
 our body our body begins to be triggered by responses to the Bible because of, I just was traumatized and so it's much more difficult than just saying well here's some new ideas to approach the Bible with because it's not about ideas it's also about your body has been shaped in such a way that it goes in a fight and flight when certain issues and circumstances come up so that is a very important question it's not something we can answer for someone else cuz it's going to be so different for every person you know
 one idea is that because that typos harm happens in face communities by other people in face community's most likely the way forward is not going to be by just a new idea of reading the Bible that it's going to try having three relationships in a community of relationships for some followers of Jesus are living in organizing the common life in a way that healing and that's that feel safe and compelling and beautiful and to see that community life around Jesus happening and then to see like a while the Bible plays an important role in why these people are living quite at their living I think that can otherwise it's not just going to be about the Bible is most likely going to be about finding a community that's living out that difficult story in a way that can bring healing that's hard for me to imagine another way for
 word for someone who's in that situation and that's just a tough place to be what I think it is sumption in the question is that this person may be wants to follow Jesus still otherwise doesn't matter yeah but there seems to be some sense of like I'm still I'm still in this what you like and if that's the case then perhaps I don't know and you're right 10 minutes late there's every situation may be different but perhaps there is something in just let's just go and read the teachings of Jesus for let you read stories of Jesus and then let the buy will begin to unfold from their slowly or just talk about the stories of Jesus and not have to let go and and read the actual tax cuz maybe they're out maybe the weaponization was a very specific phrasing of something Jesus said there was twisted and
 turn into something else beasts of perhaps but how can you still send her it on Jesus and then let God do time and community and safe relationships begin to pull back those things so that your body can begin to interact with with these with these words again in a way that isn't triggering
 yeah and I experienced I mean I haven't experienced spiritual abuse or spiritual, but I have experience other kinds of traumas and that has affected the way that it feels to read the Bible and I remember I remember the first time after I experienced the trauma four years ago of having this pain. I've been divorced and bean finding myself with tiny new infant and feeling like I really needed God's care and that I needed to know that he was stable and steady for me and I remember reading the book of Genesis for the first time after that and I got to the story of Hagar and I was like I can't read this I just don't want to read this and I can't because it felt trickery and unstable and uncaring and I think
 yeah I think from my experience just having the self-compassion to be like I think God understands that and he cares and he doesn't need me to like push through to be a good bible school and read my Bible like this like if I'm if I need to just connect with him however I can receive his love whether it's through Community whether it's through Like a Prayer whether it's through feeling the grief and just crying and feeling The Refuge that God provides I think he understands that and it totally makes sense that when we go through our things we're going to feel it so yeah I think self-compassion in and also you know we're not supposed to read these stories
 as robots or as brains on a stick and I think actually before maybe I was able to read the story of Hagar and ask mostly cognitive questions about the emotionally detached kind of yeah and I can't do that anymore but I think that's a benefit when we are feeling grief is that we can be more holistic reader so at whatever Point somebody can engage with Aztec text it's like the Bible should actually bring us grief a lot of the time if we really are in touch with human evil in pain but I don't think we should push into that if it's causing us to be triggered you know that's why that's really sad it makes me think about how the typical collection is full of so many different parts and the it's okay if some parts are more difficult and you don't hang out there as much
 cuz there might be another season of life where you see it differently and to me that's one of the great gifts of such a diverse collection that is the Bible is Genesis is triggering hang out in the Psalms and if you know this is really bothering you thank you but also sometimes and the devil collection can help us in that journey of crota too so yeah thank you for sharing and thank you carry for that really really good question always always more to discover
 on that note okay so we're going to do one more question response at the end of this series we got more we've got more and the next one actually is wisdom literature which which was alluded to and then we'll get to the seven will do one more question response so feel free to continue to send in your questions and we we love to hear them and thank you, Christopher interacting with those and thank you John you interacted to next week we jump back into the series and look at the Bible as wisdom literature with him in the first place just recognized wisdom literature is often a biblical studies title that refers to a handful of books with in the Bible not the whole thing what we mean by this little bit different the wisdom literature so here's how short hands sentence that we've written this all of the divers literary Styles in the bay
