why do some people have more power than others why do kings pass on their power to their oldest son's what makes one person more eligible to be in charge than another person and does power always correct we are beginning a new theme study here on the podcast the theme were calling the first born and it's really a theme about who gets to be in charge who gets to have power and how will they use in the idea appears in the first pages of the Bible connected to the phrase image of cop this is one of the dominant themes of Genesis in the New Testament the firstborn is a title ascribed to Jesus in multiple places in the New Testament in the letters of Paul two times in the letter to the Hebrews and in the last book of the Christian Bible Revelation so it goes from end to end and it's kind of like
 see you see how the theme works then you can't unsee it is starting to see it everywhere I'm a first born child in my family and well I got to do a lot of things first among my siblings I wasn't really given a special position or privilege in my family because of birth order and put in the ancient world being the firstborn son was extremely special the firstborn was meant to carry on the family Legacy to receive a double portion of inheritance they're given the unique Authority and power of the family and really this is all just the main theme in Genesis about humans Discerning good about the basic unit assumption when it comes to the good and bad in the future of the family is that the first born son should be elevated overall and sometimes what these humans do to put us on in that position of first born or to produce that first born causes pain and grief and Division and
 use and so what God is constantly doing subverting and overturning human assumptions about power and privilege as we unpack this thing we're going to see he frequently pics the second one or the latecomer he picks the less likely the oppressed the overlooked and he chooses them to be the leader the god portrayed in the Bible consistently and by consistently meaning in almost every generation is overturning an inverting this cultural assumption that the firstborn should have the right to the father's Authority or and priority and I begin the theme of the firstborn listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 do you see where this goes
 so we're going to start a new theme video discussion yeah it's been a while I might be that this also is the first to come out it's right since our whole movement yeah reading through the tour and movements write girls in the Hebrew Bible which was awesome I was really enjoyed that so yeah but we're going to do is dive into a theme to the steam train set from the first pages of the Christian Bible to the end and it's all in prep connected to as the theme video because we're going to be releasing at some point in the Bible project for us it might be past depending on when you're listening to this it's actually slotted to come out
 Christmas 22 okay great and when you say it John what is the it really is what is the theme video that we're going to be discussing the theme video you call it the first born first born yes the theme of the firstborn a very that's very kind of in the weeds Gigi Bible idea it's maybe not the first thing that somebody would maybe think of as a black prominent theme that runs throughout the Bible but it is older than you. We had something videos that's feel pretty intuitive you know Heaven and Earth in those two words are in the first line of the first sentence of the Bible right we've done ones on God the messiah messiah Holy Spirit but then we've done ones that I think are important are like sleeper themes
 are there right there that actually provide everything but they maybe don't come up in terms of being mentioned all the time the image of God they are like this it's just a phrase that is only used two times in two occasions in Genesis and then a few times in the New Testament but as we've discovered over the years that idea underlies every single page the scripture and the story of the Bible doesn't make a lot of sense without understanding that at the end so that's an example of the firstborn is kind of like that and actually it's can a a lot more than for them if you got them and actually the idea of the firstborn is intimately connected to the seam of the image of God as we won't start but the firstborn it's it's our categories for theme it appears the idea
 appears in the first page of the Bible connected to the phrase image of God than the idea of a consumer conflict over the status of the firstborn yeah that's can table comes right to the surface and Cain and Abel we're going to see later in this conversation that's actually the second cycle if that team not the first it appears the idea of the firstborn getting inverted or subverted or the rights or authority of a first-born getting turned upside down given to a younger sibling You could argue this is one of the dominant themes of Genesis right and Echoes throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible
 and then entrance of the New Testament the firstborn is a title ascribe to Jesus multiple places in the New Testament in the letters of Paul two times in the letter to the Hebrews and in the last book of the Christian Bible the Revelation so it goes from end-to-end it does and it's kind of like once you see how the same works then you can't unsee it is start to see it everywhere so that's why I'm because I'm making a I believe you I mean you didn't have to but that's good overview I suppose so first born I think in the first blush for some reason for me and might feel completely disorienting what are you talking about but is actually from many cultures it's really important who's the firstborn of the family, firstborn yes you are I think I
 funny yeah some people are really into birth order like it's one of the first things they ask when they meet somebody also has are getting to know somebody like this by the second or third, since you're acting like we're the first born or is it yeah I mean there's a lot of research that has gone into this and there are like typical patterns right that shape the mentality and developing psychology of human based on their birth order as I think I must be a my ship you in some way yes. They always in the exact same way I bet there's people listening to this conversation who could give us a lecture right now you're naming aside from that is just that there is a cultural practice
 that pops up in human societies and cultural Traditions throughout all of human history in all parts of where humans I've ever been out of this practice of the firstborn child and in patriarchal culture has the first born male child the first born son having a place of special honor in terms of responsibility Authority may be the future of the The Inheritance or a state or wealth property of the family and that the first born son Bears some special role from probably a majority of human history in a majority of places that was at play to some that's right degree it's not like I said I am the firstborn in my family and I had no special like yeah I wasn't treated correctly friendly I didn't get a different yeah Status inherited whatever but this is not nor
 thing in our culture that's right matter yeah that's right and that has to do with the fact that you and I are in culture the right now stands at the end of a long process of creating a whole new story about human identity in value and worth that's not tied to how most human cultures have thought about these things spread outlier if you think that first one s what does it matter if that's your mindset approaching this topic and the invest Michael drop bringing to minority in French history and thinking about food of authors are writing a context where it matters so much is a lot a lot and an interesting way though cuz the biblical turn on the way you expect yeah they what day what spoiler you're going to subvert our boiler the god portrayed in the Bible
 consistently and by consistently meaning in almost every generation is overturning an inverting this cultural assumption that the firstborn should have the right to the father's Authority or and priority kind of will you in terms of human Partners yeah but then when you probe a little deeper and what is he coming out in the New Testament is that the status of the firstborn is like baked into the structure of the universe so anyway and all around it we are yeah we're just naming that this the technical term if you look in biblical studies theological literature sociological literature is called the law of primogeniture which is the Latin phrase Primo meaning first and Janet or meaning like to send it off Spring lineage
 this is Latin Latin teacher 1st of the 1st of The Offspring alternative The Descendants we need we need a fancy Latin word just to make herself feel special thing like if you start looking for this theme describe okay by biblical Scholars and theologians the phrase is the law of primogeniture but that's it the practice that a first born son is somehow our special unique representative of the father that this is a patriarchal institution male dominant cultures that the first born son by natural right to assume the responsibility of authority in representation of the father is well Power Authority in the future of the estate so it's against that cultural backdrop that the biblical story is just from the first Pages start just doing twists or messenger incident inversions and the shock factor of all those inversions won't really land
 unless you get that basic cultural assumptions it's in the background so we start there then should we start with, trying to be sympathetic with that cultural exception not the problem with that is it a little bit because as I looked into the topics specially in the ancient near Eastern cultural background things were a little more complicated but sure yeah the imagination well you know we got imagine you're living in a culture where your security and your well-being all depends on your family structure right sure you don't have some other employer you know that can pay you have like stock with or a retirement pension plan with you don't have the government had with us and for the safety net and you have your family your family is your present and future web safety and stability
 that is a most human societies of operated for most of human and when it comes to then how is the family going to continue to work generation after generation who's going to lead get a family then there has to be someone who's responsible for making sure the family is taken care of and basically becomes the Little Kingdom the of this with Tiny Tribe I suppose which is often in most cultures patriarch interesting to think about those that and this is where I don't know cuz the biblical story doesn't take place in or wasn't written in a time when humans were in hunter-gatherer was during the agricultural assumed state of the ideal state of a
 Emily in the biblical story is settled on the land that is abundant for a man with an extended family that provides safety stability and Order yeah so what I don't know is whether something like the law of the first born with the practice of building first born if that held in previous stages of humans I don't know the answer to that I mean from the very little I have heard it sounds like there was less of a sense of ownership of things ever needed was a lot more shared another gathering it's not about yeah your family identity wealth production that isn't necessarily tied to a piece of land you actually don't you don't only end up moving around here everything's shared there's not a lot to inherit or disinherit kind of like everyone's helping each other can ship it's almost like everyone's part of thick here in the tribe you're in the family but I don't know what
 yeah yeah that's interesting little Trail the flag but in the biblical story and the cultural background of the biblical authors where that all takes place it says the Bill's authors and Israel Israel like literature their first place of existing was in the land of Federation of tribes in the settled agriculture life there and not Society was structured that patriarchal a drum sets like extended families and that with Patriarchs and then all of a sudden who will carry the leadership and hold the security and property of the family to reach generation and here we come into why the law or the practice of the firstborn
 how it sets in terms of structure of the family in the society and I'm sure it depended actual benefits of the firstborn probably changed from generation I like the times of human history even within Israel I suppose but was there a general kind of rule of like the first born gets a double portion cuz our ancient evidence is right then actually do that just children in general
 play a different role in cultural imagination in that kind of society because children are also producers and protectors the family wealth like they're your first laborers you're not there I'll go help you and so having large families is a sign of abundance and adds to your security in the more children the more abundance and security that there is and so there's something about the first of those and you know maybe here we can jump out of time does sympathetically imagine an ancient contacts and actually just think of like if you grew up going to school and at recess and you're picking teams first thing about being first or just lining up for something I'll do my kids are at this all the time they want to be first and whatever line it is only three people
 it's like a big deal who's in the front and you know trying to talk with him about this doesn't matter it does there's something you need within them that being first something Primal to how humans imagine the world that being first is somehow it feels good to be chosen first in kickball I get that I don't fully get the like I need to be first in line like Mom comes out today. Popsicles let's just like I want mine before somebody else I want it now that's idea I want it now and if I'm second then I guess I might not get the flavor I want ya to keep going on your thing for you that would really even as a kid you don't remember thinking that that was important
 I can't remember feeling that was that an hour and I think cuz it's so once you get socialized I probably just don't remember yeah but there was definitely a concern of like I don't want to be too far in the back of the line we're going to miss out yes okay but you know for me actually the first also comes with a low-pressure unlike you you can't see anyone like how they going to handle this yeah yeah sure I can learn something from that how the first person deals with this is your first born right position and your family and there is a trailblazing aspect of being the first born in a family and so when I was outside of the contacts the family it felt nice to kind of like you like someone else you do first I'm going to see how you handle this mess interesting I get that second for my family and I learned a lot by observing their sister
 definitely informed how I thought about my behavior and my decision to my family so okay bringing this up I'm just was trying to say there's something Primal and there's something I think fairly Universal in human nature that there's a desire to be first and that there's some sense that the first either gets the thing first or says it's a place of importance I don't know something really special about if your parent having your first child and that it represents like the beginning of your you know family anywhere and kind of the proof I like we can do this like we can have kids and there's so much joy and something so special about that first moment with your first child yeah and then you have to retrain yourself and you learn when you have another kid like this kid is just a special because they're completely different yeah but there's something about the first
 and I think in a culture where like now you're dependent on your kids like it would just kind of makes sense to be like man this first child yeah yeah like deserves Yahoo yep here's your first you know there may also be something to the fact just chronologically that's the child that will develop first and become an adult first yet become adults first and therefore have the ability to like share the adult response
 so here's what's interesting is that this definitely was a practice in the ancient near East surrounding the biblical authors in the time by the Bible so there's actually only one law in the Torah and Deuteronomy that addresses explicitly and it's interesting so this is in Deuteronomy chapter 21 verse 15 through 17 and this law is going to make your ears ring with the story of Jacob and Esau and Jacobs wives Rachel and Leah from Book of Genesis
 so if a man has two wives look at me with common in a certain phase ancient Egyptian culture has love and the other I loved and let's say both the loved and the unloved wives bear him Sons is the first born son the chronological first one is the sign of the unloved wife
 then it will be in the day that he Wills what he has to his son's he can the position of the firstborn take over the authority of the family and take responsibility for wealth or property whenever the patriarch cannot make the son of the loved wife the first born before the son of the unloved who is the actual first one just because you have a favorite wife like your first born is your first born yet but he acknowledged the firstborn that sound of the unloved wife by giving him a double portion of all that he has for he is the beginning of his power
 to him belongs to the right of the firstborn so there's actually a lot of fascinating things, but it's clear this is in the backdrop of an assumption that first of all there's a somehow this law of primogeniture the right of the firstborn hear the Hebrew word Buffalo.
 oh yeah sorry language are Hebrew the word firstborn is before and it comes from the verb which is the verb to produce the first child and is actually this verb there's a verb for to produce a first try the first Offspring and it's a verb used of plants animals and humans like a weed stock will hurt a Divine first head of grain an animal you don't have a word for this the closest would be adopting a King James ISM from this word which is the first fruits first fruits that's a noun this is a verb a verb to produce your first seed yeah yeah that counts are plants animals and humans or even counts for any of them
 the first routing well you could say that calf was that cow's first born but that's okay I understand there's a Pacific verb so here we're back into agricultural contacts you know it's important when they have a verb for for bearing the pain you know we've like gone very far from how they view it as we don't have a very important thank you thanks for being persistent on that I see your point and it's a very good one for the whole car Bihar is the producer first born the first of the produce let's not forget that again given the agricultural contacts the Hebrew Bible that there's a deep analogy between the ground and the womb
 and therefore between seed like male reproductive speed fluid and seeds that go into the ground and the Steep analogy there and then of the fruit of that Union between seaweed and ground which is fruit in the plant for more in the animal form in human form the fruit of the womb for the room or the fruit of the ground is the Deep analogy in the biblical imagination between those two and that's where this verbs it's an interesting interesting I have a hunch that in English there might be a verb and agricultural lingo just we would know it interesting for the plants a plants first for fruit fruit like when a tree has its first fruit or a Vine I might be a bit of that maybe someone else might be a verb for that the New Testament that is
 title of Jesus that's we'll see in a little bit is the Greek word it's compound word for a total cost
 I thought Lucas cuartas compound Proto first and took us which is one who is born on August first one was the Greek word used in the Septuagint the first translation to Hebrew Bible which was into Greek to translate these Hebrew words before and the verb hot and then it was adopted into the Greek applied Judaism called Hellenistic Judaism and then into the New Testament
 reset it again Greek mythology Hellenistic Judaism which is the fruit of after Greek culture married with every other culture after Alexander the Great but instead of calling it Hellenistic I said first Greek if I had cuz that's what it what happened during oh well I'll just do them things happened but particular to this word for this word is that the Hebrew Bible and the way it's language reflects the view of reality was what do you say tuned to a Greek cultural key in the first Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible and that what became the predominant Bible of Greek speaking juice throughout the ancient world about the Jasper in the second temple.
 Jesus and all the his first followers in the authors of the New Testament where the product of that Greek plus ancient Biblical Hebrew marriage of a deeper into that yeah it's a fascinating topic there but it's it's all about culture how language is a reflection of an assumed cultural way of viewing reality we were reading the Bible in Greek as a primary source many people were many people who is bilingual and but just the point is that the Hebrew Bible was tuned to a Greek key as it were once Hellenistic culture you know just reshape the world and the New Testament is a product of that marriage right was not a product only of that marriage is a lot of other things right the language and imagery used in the New Testament is not just Hebrew Bible
 fast forward a couple hundred years it's Hebrew Bible tune to the luckiest Hellenistic language poster the ultimate cross-cultural new territory for us we're looking at a rabbit hole a deep deep Rabbit Hole in our conversation right now and I can tell you're like well part of the reason is I've been thinking a lot about the soul oh yes and yeah I've been realizing that like there's something that happened when the Hebrew Bible is Greek a fide yep and is it that the idea developed or it's just they got new language to talk about the same things they were always talking about question and yeah yeah yeah I learned a lot recently reading project I did and I would love to talk about that more efficiently kind of explore the basic idea of you
 so it's interesting oh yeah sorry if this was all the Rabbit Trail cuz we're talking about the law Deuteronomy 20 minutes late there however long it was is that it really so this is assumes the practice of elevating first born son the chronologically first son if it's if you're in polygamous family family where a man has more than one wife but what's interesting is that what the law is recognizing is that there will be situations where I don't want to give where is the refer to the right of the firstborn will not be honored it assumes that that happened and so here's what's interesting in this was new to me as I was learning about this topic is that in the ancient near Eastern literature and secure I'm depending on a very helpful resource produce or attitude overseen by John Walton who we've interviewed
 best to make ancient near Eastern cultural background more understandable more accessible to normal Bible readers so he oversaw the production of a whole Commentary series called The zondervan Illustrated Bible backgrounds commentary the CIBC go through every story and pawn giving you any relevant kind of cultural background stuff that you might not know but the will eliminate or add some multi-dimensional color kiss many metaphors to the store so on this law, turn on this laundry 21 he mentions that this wall right of the firstborn functioned in the ancient near East but not everywhere nor was it always observed even though everywhere present so he goes through the Code of Hammurabi get some examples ancient Assyrian laws
 legal like documents from all these ancient near Eastern cities Mari and newsy on all the lock and what you find is there is a basic of some it's the same as the Hebrew Bible there's a basic assumption that this practice of giving the first born son was the norm but there were exceptions and just like in the Hebrew Bible there's a law a dressing what if Dad wants to make an exception I see there are also laws that do make exceptions also down in Egypt and Babylon and Assyria but all the laws are usually little unique variation so let's see if I can Egypt he gives an example of Egypt in the Middle Kingdom the law of primogeniture could be disregarded by a dying father
 property could be will to a brother for example maybe the first born son is like incompetent or maybe died or I don't know we don't know but the point is there's this law you know that states that or cultural practice that you could your brother could stand in the place of the firstborn so that's interesting but what the laws is a whole show is that it was a general practice but that there were and the general practice to be clear in the Deuteronomy passage was to give a double portion that's right which means just twice as much as you give other people so what say you have five kids yeah I guess you would divide it up six ways and then the first one gets through to winewood to get the double portion that's the idea was that common in these other cultures to do was a double portion interesting
 do you think that changed wealthy and wise call the collection of the laws of lipid Ishtar who is the king which say that the inheritance of a father should go equally to the children of two wives however in Hammurabi's Code the first wife's first born receives a preferential share so that's like the lawn to drown me although it's a little less concrete what is that mean that preferences yeah yeah that's true there was an ancient eastern city of Mari documents found where there's a legal decision recorded to Grant a double portion to the Natural first born son look up that's just like the one to drive me in 15th century BC in the city of New see where another legal collection was discovered the same exact has fallen in the city of all the lock on the orontes river
 there's a text that mentions a father who was aware of but did not have to recognize the law of the firstborn in as well so it's interesting you can designate a first son so he could designate a first son for inheritance purposes maybe it's saying he can pick Which Wich sun give you a gift have the right of the city of Neymar is the son receives an extra share so I think he's collected here A bunch of us are similar but then when he decides examples from Egypt it's different than his brother or the entire family could just be the trustee in the New Kingdom Heirs he says the oldest son was the expected are but the whole family or an appointed trustee could become the air and maybe for some reasons unique to Egypt but institution of the practice head
 became less important developed yeah yeah I bet there's a whole Rabbit Hole down there neo-babylonian laws the sons of a first wife receive two thirds two-thirds of The Inheritance while the sons of the second wife received one third of sons were who are of different status might fare differently so you get to feel like this was known as a general sense yeah the first born get more and then from that kind of agreed upon yes status quo there's variations on then what possibilities are
 so a lot more digging and details we could do but we got the general portrait like what is this practice and that it was widespread in the ancient near East and that it's the general assume backdrop of the Goodwill store
 however so this is AB a new step in our conversation right now when you get to the actual Story the biblical story that begins in Genesis one of the most dominant themes in Genesis is how God Creator God is constantly subverting an inverting this practice of elevating the firstborn by God elevating we're choosing or blessing or foregrounding the younger siblings over the actual first born it like every level of the story happens over and over. Yeah that's right see you mention Cain and Abel Abel second-born God favors Abel's offering to be thinking like why second and while the story may or may not provide some details about why I think the story does good little Clues but all that says it's the first time that happens between siblings
 later when you get to the descendants of Noah and Noah has three sons Shem ham and japheth or Shem, yaphet what's interesting is that ordering of their names is not their birth order the firstborn of the older is yaphet and then there's a cutie about the birth of order of Shem and ham it seems likely that it was yaphet then Shem then am interested and was the youngest of three which might explain the thing that he didn't attend the thing of the pet ham ham ham does some scandalous thing in a tent with his dad looking on it as nakedness and if he is the Third born. Kind of helps make sense of what he's doing is trying to jump ahead in line have a family like it happens again with Abraham and his brothers
 and this isn't a big nearest way with those kids who gets the bus that's right she is the one who is blessed and it said that Yahweh the Creator God is going to come and dwell in the tents of Shem and we always chooses the second or third born with Jim this is not the first born back in time that's right when you get through the lineage of the biblical story goes through and it racist to a guy named Tara who has three sons knock or around and offer him and their God chooses and blesses know if it's like Sam
 younger son Abraham over his older brother's okay and then one of those older brothers has a son named lot and lot goes with Abraham to the land of Canaan and then that causes all kinds of Abraham's older brother had a son and nephew nephew comes with but what we represent is the family of his older brother and so the tension between lot and Abraham kind of like a sibling rivalry and Abraham takes two wives that the whole story was talked about many times in the past Hagar who is a slave but that he marries so they have to why is Sarah and Hague and it's a guy who has the first born son Ishmael and then Sarah there's Isaac and the blessing
 cuz I supposed to Isaac not to smell that continues with Isaac two sons were the firstborn is Esau second point is Jacob this one like the volumes really turned up a whole Narrative of the tension between Esau and Jacob really focus is in in fact it's the story where the word first born and the now the right of the firstborn is used for the first time and their twins so like the status is like more minutes minutes cuz Jacob comes out grabbing his brother as you know from birth he's trying to get that position that his brother has and it turns out that supposition that God
 has Dustin him for is to have the position of the firstborn even though he's not going to lie to the firstborn so it's not like a guy with so much character that like terrible that God should give him the first born because you're not the first born but you got so much promise, so that yeah he's snake Sneaky Snake like from the start grab night heat off so there's a sibling rivalry in the inversion firstborn but then what's interesting is that you go another layer deep like an Inception that movie Inception inversion of the first born within Android version of the first one because then the story of Jacob and his two wives also becomes a story of inverted firstborn because Jacob falls in love with a woman who is the second born her name is Rachel
 give me try to well you know it's a great scene and he wants to marry her and his dad live on says absolutely and then he pulled a fast one on him and give him his first born daughter and so Rachel is beloved Leia is the unloved sexual does the wording but it's so that while we rode read Deuteronomy is hyperlink after that story exactly yeah and what the laws saying is here in Israel we're never going to do what Jacob did which is favored the sun stuff beloved wife over the actual first born that came from the unloved wife was interesting is through this two wives and then their two slaves could produce as a family of 12 sons and a daughter
 and then the next cycle of Genesis is all about the Rivalry in the inversion of the firstborn among the 12 Brothers yeah so we have the 12 brothers who are the 12 tribes and yeah the standout brother of the full story becomes Joseph yeah among was Rachel's Sons with Jakob it's Joseph becomes the favored one and then among Leia's son's it's the fourth born Judah that becomes the prominent one and the Really the whole story is about this rivalry of Joseph and all his brothers and then specifically this rivalry of Joseph Judah and the actual firstborn Ruben he's just left behind in the past as well as the second third born to me in the meantime but the reason I left in the dust is because each of them and there's the narrative about each of them doing something really terrible that disqualifies them in the eyes of their father hookah
 starting to think this is all through Genesis yes but you would expect to be favoured yeah he's not so and how this fits in is that God is constantly subverting and overturning the natural human assumptions about power and privilege in is the firstborn should have the power to have the privilege to have the authority God saying like well and really this is all just a main theme in Genesis about good and bad humans Discerning good and bad and so they assumed idea is the basic human is sumption when it comes to the good and bad in the future of the family is that the first born son should be elevated overall and sometimes what the humans do
 the person in that position of first born or to produce that first born causes problem causes pain and grief and Division and abuse and so what God is constantly doing is subverting and overturning human assumptions about power and privilege that's what all these inversions are about ya and but the main narrative theme throughout Genesis and it just continues to Echo throughout the rest of the Hebrew Bible Moses and Aaron for example if Noah yeah and so he's chosen for the role of the high priest but the first thing even before he steps into his job is leading the people into idolatry and it's the younger brother who got elevates to the top of Mount Sinai to you know many interstates and rescues for the people of Aaron's sons and has four sons in the first two in their first day on the job
 tavernakaya do you know Violet protocol I'm so God takes our lives and elevates the Third born Eleazar to the place of the honored son this happens with my favorite place this Motif gets explored is in the opening chapters of Samuel with the story of Hannah and the birth of Samuel because Hannah is made us kind of alcohol and alcohol has another wife penina and peninnah has all the sons and is able to produce fruit of the womb and cannot but interesting Lee all kind of love Hannah more depending on how has the place of social prominence in your family cuz she can produce children and so the whole story is about how God chooses and elevates and gives a special gift to Hannah over in about penina and then that is the gift of
 a person who she surrenders over to become a Nazarite to like a virtual high priest and he lives in and around the temple and then the actual I appreciate the time you lie has these older Sons who were like terrible guys and got elevates the little Samuel the little boy Samuel is that even though over the Priestly line super cool story David David is the youngest son this one yeah this one stands out to me I wouldn't have thought of most women wouldn't have come to mind but yet David David this is the classic story of like I mean yeah Mall in stature is out in the field taken care of the sheep and he's not even in the running at first the man this is the first Samuel chapter 16 the main point of the story is God tells the prophet to go
 to the house of this guy has a son who am I going to elevate his King and so in the store is such a great story in the story Samuel Samuel the prophet is told to go to the house of the sky Jesse the bethlehemite for I have seen for myself a kingdom on his sons so Samuel goes to his house and he has Jesse line up all his sons desecrate 4 Samuel 16 Verse 6 and when the sun's came Samuel looked upon La of the firstborn
 and he thought oh surely the Lord's anointed one is now before the Lord but the Lord said to Samuel don't look upon his appearance
 don't look at the height of his stature because this guy Ellie off
 for the Lord does not see as humans see humans look on the appearance of the outside
 but the Lord looks on the heart so then Jesse says I'm okay second-born come on up tab you makes him pass before Samuel is a classic storytelling here now then Jessie Mae third-born Shana passed by Jesse just so you know none of these has a large chosen are these all your son's and then Jesse says well there is the youngest there's the run the rent and he's the one too clearly the story turn up the volume on the steam here and notice hear it once again it's about human expectations about power and privilege yes yeah very clearly hear the tallest you know it's are the strongest were those the first born with the firstborn write the order he goes to the sons is from first to last in Perth order exactly so
 story clearly is turning up the volume here so it's fascinating is not only is David elevated over his brothers but then when he's elevated over to become king in the place of Israel's first king saw David has also elevated over Saul's firstborn Jonathan Jonathan is the first born to become king you have for Saul and Jonathan can see that God's chosen David and there's that famous story where he gives them all these special items and says you're the chosen one. Me
 the Solomon Next Generation Solomon is David's son but I think I forget what Ortiz not the firstborn forget his first us first but David many wives and the sons in line for the goal the firstborn of Absalom Hussein killed and then another son named adonijah in the Rivalry between David and Absalom and then between Solomon and out a nycha are the main focus of the beginning of the book of Kings
so this is a major theme throughout the Hebrew Bible yeah the big deal yeah big deal out of these stories don't really land unless you are turning into this thing that's so much focus on the sibling rivalries correct and why the David story so important is because it's saying explicitly what has been going on implicit Lee throughout the whole Bible with the steam is that Yahweh is opposed to human institutions power and privilege that distort our perception of what is good and bad we have an idea of what is good and the good is the first one or the biggest step the most power yes that's the good that's the good and what's good is to make sure that I create a first born and that I am in control of things and all of that
 end of creating so much Strife in the store in the stories it's right yeah I think God comes from eating humans taking advantage of each other yeah tricking each other abusing sexual abuse murder I mean it's yeah it's like the worst of human nature on display in trying to elevate or produced first born son's the major repeated team and so this practice of God in subverting it is a major theme of the Hebrew Bible that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble actually the proverb and we just tend to think proud and humble is being individual character dispositions but in honor shame culture
 that's very much about social rank in hierarchy the proud are those who would assert high social rank for themselves and the humble are those who have a low social position and God loves to or is it will say it multiple times so bring down the mighty or know he loves to bring down the mighty from their Thrones and Elevate the sitting in the dust to the seat of Nobles and princes and that's what this is about as Jesus Roofing on this one the first will be last place we first have to literally win his disciples come to him and say we're wondering who's that your eyes are like which one of us is the greatest and those who take the position of the last to be the servant
 Jesus is distilling whiskey theme in the Hebrew Bible in these teachings
 okay so all of that being said here's the puzzle here's a fascinating little puzzle after all yeah it's very clear that God is not down with the first born for the sake of the firstborn is it's too strong to say the gods opposed to this practice it's at least to say what God is opposed to is people abusing each other hurting each other in order to get their children or produced the first born are you could you do most feel like he's opposed to it yeah but you exactly inherently so this that you walked away from the Hebrew Bible gone okay I get it I guess what this is about right if he may be anti firstborn to put it may be a little hyperbolically order that he be suspicious highly suspicious of this institution can do anything good for him and see
 is it interesting that when you get to the story of Jesus what the four gospel accounts Claim about Jesus what's explicit in the letters of Paul 6 plus it in the letter to the Hebrews and in the Revelation so then all the players and parts in the New Testament there is a very clear emphasis on Jesus's identity
 as the first born as the first born son the Son of God God special first born with the rights to power and authority and responsibility over all of creation not necessarily being born first in his family as much as like this idea of like yeah cuz almost like meta idea of like the firstborn of well as chapter one is called the image of the invisible God using the phrase from Genesis the image of God and then he equates it in terms of poetic parallel line the firstborn over all creation
 have to be the image of God is to be in the position of the firstborn of all creation then he calls Jesus felines later he is the beginning
 the first of the firstborn from among the Dead
 so he's claiming for Jesus to be the preeminent representation of the father over all creation and to be the beginning and source of the new creation that's his resurrection from the dead so what's interesting here is that Jesus is down for the right of the first break I guess Jesus's house that place and universe so he's not always opposed to it it just seems like he was in Romans chapter 8 desus is called the image for my pulse is talking about how is God has called and purpose that a group that human family would form to be transformed into the image of his son so that his son would become the first born among many siblings
 So the plan of God was always that the Human family would be perfectly transformed into the image of the first born to hear the idea is that the first born of a family we get that but then it's like taking that idea to another level and saying in the firstborn of all of humans of all creation, creation I don't know if that means the firstborn of the Brethren of like the whole Human family that's right like he's the first yep he holds the status of the first born
 over a whole family of brothers and sisters and they are all being transformed into the image of that first point son that's idea here so when you get into the letter to the Hebrews chapter 1 and then in chapter 12 once again Jesus is called the firstborn and in both cases it's a place of status and honor all creation is called the Bow Down and Worship specifically Heavenly beings angels are called Down To Worship the first one that's in Hebrews chapter one and then in chapter 12 the community of Jesus followers is called the Assembly of the first born or in some translation it's the word ekklesia Church of the Church of the firstborn
 sing The Church of Jesus you could just say the Church of the firstborn like a title for him yes and then in the Revelation last book of Christian Bible in Revelation 1:5 Jesus is called the faithful witness the firstborn from among the Dead the ruler of the kings of the land
 so being the faithful witness being the one who has stood
 faithful telling the truth bearing witness to the truth about the father
 that's equated to having the status of the first born and then that's equated to being the ruler of the kings of the land was interesting Pablo because all of a sudden it's sort of like God is not down for humans to connive
 and skin their way to become will get their child to be the firstborn all throughout the Hebrew Bible makes me think. Scott and I first went to the New Testament and the story gets a little more complex yet again yeah because the firstborn is really a theme about Authority and power representation and so you could think as you read the Bible oh-so God's not down with giving that authority to someone just basically because of one that showed up on the scene but he is interested in making sure someone does have that plans that place and then there's a kind of a lineage that goes
 and so I guess try to understand what the puzzle the puzzle is when we get to Jesus is a puzzle as why isn't he celebrated as a a second born I think was interesting is that with all of this emphasis New Testament saying Jesus holds the place and status of the Eternal first born within the very being of God at the community that is the one God father son and spirit the puzzle is
 you would think that God is anti this institution or practice of just because the first born son has that role inherently son deserves the right to have power and authority but then the whole claim about Jesus is he actually is the legitimate holds legitimately out of all the humans in the story here is the one who can truly legitimately be called the first born because she actually is the first he actually is chosen and he also is the one who does pass the test and like he does kind of like you know it all comes together both themes ideas cuz the weather constantly going to show is a GS has humble Origins the poor family that it comes from outside
 city of David Bethlehem he's not from there, you know real real country up in Galloway from stick Town Nazareth he is not trained in Jerusalem he's not a Bible scholar with traditional credential so all of that is portraying Jesus as the outsider the younger sibling the one who hold the place of low social rank okay and then being crucified as a criminal but then this new testament theology as it comes and says surprise like yeah he actually has his identity yeah that's so first born yeah it's good it's a new category of firstborn is firstborn over all of creation yeah that's right you could say the story from Jesus's birth from his incarnation
 to the cross in the resurrection is a story in historical time of the subversion of the firstborn okay cuz Jesus write all this humble Origins he's the outsider and that's the one that got elevates the position of the first born this is that the narrative but then that narrative is framed within a wider claim to say the one whom God has exalted by raising him to be you know the son of man over heaven on Earth that one was and always has been the Eternal Son of God legitimately holds that place of representation existed from who is the beginning so he is legitimate firstborn was interesting. Both subverts as pattern what is the burning is not the idea that God should have a true representative son what is opposing is the way that humans
 try to scheme and create and get that power through a redefinition of good and bad and so Jesus becomes like the model the true model of what the legitimate firstborn is and should be which is a model of humility and love and and self giving compassion but it's just kind of the school twist in the way the New Testament tells the story of Jesus
 so that's kind of the big picture that we did the whole thing I guess we just did the whole thing what we can do now we just paint the whole picture so what would be fun to do is go back and dive into somebody specific moments of God inverting practice and actually specifically to talk about the Cain and Abel I don't think it's the first time that this team pierce it appears without him and his relationship to the sky rulers and to the animals I think is for the first time and if you think I'm crazy there's a bunch of second temple Jewish literature to show you that I'm not but most that the theme first appears at what did you say Adam's relationship Adam and Eve's relation out of Annie's relationship with Kyra loose and to The Animals Sky rulers being yeah
 first become a day for the animated animals are first on day 6 of creation the animals come first but it's the latecomers humans if you were the last ones to arrive and then tennis which they are the ones that are given Rule and authority over there given the other two got all right I'll let me know thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're going to dive in to the first place where this theme takes root and if the theme of the firstborn is about sibling rivalry and God choosing the younger brother over the older you would think the first story to look at is the story of Cain and Abel
 but in fact the steam begins earlier and Genesis 1 through 24 Yahweh makes rulers of the sky and rulers of the land Spiritual Beings above to represent God and humans below the humans are the latecomers that they're creatures less glorious than the Spiritual Beings above but it's the humans were given authority to rule the human rulers come last in the sequence of the six days they don't come first they can last even the animals are before then the last Comer it's the one who is given the authority to rule over the land but isn't interesting as you read through the he Revival it's consistently the latecomer that got Elevate to places of rule and Authority today's episode is produced by Cooper pelts with associate producer Lyndsay Ponder edited by Dan gummo Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza and a woo provided the annotations for annotated podcast
