we're reading through the Book of Leviticus and in the last few episodes we've been looking at the many sacrifices that God instructs the people of Israel to offered him and there are a lot of men day-in-and-day-out animals being slaughtered and you might think is this a little much a little wasteful the Disciples of Jesus asked a very similar question when a woman came and poured expensive perfume all over Jesus's feet and what he says is she gave the most precious gift of all the most and that's why the story was told Jesus called her act and ol offering the Ascension offering or what we call the burnt offering we take an entire animal all of it and you better be consumed by the fire of the altar but the Ola all values surrendered over to call is complete surrender did some of Cosplay I can't go into God's Heavenly throne room
 but here is a blameless animal that can go up on my behalf that the powerful image to enter God's life I must go through death the death of the animal and its purging to fire in the sending is an image of what I need to undergo purging that could take my life but in taking my life what it would be doing is transforming me to live in proximity to the source of real life this offering takes me through a journey that I need to undergo myself which is a burning away of what I call a life to embrace what is true lies I'm John Collins in this is Bible project podcast today Tim Mackie and I wrap up the first movement of Leviticus and we'll take a closer look at the five sacrifices described in these opening pages and explore what it takes for Humanity in God to dwell in the same space thanks for joining us here we go
hey John we are in the Book of Leviticus we have been for the last two episodes and we're walking through the whole Torah we've been talking about atonement and the reason why would the time about atonement is because we're going to look at the first movement of Leviticus we haven't actually looked at the movement really that much yet but the first moving up Leviticus is 5 offerings walking through a description of the ritual of giving five offerings this is what Israelites were invited to bring forward when they came into the courtyard of the Tabernacle just jumping in fresh we had a conversation prior to this where we walked to the logic of sacrificial systems and what it means to make in a toning sacrifice and I think there's nothing for it but to say listen to that episode
 because what we're going to do now is we're going to talk about the five different offerings and we're going to just get in it and we're just going to say this is one of the offerings that a Tums for sense and that doesn't mean anything to you that we really recommend pausing right now and listening to last conversation and then the conversation before that was about how the sectional with Atticus fits into the larger storyline of the Torah yeah which is about the God of Heaven and Earth has taken his fully life-giving source of all being in existence presence and may not post among the people of Israel that is both good for them and very dangerous for them and so these offerings represent a way that Israel is invited to come near to God but they need to adapt change their behavior and these offerings are meant to be Torah instruction for how is real
 come near to God and therefore how anybody has to come near to God maybe not through offering animal sacrifices but through understanding their meaning of the scribes in Leviticus chapters 1 through 7 say we're not going to explain it to him and put the explainer impulse in me wants to at least try to do something very simple yeah tell him it was the Hebrew word compared to pair and it's used and two different fundamentally different contacts one is the English word that we were using as a grandson that even a word we don't really use very much but a restitution payment you owe me something it's the debt obligation damages and so when you take a blameless animal and you put your hand on it signifying this thing now is my representative
 although I'm not blameless it is and it's going to represent me in some meaningful way and then it dies that death should have been mine it's not fair it's not fair it's something blameless should die for someone that's not blameless but that's what God has invited us to do that's the debt obligation The Ransom word compare is used in the context of now after that animal dies it's blood is drained its put in a bowl and it's very explicit in Leviticus that blood represent the life of the animal that's right animals dead but we have to life of the animal the life damn is right here in this bowl yeah yeah life is here and that life is still like and that the priests take their fingers and dip it in the blood and sprinkle objects that when we use the word purification that into this is logic which is our corruption and viola
 actually also damages the environment and it damages creation we are damaging the gift of creation and then a particular it's polluting and vandalizing god. Post if you wants to do all the places yeah comes as we damage the environment in general to human evil and Injustice we are also vandalizing God's living room yes set up here in the middle of us and in the biblical narrative the environment will be washed clean from that needs to needs to be you want to keep coming nearer to God then we got to deal with all the garbage you could be a flood that's going to take you out or could be a sprinkling of blood from a blameless animal and that purification will keep you alive well it will purify what has been polluted so that God can stay in our midst I mean the coldest we want to keep
 play host to God's presence in our midst but we keep vandalizing his face but God has given to us the means to both repay and to purify the vandalism so that he can stay here in the space that we keep running and both means allow me to be saved from Death ultimately here in our midst who keep providing Mana he'll save us from our enemies will bring us into the promised land but our sins endanger my proximity to the source of all life and so the atonement is what repairs the relationship to keep me in proximity to the source of life this is what the word atonement means in Biblical Hebrew and then all the examples words used in Leviticus it means repaying for damages
 and purifying what has been vandalized by my moral failing to do so that I may live so that we can have life and what is life of being a communion with God feeding of the tree of life knowing him and John 17 verse that they may know you and Jesus Messiah me set now remember there are five offerings in the first chapters of Leviticus only three of those five are sacrifices of atonement so this is important but they're not a package there's more going on is more layers a meeting in addition to atonement of what these offerings are all about
sub-5 offering Zelda's name in real quick in the order that they appear they are first the Ascension offering sometimes called the burnt offering second is the gift off sometimes called the grain offering third is the peace offering sometimes called Fellowship Huffer 4th is the purification offering sometimes called the sin offering 5th is the restitution or reparation offering sometimes called the guilt offering you can see the translation of the titles of these offerings is up for grabs because well because it is hard to put into one English word the richness of what each of these devices so the first one the first offering Leviticus chapter one that's called the old La in Hebrew it's a normal Hebrew word the participle that means going up going up that which Rises up
 if you say that person is going up the mountain to stay there it is the same word used to describe when Moses goes up the mountain over laws that there is another verb form which is Allah but I got it yet so that which ascends that which goes up its first in the list because it's like the most foundational of all the offerings for reasons that we're going to see why the altar that sits in the courtyard of the Tabernacle that's right in front of it so when you're approaching the Tabernacle you would be looking at the door of the Tabernacle with the altar in front of it and the Flames of the altar covering the door for their vantage point of the doors got the chair being you and me and yeah so that altered is called the altar of the Ola name of the altar is for this sex is described by this sacrifice the old offering was the type of offering offered every
 good morning and the evening if Mark the boundaries between day and night morning and evening everyday all year round and the main thing that sets us offering a part is that the entire animal is burned up in the fire the word going up is actually referring the cremated yeah that's right yeah going up refers to the smoke the rising the whole animal goes up that interesting you know that's what the smoke is it's the actual like atoms of the wood it's the actual material the way up into the sky it has material that has been transformed into a new kind of body oh well that's actually the most intuitive way to think about it like that's the animal going up just in a different form and it transformed form sacrifice and the burning is what transforms I am getting ahead of myself but this is this is fun
 bring me the first actually let's start here just wait so first of all it's the whole animal that's offered there's three other offerings are animal offerings and in all of those only part of the animal is burned up the meat was kept and then given either to the priests or the priest and the person who offered it and that says it's like an ancient butcher shop temples were the local butcher shop yeah I mean you could Slaughter an animal just on your own house if you wanted to break but there was a lot of me being outsourced from the temple and it's what the priests and they would take a home for the families but enough so we're supposed to keep itself this is like the surrender of an animal and all the other sacrifices the value of the animal goes out to feed people but the Ola transformed into the air all values
 surrendered over to God it's complete surrender it's the most costly you know sure or wasteful in a sense I think depending on what story you have in your mind about it right yeah. This is akin to the woman who tours the big alabaster jar of offering on Jesus when he's on his way to Jerusalem you know the disciples are like what what a what a waste in Jesus accepts it he called the disciples thing why this waste and what he says is she gave the most precious gift of all she surrendered the most she surrendered the most and that's why the story will be told around the world where is good news goes people will hear about what this woman surrendered so there is an annoying thing for burial in the story but there is shades of meaning for the whole offering and what she's doing
 if you remember this is an animal it's blameless its tummy is the Hebrew word it's unblemished it's an ideal specimen of its kind with no physical blemishes or defects which is an image of a human who is morally blameless correct its physical health is a symbol of the moral blameworthiness I ought to have at the house during the whole animal is about total utter surrender of myself cuz when I put my hand on the animal I commissioned it to make a minute to represent me and then it goes up into the heavens whole thing is so this is the second aspect of meaning which is how the animal is transformed into smoke so there's a lot of Hebrew words for burn
 serif and serif Vernon Cruz returning ones are which means to consume something in fire so the word use for all these offerings and right here for the law is the vertebral verbeke tear
 and it's formed from the same root as the Hebrew word for smoke to tour it and specifically incense the altar of incense inside is called the altar of Couture it it's alter smoke it's the word for burn used here is to turn into smoke remember this animal this fits into the category of things that bring one near to God that's what the word Corbin means our last conversation and offering an offering that which brings me near to God how does burning something up bring it near to God or bring me in there too.
 what happens with smoke so here we're back to the law ha moment you were having a few minutes ago it's the burning is what transforms it into a mode of existence that can go up and got up into the sky so they're having some kind of you yes and in other words the burning is like a transforming agent it turns it into a form where it can enter into the Heavenly throne room of God going up in this was interesting and this was Michael Morales who pointed this out in his book on the see ology of Leviticus call to Sheila's and the mountain of Lord he says again if you're standing in front of the altar looking out the door of the Tabernacle he would see the two cherubim on the door but then the fire of the altar would be right at the middle and then if you just happen to see the priest open up the curtain as it goes in what you'd see you would see a room with another identical curtain back there
 too much are B-Daman at that goes into the holy of holies but right now you got by the chair babe but there's another altar in there in the tent called the altar of incense and also burning with the same word and it's burning incense perpetually with smoke rising up into the room and so from your Vantage Point the smoke so I have it or else her know that's the 70s Stan and it's actually described as having Portia Nutley it's a mini altar Altar and so from your Vantage Point this is sort of like if you were to understand the movie director animation what do you call the stop motion animation shorts ones called fantastic mr. Fox book by Roald Dahl and there was this like making of fantastic mr. Fox so awesome
 if you watch it at the making of the movie you can see it amazing or yes it is so good anyway he often used playing with a camera has the ability to do depth perception to create the sets and so he would put a tiny miniature object in the foreground of the camera when you would be creating a little stop motion seen but the way it was posed it was look like it's in the background so it would look big but actually was just a small thing really close to the camera that's what the altar of incense is inside you would watch the priests go in and you like wait
 it's The Altar in front of me out here but it's in there you're looking down on you like there's an altar looking up there and both have smoked going up Summer Alice thinks it's a visual symbolism is important the thing I'm doing out here occasionally is actually happening inside the tent with the altar of incense perpetually not cool the smoke of the incense or the smoke of my offering is what goes up to the skies once again it's all about its symbolism is retelling the story of ascending to eat in this the return to eaten through the fire through the fire when it's transformed purified
 but also if that was you you're done yeah we totally okay so here we go how did this altar fire get in the first place I have no idea in Leviticus 9 the altar fire is lit when the glory Cloud descends upon it in lights to fight like the Olympic torch sitting there I would be perfect for that one so it's God's Own glory and Holiness that let the fire and a blameless representative on my behalf goes into the fire and dies and is transformed through that death and burning into a form where it can you send up to eat it today out of my temple
 all of a sudden dude just biblical narratives are start clicking into place when Moses goes up to the mountain on this realm's behalf. Comes down on the mountain the Israelites day. We don't want to go up there and watch you got this tells until you come up the Moses allow us he goes through the fire and he's alive and then he's up in the heavens looking at the head of my temple do interesting for got some Moses list through the fire and he comes down transform he comes down transformed in some way that people are freaked out by his face when Isaiah wakes up in a vision and Isaiah chapter 6 or are you standing in the temple which is a portal to the Heavenly Temple
 and he sees seraphim burning ones in the burning ones take a call from the altar of incense and he says woe is me I am in pure I'm going to get burned up yeah I'm about to be burnt up and he does get burned out but because of his posture of humility in the fire of God's Heavenly Temple doesn't destroy him it burns him and what God says to him is your sins are toned for the burning of Isaiah is what it sounds for his sin the burning is is lips are burned his lips are burned and then what God tells him is your sins are accounted for you so the death of the animal and its purging Through Fire Menace ending is an image of what I need to undergo purging that we could take my life yeah but in taking my life what it would be doing is transforming me to live in proximity to the source of real life
 we're out here like creating a versions of Life by doing what's good in around eyes and we call that life but then this offering takes me through a journey that I need to undergo myself which is a burning a way of what I call life to embrace what is True Lies that's what this offering means I found and we did talk about that a little bit in the last hour where we talked about Jesus is saying to that effect whoever wants to find their life will lose it something about being burned up into death losing your life the way that find real life totally Jesus was so into this the story animating Jesus is the story that's being symbolically encapsulated in the Olaf ring the surrender of one's life for the sins of others
 right we're just bored out those is the way to True Life
 I know we've only done one so you can see why this is the fundamental one really just working on this has made me realize the fire that fiery sword of Eden is that a theme video and I just thought it was interesting biblical image but I think it's deep themed connecting the story together. Find fire links fire is what comes over the disciples had the Pentecost Daniel and the three friends sacrifice their lives in the furnace of fire and live through it they live through it cuz they're blaming us doesn't leave his policy something about going through the fire in 1st Corinthians 3 talks about the day of the Lord will be like a purifying fire and our lives offered and service to our discipleship energies a homie that's blameless will pass through that's the logic of the offering the Paul's working with their actual lives
 bodies a Living Sacrifice your whole life can become a law
okay that's the Old Law number two
 the gift offering them in these are offerings of grain but you could also offer vegetables and fruit who was Cain's offering it is an offers a minute and then cuz the Hebrew word and the logic of it isn't described here actually the only place you get a real offers eye view of it is later in Deuteronomy and there's this ritual about bringing the first fruits Deuteronomy chapter 26 and Israelites were told to bring the first fruits of all the produce of the ground as a gift meaning the first harvest the first grapes nearest olives and you come and give them to the priests and the priests will take some of it looks like a handful and burn that on the Altar and then take the rest and it will feed the priests
 and the logic of it is explained later here in Deuteronomy 26 verse 10 for the Israelite is to say look I have brought the first of the produce of the ground that you owe Yahweh given to me you gave it to me I take the first and I give it back to you so you get back to God's the thing that he gave you this is the logic of the tithe typically but for the Israelites gave one tenth of all their produce to the Mughal cuz this is 1/10 no no this is just called the first they were also supposed to bring just one tenth of their produce in general and give it to the temple so this is the food offering so it doesn't own it's essentially a wave it's the law offering is about God I offer my whole self and surrender to you
 the mint offering is essentially saying thank you for what you've given me that's offering back all your stuff I feel like I have everything I have is yours but you're saying thank you okay tell me what that says hola you give a whole animal I don't get anything back yeah and nobody gets anything from it is solely dedicated to God the man, offering is you give me all of harvest this year thank you y'all way I'm going to take the first all of the bud
 bring them here I'm going to take a sample section and bring it here and the priest will burn up a handful of it and then the rest will be for the priests and it's my thank you gift for the big Harvest waiting back for me on the farm that we're going to enjoy for the rest of the year so it's truly like a token thank you kind of thing
 it's kind of like if you could give him a present by somebody it's taking a bit of the present and giving it back to the giver which we do the house and you bring you know you bring a bottle of wine and then you open it up and then you enjoy it together one is called The Zephyr shamim it's called the peace offering because I weren't shall I mean is formed of the same route as the Hebrew Shalom is wholeness, Harmony this offering gives a great window into the biblical meaning of shalom
 because the whole point of this offering is that you bring it in you put your hand on it but it is not a sacrifice of atonement it's a sacrifice that is offered but then you take all the valuable meat and the priest get some but you get a bunch to and then it says you go and you invite the levite the Widow the orphan your family and you have a party that's cool it's super cool it's so the show them which is not just the absence of conflict it's the presence of prepared relationships of relational Harmony and then abundance
 celebration of abundance this is straight-up you offer the sacrifice then you get the meat from the animal and you have a party the party start 1st yeah so this is also about Eden it's about enjoying the abundance of God's gift in the presence of God in my community time to make the peace offering eat sweet sweet were you inviting this is what Paul has to deal with in the Zeus temples with the letters 1st Corinthians but those get out of hand those become like yeah parties in orgies and nothing. I'm just saying this was common in the ancient world that meat sacrifice you have a God could be taken and then used it to make a meal that's a party got it so
 this is the Israelite version of that so this image of going to the temple receiving meat food that I've offered to God that I get some back and then I have a party with is really cool for Passover is in its own way is ripping off of this but kind of a different story but it's that God has provided a substitute animal but what we do is we eat and enjoy it as God's Gift of abundance so you're just some sections of some Psalms
 that are connecting the Eden story in the food and divine abundance with the temple offerings and those that are selling me a cyst on 3637 how precious is your loyal love oh God as the children of Adam take refuge in The Shadow of Your Wings this is imagery is coming in to the coming to the temple were Godless it's like it's like he's a big bird and we come under his wings and so when people come to take refuge when they come near they drink of the abundance of your house Temple and you give them drink from the river of your and it's the Hebrew word eaten usually translate Delight because with you is the Fountain of Light and buy your light we see light I was picturing God having a wine cellar which
 is the rivers of Eden pretty cool yeah it's the Fountain of Life when you're drinking of that wine you're drinking of life itself section of Psalms 36 it's a poetic description of going to the temple offering peace offering taking of the food that I've offered up and having a party near the temple but you describe it in this Cosmic language of taking refuge in God Shadow and I get to drink from God's Temple drinking from the rivers of Eden cuz he's the source of all life is the Fountain of Life he's the source of light all the light that we see is by means of that slight does meditation on day one of creation and
 I love just a biblical puppets man they like they got this is garbled it's about one more just cuz it's cool
 Psalm 65 verse for how blessed is the one whom you choose and bring near to you to dwell in your courts in the Court's being the outer core if the courtyard of the temple to make sacrifice
 we will be satisfied with the goodness of your house your Holy Temple
 Society of coming in going up to the mountain of the Lord ascending entering into the courts having meals and feast celebrating the abundance of God's goodness that's what this offering is all about it's the Eden overabundant food good man
offering number for almost all of our Modern English translations call it the sin offering so the Hebrew word is a top and pretty sure and Oliver Modern English translations least the main ones translate a sin offering here's the problem with that the root letters of this offering are the same letters as the root word sin in your or the noun fit which means a more moral failing however just now it isn't formed off of The Vowel pattern of the word sin formed off of The Vowel pattern of the verb which is the same route letters but that different vowel hot dog versus hot is it in important difference in height a means to purify so for example in Leviticus chapter 8
 when Moses brings a hot one of these offerings to the altar he takes the blood of the high-top animal and he puts it on the horns of the Altar and he sought as the author which also makes it holy and atone for it it's the word purify when someone has touched the dead body and they want to transfer from a state of ritual and Purity back to Purity so they can go into the temple they offer one of these and then they are hunted and then they become pure purified from contact with death so here we are to a really chord image back to the logic of atonement is purification that moral failings
 it's like I vandalize myself like my own character becomes vandalized also I simultaneously vandalize the holy space and the hot offering is what I offer so that I can be purified and so that the sanctuary of God's presence can be purified to it's like a like a disinfectant wipe
 a very ancient and gross yeah I mean it's kind of funny because you're actually smearing blood on something but the blood is the life and the life can I cancel out the death that I have introduced into the world through my Moral Moral failing hovering death of Life covering death was life life swallows up death that's not offering there's a Jewish scholar Jacob Milgram who wrote A 1600 page commentary on Leviticus no stone unturned anyway I haven't read it through but I've been using it for a couple decades now I've learned so much from him so he uses his metaphor for the purification offer cuz here's what's interesting is that when you go to Leviticus 4
 there's four versions of it that are described and what you're told is if the high priest has failed morally and he has to bring hot. And the blood of that animal is actually brought into the tent
 that's at the high priest has has failed however if you go down and you hear that it's the whole Congregation of Israel has failed morally the neighboring a thought and also the blood of that animal is brought into the tent how would you all fail
 like when they don't want to go into the promised land we all collectively I know I'm so sorry that's not you can offer up. If you morally failed but didn't know it in the moment though but it's brought to your attention so that's what's up. If you if you blew it all wrong God or on someone but you didn't know any of them, and like bow do you say unintentional so down and verse 27 if any just single individual Israelite sins of fails morally then he should bring a fit. But the blood is not taken inside the tent it's only put on the altar outside the tent they have this idea that depending on your position in Israel
 or if it's the whole group or just one the pollution is greater or lesser and so for the greatest acts of polluting Saint you got to take the blood into the tent but for just an average Israelites in by the by the altar pollution didn't make it into the tent so Jacob Milgram he uses this metaphor of this novel is called Picture of Dorian Gray was a Victorian do you know this
 oh yeah it was an Oscar Wilde novel 1890 I'm not familiar with yeah he was in American American novelist
 so this story is about a guy who makes a pact with the devil or with a demon or something like that that if he's given eternal life he has a portrait of himself hanging in the entryway of his mansion and he makes his pact that if he gets eternal life the picture in the entryway that will age but he would constantly seem like he never ages and so is this whole story about how he has to start hiding the painting and covering it up and making sure nobody sees it because let's say like he gets them into a bar fight or something and he gets punched a bruise appears on the painting and so the painting starts to look hideous as the decades go by and then eventually it's this mangled rotting corpse of God
 and you have to hide the painting and make sure nobody ever sees it to Discovery secret Jacob mg uses that image that it's as if Israel sins are constantly damaging but you can't you can't see it visually but it is polluting the way we damage the environment way we damage each other a relationally is actually polluting the Tabernacle bruising and yeah it's like heaping are track where it's like we're shredding it and you taking a sledgehammer to The Altar and cracking it and ripping up the tent and it's the offering that renews it and so you would not looking around that word constantly keeping our trash and damaging the Tabernacle but God can see it as he sees all and so through the photographer and you can reset the Tabernacle
 let's start the fifth one is called the asham and essentially this is an offering you do when you wrong when you take what is supposed to be a value to God or to another person and you misuse their property in some way so for example in Numbers Chapter 5 let's say you have a donkey you know and I take it and like I just abused the thing in the project I have it for and it comes back all like we can what I need to do is I need to make a sham for how I've deprived you of value which means I need to both repay the value of what I wronged you and add one Fest so this is something just Israelites did to each other they gave each other are shams but then when you wrong someone else because they're an image of God you're also wrong and God
 and so in a Sean isn't offering you can bring to the Altar and you have to both bring the animal but then add two at one fifth of the monetary value of the honor and dedicate that to the temple and that session, so you take the animal to the temple let's say someone is unfaithful to the Lord and you sent unintentionally you were to bring as a penalty a ram
 as in Sharm but also bring one fifth of its monetary value and offer that along with the animal in the meat of the animal goes to the priest you also have to you know you lose one fifth of its value that you've given addition and that's the Sean offering it's like a repayment for damages. So you can imagine these scenarios you don't come up where people wrong each other and the wrong people is too wrong God why doesn't this just take place outside the temple I mean it seems like if I owe you a donkey why we going and coming out within the temple light by me I'll give you a new donkey and maybe I was going to say is when I wronged you I also the wrong God
 have I wronged you and so when I rang you I need to go Givin Up Sean and what sense am I wrong and God when I wronged you because you are an image of God medical the deposit underneath it when you wrong people in the community you need to both make it right with them and you need to go offer in the shower I'm in the temple to do both I think yes yeah that remarkable yeah it's like Spence if it's expensive to the wrong fitted like abused your neighbors mule
 I know that's right every time you wrong someone in your community
 you have to make it right with them and you have to go do this to Sean in the temple through Markham and yeah but I think it's Torah its instruction this is about you do that a few times and hopefully you would get some instruction from that did not stop ruining your neighbor in that way these were formative liturgies right in the life of this real to teach them about a new way to be human and a way to relate to God and that's what that Shawn is about the four other offerings are all directed solely to God the ishamm is directed towards God and neighbor and that's what sets it apart and so which of the three are considered atonement one the first one then the hot tub the purification offering. You're the bomb this one also attends yeah yeah yeah we're forgiven for what you did to your neighbor
 but you also have to go make it right with your neighbor you can't just come to the temple this is actually what Jesus is getting at in The Sermon on the Mount when he says if you are bringing an offering and you remember that your brother has something against you don't think you can just go make things right with God but leaving exam resolved will make it right with your neighbor your brother can come and do the. Are you coming here its Beauties talking about is the logic of the yes I'm offering
 yeah yeah but the more I've learned about these offerings the more I see that their meaning is working on themes that are developed all throughout the rest of the Bible self-surrender purification from sin making right loving God loving your neighbor thanking God for what he's given to me that's the meaning of deep deep in the heart of the biblical story that it comes out everywhere so what even here in the Priestly tech manual section of Leviticus we're actually working the same themes that are work elsewhere in the whole difficult story they pop out Jesus teaching language they pop out in Paul's language in Hebrews Franks can give a color and adepts
 the how you appreciate the rest of the Bible in a way that has surprised me there are over the years
 yeah we could do a whole video series on these offerings alright offerings are the first movement of Leviticus outlines those first five offering yes and so we've been in a waitressing the theme of sacrifice what does it mean to make an offering to God and what are the different ways to do that and what is it instructing us about what it means to be in close proximity with God and to to create to the purpose of being in proximity Is God is to be in the eating-place to be where things are complete and there is peace and Shalom and we're treating each other right and so all of these offerings are what was ways for ancient Israel and actually participate in this reality
 his Holiness and power and goodness and love and eating presents to the middle of their camp with Chris a problem and these offerings are given to Israel as a means to overcome the the rift ever us reading it they are Torah instruction and as we meditate on them and I'll continue to meditate on this about our lives how to draw near to God
 so yeah maybe here be cool just to close with a meditation if you go to the New Testament you can watch how Jesus and the apostles Drew on the section Leviticus as wisdom literature as giving us insight into our own relationship to God through Jesus Messiah and so a good example is right here at the close of the letter to the Hebrews and the author says through Jesus through our representative Jesus let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God
 so your words become a sacrifice that is the fruit of lips
 let's give thanks to his name
 please using the language of the men have the gift offering that you would give fruit to God from your Olive Tree but here you're giving the fruit of your mouth that is your words
 so God gave me my mouth I use my mouth to give a gift to God she said he's taking he's like Mana for icing that gets offering and then what he says is and don't neglect to do good and to share your stuff with other people or with these stats are already offering. Just please yeah so now it's that yeah the party the showing me to take what God has given to you and share it with your neighbors and then that is also a sacrifice is a good example of where you can watch Paul and Jesus do this was actually pick up the stuff Another Day cast and then turn it into Torah
 to give new kinds of instruction to get at the heart of what he's offering for all about the first of us so much richness and the five ancient as offerings so next we're going to get into the second movement of Leviticus yeah yeah it's all started with the crisis Moses can't go into the 10 taken up residence among the morally compromised people who wrote a problem in these chapters happen and then what's about to happen is a narrative where they begin to offer these offerings and Moses's stapled is able to go in for one day something goes terribly terribly wrong but we kind of saw that coming didn't we stay tuned for the moment let us offer the fruit of lips and share our stuff because with such sacrifices guns please
