we're talking through the theme of the firstborn it's a theme about who gets to be in charge and in the storyline of the Bible God creates a reputation for selecting the least likely candidates we saw this thing began with God's choosing Humanity to be his image to rule the world a choice to some angels aren't that thrilled about and the steam continues with God showing his favor to Able the second-born shepherd Boy Over the sacrifice of Cain the firstborn city boy the same continues and is very poignant and the moment that God chooses Jacob the second-born even though he's a devious snake of a man as We Begin The Scroll of Exodus we see the steam come to life in a new way the family of Abraham is now grown to become the tire ethnic group and their slaves to the real power in charge Egypt yet it's this small inconsequential oppressed people who God calls his
 firstborn son of God is so closely identified with them like you always on Power and name 40 is invested in these people first born becomes essentially a way of saying this is my image this is my representative to call someone the firstborn is not necessarily a statement of their actual origin this family was never the first born in any of the generations but what's being referred to by calling them first born is a status a roll Israel's designation is God's firstborn is a title that gets picked up in the New Testament and applied to Jesus Jesus comes as father God's representative and Royal heir but his whole kingdom is upside down arriving first or the last people you would expect to be chosen by God the sick the poor the beggar's the paralyzed people with disabilities women these are people that Jesus intentionally
 included into the kingdom of God communities and said to them you were the blessed one of the kingdom of God begin now with you that's the fruition in Jesus's story of this theme of the inversion of the firstborn which is really about God's surprising way of challenging our conceptions of who should be inspired and who should get the good life today Tim Mackie and I talked about enslaved Israel is God's firstborn son and we talked about the relational dynamic between Moses and his brother Aaron I'm John Collins you're listening to Bible project podcast fix your joining us
 it's in a John hello we're talking about the firstborn the theme of the firstborn yes yes we are at and we covered a lot of ground and I want to hear maybe your your summarization of where we've been okay. Okay the scriptures about this desire fundamentally it's comes out of the corps plotline is a biblical story which is God's desire to share existence and responsibility and Authority enjoy with a partner
 that's really yet God desire to share responsibility power exists existence infinite existence with a created by not being used as a partner to share in the joy of responsibility over good things about style The Story begins yeah and that's how this team begins in as much as God in the all the diversity of creation there is a crown jewel in the first narrative which is the 7-Day Christian narrative or God takes the latecomer
 the last being to be created which is human the image of God and God exalt an appointment at 1 to place the responsibility and rule over everything that's come before and that's how God rolls he loves to elevate the latecomer to the place of honor and sortie so what happens however is that
 desire of God's is supported by distorted desires of said creatures that he wants to share with and that's what they eat in there to get them to and there we on a snake's less spiritual being that doesn't apparently what it wants to subvert the rule and honor given to the humans and stuff so we explore that likes why are not stated but as you read on into the rest of the story what you see is God consistently engaging in a pattern where there's this cultural background of who ought to be running the world and that is both in the background of the biblical story widespread in human history and nature and every switch is the firstborn male
 descendant of a patriarch is the one who rightfully deserves the responsibility and Authority maybe I should start there yeah I was thinking that that is a great question to start with who should be in charge us a centrally the question that's the court who should be in charge if you've got if the biblical story begins with the creator of everything beginning to share responsibility and power who gets to have that power and who gets to be the ones in charge of that power I suppose you could say why can't it just be complete totally flat like everyone's peers and no one's in charge but God chooses out of all the creatures out of the host of Heaven above the Angels out of all the animals he chooses in humans
 and they happen to be created last yeah and the Genesis 1 creation story and so the ones created last are than elevated to be the ones in charge of ruling the creatures of the sky in the land and the Sea and this choice that God makes the share his power to a creature that doesn't seem worthy of it yeah yeah did I sets in motion a plot conflict that we see happen when the stake in Genesis 3 shows up just as Captain says can you really trust God like
 somehow the snake wants to disrupt Rule and authority and relationship that the humans have with God strength and will you were showing was as you meditate on his passage you see what the latter prophets were doing you see what happens in the second temple literature seems pretty clear that the snake is connected to the Spiritual Beings who think they should be first they should be the ones and they were first in the order of the day's within Genesis one they were first and the way you get there it's because the language and the pattern and themes of those first few pages starts getting recycled over and over and over with every generation that follows from that story so you have the sibling Rivals of
 Cain and Abel but the reason their Rivals is because God chose to show favor not to the Elder firstborn brother but to the second and so we talked about that God consistently repeat that pattern by choosing the middle son of Noah's Three Sons Shem to receive the blessing and the promise of a future human who will come through him and doesn't Elevate the firstborn Jess
 or the last-born him and then that last born ham introduced another tweak in the cycle which is the last born son grab sad and violent and abusive way to try and attain to the role of the alpha male for the first born so then we talked about that and then once you have all those variations of three ways to become the first born you can be born into it as the firstborn you can get there by God elevating somebody's not the first born into that place or you have a latecomer trying to achieve the role of the first born by their own power wisdom strength or devious or devious schemes and so basically those three possibilities just get developed and creatively
 tweaked in inverted as you go through the stories of Abraham and lot and then the next generation of Jacob and Esau and then next generation of Joseph and Judah in the 12 and the other sons of Jacob and salt one but really it's all about this who gets to be in charge and what happens when God Elevate somebody who nobody else thinks she's being charged to be the person in charge and why does someone need to be in charge God gave Adam and Eve the title of image of God male and female let them rule 11 also there already was the sense of the man's I can recharge phone is not going to charge let them rule time rule together so there was kind of like let's set the table for what's the word not a democracy but like yeah mutuality to our mutual responsibility neither of them of them were in charge but together they were in charge
 and you can imagine then if they represent Humanity you know Adam is human Eva's life then all of humanity is meant to be the image of God ruling in a collaborative mutuality you get that sense but then as we've been tracing the steam it's all about who gets to be in charge and got you some people being charged I think I have an idea of why that is but you're saying why does anybody need to be in charge of God why does God start to say okay you're going to be the one the elect well remember the concept of the firstborn is tied to the Eden blessing and if you go out from Eden there's two ways it gets expressed one is just the continual blessing of God's Gift of Life and multiplication and abundance which is about Eaton's all about abundance but then the other is about the promise of a future descendant
 who will come and undo what the snake has done and crush the head of the snake while being struck by it and that's a part of this promised to that's fascinating are we saying that the original sharing of power wasn't about choosing a firstborn among the humans it was all of humanity being the firstborn definitely it's a collective calling for all Humanity in Genesis 1 Adam and Eve's don't appear in the 7-Day Christian narrative you just have male and female and Humanity as one species has made to reflect the image of God were made in the a.m. to the theme begins their God's choosing a first born the first born is the collective Humanity but then when we get to outside of the garden where now God has to deal with I need to take evil out at its source and I'm going to do it
 through Olivia lineage human lineage now you've introduced the idea of a narrowing down narrowing down in selecting and electing or choosing of a threat a specific family that God's going to use and sense of that gets merged with who gets the right of the firstborn now this theme becomes like who gets to be a feels like you're asking who gets to be in charge but you're really saying who's got going to use to defeat evil so that all humans can be damaged got his threat and what God often does is give that surprise Chosen One some level of honor and Authority but usually she was some process of them suffering her having to trust God to go through a test here we are at again at that point where the complex plot line of the Bible it's just a bundle I could tapestry and when
 make a theme video we're just we're literally taking out or pulling out of the tapestry one color thread you're saying the bundle is the image of God is a theme the idea of a Denny's the crush evil that's a theme yet the idea of a test that God puts his elect there is a theme of a chosen one who is chosen and then enters into their role as the image of God but through suffering and test that you know that's the key part of this so we're trying to pull out just a specific strain of God elevating someone who doesn't is it supposed to be in charge and putting them in charge and that's right okay and by putting them in charge it may just be selecting them to be the one who at the moment is has God's favor cuz they are chosen to become the lineage of the future snake Crusher Yeah by in charge it's not necessary to be king those ideas start to get merged with David and we'll get there but like but it is a place of honor to be chosen
 within I'm thinking within the biblical story of his character is the yeah it's an honor if that they get chosen to become the vehicle of the Eden blessing in the seed for others but also it off and puts them In Harm's Way cuz it ignites jealousy or rivalry from other people who think that that ought to be theirs what's interesting is I feel like in our last conversation or to our last one we talked about how these bundles concepts of the promise of the future ruler of future image of God ruler and the Edan blessing of abundance those can be separated so their example and cycle of Abraham and Isaac Abraham had the first born yes ma'am and God says he's not the one for the chosen lineage but I will bless him too and he'll be fruitful and multiply so he gets the Eaton blessing of abundance
 but the lineage could only come through one of the two sons and God chooses the second one for the snake crushing lineage and he gets the blessing and the promise of the future line and at the very end of Genesis when Jacob's 12 sons we learn about all of them the blessing gets dispersed between two of them two sons yeah Judah and Joseph at the end in Genesis 49 Joseph the first born of his second wife third wife but most beloved wife Rachel gets loads of blessings are you read the poem that you could speak to him on his deathbed and it's like the word blessing it doesn't bother me but then it's to the fourth born son of his first wife that he didn't like very much Leia
 that's the sun that's given the promised it through his lineage will come a future ruler over the brothers hand over the nation's so that blessing of first born Gates, split between two sons who become Rivals throughout the rest of the Torah and Prophets Joseph and their descendants yeah so God is working to restore the Eden blessing to all corners of the Human family but he's doing it through the lineage of one because the lineage of a promise future deliver has to be through one and part that you and blessing is that all humanity is he what you got correct so if you would be half of what you see is God's consistent strategy is to subvert
 human expectations about who gets to be that honored chosen lineage for the promise Nick Crusher and the Eden blessing and it is always some second born or latecomer or unlikely one Oreo one of low social status that got elevates which once you read through all the iterations of that cycle in the Hebrew Bible then you come back to those early chapters of Genesis and you can see it's right the same patterns right there with the humans in the sky rulers and snake so you're reading the early Genesis narratives in light of where this pattern of the surprise firstborn is going
 and I thought he probably works so that's why we're even going and over the last four conversations we just work through the Genesis crawl yeah so what we're going to do for the rest of the conversation is Rainsville brought over to the campout still in the Torah for this one and just focus in on the Dynamics of this first born The Sibling Rivalry between Israel and Egypt a right at the beginning of Exodus and then God chooses a deliver to deliver Israel from their oppressive sibling Egypt and got choose a guide in motion
 and his brother Aaron and there's a little rivalry going on between them that's interesting and then they gets repeated with Aaron's sons were chosen for the high priesthood there dynamics of this surprise firstborn inversion there too and they all can implicate each other in really fascinating ways then will go into the prophets and then into the gospels and then into the letters of the Apostles play Exodus today think about the first born in Texas
 so let's just listen to rock the first paragraph of excess real time right now I'm prepping for a series of Bible project classroom classes going through the Exodus in the heart of the Torah looking for Exodus Leviticus Numbers the next mini classroom classes that were filming I'm so excited it's so rad is fortegra Alexis and these are the names of the sons of Israel the ones who went to Egypt with yaakov Jacob to check out the ass. I tried to use Hebrew pronunciation and my translation cuz it's cool each one and his household went
 Raven Symone Levi Levi Yehuda the car is Evelyn Benjamin Dan Natale dad and Asher what's use a car oh it's a car every person who came out of the loin of Jacob 70 people that Joseph was in Egypt now just about died and all his brothers and all that generation and the sons of Israel were fruitful and they swarmed and they multiplied and became strong very very much and the land was filled with them
 first paragraph tell me what you say well so we start with a list of the 12 sons reminding us this is how Genesis ended the info Sons went down to Egypt but we learned that actually 70 people we had two sons came down to Egypt is an important number. It's like the number of a hole like what is that well it's just seven it's spelled with the same letters as the word complete we're satisfied or brought to fulfillment and Hebrew saba and so that becomes a design pattern theme throughout Genesis and so 70 is just turning up the volume on the concept of Devin pleat amount of people list of complete list of 70 is so all of them came and then we're fast-forwarding Joseph died and the author here wants us to think of what happened to
 this family in Egypt like what the humans were to experience in the garden yep that they were fruitful and multiplied when you use the word swarm exit 147 the sons of Israel were fruitful and swarmed they multiplied and became strong and they filled the land and filled the three of those are right from Genesis 1 the blessing on the image of God be fruitful and multiply and fill the land it's the same exact words but swarmed is the verb used of the fish in the sea from day 5 of Genesis 1 and they're called the swarmers and they are giving a blessing to be fruitful and multiply to him and put the call the swarmers so you're kind of like they're multiplying like fish
 given to fish there and now it's here in describing the really fascinating and they're going to do their own version of swimming a couple times in the story in different ways and also becoming strong very very much too strong so clearly this is the family that is being given that you the blessing right out of the gate and we're just you know you turn back the previous Genesis scroll and Joseph and Judah in particular were given the new version hyper-focused version of this blessing of not just abundance but also rule future ruler coming to do that cats so that that action Farah's response
 now a new king arose over Egypt who didn't know Justice Joseph has died do you know how much time it's supposed to, man it's for Generations were 400 years but either way Joseph and the Pharaoh and his dad were like type I mean it was like first and second in command you and the new Pharaoh Rose who says to his people look the people of the sons of Israel are more multiplied and they're stronger than us a timer set to be called Israel the sons of Israel but this is the first time that they are now can be called one whole group of the whole nation I mean the group of small Clan has become a nation and now they're being looked at as a large ethnic entity but notice what he sees is
 is there more fruitful and multiply and stronger than us to come let us act with kokoma wisdom skill cards really carefully how to craft in here or else they'll multiply more yeah and it will come about that when War happens to us that they might even add themselves to those who hate us and they will make war against us and they'll go up out of our land that's a very like astute and careful way to think about situation is in you've got a group of people that are different nationality living in your land my friends and they are like getting large is a lot of them and they're powerful
 feels threatening the Pharaoh it's his portrait of a governing leader whose views a extremely productive abundant immigrant population of Joseph stay welcome the whole crew 70 down and what's 70 going to do to you but they're like the siblings of this guy who's working in your cart who is have a lot of influence but what he sees when he sees the abundance in the wisdom given to Joseph in the abundance that's attached to this family the Pharaoh just stay seize the opportunity right threat of a government leader who looks at Immigrant group and all they see is liability fear what ignites in them and as of
 potential conflict and so what's the tragic irony is that his fear of conflict is actually what he goes on to create through his actions there wasn't a conflict but it is fear of the conflict the creates the conflict and also his choice to enslave them which is what he does next but I just want pay attention to it so you have a governing leader, sees the blessing on this group and it ignites the kind of fear jealousy in them yeah I think what we're seeing here is where this is Kane this is Esau well this is the serpent this is the snake exactly well I mean I'm wondering exactly right let us act with wisdom wisdom and skill so we learn about the one thing we learn about the snake is that he's crafty which is a wisdom word not a bad word it's not like I often to just ask
 for someone who's like really strategic while I think we often think that must be a word to describe something sinister and so are we hyperlinking to that idea definitely most definitely also you know that I remember in Genesis 12 eleven Cycles went from the snake
 Replay by Kane the LED to his descendants 2 limit to the building of City then we reboot with Noah and then it starts with ham
 and then it goes down from him to Nimrod who bill I don't care if I can build the city of Babylon look what the next thing Pharaoh does is they placed over them captains of forced labor
 to oppress them with their burdens and they built cities of Supply storage for Farah pistol drums days and then you re down a little further they enslave them they made their slaves with brutality they made their lies bitter with enslavement with mortar and with brick
 so they're building cities are brick-and-mortar these are all the keywords of their used car value only elsewhere of the building of the city of Babylon in the Bible that which is battling that's right exactly is just saying how you pronounce in Hebrew yeah here in Exodus song is describing what Pharaoh is doing to the Israelites he's using the language that was last used in just this combination of words to describe Nimrod and the people of babylon's desire to build a city reaches up to the skies and Nimrod came from the line of us ham of ham that's right and nimrods descendant is Egypt Egypt and Babylon has come from Ham the third son of Noah so once again
 we have really what this is this is a sign of him against the son of Shem the son of Shem is getting the blessing and the son of ham here is acting the snake yeah wow and its hyperlinking to the serpent which is about someone who is powerful in a place of power looking like why is God blessing these people that exact shouldn't be powerful and then how in the Striped Cain and Abel Cain is described as like embodying the serpent evil yes when he decides of the firstborn yet this isn't fair that God's giving favor to a second born to all of these themes like it's coming together in this really wonderful way yes that's exactly right that's cool just as a little here all throughout the Psalms there many
 Psalms that retail different parts of the biblical story and there are three Psalms that when they retell the story of The Exodus they refer to Egypt as him awhile they kind of sticks out like an song 78-51 God struck the firstborn of Egypt the first fruits of their manhood of the tents of ham in Psalm 105 verse 23 Israel came into Egypt Jacob sojourn in the land of ham Caesar later biblical authors that's why the genealogies really matter in the Hebrew Bible because you really meant to see later generations as replaying the incidents that happened among their ancestors in the earlier parts of the biblical story in this is a good one
 all of the cycles of Genesis 1 through 11 are being replayed here in the descendants of ham and the descendants of Shem okay so the theme the firstborn is really loud here we are seeing that the king of Egypt the one in power the one who you know ham wasn't the first born it comes to that lineage him his whole purpose was to take that power correct and here we have here we are again the Pharaoh has the power but in a way like ham succeeded at least the line of hams yeah you did and taking that power we're now the world Empire or the one in charge and we've got a smaller growing immigrant population the end no way should be a threat to us and no it should be in charge o I'm I'm sorry yeah sure he'll like a threat because they're like they seem to be have God's favor and see what we know of this theme is it
 firstborn the one in charge is going to get jealous and it's going to murder or do something somehow the way that you just summarize that kind of help motivate me that even want to clarify more help with what's happening often the one that God actually chooses her favors are blesses the way to indicate their lower status was either that there later born sibling sometimes like in the Genesis in the Rival wives it was the one was more loved than another and so God favors the unloved Leia you know in this case what is it within the narrative that Mark someone of being a lower social status and before the Israelites were enslaved it's just the sheer fact that they're immigrants and an ethnic minority
 within the dominant culture and that's what makes them the vulnerable ones and so let's just pause and meditate this is a crucial message of the Exodus story that when God looks upon the human seen what God notices and pays attention to and focuses his Blessing and elevates are vulnerable immigrant families in a foreign land and that is the character of God that the same character of God that looked upon layer the unloved wife of Jacob and gave her the gift of abundance and not the love your sister you know who Jacob love more and their moments where that mace like maybe the the wives that kind of strikes us or with Kane & Abel we're kind of like man what's up what's up with that you know but I think in a moment like this ice kind of feel it and I'm like that's seems beautiful to me but I think that's also cuz my imagination is the shape by the Christian Store
 it's normally in human history what's happening in Exodus is exactly how things go and it's exactly how things go still today let them here like this is not an ancient issue for the Human family like this is a clear and present cycle of human behavior on a large scale so what you're saying is you can draw a direct line between God's desire to share his power with all of humanity which who are we one of these creatures to God's desire to like look upon an unloved wife
 God desire to elevate a second born son to his desire to look at a minority immigrant population who's being mistreated and want to protect and Elevate them God identifies God's Own Self with them just to come gometta in scripture here this is for me personally what was so at first compelling I remember when I was young man and his first being drawn to Jesus for no hear stories about him is exactly this seem right here like a the people that Jesus noticed and paid attention to our the equivalence it is fought and fought for and yeah are the equivalent in his day of where that is real I sit in this story the sick the poor the beggar's the paralyzed people with disabilities women these are people that Jesus intentionally
 included into his kingdom of God communities and said to them you are the Blessed ones the kingdom of God begins now with you that's the fruition in Jesus's story of this theme of the inversion of the firstborn which is really about God's surprising way of challenging our conceptions of who should be in charge and who should get the good life and I just have always loved that part of the biblical story and this is of such a beautiful kind of poignant moment that
 so what happens next is that Pharaoh first gives an order that every son of the family should be murdered like the moment they come out of the Gloom that plans foiled by some counter deceivers the Hebrew midwives really fascinating then he just says throw all the boys into the river and then that plan is for boiled when a mom actually kind of does it by putting her first born son into a river but in an arc mini Arc and delivered through the waters right into the household of Farrow and he actually buy the end of chapter 2 becomes adopted as a son into the house to Pharaoh he becomes the Sun to the daughter of pharaoh
 so now it's fascinating cuz Moses watch the sorry I said he's the firstborn son the Nerdist doesn't say that and it's actually not the case doesn't clarify I just asked his mom give birth to her son and not son becomes the sun both to an Israelite women but then he becomes a son to an Egyptian woman who raises them this is fascinating question of the identity of Moses now is he Israelite or is the Egyptian either you both as a conflicted identity and then of course you know he's going to lose his temper murder in Egyptian in his attempt to rescue some Israelites not backfires and his adopted father Pharaoh in the blind kill him so he plays
 the Moses as an exile for 40 years ends up meeting God and a burning tree brush them to say the whole generation of people that wanted to kill you have passed away and go back and confront pharaoh and tell him on my behalf let my people go
 so that's what starts happening and then the theme of the firstborn really gets prominent here and a little group of store is near the end of chapter 4 this is super fascinating the Moses is cruising back on a donkey with his family to Egypt were in chapter 4 okay I have is that sells over yep he's going back to Egypt and 4:21 the Lord said to Moses when you return to Egypt sees it all the signs and wonders I put into your hand perform them before Pharaoh this is the staff that turns into a snake and turn the water in the blood do them before Pharaoh I will make his heart strong and he won't send out the people
 and so you will say to Pharaoh this is what you always says Israel is my son my firstborn son and I'm telling you send out my son so that he can serve me but you have refused to send him out so look I'm going to slay your son your first born son which is foreshadowing 10th play the tenth plague which is the night of passover so notice here this is the appointment is the first time that this language is used up the family of this real ok Google my first born son
 so the word firstborn son hasn't been used since the Genesis crawl to talk about Jacobs Axel first born son Ruben who lost the first born rides and then with the word use a lot in the Jacob and Esau stories cuz the first born first born right was what Jacob was you know swindling his way into but here it is real gets the title what does that mean that they have that title well so the first born son is essentially This Is My Chosen Heir and representative so for a God for a deity or deities to say that other people group is to sensually say these other people I should be ruling the world well at least this is my crew is so closely identified with them like you always on Power and name Authority
 is invested in these people first born on becomes essentially a way of saying this is my image this is my representative in Exodus 19 it'll get put that that is real is called to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation but here it's using the language and imagery of the first among siblings to be the representative of the father is so narratively and no sense are they well okay well it's interesting narratively in terms of the genealogy they come from Seth who's not a first born born Adam and Eve
 then from the line of sham sham who's the second second wind of Noah and his wife and okay I don't know where and their lineage are they actually a first-ball no no Isaac then after that of Abraham who seems to be the middle child of his brothers then of Isaac second-born then if Jacob second-born it's gone so it's none of the generations Israel come from the first and and they're not in a position of Power by any means here so God as is not identifying with like hey my crew is the powerful crew and he's identifying with a crew that looks pretty weak yeah this is my man that's right this is Yahweh what do you say
 conferring a title of not quite royalty but definitely have a first born status that was a category of family Clan Authority and honor and you always looking for a title and position upon the family that has never held that position throughout history in any of the family elevating this is the same moment. Got elevating the lake, or the dirt creature to a place of honor that's what's happening here so calling Israel of firstborn is clearly saying God is choosing what is not first and saying it'll be first that's right and that poses a challenge for all those around the Blessed quote-unquote firstborn you're the one that got two points how you going to deal with that to the status of firstborn okay but I feel is relevant for when we talk later about Jesus to call someone the firstborn then is not necessarily a state
 are there actual Origins this family was never the first born in any of the generations yeah but what's being referred to by calling them first born is a status role that's relevant for how the title gets applied to Jesus is it because the jump there real quick because she is called the firstborn of all creation and unlike Israel he
 how do you say this it's just hard I guess the categories get weird because it's what I want to say is like unlike Israel he was an elevated from a lower status like he was the image of the invisible God from the beginning he actually is the first remember how the hell did the quilt patterns work it's never identical it's always a Twist but I think the point is that to call someone first born son here is a roll status as opposed to describing the actual physical processes are origins of how they came to that role they are being identified or publicly recognizes that we could say it's actually really helpful analogy because this family has always through all the generations been holding this special place within God's purpose it's not the first time
 this family has been given this role through the cycle of the store is what's new is that a new generation of people need to have declared to them that this family is my first born and since you clearly farro have either forgotten that or don't want to acknowledge that that's what's going on right here so this declaration of my firstborn is more for Farah then it is about giving Israel a status they didn't have before cuz they have had that all along in the sense that God has been choosing that family lineage all yeah yeah and so you're bringing up Jesus to say by calling use the firstborn isn't saying what order was he born in creation correct it's about status about a revealing Jesus status so I was Paul and Romans 1 he's declared to be the Son of God in power through the Spirit by who
 Resurrection from the dead so he's not saying Jesus became the Son of God by the resurrection but rather the resurrection revealed to everybody else was it declared it was always true of him that of the Eternal Sun and I think that's out this firstborn language function so sorry that's a little detail kind of here but it's helpful analogy is this family's always been the special one of God's purpose but it's revealed a new to this generation what is always been true of them all well anyway so this is actually previewing the whole cycle of conflict that's going to go down between Israel and Pharaoh all the way up to pass over which is where God puts a choice in front of everyone in the land of Egypt which is
 there's going to be a destroyer that goes through the land of that night and the wife of the firstborn is at risk so in Passover what God is showing is to have ultimate responsibility and authority over the most powerful Imperial rulers of the land and their family monarchies and but it you know it says from the firstborn of every animal to The Peasant in their home to pharaoh and his throne yeah and all of those first born DeLong
 to Yahweh and so he can give them their life or take away their life and those are the stakes of Passover and so God obviously reversing and bring back on Pharaoh what he brought on Israel which is to take the life of their sons but here at Passover he always provides what Ferrell never did which is a choice you have a choice of how things go Yahweh will protect the life of the firstborn if you choose to come under the covering of the substitute the Yahweh provides nuts the Passover Lamb in the blood on the doorpost but if you refuse to accept you always gift covering then you forfeit the life of your first-born that's how the logic of Passover works and I'm just arriving at Clinic leave right now which masks over a deep disturbance in my inner Force
 the plague of the Passover end of The Taking of the firstborn as long as I've sat with it and work through it can understand how it works in the story I Stood Still hard for me yeah hard for me to harder than the flood for you same same thing same type of difficulty or with the rebellion of the sons of Korah where the whole family suffers for the sins of the father and essentially that's exactly it it's the children being held accountable for the sins of their fathers which is Ezekiel says in Ezekiel 18 that's exactly how he always does not operate the front seat children accountable for the sins of their fathers but yet that's if I stood the watch that country over there
 so I'm telling you it's one of the outstanding issues for me it was in the Hebrew Bible that I struggle with how it makes sense I feel like we should talk about that for like another hour. I Spent My Summer trying to read deeply in the number of early Greek Church fathers and Scholars I learned a lot over the summer for one of the illusion that Pastor Gregory of Nyssa wonderful short treatment called the life of Moses and that's the interpretation of the most storage in a week when he gets to pass over you just raised up names that he just says what do we do with this portrait of God holding innocent children and you really turns up the volume is like what has a babe. I just cried only for the nipple of its mother and fast and its parents arms and and what has it done that it deserves death for the sins of Farrah major piece names
 straight up for the tension and he has his own way of resolving it that I'm still processing through but so this is an element of about the portrait of God in the Hebrew Bible is one of those portrait hard if you take as your starting point the character of God revealed in Jesus cuz it seems to me that the character of God revealed in Jesus wouldn't do something like this
 the real tension yeah yeah yeah so what's bothering us is that God would hold a child responsible for the actions of their parents and infant even if a six-year-old boy in my science an innocent one who has done no good or evil but you know he's wrong if we want to think about it and compartmental a we try to have the theme of the firstborn which is interesting here which is saying hey you find your strength and your power and your first-born status and in your first born
 Suns yeah who are the going to be the one to pass on your status para exactly but then also the next patriarch of the clan of the people who live in Egypt in the do whatever everyone for me this is the thing where my mind goes as to some kind of resolution is in Egyptian religion and culture quiz. Sarah was the Incarnation of their most powerful deity image of God in the Hebrew Bible that's right and so it's not insignificant that in
 Exodus 12 check this out this is within the instructions about Passover now it says in Exodus 12 12 I will go through the land
 that night that I pass over I will strike down the firstborn in the land of Egypt both human and animal and against all of the Elohim of Egypt I will bring my Justice I am Yahweh so somehow Passover is a strike against the Elohim of Egypt also which seems odd to us it's like we're okay the humans and the animals and then that will him but they're all one in this narrative taking down the firstborn of Egypt is taking down the LA man that's what exit is 12/12 clearly implies there's a spiritual a rebellion that is getting intertwined in the power structure of human Empire and by God dealing with the power structure of the human Empires actually dealing with the spiritually yes just like in the flood and other where they've Dynamic is in the flood
 about this illicit mutant merging of Ella human human to create monstrous human violence and evil in the world and that's precisely what is happening in that strange son about the sons of Elohim in the daughters of Adam in Genesis 6 1 through 4 that's like the last part of the Rebellion that leads to the flood in other words were great this is the melody replaying So within the Exodus narrative God striking the firstborn of Egypt is God striking at the human design Rebellion that is combined and Egypt I think that's how the logic of story works and part of the plague of the firstborn is kind of a way of God saying
 look I'm attacking the very center & heart of your misunderstanding of power yes yes good and not only am I going to attack it but I'm going to give you a way out which is to align with a new power which is saying you see this immigrant population the Hank just abused like there that's my first-born that's my first born and in my economy yeah it works completely different you can get on board with that economy and you actually will find power and blessing come get them or you can just run with the way you want to do it which is giving it to your firstborn and actually I'm going to just disrupt that at its source I'm just going to stop it it's raining in a pretty violent and disturbing way which feels just as violent disturbing is God saying I'm going to stop human violence and on the earth in Genesis 6 and so you're saying there's something happening here where the volume
 turn. We're often in the Bible God's described his patient slow to anger and he's dealing in a way so that people have time to come to him but then his moments sexy creation moment here in Exodus with the tenth plague where is just like stop saying Sodom and Gomorrah Sodom Gomorrah it's just I'm stopping it yeah and so these are the moments back to the flood narrative God accelerates a process that humans have already begun in building a culture that's become so monstrous and it's neglect of human life and value it's reached the point of no return the Nazis flood like The Creation Moments and this is why the ten plagues are riddled with vocabulary from the flood narrative
 it's uncanny other words the words used to describe the Waters of the flood and what they do and what happens it's all the same vocabulary used over and over again throughout Flags thank you for that summary because it's those decreation moments that are exactly the parts of the biblical Melody that usually for us is modern readers were just like I'm super uncomfortable with what God's doing right now and I think it's okay to feel that however I don't want to have that blind me from us of the important point being made that you just named that there are times when human evil gets so woven and so a large scale
 that it says the seeds of its own ruin that creates immense suffering and pain and Injustice in the world and bringing that ship down burning it's just a big moral mess and that is reflected and I think in the moral tensions that are raising these stories and I've come here now I'm whenever I'm right here at this point in the biblical Melody of the Cycles it's good for me
 but I can tell it's going to be something that's resolved if ever decide if my resurrection just buy lots of years of prayer and pondering and taking it to God In Prayer cuz I logically that I keep hitting roadblocks when it comes to this and that's okay please for me
 I just keep thinking about Thanos Infinity War endgame them once and I don't remember a lot well so the whole plot is that you got this big bad guy in the Marvel movie Universe the universe is stage 2 of Marvel maybe was at stage 3 I don't know the big purple guy who wants to like yeah so it's the whole storyline of Thanos rising to power he's a bad dude yeah but the one thing that he wants is to collect all the Infinity Stones so that he has the power we want to do is wipe away half of the threat the creatures on a dorel living beings that's right but for him it's a moral good because the universe can actually sustain all of these creatures so he's actually kind of resetting things so that the people that continuing to exist can actually exist and so you've got this bad guy
 who is doing something pretty horrendous before a reason that actually has a moral intuition to it and so there was this whole like internet subculture what people are saying Thanos was right I did nothing wrong yeah yeah yeah it's weird tension or your liking just wrestling with it now because Bible is not Thanos because it got the Bible is actually represent is on the opposite of like a good God doing the right thing and like but all the sudden put into it so anyways there's this weird kind of resin in the first place my mind goes is actually think many of us do imagine that the god represent in the Bible is like that to you and to bring the parallel even closer the way that's all that plot tension is solved in that series of movies is when one of the main Heroes
 Dark Iron Man Iron Man gives up his life on behalf of his friends he sacrifices his life on behalf of his friends and then that becomes to hear a moment and the whole message of the movie is that's the Ultimate Mortal good just to give one's life for the trend in one sense it's a deeply Christian movie but on another sense notice it's portraying to Powers at work in the universe like a god is a God the only way of bringing this to kill everybody but half of everybody and so it's the sacrificial hero who saves us from the God of Justice and I really think that's how many of us experienced the god of the Bible that Jesus saves us from the Wrath of the wrath of that place that's right and some people would say that is the portrait of God in the Bible
 and others would say that actually is intention with the true God of the Bible which is not think I like that nose and here there is a major fork in the road in terms of the Christian tradition between different portraits of God coming out of the same Bible
 but it's just funny to me that you brought that up because that's really whether or not you think the god a God the Father to use trinitarian category as where these in God the father is more like sinus or not at all like Thanos well actually tell you a lot about to get away from his moments like this that's right where it feels a little bit like the logic of phanos of like I'm going to do a net moral good but it's going to just reek Havoc yeah yeah yeah but the fly in the ointment so to speak the wrench in the plan is that the same God that is doing that is the same God that is providing and the substitute the Passover Lamb yes in the same way other than the Abraham and Isaac story God demands the life of Isaac and it's Abraham sins catching up to him
 and God is the one who provides the substitute for God is both the one who character creates the tension and solves the tension within God's Own Self and something like that at the Deep logic of what's going on in the New Testament in the father and the son not a dog's with each other like Iron Man and Thanos but actually both are expressing things that are at the very Heart Of God which is Justice and mercy quite a bit broader than other first.
 What we didn't get to look at was how Moses and Aaron their Dynamic is a first-born dynamic Midway Through The Exodus story is it that Moses has a brother and then at a certain point of chapter 7 years has given this little notice which is right when they start approaching pharaoh and really confronting him it is Exodus 77 just a random little detail right in between these narratives exciting there's a conflict with pharaoh and it just says Moses was eighty years old and are in 83 the older brother will make you like Elohim the pharaoh
 an errand will be your Prophet so Moses becomes an image of God to pharaoh and Aaron is his like you know Helper and Moses is the second-born are in this the first so even if it's not our firstborns within firstborns doesn't ever try to like overtake Moses though it's just the garden once again inverts the firstborn order with Moses and Aaron is like kind of like a billion into the people in the people you have to persuade him and those people are like let's kill Moses or let's make a God and worship him. They also at one point and I like let's kill Moses collect the road trip gone wrong in the numbers golf so what this fascinating is this Dynamic of the inversion of the firstborn is a huge
 sub theme of The Exodus narrative has a whole it rarely comes to the surface except in these moments of Israel is my first born and then we'll pass over and they're the inversion of the firstborn the right front center along with a whole bunch of others names obviously which is what we ended up talking about and then Aaron's sons to quickly summarize that has four sons of Eleazar and it's the first to the older two sons that bring the Strange Fire into the holy place and get zapped yeah it's going to bother the fourth one of them are yea and ndaba Navi who who are the oldest son's and up
 violating the Liturgy in some way on the day the first day of the Tabernacles like service and what they do is take incense into the tent with what's called unauthorised fire Strange Fire but bringing incense into the tent at that point was only the responsibility given to their dad so you have the younger I tried to assert the authorities are taking the role of the dad and kind of like a ham move from Genesis chapter 9 Pam you know trying to take in some way of the position of his father and so they died and it consumed by fire and it's the third born Eleazar who then takes the role as the next high priest and succession
 so those with Moses and Aaron and then among Aaron's sons you get all the Dynamics that you had in Genesis of God elevating the later born of the firstborn pulling a ham has no no no the first born in the second born of Aaron who are doing a ham kind of moves say let's take our power yeah and even though it's not ours yet yeah let's let's do the thing that God has given only to our dad right now yeah cool alright well we got to stop their tour next stop is going to be after the Torah and the former Prophets The narratives that really turn this up and really powerful ways the story of Hannah and her son Samuel
 at the beginning of Samuel scroll and then Samuel the prophet becomes the one who God calls to anoint and raise up a king for Israel from the many sons of a guy named Jesse and it's the younger one David that elevated and then both of those set the pattern that gets drawn a pond in the latter prophets especially the book of Isaiah about how God will raise up a future seed of David to bring God's Reign and blessing over all the nations that through suffering and stress first born in the province yeah man
