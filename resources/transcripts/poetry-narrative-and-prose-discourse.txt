 E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
2 Jon: Hey, this is Jon at The Bible Project. Today on the podcast, we're going to 
continue our conversation in the series on How to Read the Bible. If you're 
like me, the Bible can get really intimidating and even confusing. And one 
reason is because there are different styles of writing in the Bible.  
 In this episode, Tim and I are going to talk about three main types of literary 
styles i n the Bible: Poetry, narrative and press discourse. And of the three, 
perhaps the hardest one is poetry, yet, poetry in the Bible is really important.  
Tim: One of three chapters in the Bible is not trying to communicate content or 
information to you. It's  rather trying to create an experience that shapes how 
you feel and how you think. That's remarkable to me. A third of the Bible is 
this kind of literature.  
Jon: in this episode, we break down some examples of biblical poetry, narrative 
and discourse and w e talked about their differences. Here we go  
 33% of the Bible. That's a really clean number there.  
Tim: Forget what the decimal's for when I did my...I did by chapters. Did I write it in 
these notes? I have it somewhere in my notes. Here it is. 502 chapters in the 
Bible are narrative, 387 are poetry.  
Jon: Now, it's not always that clean. A chapter can have both.  
Tim: That's true. I tried to round up because there are many poems that are 
embedded in stories, in which case, that's the narrative chapter . I didn't count 
it as a poetry.  
Jon: Oh, so poetry actually has a little bit more — 
Tim: Probably poetry, yeah. But some poems embedded in narratives are whole 
chapters. So yeah.  
Jon: You would count that as a poetry chapter?  
Tim: Yeah. There's probably a nother dozen to 15 chapters’ worth of poetry 
embedded in small poems in either Paul's letters, he quotes a number of 
poems, or in other narratives. So yeah, it's probably more like 35%, maybe 
36%.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
3  Here's the thing with poetry. This is like the Dead Poets  Society. You can begin 
with a definition.  
Jon: Let me put that on my list to watch again.  
Tim: Remember when he's drawing on the board? They have somebody read from 
this classic introduction to the poetry and he's drawing a chart. He’s drawing 
a chat and  he talks about it, and then he's like, "Everyone....  
[crosstalk 00:02:49]  
Jon: And everyone's like, "Ahh."  
Tim: Here's the thing. We could read the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of 
poetry, we could read a sentence from one of the classic introducti ons to 
poetry by Lawrence Perrine, or we could read just an example, one of my 
favorite examples of the uniqueness of poetry in biblical literature. Do you 
might start with the example or start with the definition?  
Jon: The example. Like an actual poem.  
Tim: The example is actually reading a narrative that's told in the Bible. Then right 
after it is told, a poetic retelling of the narrative you just read. So you can see 
very clearly how narrative and poetry work differently.  
 So Exodus chapter 14, classic s tory. It's where the Israelites walk through the 
sea as on dry land and Pharaoh's destroyed.  
Jon: This is the narrative?  
Tim: This is the narrative. "Then Moses stretched out his hand over the see all that 
night. The Lord drove back the sea with a strong east ruach, wind and turned 
it to dry land." All that language is echoing Genesis chapter 1. "And the 
waters were divided, the Israelites went through the sea as on dry ground 
with a wall of water on the right and on their left.  
 The LORD said to Moses, " Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the 
waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen." 
So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak, the sea went 
back to its place.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
4  The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea. 
The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen --the entire 
army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of 
them survived." Epic scene.  
Jon: So that's the character of Moses and th e Israelites. The setting is the sea.  
Tim: The sea of reeds.  
Jon: The sea of the reeds on the way into the wilderness. The other character is 
Pharaoh and  
his army.  
Tim: The conflict is the Egyptians led by Pharaoh want to destroy the slaves that 
they just  let go.  
Jon: So they are off to go get them.  
Tim: Through Moses, God fights on Israel's behalf and all Moses — 
[crosstalk 00:05:09]   
Jon: By taming the sea?  
Tim: By taming the waters. Making the waters to [split? 00:05:13] just as they did in 
Genesis 1.  
Jon: And then the resolution is Pharaoh gets ripped over.  
Tim: So you walk away from the story going, "God's Creator of all things, and He's 
on a mission to defeat evil and rescue the helpless." That's the story.  
Jon: All right.  
Tim: All right. You turn t he page to Exodus 15 and the Israelites sing the first 
worship song in the Bible. I've just excerpted these two sections that retell the 
story we just read. It opens with "The LORD is my strength and my song. He is 
my God; I will praise him. He's highly ex alted." It goes on verse 4.  
 "Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of 
Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the sea. The deep waters covered them; E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
5 they sank to the depths like a stone. Your right hand, O LORD, majestic in 
power , your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.  
 By the blast of your nostrils waters pile up. The surging waters were like a 
wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea. You blew with your 
breath. The sea covered them; they sank like lead in t he mighty waters. So 
epic.  
 Some interesting things to contrast. It opens up "Pharaoh's chariots and his 
army hurled into the sea." That's a very different image than what we got in 
the story.  
Jon: Right.  
Tim: You do get the water standing, congealing like a wall later in the poem but in 
this first line, it just looks like God picked them up and just threw them into 
the water.  
Jon: But when he says, "The deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea," it 
evokes more emotion for me than when he says jus t— 
Tim: The narrative is a little clinical. It's just like, "And the waters parted and they 
stood up like a wall on the right and left."  
Jon: I guess narrative can use poetic tons of phrases and stuff all the time.  
Tim: All the time.  
Jon: One observation  is that the poetry actually made me feel like I was there 
more than the narrative.  
Tim: Oh, interesting. Yes. It evoked your imagination more than the story?  
Jon: Yeah, it did. And it might have just been the way the story is written - you 
said it's clin ical, it is a little more clinical - because a good storytelling can do 
the same thing.  
Tim: That's true.  
Jon: But I mean, the blasting of his nostrils, pile up the water.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
6 Tim: Blast of your nostrils, you blew your breath. In the narrative, the description is, 
"the Lord drove the sea back with a strong wind." It's same word "breath" or 
"wind." Ruach. And it's God doing it. But nostrils and blowing?  
Jon: It's connecting more ideas. So poetry — 
Tim: Here. There's one more.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: Whose ha nd is most important in the narrative?  
Jon: Moses'.  
Tim: Moses stretched out his hand. Then God says, "Stretch out your hand." And 
Moses stretched out his hand. So three times Moses' his hand is the key thing 
shaping the flow of the narrative. In the poem , it's God's hand. "Your right 
hands, O Lord. Your right hand."  
 Actually, the poem never even mentions Moses. In the poem, only God is the 
actor through his hand and his nostrils, and his mouth. In the poem, Moses is 
the main actor at the Lord command. So rry. In the narrative, Moses is the 
main actor.  
 So that's the difference there, that the poem also is a level of theological 
reflection, where — 
Jon: What did this mean?  
Tim: If you were there, what you would see is what the narrative tells you. The 
poem  steps back and uses metaphor "God has big nostrils." It's also 
interpreting the event in a really reflective way that Moses' hand was like 
God's hand. All of the vivid imagery of them sinking, the soldiers sinking, 
drowning — 
Jon: The weightiness of - he's calling them lead.  
Tim: Yeah, they sink like lead and like rocks. There we go. That's good. You get the 
experience. So what just happened?  
Jon: Well, it seems like the poem was like, I'm not worried about making sure that 
the character...I don't know. Tha t's the thing is like poems and stories, there's E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
7 definitely an overlap. Like if you drew the Venn diagram, you could have right 
there in the middle this very poetic storytelling.  
Tim: We're reflecting on the memory of an event or of an experience.  
Jon: Because there's other poems that are so abstract that it gives you feelings 
and emotions and it might conjure up ideas.  
Tim: Okay, sure. So that would be poems that aren't reflecting on a story. In this 
case, this one is.   
Jon: This one it is. It is it seems like kind of in the middle. This poem has a 
storytelling — 
Tim: It's a poetic retelling of a memory. That's right. In this case, this is why it's a 
good example because the poem's anchored in something that seems more 
familiar. So it's not like abstra ct poetry. But the techniques and the mode of 
communication is fully poetic.  
Jon: The elements of story are there, but what else does it have that makes us 
think, "Oh, this is more poetry"? And that seems to be its loose structure. It's 
not really worried  about sequence this much.  
Tim: Yeah, sure, it's not about sequence. You mentioned your imagination was 
more ignited?  
Jon: Yeah. And I think that's because much more liberal use of metaphor, which is 
making me connect the ideas that I either haven't conn ected before or that 
has helped me see maybe I have but it just is planting that idea right in front 
of me.  
Tim: So ignited your imagination through its use of metaphors that you wouldn't 
have thought of. Like you'd never read the narrative and go, "Oh, G od blasted 
with his nose." And then, emotion. You felt something when you think of God 
blasting with his nose breath?  
Jon: Right. Or just the example of the wall of water. To me, that's the most 
magnificent image in the story is...Where is it in the story?  
Tim: The waters congealing.  
Jon: But where is it in the actual story?  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
8 Tim: Verse 22. "A wall of water on their right and left." That's it.  
Jon: Wall of water on their right and left. That's an amazing image.  
Tim: Yeah, it is actually. It is.  
Jon: That' s an intense image. When I read it in the story, I'm like, "Whoa, that's 
intense." But then when I get into the poem, and it says, "The surging water 
stood up like a wall," now it's actually making the waters - What's the word? 
Anthropomorphizing the water s. The water stood up. The surging water 
stood up. So it's like giving the waters more of a character.  
Tim: Yeah, or animating them.  
Jon: Animating them. It wasn't just a wall. It was a wall that congealed in the heart 
sea. So I'm picturing the wall now a nd it is just as intense, but now there is 
even more emotion to it.  
Tim: Yeah. It's like when Jell -O cool.  
Jon: Congeal. What's the Hebrew word there?  
Tim: It's a unique one.  
Jon: It must be for them to use such a unique English word.  
Tim: Qapha' [SP] f rom qapha. To thicken, condense or congeal. It's used here. It's 
used one time in Zephaniah when he talks about wine that's left to sit for too 
long.  
Jon: It congeals  
Tim: It gets all like thickens and gross. God says, "I'm going to search Jerusalem 
with lamps and bring justice on those who are complacent who are left like 
wine that congeals."  
Jon: Does wine do that? Wine thickens if you leave it out?  
Tim: Apparently. Maybe how they made wine. Then Job asks God, "Don't pour me 
out like milk. Don't congeal me like cheese." Oh, so that's like cheese 
coagulating from — 
Jon: Coagulation.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
9 Tim: That's it. Those are the three times the word occurs in the Bible. Anyway.  
Jon: That's amazing. Like Jell -O. 
Tim: Yeah, hardening like Jell -O. Okay, all right. Let's back up. Let's allow 
Encyclopedia Britannica to give us a scientific definition of what just 
happened.  
Jon: Oh, can I say one more thing that I noticed?  
Tim: Yes, please.  
Jon: The cadence.  
Tim: Oh, yeah, yeah. Totally. That's very important.  
Jon: There's a rhythm to it. I don't know why that's significant, but all poetry seems 
to have that.  
Tim: Different cultures have different types of rhythmic structures, and a lot of the 
English European tradition have rhyme. Rhyming is way to do that. Not really 
a feat ure of Hebrew poetry, but Hebrew poetry definitely has a very 
intentional kind of structure to it. Itself communicate.  
 It's called parallelism, where basically you create little pairs, sometimes triads, 
most often pairs, where you pair two things and eit her you create them in a 
sequence, or you are saying the same thing twice. There's a whole variety of 
ways you can use it. But it creates a structure. Pharaoh's chariots and army 
hurled in the sea. Best of Pharaoh's officers drown in the sea. Deep waters 
covered them, they sank to the depths like a stone.  
Jon: It's saying the same thing three times in a row. Three different ways.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. "Your right hand, O Lord, majestic in power." "Your right hand, O 
LORD, shattering the enemy." That's a good  example where you just said one 
thing. But "majestic in power" "shattering the enemy" are two very different 
things and you want to say both.  
Jon: I remember learning this. Instead of rhyming sounds, they rhyme concepts.  
Tim: Yeah. Then it gets you to pa ir or bounce off of each other two things that you 
wouldn't have thought. "Surging waters standing up like a wall" is paired with E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
10 "deep waters congealing like jello." And you think, "Oh, how the walls 
become..." You know, it ignites your imagination. Then you're thinking about 
these two walls made out of jello.  
Jon: Jellowy water.  
Tim: Okay, perfect. Perfect. This is from Lawrence Perrin it's one of the classic 
Western introductions to poetry called Sound and Sense. He says. "Poetry is 
the kind of language  that says more and says it more intensely than does 
ordinary language." It's not a not very technical description but I like it.  
 It says more and says it more intensely than normal language. So normal 
language says, the sea blows with the waters, they p arted into a wall.  
Jon: There's a wall in left and right.  
Tim: Yeah. You are saying more by calling the "surging waters standing up like a 
wall" "deep waters congealing." Just right there you're saying more and you're 
saying it more intensely. With the p airing of "standing up like a wall" and 
"jello congealing waters," now your imagination is set loose to create more 
meaning than any of those words would do by themselves.  
 That's what poetry does. It's a condensed form of language that uses and 
pairs new  images, metaphors, ideas, and then you, the reader are set free to 
go on your own experience now. It's participation. Just like stories force you 
to participate, poetry forces you to participate through your imagination and 
through your emotions.  
 So poe try has this main aim to affect how you feel and how you daydream, 
you could say. Its primary goal is not to communicate information. This is a 
big hang up, I think, especially more Western religious traditions have is 
because we think, again, of the Bible  as primarily moral instruction literature.  
 The fact that a third of it is poetry - and it shapes you and it affects how you 
think even morally - but its primary goal isn't to tell you what to do. Its goal is 
to set loose your imagination and make you fe el. 
Jon: This has reminded me of a poem actually. Have you heard of Billy Collins? 
He's poet.  
Tim: Talk to me.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
11 Jon: He's a very accessible poet. He's got this poem called "Introduction to 
poetry." I want to read it. He's an also an instructor.  
"I ask th em to take a poem  
and hold it up to the light  
like a color slide   
  
or press an ear against its hive.  
 
I say drop a mouse into a poem  
and watch him probe his way out,  
or walk inside the poem's room  
and feel the walls for a light switch.  
      
I want them to waterski  
across the surface of a poem  
waving at the author's name on the shore.  
    
But all they want to do  
is tie the poem to a chair with rope  
and torture a confession out of it.  
    
They begin beating it with a hose  
to find out wha t it really means.  
Tim: Wow, that's really good.  
Jon: Yeah, it's good. Huh?  
Tim: Whoa. What is that? Billy Collins?  
Jon: Billy Collins "Introduction to Poetry."  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
12 Tim: I'm just going to put that in for future lectures. That's awesome.  
Jon: His poems are amazing. It's like the only poetry I've ever read recently that I 
just get absorbed in it. His poems are great.   
Tim: Couple of things. I have two quotes down in the notes. One is, poetry is this a 
surprising form of language. This is from Thomas Long, wh o actually wrote a 
book called "Preaching from the Literary Forms of the Bible."  
 It's actually a whole book for pastors and teachers, helping giving you ideas 
for how you when you preach from the different kinds of literature from the 
Bible, you should p reach in a totally different way. Like you shouldn't actually 
preach or teach from a poem with the same approach as a narrative. Poem 
isn't trying to communicate information; so don't teach it the same way you 
would teach Romans...  
[crosstalk 00:20:35]  
Tim: Yeah, totally. He has this great line where he says, "Poetry works to disrupt the 
customary ways in which we use language. Poetry stretches the ordinary uses 
of words and places them into unfamiliar relationships with each other, 
thereby, cutting fres h paths across the well -worn grooves of everyday 
language." He just did it in this sentence. Then what you just read, the Billy 
Collins is exactly waterskiing across the poem.  
Jon: Put your ear up to the hive of the poem.  
Tim: Yeah, totally. It's that.  
Jon: That image is so intense to me because beehives are so — 
Tim: You would never do that.  
Jon: Yeah, you would never do that.  
Tim: They're like alive with frenetic dangerous energy. And he's saying that's what a 
good poem is.  
Jon: And to interact with t he poem you've got to put your ear up to it. Sticks with 
you.  
Tim: It's using language in surprising...The surging water stood up."  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
13 Jon: Surprising. Waters don't stand.  
Tim: Oceans don't congeal like jello, but in Exodus 15 they do. Just pause. I almost 
don't want to read the Encyclopedia Britannica definition because it's so 
sterile.  
Jon: It's so clinical.  
Tim: But it's interesting. Okay, I'll just read it. It's a long run on sentence. To me, it's 
actually so ironic that this is the definition of poetry. "It's a kind of literature 
that evokes a concentrated, imaginative awareness of one's experience or 
emotions by means of well -crafted language that is chosen for its meaning, 
sound and rhythm."  
Jon: That's not bad.  
Tim: No, it's not too bad. It's just a l ong, complicated sentence. There are three 
things. It evokes a concentrated, imaginative awareness. So concentrated — 
Jon: It does more with less.  
Tim: It does more with less and it's an imaginative awareness. You go inside your 
mind and start painting pic tures. What are you aware of in that concentrated 
imaginative way of your experience and your emotions? And how do poetry 
do that? Through well -crafted language that is chosen for its meaning, which 
is also true in narrative, and also true in a good essay,  but also for its sound 
and for its rhythm.  
 The sound and rhythm communicate things that are really intangible but they 
communicate things as the poem did there. The famous example of this is 
Lewis Carroll. I actually don't know that much about Lewis Car roll.  
Jon: Me neither.  
Tim: He was a British English author, writer. He wrote "Alice in Wonderland."  
Jon: Oh, okay.  
Tim: Then "Through the Looking Glass." But he wrote this famous poem called 
"Jabberwocky."  
Jon: Oh, yeah, Jabberwocky.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
14 Tim: And the "Hunt ing of the Snark."  
Jon: And he just uses this nonsense language, right?  
Tim: Yeah, yeah. The whole thing about Jabberwocky was using non -existing 
words.  
Jon: And the sounds carry the meaning?  
Tim: And the sounds carry the meaning and the rhythm of it. Thi s is the opening 
line.  
Twas brillig, and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:  
All mimsy were the borogoves,  
And the mome raths outgrabe.  
Jon: Wow. I pictured a meadow - kind of a dark meadow.  
Tim: That's the brillig. Oh, no. The wabe.  
Jon: The wabe?  
Tim: Yeah. And what's going on in the meadow?  
Jon: I mean, just like the wind's going through this maybe mist and just like — 
Tim: The slithy toves.  
Jon: There are these creatures in the meadow. It's kind of a swampy meadow.  
Tim: Yeah. It was all  mimsy. But then the mome raths outgrabe. It's the beginning 
of plot conflict something.  
Jon: It's amazing.  
Tim: It's complete nonsense, but it communicates through rhythm and sound.  
Jon: That's cool.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
15 Tim: Then, once you're using words that you do understand in freshman. There 
you go. There you go. That's poetry. Poetry is amazing and I don't read 
enough of it. I'm actually disciplined this year; I'm going to — 
Jon: Grab some Billy Collins.  
Tim: That's good. I was going purchase TS Eliot, "The Four L oves," which I've heard 
is one of the most bottomless modern poems.  
Jon: I should do that too.  
Tim: What's funny is that it's the easiest thing to not do before bed or something. 
It's like the last thing. Because it's not functional — 
Jon: And it's hard s ometimes - oftentimes.  
Tim: But I've found we've done a couple times recently where the last thing we do 
before turning out the light is reading a poem aloud.  
Jon: Oh, cool.  
Tim: I always go to bed with the full imagination.  
Jon: I've also wanted to memo rize poetry but never have.  
Tim: Seemed noble. You want to be the kind of person that memorizes poetry?  
Jon: Yeah. This is my ideal self is someone who has a lot of poems memorized. 
That's my ideal self.  
Tim: So let's stop and just maybe land the plane on this one, and just say, a third 
of the Bible is this kind of literature.  
Jon: That's crazy. One out of three sentences in the Bible. Or one out of three 
chapters.  
Tim: One of the three chapters in the Bible is not trying to communicate content 
or informa tion to you. It's rather trying to create an experience that shapes 
how you feel and how you think. That's remarkable to me.  
 The poems reflect on all kinds of concrete events sometimes. The book of 
Lamentation it's all about the fall of Jerusalem and — E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
16 Jon: What if a third of the sermons you heard were poetic sermons?  
Tim: Yeah. Very good question.  
Jon: That to me, going back to the son versus the knife. We like to use the knife as 
a tool. It's easier to handle and it's quick and it's decisive.  
Tim: It gets things done in very efficient way.  
Jon: If I want to change people's behavior, I grab my knife, and I say, "Here's what 
this means. Here's what you should do. Here's how you should change the 
way you think."  
Tim: And the scriptures are likened to a kn ife. Like in Hebrews, double -edged 
knife.  
Jon: You need that.  
Tim: You need that. That's right.  
[crosstalk 00:27:34]  
Jon: But then a third of the time you probably need to just sit in it and let it just 
put your ear up to the hive. What would that look like? I think most people 
would walk out of that Sunday service going like, "Well, that was weird."  
Tim: But that one part was really interesting.  
Jon: And yeah, but that sticks in you.  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: Okay. I think we landed the plane.  
Tim: Yeah, on t hat one.  
[00:28:20]  
Tim: The last part of the bookstore in our biblical bookstore video.  
Jon: The corner of the bookstore.  
Tim: The corner because it's only one quarter.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
17 Jon: It's only one quarter.  
Tim: One-quarter of it. 24% of the Bible is prose disco urse.  
Jon: To go back to the grocery store thing, that's where we should put the 
discourse in the back so you have to walk through the rest of the store. You 
come in for the discourse, but you have to walk through the poetry aisle to 
get there.   
Tim: That's actually kind of how the Bible is organized if you start on page 1 and if 
you start on page 1 of the New Testament. Anyway. So with prose discourse, 
that may not be a quiet prose. In American terminology - I don't know what is 
in British - prose discour se is not nonfiction. We call this nonfiction in our 
culture. It's not narrative. It's not literature. We call it. literature. It's not poetry. 
It's essays.  
Jon: And articles.  
Tim: Yeah. You feel like you're hearing someone give a speech, a little mini-speech 
or a little essay embodied form.  
Jon: It's the quickest way to convey information.  
Tim: Yeah. It has two main goals, typically. Usually, it's to get your listener to do 
something and you persuade them by a set of arguments or set of facts tha t 
you arrange as an argument to persuade them to do something.  
 Actually, that's a really important part is that even prose discourse, the main 
purpose isn't just to give you information. Still, it's to get you to do 
something, to persuade you that you ne ed to make certain kinds of choices. 
And it'll do that by engaging your intellect, engaging your reason, your 
rational capabilities. If this is the case and if this is the case, and because of 
that these things follow. And in light of all of this, therefor e, you should do X, 
Y, and Z.   
 That kind of staged sequential, linear process of thought and reasoning 
leading to rational outcomes and decisions, that's a very specific way that our 
brain works. Totally different than narrative and poetry. And a quarter  of the 
Bible is this kind of literature.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
18  In the Old Testament, the best example is the book of Deuteronomy, which is 
mostly Moses seeking to persuade the Israelites to be faithful to the 
covenant.  
Jon: It's one long lecture.  
Tim: Yeah, the whole book is set as one long lecture. Then the essays, there are 
laws within it and even little mini -narratives. But the biggest sections in the 
first half and the end are these kinds of discourse. "Remember this. That 
taught us this. From this, we know this is true . Therefore, do this." That kind of 
thing.  
 But Ecclesiastes is mostly this. Ecclesiastes has many embedded poems within 
it. Actually a lot. But the main framework, the way the philosopher thinks 
through things is very much "I saw this, and I conclude thi s. Therefore, I'm 
going to do this." And that kind of thing.  
 This literature is littered with logical connector terms, like, "and" "therefore," 
"but," "because," "so that." "as a result." That's actually how you learn how to 
follow it.  
 I remember when we took our introduction to reading the Bible from Ray 
Lubeck, actually, we did one semester on narrative and poetry - we studied 
the book of Jonah - and then we did one semester on prose discourse. And 
we did Ephesians.  
 And do you remember, one whole ex ercise was going through...? Well, I think 
I made a photocopy. Then I just highlighted in pink all of the logical 
connective words. "And," "But," "therefore."  
Jon: I don't remember.  
Tim: He had us do a paragraph. That's what we did. Actually, he had us do  a 
sentence diagramming exercise.  
Jon: I remember that. I remember the sentence diagram.  
Tim: And you diagram it, you shape the diagram, by means of the "ands" 
"therefores" you subordinate things, "because," "so that," "as a result." There 
you go.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
19  All of the New Testament letters are shaped by this kind of structure. 
However, embedded within them are poems. Paul's constantly embedding 
poems within.  
Jon: And stories sometimes.  
Tim: Yeah, little mini story sometimes too. This is really significant. Narr ative, I 
think, engages both hemispheres of the brain because you're seeking pattern 
and connection.  
Jon: Which is the right side.  
Tim: But also through your imagination. Poetry is mostly engaging your right brain 
in which is image, experience, emotion, f eeling sensory. Then discourse is 
mostly left brain, which is also about patterns like in narrative but in a more 
abstract way.  
Jon: It's connected to the logical and it's connected to language. All language is 
going through your left brain. So you can't read language without engaging 
your left brain. The whole to brain thing is very interesting. You know how 
people say, like, "I'm more left brain or more right brain?"  
Tim: Oh, that's not true. Everybody's using their whole brain.  
Jon: Everyone's using th e whole brain unless you've severed your - What is it 
called? Whatever. That thick cable of brain that connects your two 
hemispheres. If that's been severed, then you're in trouble. There's been a ton 
of interesting studies on people who have a suffered br ain. But everyone has 
that thick cable and so you can use both sides of your brain.  
 But it is true the hemispheres they have disciplines that they do it much 
better than. The language goes through your left hemisphere, but experience 
an emotion is more g enerated from your right hemisphere.  
Tim: I feel like you would know more about this than I do, about the unique — 
Jon: Cerebral cortex. That's it.  
Tim: Who was it? Was it Aristotle or Plato, who said, "What makes humans is that 
there's a reasoning animal" ? Humans uniquely are able to abstract things, 
ideas into this symbolic and then create whole hypothetical chains of cause 
and effect to try and illuminate a decision before me. "Do I take this? Do I eat E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
20 this berry? Do I not eat this berry? Or do I swim in  that lake or do I not?" 
Humans uniquely have this ability to create this elaborate cause -effect 
feedback loops.  
Jon: It doesn't seem like we know exactly how uniquely because we don't 
experience life like animals, or as CS Lewis wished animals wrote stor ies, so 
we could know.   
Tim: Maybe it's not a difference in kind, but maybe just some degree?  
Jon: Well, yeah, there's definitely a difference. It's like we have language the other 
animals don't have, which allows us to understand things in a much more 
abstract way and create more concepts. And then we have the ability to think 
about life as a story. So the past it can then inform how we think about now 
and the future, and then we can imagine futures and work towards futures.  
 Animals just don't do that.  Like a squirrel when it's burying a nut isn't thinking 
like, "Hey, next summer, or next winner, I'm going to be so glad I buried this 
nut." It actually just has this instinctual urge to bury the nut. And it doesn't 
know why. Most likely the case. I don't actually know. Never been a squirrel. 
That's unique...  
Tim: That's it. Something about humans to a degree that no other species on the 
planet does, we're able to abstract out cause -effect patterns in long chains to 
motivate behavior that makes no sense.  
Jon: And we're constantly telling ourselves stories of why things happened and 
creating meaning through the stories so that we can have motivation to 
continue. Animals just don't do that.  
 One really interesting thing I've been thinking about is, there's a certain kind 
of - what do they call it? Heuristics. There's a certain kind of heuristic. It's the 
sunk cost...I don't know what they call it. But it's kind of like the sunk cost 
heuristic, where it's like, if you've already put a bunch of energy into 
somet hing, you're now more committed to that thing. So even if now it's not 
going to work out, it's harder for you to abandon that project because you've 
put so much energy into it. It doesn't make sense logically — 
Tim: Oh, sure. It becomes utterly irrational w hy you'd keep doing that thing.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
21 Jon: But to us, we've attached so much meaning to all of our labor and we've told 
the story about why it's so important, we can't abandon it. And humans just 
do this all the time. Where like a dog won't do it.  
 Like if a d og's been sitting at a certain door waiting for days for the store to 
open for to get a treat, and he's just waiting and waiting and waiting and it 
never happens, and then the door opens like 10 feet away, a different door, 
the dog's not going to be like, "I'm just committed to this door, though."  
 The dog will never do that. It'll just go to the next other. "Oh, there's a treat 
over there." But humans will actually do that. They'll just sit there like, "No, I'm 
committed to this store." Why do we do that?  It's we're attaching all this 
meaning to it. This might be more about story than actually discourse at this 
point.  
Tim: Well, but there, I think the point is that we've abstracted the value of sitting at 
the door. It may be a bigger story about it, but th e point is we've turned the 
value into an idea that we use to motivate ourselves. I like the squirrel 
analogy too. On a basic level, we're impulse sensory creatures also, and so 
maximize pleasure, and minimize pain.  
Jon: The lizard brain.  
Tim: Yeah. But we will also deprive ourselves of pleasure for some long -term goal 
and will convince ourselves to do it based on an abstract set of reasoning.  
Jon: That is the difference between the lizard brain and the neocortex. All animals 
have a neocortex. Even like a mouse, it's like the size of a postage stamp. It's 
very thin, and it's a small covering of their brain, but it's that neocortex that 
allows them to observe the things have happened and then learn from it. A 
lizard can't do that. A lizard all instinctual.  
Tim: It's always in the moment impulse, you are saying?  
Jon: Yeah. It can't observe another lizard do something unique and go, "Oh, I 
should do that." A mouse can. A mouse can observe another mouse do 
something and go, "Oh, interesting. I should do that,"  and learn from 
experience. That's because of the neocortex. Then humans have this thing 
folded neocortex. We've got this massive one that's all over the brain.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
22 Tim: In terms of biblical literature, this is fascinating. Think of a letter like 
Ephesians, w hich was the first...it's what we studied when we were introduced 
how to study this type of literature. It's a great example of prose discourse 
that's designed to persuade through information and then change of 
behavior because it's cleanly broken into two  halves connected by the word 
"therefore" at the beginning of the second half in chapter 4.  
  The first half, actually it has a poem opening and closing it. It has a lot of 
storytelling within it, but basically telling the story of Israel as the covenant 
people, and then how through the Messiah, Gentiles, non -Jews are now 
included in the covenant Family of God, and he's brought eternal life, and he's 
defeated evil, and he's created a new family. That's more story driven, but he 
has full of there for us.  
 But then chapter 4, it says, "Therefore." And then he gets pretty abstract. He 
starts talking about "keep your unity." He's writing to a multi -ethnic 
community. Think of impulse behavior, like attracts like. It's a very strong 
behavior. And ethnic groups ke ep kind of high boundaries around 
themselves. And then the Greco Roman world of Paul's day, it's a very multi -
ethnic world.  
Jon: Your lizard brain will tell you not to trust people that aren't like you.  
Tim: Don't trust people that aren't like you. What Pa ul was able to accomplish was 
communities that intentionally remove the barrier as he talked about in 
chapter two, remove the ethnic barrier to realize their common humanity in 
the Messiah. That they are actually one new humanity made up of all kinds of 
different people.  
 So he starts saying, "Listen, we have one faith, one Lord, one baptism, one 
God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." Sounds like 
Holy Spirit language. One spirit. Then just on the basis of those ideas, he was 
able to create communities of people who chose to override one of the most 
basic human impulses, which is to withdraw from people who aren't like you. 
Such a powerful example. It's like eating. Such a powerful impulse.  
 Humans are able to override...  
Jon: With rationality.  E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
23 Tim: ...by means of rational chains of thought to override our basic bodily or our 
most basic impulses. And that's the power of this literature is it gets you to 
think in new ways to accomplish change on a fundamental level in the lives of  
the people who read this. That's all what Paul's letters are designed. All these 
letters in the New Testament engage your brain to invite you to do a new 
story turned into a set of ideas that you then turn to motivated whole 
different course of action. Th at too is a quarter of the Bible literature.  
 It's very much in the first century. It's no joke that most of it is in the New 
Testament letters. Those letters are influenced by conventions of Greek and 
Roman letter writing, Greek and Roman argument and philosophy.  
 Here's the interesting exercise. Paul grew up in Tarsus and so people have 
tried to reconstruct what his education would have been like because as an 
educated Jewish man, cosmopolitan, Tarsus. Man, you go through it and you 
read some of the classic educational texts that people were raised on and you 
feel like...so there's one in Seneca.  
Jon: He would have been reading Seneca?  
Tim: Correct. Seneca, Tacitus. No. Was he later? I forget. There's a set of my 
Amazon wish list. It's about four book s. The first time I read this it was 
reading a section of Seneca and I felt like I was reading the letter to the 
Romans. The idioms, the manner of speech and "What should we say then? In 
light of this, tell me this. Do you say this? I tell you this. But if  that is so how 
can this be?" You feel like, "Oh, that's how Paul writes."  
 Then you realize like, "Oh my gosh, where did he learn how to write? He went 
to school." And how did you learn back then? You just immerse yourself in 
the educational classics.  
  That's a good example where the writing didactic reasoning style of prose 
discourse of the New Testament is very much this melting pot of Jewish 
biblical culture and imagination merged with the Greek philosophical 
tradition.  
Jon: Interesting.  
Tim: Yeah, it's really cool. Anyway, all that say this literature makes you think and 
makes you think in deeper ways than you probably would normally. And E2 - Poetry, Narrative &  Prose Discourse  
24 that's his goal is to engage your brain so that you'll make new different kinds 
of choices.
