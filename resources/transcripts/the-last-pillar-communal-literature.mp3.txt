how amazing is it that we have direct access to the Bible God's Own word in my own lap I mean you can own a dozen different translations if you want you can read them whenever you want I grew up in a spiritual tradition that marveled at this and we encouraged each other to read the Bible everyday on our own we called it our quiet time just you and God's word this can be a beautiful discipline but for most of the Bible's existence it wasn't experienced this way for fifteen hundred years the most followers of Jesus heard the Bible read aloud in group settings what that means is that the puzzles and scripture and there are loaded onto every page we're always part of a communal invitation to go connect to other people in the community so that we can discuss it for the last few months we've been going
 do a series called Paradise series what kind of literature is the Bible today we look at the final pillar of the paridon him that the Bible is communal literature written in design for a community to experience together the idea of the quiet time and you got in your Bible one-on-one is it cultural product of our setting does mean it's bad but it means there are other ways that people have engaged the Bible and maybe they're our strength to those other ways that are cultural setting that mean missing out on we need each other we need to be able to see beyond our own Arrow prospectus we need the entire community of Jesus to understand God's word is about social location my readings of the Bible will be influenced by my own background mcneely's background and will miss certain things and we'll probably over and precise other things in the store thumb but the moment you compare me and my groups reading to another group's reading then
 can happen then multiply that by the global Jesus movement in you've got some potential I'm done calling this is Bible project podcast today I'll talk with Tim Mackie Chris a Quinn and we're to look at the final pillar of the Paradigm we look at the beautiful gift of reading the Bible in community and suggest that it is in fact the way it is designed to be read thanks for joining us.
okay we are here going to land in the plane final series on for calling the Paradigm series which is what is the Paradigm the the way that we should be thinking about how to read the Bible and so we've been walking through this slowly point-by-point and we've done six out of seven right now I'm packing a short little statement that we use around the Bible project we want to help people experience the Bible as unified story that leads to Jesus Carissa what could such a thing mean
 it means seven days in Divine written as a collaboration between human partners with God and each of these points we've noticed feeds into the next so this one the next one is Unified literature that it is a coherent piece of work from beginning to end even though it has many authors literary Styles and themes the Bible at the old house one story about God's Rescue of humans to be his Partners in ruling the world that relates to me to the human and divine peace and that these are Spirit inspired authors editors organizers and when we read the story at least to me it's very compelling when I see how coherent the story is that there's got Spirit working behind it this story has to do with the Messiah so the third point is that it's Messianic literature that this story of God's Rescue of humans comes through the anointed one the machine and all of the themes
 throughout the Hebrew Bible come to 5th Element in Jesus and the New Testament so that's a huge part of what we draw and all of our videos here and all of what we work on is that this is a story that's pointing to Jesus in his first three kind of have in common they're all about the Divine human partnership the Bible's a product of that partnership unified by people got hit by the spirit to bring coherence immunity to it and it's all about one story that is about the partnership between the story is about a particular yeah Jesus is the the perfect partner 3 without really knowing that we kind of discovered their kind of a personal Triad yeah it kind of each other or bring your organization to the organization you're thinking like a Revival it's a story but it's not written in the form of a story as we might describe the story so
 yeah so this fourth point is that it's artistic meditation literature its ancient Jewish literature it's are typically designed so there is a narrative thread there is a story being told but more artistic than that so we have it's designed to interpret itself but I feel like we didn't talk about that as much as it's designed to be read and reread and that that's how we see the patterns within the story and how the story links back to itself which part is illuminated by the overall story while at the same time each of the visual part contributes in some way to that overall store Lake Forest trees back and forth It's like you have your drone you're sitting in the forest but you're constantly sending the Drone up while you were staring at the trees but you're looking at your drone camera to see the whole forest and it just constant back-and-forth talk about it will you just using a drone recently I saw one of the other day and it was a guy standing in a bunch of trees and doing what I was saying your watch
 damn and you can't you talk to yourself. Like read me everybody in the stipend as well so it's it's not just a narrative story it's the Bible of the whole is wisdom literature so it's a story written in the form of wisdom literature has diverse literary style that reveal God's wisdom and invite us into this journey of character Transformations so wisdom isn't just about cognitive learning it's about a whole person and how to be human and so did to the same theme of human and divine wisdom and how do you get that wisdom you meditate on Ventura day and night and sinks into meditation there which leads us to the last one we did contextually rooted literature so the Bible was written in another time and culture and we need to honor that
 ancient historical context as we come to understand it better so that both has to do with the words that are being used and understanding those and then the actual culture the Bible was written into and just having a lens for or I guess understanding that the authors lenses are different than our own that's the starting point and then as much understanding as we can have about what their lenses were is super helpful for understanding the meaning of the text her language and the culture just real quick cuz I'm looking at the list contextually rooted literature all the other ones are a little more simply word it be all right we could name this perspective contextual literature but is that something about routed that kind of like metaphorically cuz it's like rooted in a context here and that's the kind of little charges but that's what contextual literature means but isn't all literature contextual literature tall cans from a particular context so I'm just wondering do we need contextually Roo. Or should we just were dead we simplify literature but
 the reason that sounds a little more like sterile uninteresting as opposed to actually wrote it I just wanted to put that out there and contextual we really mean it's ancient Jewish yeah that's right that's a specific context I wonder why me and it's rooted in an ancient contacts ancient literature ancient letter because it's got some more because it's ancient literature that automatically makes me understand that it's not modern and I need to get out of my mind setting trying a different one context context us an idea comes along with ancient yeah but you also get a bunch of other things we also changed ancient Jewish meditation literature to just meditation yes.
 the last pillar the Seven Pillars of our Paradigm of the Bible is that as communal literature yes the Bible was designed to be read and study to within a community that is learning to live within its story this one feels like to me like interesting but is it truly a pillar is it truly like you really have to get this about the Bible or you're going to be left a little flat foot yeah it's interesting I I do I think it's actually crucially important yes I think it's really important for all the reasons that were about to talk about. We did make a video on this by the way a book reading of scripture video cuz it's not about the United storyline of the Bible which is most of our team videos but it's a video about the history of how the Bible has been read through history history also begins within the Bible itself which is what we look at now here is the endgame at least in the traditions of Christian culture where I first came to face and was learning
 means to follow Jesus the ideal way to engage the Bible with the assumed ideal way to gauge the Bible is by yourself in the quiet. Usually in the morning to ya on the couch on the couch Journal quiet time throughout most of church history the ability for all individuals to have their own Bible is itself the only product of the last five hundred years since the printing press and for the majority church history people heard their Bibles or saw their Bibles displayed graphically in the churches and so it's good for us to step back and say oh okay so the idea of the quiet time and you got in your Bible one-on-one is it cultural product of our setting does mean as bad but it means there are other ways that people have engaged the Bible and maybe is there are two strengths to those other way
 our culture settings I can missing out on yeah so there's that practice of engaging the Bible communally but also this relates a lot to the last point that ancient literature point that it was written into a communal setting so I was away is that we interpreted we need to put on the communal lens to understand it better is the assumed or ideal posture of engaging the Bible that's two pigs by the biblical authors themselves and that might give us interesting clue as to to some additional ways may be that our two cats for Halloween Gates the Bible need to become more diverse as opposed to like we did it this way that's wrong so now the new way there are many ways and I think we would all stand to benefit from learning additional ways in addition to reading it for yourself so short history of the first mentioning of the writing of the Bible with in the Bible
 read in the Bible when do you first come across a story about that section of the Bible being written Brothers movie know it was Nicolas Cage in the movie adaptation out of it was a movie and if you watch it you realize you're watching a movie that's about the Genesis of the writing of the movie that you're watching and then it gets real mad I could you start bending dimensions of viewer I'll never forget it cuz a certain moments he starts it's a movie in your like all this we watching a movie and character and then he starts realizing he's riding a movie that he is within Charlie Charlie, what is what it feels like something's going brothers would do bend your view of everything anyway
 so in Exodus chapter 17 Israelites went through the waters Pharaoh was destroyed in the waters they walked through on dry land and the water to the right and the left to go out into the Wilderness and in the teens I just remember this in the teams of Exodus there in the wilderness and an extra 17 there in a place called Richard Dean and some ancient relatives these are descendants of Jacob's brother Esau they're called the amalekites they live in that southern desert and they pounced on an attack this band of escaped slaves wandering through the desert with very little food and water tough time to be alive you know the animals women children try I've been you're hurting for water and food yourself for I like to look at these people that means human so dangerous is the story about Moses listing
 so he goes up on one of the gels he sent out Joshua and another guy battle to fight them as long as Moses's about Joshua and but I remember the first story where Joshua Pierce actually said it's all of a sudden you just are. Joshua is a date or something Hollywood narrative any time you introduced the character yes in the Bible and I love it. Joshua and they're doing okay but you know they're losing and samosas goes up on him and he spreads out his hands with the staff that he's part of the waters and he said that old Pharaoh it down a rock yeah yeah totally and his hands are supported by two companions and they win the battle and so right when they win the battle Exodus 17 verse 14
 lord said to Moses write this on a skull as something to be remembered and make sure the Joshua here is it because I will completely blocked out the name of I'm Alexa from under and Joshua you know will be the one to go back after Moses died and then continue the conquest of the land of Canaan so this wise come by there but this the first mentioning of writing in straight lines Bible and you brought up the story before to me were talking about the history of the making of the Bible this is the first mention of rain again in the family and this is a bit of a rabbit hole but you also turn me on to the idea that writing in general was a new phenomena in human history there was like the alphabet alphabetical order alphabetical writing there was like hieroglyphic writing and whatever they called back to graph pictograph where that thousands of years before the alphabet they would that but you got to be a pretty Elite kind of scribe person
 to be able to use that type of rice is hundreds upon hundreds of symbols thousands thousands of symbols he had to memorize each symbol represented an idea or concept of human history as Moses would have existed what does he know debatable when that was is when the first kind of Proto alphabet was being developed by semites in the Sinai Peninsula so fascinating the early history of the alphabet and older reference work but it's still kind of the standard there's been new discovery since then
 but the basic features of what we know where the same just a 22 226 simple set representing ideas for words but sound sounds and once you do that then you can make the symbol set really short so what human mouth can only makes me sound so what likely happened was that of Semitic people who knew the Egyptian hieroglyphics system like realized oh well if we just take like 20 of these yeah and turn them into our sounds so now that symbol doesn't represent a word sound using they were adapting those symbols and they can create the first photo alphabet and that was somewhere in the 18th 17th century in Northern Egypt's Sinai Peninsula are the first alphabetic subscriptions found the democratization
 the potential the potential for widespread rioting among the non-experts non-elites and so the fact that Moses could write something down that just happened on a scroll in that process is in full swing yeah that's time he missed me when it would have happened of the Bible being designed to be read and studied within a community or that the first the first instance of writing is in a communal setting what do you mean by that explicitly seven chapters later but this first one is about a communal event remembrance but a deadly for communal memory cuz they were all rescued that day so the Spurs mentioning of the writing of the Bible with in the Bible is about a communal event
 you write a text to keep it in communal memory that the Lord save us from our enemies and that foundational to who we are we are rescued people and we can never forget that and that's riding is a way of keeping it in communal number for sure even the fact that not every person could read it this time and they didn't have personal Bibles not everybody on this personal account from Exodus referred to means it was transmitted orally to Big groups of people or within the household the parents would tell the kids and pass on these memories that's your time you know it's literature has a super important in other words the Advent of writing alphabetical riding didn't replace the main way that a people's history was shaped memorized and passed on that was happening orally it's all kinds of mechanisms for thousands of years and writing comes along as another
 Aid in the oral transmission is a work in Tandem and there will come later a certain point where oral history will become overshadowed by written history about that that's not what we're at this point so the writing isn't it cuz you're at cuz not everybody would have the scroll through because like what more like the deposit verifies the oral aural Horror Story music for passing down through the generations skip then it made it into the scroll of detritus
a few chapters later we get the second writing of the Bible in this it develops this whole thing we were talking about even more this if they come to the store to Mount Sinai there's a storm up on the mountain The God Who rescued them and Moses goes up into the storm and there he meets with God and here's got a dress him and threw him all the people about the terms of this Covenant relationship the storm wants to marry his people The Ten Commandments and what the people here is a storm but that's the voice of God speaking to them they're freaked out and then in the narrative The Ten Commandments and then 42 Covenant terms that come after that Moses comes down the mountain chapter 24 of Exodus Moses came and he recounted to the people all the words of the Lord all the ordinances laws of the Covenant in the people answered with one voice saying everything
 the Lord has spoken we're going to do it and we Snicker to ourselves cuz we know that's exactly not what they're going to do so Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord's is the second time that writing is mentioned in the Bible and those are the Covenant in the narrative it refers to the words that he heard up on the mountain which is The Ten Commandments and then 42 commands after that and we have all those and Willie's we have a selection but the 10 in the 42 are a selection of what Moses heard this is an example of potentially of Moses writing down a bigger list of which then only a selection got into the author then selected to represent in the narrative in the fact that it's 10:00 which is the same number of times that God spoke in Genesis one number of plagues that all begin was Moses delivering the word of the lord it's the same number of times that God will speak to Institute the sacrificial offerings and Leviticus
 right so I forgot speaking 10 times and then the second set of commands is 40 to 6 * 7 which is a whole other thing we won't go down the point is it's a selection so in this case it's very much a communal Moses comes down he reads the words aloud writes them down and it's very similar and the people say we're going to do it so it's a communal event to hear the words they get written and then they get deposited the Scrolls going to get deposited in this sacred box called ark of the covenant and it's going to be there at the testimony Anna as a witness at the end of the Torah in Deuteronomy 31 Moses that commands the next generation of Israel to say when you go into the land at the end of every seven years in the fall when you all go live in tents for a week to celebrate the Feast of booze to remember that you lived in tents in the wilderness coat once every seven years
 in the Feast of Sukkot all Israel's to come before the Lord your God of the place he'll choose and read the Torah loud for all the people every seven years it's like a tour of tests and whatever form the tour had at that point where we kind of have cloots but really where are we at in did the end of the tour of the talking about reading the thing that has what rating is like that movie but two chapters later or three chapters late are you going to read a story about how Moses died and he was buried and no one knows to this day where he's buried Drive Moses didn't write that Moses wasn't reading that allowed so in other words the form of the tour that we have it is a later organization and presentation of an earlier form of the Torah earlier form of the Torah but the odds are clearly wants to see a connection between those two so Moses commanding Israelites to read a Proto Torah is for the reader a request to read the Torah
 places it would be a communal reading aloud in front of the whole Community how long would that take? 20/20 hours at three and a half hours hours maybe solid day you guys remember at Multnomah ever doing Bible marathons at dr. G's house did you ever get any more people gather and you don't you don't talk about it you don't discuss it everybody reads a chapter at a time. Maybe you trace a theme through but similar to what this is except we're reading instead of 1 L reading it out loud yeah I think about this it's it's interesting to think about how people are hearing the Torah and in that moment within their
 they're they're probably responding to that I think usually for me I think of reading meditating reflecting on scripture is a private thing that maybe I taken as an individual but even a communal response is interesting to think about here that if it was a sad story the community would be sad together if it was a beautiful story they'd be joyful together in the same thing to think about important important things to think about I think that's part of what we're Discerning here is that the communal experience of our common story is a really different kind of experience than a private reading of what you know you might think of somebody else's story okay yeah so let's will come back around to these teams here and Israeli scholar Jeffrey T gay or is it Jus Scholars think he lives in the US actually Jeffrey TJ has a excellent commentary on Deuteronomy I'll just buy the Jewish publication Society he says this about what we just read Deuteronomy 31 he says the
 form of publication in the ancient world was oral presentation the written facilitated the oral presentation which is like the release event I got a book release it would be handing out copies of the book releases reading aloud here and then you have one copy the tablets of the decalogue Ten Commandments in the ark he reads the scroll of the Covenant to the people which is the whole lock code what will you just read the scroll of the Covenant is what Moses heard up on them out. And came down and wrote down the hole so it's the hall the loss the first round of applause first round at Mount Sinai but notice today goes on Moses made no arrangements for people to study these texts or the records of the Israelite victories like the rescue from on black even though he says the teaching is to be written on the doorpost of homes on citygate sore on the stone
 I thought male ball he doesn't have copies made and Papyrus for convenience study the written copy made in Deuteronomy 31 which is what we just read is to be stored and taken out every seven years to be read all of the people all of this points to the fact that even in Deuteronomy the dissemination of the Torah remains primarily oral with teachers either reciting it from memory or reading aloud from the written text in the first temple. Of Solomon's Temple the written texts of scripture was primarily for preservation copying verification memorization and then for reading to others and is that likely just because it was really expensive and rare to have hand produce a scroll of the whole Torah the material the time it just crept it just wasn't feasible to create more copies for people to see how to correct this has huge implications for
 we're going to start talking about next which is how the Bible is organized into bundles of material and literary movements no part of the oral the oral nature of its prime for memorization is designed for memorization and patterning and repetition is a key part of that it will see these memory devices in the text it's Ross and be able to look for them because we know it was orally transmitted through oral presentation for memorizing residing in group settings that's the natives setting of biblical literature we just have to stop and let really different than how modern M encounter these texts and does me how we encounter them bad but it seems like we should take that difference on board and maybe an adapt or add some other practices than just reading Alone by yourself
 okay so we made a video on this way we won't go through all the story is but this practice of this public reading of the growing collection of sacred text the come from Moses and the prophets this is mentioned throughout the story of this realm Old Testament Joshua. Joshua chapter eight happens in King Josiah's day there's an important story in Ezra Nehemiah where they do exactly what Moses says they get all the people out to the Sea susuko they're living in lotensin they threw a long look at this is Jeffrey TJ again and this is rad quote and I think we read this a few couple years ago but it Bears repeating again John a few minutes ago you talk about how the alphabet democratized the ability to read and what is going to draw attention to hear is this public reading of the Sacred literature of the people group this was that actually unique in the ancient world if a group of people had a sacred literature this preserved by the priests and safeguarded in these sacred spaces you
 play that means it's inaccessible to the many but back in Deuteronomy 31 Moses's wife assemble the people the men that women the children's the immigrants everyone everyone gets to hear and they see us up there it's not for the Elite Four everyone the ones who have the inside or knowledge it's for all the people cuz the whole people is called to be at the Kingdom of priests that's cool and so yet he calls us that the Democratic character of biblical religion by Democratic like the marker ties and Democratic means available to all are accessible to people that's what he may be modest means what is the Greek word for like a gathering of people and then caught us is power strength power to the people
 how to democratize something is to take it from the hands of the few usually govern and to put it in the hands of the day Mom so this is cool sites another Jewish scholar Elias dickerman who was summarizing a bunch of archaeological finds from a city up in Syria Caldera erupt us and forget their from the early centuries a day but he's just using it as an example to describe this unique character of Jewish biblical text reading and how sacred texts were public not private and so in the same city there's both the Jewish synagogue with all these cool paintings around it and there is a temple that was used to gather this really secretive Elite specially called called the Mithra was Mithra cult I don't know if you've heard about this before that Wikipedia is interesting I forget what Pantheon Miss Ross belong to but it was this really secretive cult
 I guess it would be kind of like I don't think of some call today that's like some really isolated socially isolated group that has secret of practices in that day you know the animal sacrifices and so on but anyhow he contrast two paintings found in these two buildings one is a temple to the god Miss Ross and one is in the Jewish synagogue and so in one painting it's a three priests wear Amy super specialized fancy Priestly carbs and in the in the hand of the mystery of priest is a closed scroll listen to contains the rituals and magic spells and the things you would memorize if you were part of this cult even has postures really closed down the street is a picture of a Jewish man reading aloud the Scrolls of the Torah it's an open scroll and then I guess I would try to find Google images of this
 it's big Fresco but there's women and children and the people of the synagogue gathered around and so vickerman wrote an essay about how these two images depict the different approaches to connecting people to the sacred and you know Greek and Roman religion vs Jewish communities in Jewish communities the scroll is open the word that connects God's people to do the story of what got to do an arm it's an open scroll available to the many where as in most Greek and Roman religious communities at that day it was available to the few Scrolls were available to the field I just think that's a cool contrast physical to meditate on the Bible originated in a community written by an individual but it's always about the communal store for the community to be red and processed and experienced by the whole
 just pondering this public communal nature of the biblical story that's more for all the people this communal nature of biblical literature isn't just limited to the Hebrew Bible there's a story about Jesus doing a public reading of the scroll of Isaiah when he goes to Nazareth look for when Paul and Barnabas or cruising around trying to spread the good news about your shoe at Asia Jesus the Messiah they go to synagogue in sitting Antioch and you know the tour in the profits being read aloud something to say about today's Torah reading so that's stories about the communal reading scripture when Paul started writing letters
 to local communities of the Messiah he says in multiple letters to different cities and different audiences like I read the letter aloud and make sense one letter would arrive for it but in Colossians this thing so he says to the followers of Jesus and kielbasa hey when this letter is after it's been read to y'all make sure you send a copy of it down the road to the layout is here cuz I want to see that and you should read the letter that I wrote to them even though it's different audiences he assumes that there will be important to hear what Paul said to those followers of Jesus down the road and vice versa and the letter to the receipt might be it could be a last letter could be the last letter could be what we call the letter to the Ephesians so one one way or one reason why we would say an important way to engage the Bible in group settings hearing it allowed is because it's native to how the Bible came into existence
 and it's the texts were designed for that type of is that doesn't mean you can't read them by yourself it just means that's probably not the only way that we should do it if we really want to get in touch with what they're about that's one piece to process I think there's another layer of importance in our cultural setting we can talk about the I think first is good just to ponder that make a point to make a point is this is how the Bible has been read your rights history of development and there's something powerful about that coming together hearing it now we have the ability to all owner on copies of the Bible which is because largely because of Penny press if it was before the printing press we might be able to own a copy but that would be a really expensive to produce so I'd have to be pretty wealthy to own that are cheap like they printed like this is really thin paper like you find them in like the pews
 I mean that's a good example of the democratization of of scripture like following this line of at least democratizing it for everybody that the fact you can find in America you can find the Bible in the drawer of like a hotel room is a continuation of the process to begin was Moses having the open scroll before all the people from now and I don't want to use this one today I want to use that one luxury are all available on your phone free YouVersion Bible app they've got all the translations so because of that there's a I suppose like a gravity towards so then I can just read this by myself and so it's good to remember that is unique to this time in human history
 throughout all of human history that's not how this text has been engaged with even if we do read it by ourselves which is good and we should do that too it was written in a communal context in the sense that it was meant for oral reading so the way we read it if I were going to study it by myself I should be looking for memory devices in it which really means like how did the author structure this text so that I could remember what comes after each thing you know so repetition or patterns starting new units the same way things like that are all these memory devices so it ain't even just be aware of that as an individual reader is one of the implications of this is Camino in fact this is like something is really important and my own pastoral experience but I think the reply-all the three of us from our own personal experience as individuals and then and then church
 cuz I think this has huge implications for how we think about the Enterprise of interpreting and understanding the Bible so stop and think for fifteen hundred years most followers of Jesus heard the Bible read aloud in group settings what that means is that the moment somebody would hear something and be like what I don't get that you like turned in the other person and you like what does that mean and they would be like I don't know if that means let's go talk to the priest let's go talk to the pastor to another words the puzzles and scripture and there are loaded onto every page we're always part of a communal invitation to go connect to other people in the community so that we can discuss it and debate about it and so on and that process is short-circuited if the main language the Bible is reading it alone by myself and that's what Bible studies are in modern Rome but even then it's different Bible study will be maybe one person true and they've already done this preparation and
 sifting and they come and they sell and they only read certain selection the public reading of scripture I can get together and let's let's read through the entire Scroll of Deuteronomy we're going to read Matthew allowed over the next four Friday nights at 7 so I will be over the course in the Sunday Gatherings Gatherings over the course of two to three years you hear all the gospels read aloud the whole book of Psalms and the tour in the profits on alternating and so the whole point is that you're in a group setting where you have a community of interpretation it's not a solo project and that itself is important I think that the has other applications through were talking about but think about how different experience that would be if you were never alone in your puzzles about the Bible you always had a group to turn to cuz the only way you are
 just because you heard it when you were with your the authors or the Bible is intended to be interpreted within the Spirit-filled Community not just today but the community of God's people throughout history have have interpreted the Bible so we can listen to all of those vices we can listen to and collaborate with the people around us as we read I mean the Spirit-filled Community is large Global and it crosses all span of time somebody in the medieval. Medieval Europe was you know part of the church they would hear the scriptures read aloud have a question and they go you know ask other people but what if everybody in your local Church community has the same social location the same demographic the same background and you're all going to be like when we don't know what that means you do like everybody's going to go around the circle and so at some point you're going to need somebody with different background
 experience and they're going to be like a man well in my church tradition we thought about that part a lot and here we get in with exactly what you're saying the whole community of Jesus followers throughout history is the largest communal setting for reading the scriptures and the kind of goes in concentric circles then we need every layer that Community to inform are reading this is why for me it deserves to be one of the pillars of the Paradigm has to be a pillar because because the scriptures came into existence within a communal setting to be read aloud to community and especially as groups of Jesus followers are more culturally distant from the ancient context of the Bible we are going to need more and more different kinds of communities to gain a fuller vision and understanding and it is about social location my readings of the Bible will be influenced by my own background
 my community came back around and we'll miss certain things and we'll probably over into the eyes of things and distort some but the moment you compare my group me and my groups reading to another group's reading then real girls can happen then multiply that by the global Jesus movement and you've got some potential crowdsourced everything about you so that's why I think it deserves to be a I appreciate you made that point Chrissa cuz it we needed the community from all times and all places called reception history or you maybe look at a passage of scripture and then you ask the question how people interpret it it throughout all time in the Bible itself and then in early Jewish interpretation into our modern world and globally and that can be really helpful for just trying on different lenses because our lens for reading scripture isn't the best Len
 yeah and doing that can take us out of our egocentric View
what would the time I paradigms we all have a certain Paradigm which which we come to Everything clean the Bible we're trying to say look here's seven Great paradigms to try to read aren't you too what the Bible is but even if we do that really well we still have our own Paradise I live in Portland I grew up in the west I was born in the 80s like I have my stuff and I can't like get above that but other people are not within that Paradigm it so they can see things that I can't see so together we can kind of been Unearthed and figure out what is really going on I threw a curveball into this as we land the plane course I love it what do you think about the perspective of artificial intelligence as it comes to part of the community of reading we're on the edge of a know if you're falling with liquid happens with a GPT 3 which is just I don't know what that means
 like it's an algorithm is really good at language so I can write articles that sound human you can like write songs that sound like it's just really good human language and it keeps getting better and better and so basically it can look at human language and understand it does it understand it or is it the result of a bunch of algorithms created by people and people understand and then they write out a process the mirror is human understanding and then the algorithms replicate let me know though it's as good as the scale Ryan will it be something like this could take in information at a scale that human brain couldn't or could only do it slowly I will say it yes it does it understand it not in the way that humans understand things but in a way that a computer can understand that mimics the way that humans are not dead enough that we're now getting fooled of like was that written by a huge
 or for example text-to-speech you know like a Siri that always sounds a little clunky right it's because it doesn't understand what it's reading so it doesn't know where to emphasize in a sentence well now it does there's a I text to speech it understands enough and whatever we mean by I understand it actually sounds very human because it's exciting things in the right way it's to contacts can process millions of examples of people pronouncing and emphasizing and then create like right as this technology at these algorithms get sophisticated enough they're going to be unearthing things that humans just might mess should and is that part of the thing about the literary Geniuses who produces literature that had it all in their head in a way that probably no other people will ever have it and all in their heads that maybe some
 my grandpa is today so yeah it's a GPT 3 when you're coming across me. Give me all the instances where the word right occurs in the Hebrew Bible you don't need you to schedule a but what if you could do it orally where can I buy a reading NFL but give me all the ones that seems significant to the hospital I'm totally into this significant up links so you can say like hey where are all of the occurrences of the author most likely intended this to be connected right now and they're like oh well we knew about these ten but this one that's interesting is that something can you connect to lens and we're all working together to try to find you know the ancient context the literary structure and the wisdom within is there a play
 for the algorithms we create a part of that Community I mean I think that's like asking are all the disciplines welcome to approach the Bible through their lens to science and maths and the literary studies you know I think there are valuable things we can learn from a protein the Bible through these different fields bring your waiting for the day when there's a cyborg next to you or the pastor and worship the gp3 website will not let me tell you what you're saying is helpful and what kind of Bible Software everyday using that concordance using the reference tools actually have a little Windows setup where I can type in a verse in a while access all my commentaries exactly to the digital page there where that verse
 talked about but then I have a history of interpretation thing where little anytime that versus been discussed by early Christian scholars in early Christian literature little line those all up for me and this is reading Community cuz everything with all this communal later as far as reading the Bible today if somebody's approaching the Bible as communal literature what does that look like for the average reader what do they gain from feeling it that way that's right and you could say that it's impossible not to read the Bible this way right but no one grew up on an island just reading the Bible give me the reader translation is to be reading and community community has you've never met we're all coming from our own bubble and so when we sit down and read alone all of that is there are still kind of reading a community but this is about really embracing that and going wide also I think responding and Camille
 Eddie is a big deal so being able to say to my group of people hey I was reading this and it really impacted me in this way this is how it relates to my life I think that that is important you know cuz I'm not just interpretation that's also Community response a really great book about introduction to the Bible by scholar Michael Gorman he's a new testament scholar but he just edited it called the global ecumenical introduction to the Bible and it's literally it's an introduction to how different Christian communities around the world read and understand the story of the Bible so there's chapters on African understanding some of the biblical story African-American Asian Latino and everything in between so it's this is a great way to introduce yourself to the global Christian Community that has been reading Bible for long-time tools like this outstanding cuz they just help you see
 your blind spots on your own setting and Community but also introduce you to the body of the Messiah around the world that we're all trying to do the same thing so it's a great way to erase the Bible as communal
that was that we did it all seven pillars that make up the Paradigm how to read the Bible let's review them really quick as we landed plane here also take note the fact that we called him pillars yeah
 we decided that that's what we're calling them in the course of the conversation so yeah if you listen to the beginning of the conversation we're calling all sorts of things and at some point we just have zeroed in on pillars so we began with the scriptures are Divine and human that is the product of a human and divine partnership that produced this collection of scripture writing the second one was that this is a unified collection so there's a story being told about God's Rescue of humanity and the third one goes right alongside this it said it's Messianic literature so the story is about a messiah and anointed one to come we are unified with the Divine human partnership theme the scriptures are divine-human it's a unified story about a Divine human partnership that leads to a Divine human
 we're together first three John what's the fourth time meditation literature your favorite ancient Jewish meditation literature how the Bible is design and highly structured and it interprets itself and it asks for a lifetime of reading and rereading meditation more in the is this the fifth pillar about how the Bible is ancient literature so it's rooted in the historical context and is written within that context so has conventions that are different than our own and written in a different language with different terminology that carry different meaning so just being aware of all of that as a Rida super helpful and then $6 for that reason it is all ancient literature rooted in ancient contacts written in ancient languages can transcend that ancient context and speak to anybody any
 and that's the $6 has a paradigm that is wisdom literature its literature that's designed to reveal God's wisdom and then to shape and form human character and communities to live a certain way in the world in light of the implications of the story wisdom and then the last time we talked about is that the Bible is communal literature it is written for a community of God's people meant to be read or interpreted in a community has implications for the community. So we ended with the number seven is a really important unifying principle in the store has 25 we didn't start with 747 something just happened is locked in 27 number means full or complete spelled with the same letters of the Hebrew word completeness I love it there could be no more
 that was a really rewarding series and thank you Tim and crisa and organ the next is an interview with our friend Arthur and Pastor Dan Kimble who wrote a book that is all along the line of this is Zach same thing how to read the Bible the title of it is how not to read the Bible and really interesting to read so about that then we'll follow that up with our final question response episode for this series and then we're getting towards the end of the year and we're going to an episode introducing really what we're going to be doing all next year which is really exciting I guess Tim do you want to plug it a little bit yeah we're going to be going through the Torah to the course of 2022 in the podcast the main thing we're going to do is walk slowly through the Torah and showing and exploring the main themes that linked together different parts of the Torah into one unified piece of work
 there's more to it but we'll get there when we get there but we're excited we're going to crawl through the Torah is going to be awesome I can't believe it's the end of the year a whole another year has gone by the years are like flying by but we got another year coming I'm really excited we're going to be digging deeper into how do you actually read the Bible with this Paradigm developing those skills and I really grateful for you guys being along with us
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we got an interview with a pastor and Professor Dan Campbell about his new book to read the Bible and it just came out he addresses all of these disturbing and important and common questions that a lot of Christians and people who are exploring the Christian faith has so he starts off with questions like why is it okay for God to kill children and not Hair It Is God endorsing humans as property is God commanding gender inequality so these are really tough questions and he provides some tools that resume allows a paradigm that we've been talking about in the series by Lyndsay Ponder Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus and to do it in community so thank you for being a part of this with us
 and I'm from Barcelona ever said about the Bible project last year I use the Bible project for Bible studies and synonym of a few important Link in Hebrew in the Bible my favorite thing about the Bible project is the online test me at classroom. Bible and honestly speaking into Mickey we believe the Bible is a unified student that leads to Jesus wore a crowdfunded project by people like me find free videos that you notes podcast classes and more at Bible project.com
