 The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
2 
 Jon: This is Jon from The Bible Project. Today's episode is the first in our series on the 
Holy Spirit. We've got a new video on the Holy Spirit coming out soon, and this 
conversation helped us prepare for that  
Tim: This is one of those things in the Christian faith where it's almost impossible for us to 
come to talking about the Spirit with a blank slate.  
Jon: The role of the Holy Spirit in Christianity today, differs from tradition to tradition. Tim 
and I focus on what the ancients believed about the Spirit.  
Tim: Reading the Bible is always a cross -cultural experience. We need to check our 
worldview categories at the door and understand what they meant.  
Jon: And we discuss what our worldview might look like if we think of the Spirit the way 
they did.  
Tim: It invites us to almost have a kind of a reenchanted view of creat ion. 
Jon: Here we go.  
Tim: So, we're getting ready to begin a Bible Project video about the Spirit of God.  
Jon: The Holy Spirit.  
Tim: The Holy Spirit, this is one of those things in the Christian faith where it's almost 
impossible for us to come to talkin g about the Spirit with a blank slate. Most people 
come with premade categories or experiences with Christians or church communities 
that have a lot to say about the Spirit.  
 And so, one of the most difficult things to do is to come back to the scriptures  and 
expect to hear something new, because we kind of think we maybe already know. 
There's something about the charismatics and Pentecostals and baptism of the Spirit 
that's a big thing. But truly discovering what the Bible is actually saying about the 
Spirit, for me, personally, has been one of the most surprising, mind opening, life -
transforming things in the last number of years.  
Jon: Wow.  
Tim: I really, really love this theme.  
Jon: Cool.  
Tim: It's going to be hard for me to distill it all into one vi deo, personally.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
3 
 Jon: Should we talk about what our paradigms were growing up just to get that on the 
table or is that not helpful?  
Tim: Oh, sure.  
Jon: Should we pretend we have no paradigms?  
Tim: Well, actually, I think it might be helpful because our growing up experiences, our 
interactions with church about the Spirit are really different, I know. And that 
probably represents a spectrum of most people of people who might be listening to 
this. So yeah, why don't you talk about it?  
Jon: Well, mine's pre tty straightforward. My church tradition came from Baptist roots. It's 
a non -denominational church, but basically, it's cessational . Is that what it is? 
Cessational?  
Tim: Cessationist.  
Jon: We were cessationists.  
Tim: Technical term meaning?  
Jon: Meaning the Holy Spirit doesn't really do anything nowadays. Right? I don't know. 
That's probably â€” 
Tim: That's not technically it. That view sees the Holy Spirit as primarily working through 
the Scriptures and God's people speaking truth into each other's lives based on the 
Scriptures, and the experiential presence of Jesus, and worship and so on.  
Jon: Sure. But the miraculous stuff that happens.  
Tim: Sure. Miraculous powers and even just something, experiences that might seem a 
little more on the mystical...  
[crosstalk 00:04:01]  
Jon: The prophecy and those kinds of thing. They are not needed anymore so those 
won't happen. There's a belief the Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity, and super 
important. I think there was always confusing for me what the difference between 
Jesus living in yo u and the Spirit living in you was, but we would talk about both of 
those things.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
4 
  The Holy Spirit helps you, but the Holy Spirit was always very clear. The Holy Spirit 
will never tell you something that's not in the Bible already.  
Tim: Yeah, sure.  
Jon: I think there was a bit of a fear that you could use the Holy Spirit to do things that 
were unorthodox, so you have to have the seat bell up there.  
Tim: Yeah, you confuse your own imagination for the Holy Spirit.  
Jon: So, very downplayed. Didn't talk abou t the Holy Spirit a lot. That was my experience.  
Tim: That was your experience. My experience growing up, our family attended church 
and it was mostly in the charismatic or Pentecostal tradition. Foursquare was the 
kind of church our family attended for m ost of my growing up.  
 So from a young age, my memories about what Sunday gatherings are were very 
energetic and action -packed with people yelling out in the worship gatherings in 
unknown languages. And sometimes then somebody would yell out what they 
thought that that person said. I'm just a little kid taking all this in.  
 People coming up to the front for prayer and then falling over. There was a whole 
crew of people who would come for women who fell over while they were praying if 
they were wearing dress es. 
Jon: If they jump?  
Tim: Yeah, there'd always be someone to catch them, but if they're wearing dresses, there 
was a whole crew of people who would come with these clothes and lay these 
clothes over their legs in case their dress had fallen off. Anyway. I don't know.  
Jon: And that was normal?  
Tim: As a little kid, that was like, "Hey, this is what Christianity is."  
Jon: We had a church like that down the street. I knew the kids in their youth group, and 
they were a little bit more punk rock than us. Th at youth group was. Some cool kids.  
 I remember, we started this Bible study in high school like in the cafeteria. I don't 
remember. It's like, we all got excuse from class at some point to do this Bibles 
Study. I don't remember how this even worked. But one time they lead it and did like 
a slain in the spirit. And it was the first time I had experienced that firsthand.  And I 
was really uncomfortable. I just remember it being weird.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
5 
 Tim: That's what's interesting for me too. Even though my earliest memor ies of church 
were that kind of thing. When I got older, like junior high, I didn't like it. I thought it 
was very weird. I remember I didn't like the youth group. I thought it was stupid. I 
never went.  
 But one event I went to, and there was like a Holy Spirit time where they were 
inviting people who hadn't been, quote, baptized in the spirit. And so, they just 
started praying, and then somebody came up and asked me if I'd received the Spirit.  
Jon: What did that mean to you at that point?  
Tim: Had I had o ne of those experiences that the people did up front on Sundays? And I 
was like, "No." Then they asked if they could pray for me, and I was kind of 
standoffish and then they started to do it anyway. Put their hands on my head, 
applying pressure. They were trying to push me over and I was having none of it.  
Jon: You're like, "I'm a skateboarder. I have really good balance. Good luck pushing me"  
Tim: Yeah. All that to say, and then after that, I just hate to go into church. I started 
sneaking out of my room. I'd mysteriously disappear to my friend's house on 
Saturday night so that I wouldn't have to go to church on Sundays. My parents 
finally picked their battles and quit forcing me to go.  
 When I became a Christian through the Ministry of Skatechurch, later the church 
community I became a part of was more like what you grew up in, Jon. I've had to 
sort through my baggage because I realized I've had a chip on my shoulder against 
that upbringing. And some of it is just prideful. So I've had to, like, "What part  of, 
you know, is my suspicion of that? Is there anything that's legitimate, and how much 
is it I'm just reacting against my childhood? And I need to get over it."  
  That's why, for me, this rediscovery of the Spirit over the last maybe six years or so, 
just started with a sermon series that I put together on the Spirit because I was like, 
"Well, I'm just going to go at this as an adult with new learning and categories."  
Jon: We kind of come from different places. Your suspicions arise from the slain in the  
Spirit kind of stuff, and my suspicions arise from this almost ignoring the Spirit. And 
so, my rebellion would be like, "Come on, let's get mystical." The Spirit's got to be 
doing something way more interesting than I can imagine.  
Tim: Interesting.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
6 
 Jon: But I think the problem is, is, however, I've learned this, I live in my head. Like I live 
life thinking, not feeling, not experiencing what's happening the moment.  
Tim: It's your temperament, you are saying.  
Jon: It's my temperament. And I've been trying to fix this over the last couple years. It's 
just what I've learned. And so, it's really hard when I'm worshipping, singing songs or 
anything to have something that feels like mystical or feels like the Spirit. I'm always 
just, everything's just rat ional thought.  
Tim: Well, sure. I hope maybe by the time we finish this conversation you could have 
some different categories for that because that's been one of the areas where the 
use of the word and the concept of God's Spirit in the Bible, I think, has  some 
surprising things to say about those categories.  
 So you know me, a good Bible trivia. I used it at a party this Friday night. Where in 
the story of the Bible does this Spirit appear for the very first time? It staged already 
because I just saw you look at the notes.  
Jon: I did. I would have known this one.  
Tim: You would have known this already?  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: Probably most people did.  
Jon: The Spirit of God hovered over the waters.  
Tim: Yeah. Not only page 1 but the second sentence of the Bible . The Spirit appears front 
and center.  
Jon: Hovering over the water.  
Tim: This is such a great example. We'll camp out on this for a little bit because right here, 
there's so much unlearning you have to do, I think to then relearn what's happening 
here in  the opening verses in the Bible.  
 Here are the first three verses of the Bible. "In the beginning, God created the skies 
and the land. Now, the land was wild and waste â€” tohu wa -bohu."  
Jon: Tohu wa -bohu. I reme mber that from Lay [S].  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
7 
 Tim: "Darkness was o ver the surface of the deep abyss, and the Spirit of God was 
hovering over the waters. And God said, 'Let there be light, and there was light.'" An 
ongoing sequence of God speaking and so on.  
 So whatever your view of Genesis 1 is, it begins with the summa ry statement, God 
creates all that is - what's up there and what's down here.  
 Then the focus of the story is that things began with what's down here being wild 
and waste, darkness. Then in the middle of that darkness, and wild waste is God's 
Spirit hover ing there. You were going to say something?  
Jon: Yeah, it might be a tangent. But the earth's there, so land is there. It's waste in some 
way, formless and void. What's the Hebrew word?  
Tim: Tohu wa -bohu.  
Jon: Tohu wa -bohu which is cool.  
Tim: Yeah, it's great. It's great little rhyme.  
Jon: It's a rhyme I guess. So waste and wild is the way to capture that in English, 
something like that. So, something's there, it's a waste and wild and the Spirit of God 
is there hovering over the waters. What am I supposed to have in my mind? Am I 
supposed to have just like a desert landscape and some seas?  
Tim: Well, there are two things, and it depends on how you interpret the first sentence of 
the Bible. Whether it's a summary statement, like a title almost for all that follows or 
if it's actually the first main action, God making everything.  
 I think the first view is more likely that it's a summary title. So that the story actually 
begins in the second sentence, "Now the land was tohu wa -bohu, which means t his. 
That from the framework of the author of Genesis 1, creation doesn't begin with God 
making something out of nothing. It doesn't begin with nothing and now God's 
going to make something. It begins with something.  
Jon: The land.  
Tim: It begins with th e land. Yeah. But the land is in the form of chaotic disorder. It's very 
difficult for us to not impose our modern view of the universe or Big Bang Theory. I 
mean, we don't really even have...we have a theoretical concept of nothing. Nothing.  
Jon: Like spa ce, maybe?  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
8 
 Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: But even space is something.  
Tim: But even space is within the framework of the space -time continuum. But the 
concept of something and nothing, we think of existence and creation as something 
coming into physical existence, but before which there was nothing. And that's not 
the biblical au thor's framework at all.  
Jon: They didn't have a perspective of, "Oh, at one point, there was nothing?"  
Tim: Correct. That's a concept.  
Jon: As far back as you could go, well, it was here, it was just wast e and wild. It was tohu 
wa bohu.  
Tim: Yeah. The au thor of Genesis one, and this is consistent with the view of creation in 
the Psalms and Proverbs and Job, is that creation begins with a state of disorder and 
chaotic disorder. And what creation is, is God bringing order beauty purpose, 
meaning - a garden out of the chaos. That's Genesis 1.  
 And so who is there hovering in the midst of the dark chaotic wilderness? Oh, sorry, 
you asked what's the picture you're supposed to have in your head  
Jon: Yeah.  
Tim: It's a paradox of images I think on purpose. Tohu wa bohu  is vocabulary used to 
described empty desert - Wasteland.  
Jon: Tohu wa-vohu ? 
Tim: Tohu wa bohu.  
Jon: Wa bohu?  
Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: Okay.  
Tim: It's vocabulary used elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible to describe wilderness â€” empty, 
uninhabitable wilderness . But then right and the next line its "darkness was over the 
surface of the deep abyss of the waters."  
Jon: So it's a desert water?  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
9 
 Tim: Right. It's a watery desert, which is a contradiction on the literal level, but on an 
image -driven level, it makes pe rfect sense. The Wilderness is uninhabitable, 
uncultivated, space.  
Jon: Not only is it wilderness that you can't survive in because it's barren land, it's also 
the chaotic seas where you will get destroyed by sea monsters and things.  
Tim: Yeah, that's righ t. There are two kinds of spaces in the imagination of the Hebrew 
Bible that are dangerous, chaotic, untamable. One's the wilderness, and for Israelites 
were talking about the huge stretch of desert between Israel and the Persian Gulf. 
Just by the compass,  as the crow flies between Jerusalem and the Persian Gulf, is a 
gigantic desert. It's in the northern edge of the Saudi Arabian, Peninsula. It's just 
sandy desert.  
Jon: And you're not going to survive out there?  
Tim: No. That's tohu wa bohu. You're not eve r going to try and...I mean Las Vegas â€” 
Jon: We can put out casinos there.  
Tim: Yeah, now we can put  casinos in the middle of tohu wa bohu  but back then that was 
unimaginable.  So there's that. Then the other most untamable space is, of course, 
the ocean, w hich we still don't really have a handle on. Yes, we can build oil rigs out 
there but...  
Jon: But for them, you go out in the ocean and it's dangerous. You get killed by the 
waters the storms. Then, let's not get into this because it's not really part of t he Spirit 
but in the other creation - is that Psalms that we're talking about?  
Tim: Psalm 74 depicts that...  
Jon: Yeah, the sea dragon.  
Tim: ...as the seven -headed sea dragon.  
Jon: That God has to tame.  
Tim: That God has to slay.  
Jon: To slay while He creates.  
Tim: He crush the head of the sea dragon.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
10 
 Jon: The seven heads.  
Tim: Yeah. And that's tapping into ancient Near Eastern mythological imagery.  
Jon: So not only can you get hit up by the waves and the wind, but there are sea drag ons 
out there too.  
Tim: Totally. Genesis 1 within that worldview, that cultural worldview, depicts the story of 
creation beginning in empty, untamable disorder.  
Jon: I love that there's a paradox there. There's this like conflict in the story.  
Tim: Oh, of the water and the desert.  
Jon: Yeah. There's this desert, waste the wild, tohu wa bohu , but its water. Watery desert.  
Tim: Yes. So it raises the question, okay, so God's going to create sky and land and order 
out of this desert wasteland ocean dept h. How?  
 And the first positive sign, it's kind of like a little bit like in a mountain top, and then 
just ski jump. "In the beginning, God created sky and the land. "Yay, we love it." "But 
it's tohu wa bohu , when darkness over the surface." And you're lik e, "Oh, no. What's 
going to happen?  
 And then, who's there to bring the created order out of the chaos? The Spirit of God 
hovering in the midst of the dark, untamable chaos. What's that about?  
 Two things. One is the Greek and Hebrew vocabulary here; Gene sis 1 is in Hebrew. 
It's a word, you have to kind of clear your throat, almost spit a little bit when you say 
at ruakh.  
Jon: Ruakh.  
Tim: We have these little covers in front of the microphone so we don't spit on them. But 
it's kind of like those covers sp it out a little bit.  
Jon: Nice and moist.  
Tim: Then in Greek, the first Jewish translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek called the 
Septuagint, they translated "ruakh" with the Greek word "pneuma," which is the 
same root word from what should we get lik e pneumatic drills. That kind of thing. 
So, ruakh and pneuma. And they overlap in meaning.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
11 
 Jon: Pneumothorax is when your lungs collapse.  
Tim: Whoa.  
Jon: I know that because it's happened to me.  
Tim: It's happened to you. That's right. You told me that story once.  
Jon: Pneuma.  
Tim: Pneuma. Also, if you misspell it, it turns into a collection of videos by Rob, bell 
Nooma.  
Tim: That's right. An exercise I do when I'm teaching to help get our minds around what 
ruakh means in Greek and Hebrew is to have pe ople put their hand in front of their 
mouth. Have you ever been around when I've done this before? I don't know. People 
put their hand over their mouth and just say something like hello.  
Jon: Hello.  
Tim: Hello. Hello. If you're listening the podcast, put  your hand in front of him and say, 
"hello." You feel something on your fingers, of course. In English, the word we have 
for that is breath. Breath. In Hebrew, the word for that is ruakh. Ruakh. Ruakh, its first 
and most basic meaning throughout the Hebrew  Bible is breath There are loads of 
uses. I've just kind of picked out a handful in the notes here.  
 So, in Genesis 2, this is significant, but God breathes the ruakh into the humans.  
Jon: Does He ruakh the ruakh into the humans?  
Tim: No, it's a different. ..I forget what was that verb in Genesis. Actually, it's a cool verb in 
Genesis 2. I guess naphach. It just sounds like a breathing word.  
Jon: Like if you have a snoring problem.  
Tim: That's right. Or Job in chapter 27, he talks about the ruakh of God in my nostrils. 
Now, we'll talk about why he calls it God's ruakh. In his nostrils, he breathes in and 
out. But it's ruakh. What he breathes in and out is ruakh.  
Jon: What is the other one? naphach or whatever. The snoring one.  
Tim: Oh, that's a verb to brea the out.  
Jon: But it's a different word  completely?  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
12 
 Tim: Yeah.  
Jon: What's the difference between those two words?  
Tim: Naphach is the act of breathing in and out. Ruakh is what it is you're breathing in 
and out.  
Jon: Okay. So we don't have two different  words for that but in Hebrew there are 
different words.  
Tim: Oh, we have. You're right. We have breathe and breath. Those are related in English, 
not in Hebrew.  
Jon: Breathe, and breath. But it is two different words technically.  
Tim: Technically. But th ey're from the same root. Not in Hebrew. In Hebrew, you naphach 
as a verb.  
Jon: You naphach and you have ruakh.  
Tim: And the thing that you naphach is your ruakh. There's no verb.  
Jon: You naphach ruakh. You breathe breath.  
Tim: That's right.  
Jon: Actuall y, you breathe air.  
Tim: Well, in English that's how we say it. Yeah.  
Jon: And you breath.  
Tim: We say, "You have breath."  
Jon: "Your breath smells bad" is something I hear a lot from my wife.  
Tim: It's a noun. It's the thing.  
Jon: The air coming out of your mouth is breath.  
Tim: The air coming out of you, we call it breath.  
Jon: But coming in, we call it air.  
Tim: Yes. I haven't quite thought about that.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
13 
 Jon: In Hebrews, is it both ways?  
Tim: Ruakh.  
Jon: Ruakh in, ruakh out.  
Tim: Ruakh in, ruakh out. I've never thought about that distinction in English. But that's it. 
Yeah, that's exactly right. Okay, so breath. Here's something else interesting about 
ruakh. That's this first and most basic meaning.  
 Another interesting thing, we don't have windows in our recording room, but if you 
were to look out the window, and you were to see trees out in your front yard, or 
something, and they were moving but you can't see anything moving them, like 
they're dancing, our English word to describ e what it is that's moving the trees is 
wind. In Hebrew, you would call that the ruakh. ruakh. It's the ruakh moving the 
trees.  
 So the common denominator between the ruakh coming in and out of you and the 
ruakh moving the trees...  
Jon: Is it animates thi ngs.  
Tim: Yes. It animates things and it's invisible. You cannot see what it is. You can't see your 
breath.  
Jon: But it's really cold.  
Tim: This is really cold. And you can't see the wind. And it's connected with energy and 
power and animation. So we're  talking about an invisible energy that animates 
things that makes them move.  
 And so, think about in English, we have totally disassociated the thing that animates 
the trees with the thing that animates me. But in Hebrew, it's the same thing. That 
then i s grounded in a deeper level, a deeper idea that's underneath both of those.  
 Namely, where did I get my ruakh? What moves the trees, what also makes the 
rabbits and the birds, what animates them because they are around the trees too? 
And then what is it the animates me because sometimes I go around the trees? So 
there's something invisible that animates the trees and the birds and me. In the Old 
Testament worldview, the thing that is doing all of that is also ruakh but it's God's 
ruakh.  
Jon: God's ruakh i s doing all that.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
14 
 Tim: God's ruakh is animating everything. This is interesting. There are many, many places 
in the Old Testament â€” 
Jon: And they don't mean , sorr y. By that they don't mean God's breath ? They just mean 
this energy ? 
Tim: Invisibl e presence and power that is divine. God.  
Jon: If I'm an ancient thinker and you're talking about that, am I picturing some being like 
blowing and then tha t breath coming into me and the  rabbit and wrestling the 
wind? Or am I just thinking more  abstractly and thinking, "There must be this kind of 
power?"  
Tim: Again, try and, 3000 years ago, put yourself what in your imagination could wind be? 
So from the Exodus story chapter 14, the main actor, how does God act to part the 
great Red Seas? He sen ds a strong east wind and turns the sea into dry land.  
Jon: Is that ruakh there?  
Tim: He sends a strong eastern ruakh. There are many, many Psalms and proverbs that 
talk about God bringing out the ruakh to send the rain and to water the farm fields, 
and s o on. So God's connected to what we call wind, but in Hebrew thought, it's 
God's ruakh that orchestrates the ruakh that commands the weather, essentially. It's 
a way of them seeing that God providentially sustains and is involved in all of 
animated life, i ncluding the invisible wind.  
Jon: This is so difficult, because I don't think that way. I know what wind is. It's like 
pressure changes in the air. I know what breath is. I know that I'm breathing in 
oxygen, and all sorts of other things, but then I'm usi ng the oxygen and breathing 
out - what is it?  
Tim: Carbon dioxide.  
Jon: Carbon dioxide. I know that that's part of keeping me alive because I need the 
oxygen. I don't know why I need the oxygen actually.  
Tim: Yes, blood. Yeah, it's blood. Our blood cells.   
Jon: Blood cells need it. For?  
Tim: For oxygenating our muscles or some something like that. Kind of embarrassed I 
don't understand that more.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
15 
 Jon: I bet a lot of people don't know. But we know that you hold your breath long 
enough and you're not â€” 
Tim: Yeah, you're done for.  
Jon: But I know that's not the only thing animating me. I know that I need calories and â€” 
Tim: Proteins. Yeah.  
Jon: I guess I'm trying to say I have a more sophisticated view of the world. When I say 
sophisticated, I'm more advanced,  more technical.  
Tim: Yeah, it's informed by a whole body of information that we have accessible to us 
that the biblical authors did not.  
Jon: I don't even really understand it. It's accessible to me, but I don't really understand it.  
Tim: Totally.  
Jon: I guess here's my point. In order for us to even begin this conversation, I have to try 
to unlearn that and then begin to think how humans would have thought before 
they knew that. I have to start to imagine that the wind is ruakh and what's in and 
out my mouth is ruakh. It's just I have to get into a different mind space.  
 It takes a lot of imagination, it takes a lot of focus in clearing my brain, all for us to 
even be able to begin to talk about what on earth the Bible means by God's Spirit.  
Tim: Correct. That is what I'm telling you.  
Jon: It's a lot.  
Tim: It is a lot. Two things. One is, I think to have it a sympathetic reading of what the 
biblical authors are trying to say when they use this word, we need to check our 
worldview categories at th e door and understand what they meant. But what we 
then have to do at some point is come back and relate it to our view of the universe. 
I mean, we could do it later or we could do it now; I would argue that ultimately, we 
end up in the same place.  
Jon: Sure. 
Tim: You have a different understanding of the physical mechanisms and processes by 
which the universe works, but ultimately, this is a way of talking about God as the 
originator and author of existence. And they are all of existence in the created ord er The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
16 
 originates and is sustained by the Creator God. Ruakh is a way of talking about how 
that God is personally present, sustaining and orchestrating His world.  
[00:32:12]   
Jon: I think the thing that I was tripping out on is that, for me to understand...th is isn't 
some tangential - is that the right word? Tangential? This isn't some...  
Tim: Secondary.  
Jon: ...topic. This is the Holy Spirit. This is really, really important. This isn't like angels or 
something where it's like, "Well, maybe I understand and maybe I don't really care. 
I'd like to." This is the Holy Spirit that's supposed to be living in me and making me a 
new creation. Doesn't Paul talk about it like groaning on my behalf and all this stuff? 
I'm supposed to be intimately involved with the Holy  Spirit.  
 And for me to begin to appreciate how the Bible views the Holy Spirit, I have to get 
to a different mindset, a different worldview from the one I'm accustomed to, just to 
get on a level playing field with the metaphors that it's using.  
 It's im portant for me to understand the metaphors that it's using, not because those 
are the exact...That's not exactly how it works. That's the metaphors they were using 
to describe something much bigger and much more interesting. But if I want to 
understand the  way they're describing it, I have to think within their metaphors. And 
those are the metaphors they think in.  
Tim: Yeah, they're not natural to you.  
Jon: They're not natural. So, for me to get to that with this topic, I have to like â€” 
Tim: It's interesti ng the way you're putting it. That's right.  
Jon: It's a massive imaginative effort.  
Tim: We've been here before, where it's the fact that what the Scriptures are is God 
revealing Himself in and through people. Actually, the Spirits role in that is really  
important. We'll talk about that. And so, that happens through language that from a 
particular people in time. And for them to even talk about God, they are going to do 
it in their language and their frame of reference.  
 That's why Genesis 1 talks about a  chaotic desert ocean and not quarks and dark 
matter. So yeah, you're right, reading the Bible is always a cross -cultural experience. 
For the Spirit, I think the reason why it's difficult is because this is such a core part of The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
17 
 following Jesus. The Spirit i s a really big deal and it involves adopting a new and 
different type of worldview, at least to get my mind around what the Spirit is and 
what the Spirit does.  
Jon: I have emphasized how difficult it is, but let me try to make sure I'm there. So, I 
breathe  in ruakh. I breathe out ruakh. To me, that is an energy that's animating me. I 
know this because when I see people stop breathing, they stop animating.  
Tim: That's right. It's very intuitive.  
Jon: Very intuitive.  
Tim: If you see somebody collapsed on t he ground, the first thing you're checking for is 
their pulse or if there's any ruakh. It's one of the most basic signs of...  
[crosstalk 00:35:27]  
Jon: So I just noti ced that everyone is alive is r uakh-ing. 
Tim: Yes.  
Jon: I've observed that. And then, I'm  looking around and I see leafs wrestling in â€” 
Tim: Or clouds moving.  
Jon: Clouds moving, and dandelion seeds floating around, and I don't know why, but I 
could feel it. I can't see it, and I go, "You know what? That's the same substance 
that's keeping me alive and everyone else I know - human non -human alive." That's 
ruakh.  
 Then when I want to understand God, I think, "Well, all this energy, this is coming 
from God. That's God's ruakh." When I say it's God's ruakh, I don't mean like He's up 
there breathi ng all this technically, but it's just that this power comes from Him.  
Tim: Yeah, that's right. It's the question of where did I get my ruakh? Did I make it for 
myself? Like, what is this animating energy? Which is a 3,000 -year-old way of asking, 
where di d this all come from? Why are we here? What's driving all of this?  
 The biblical explanation for that is right there in the second sentence of the Bible, it's 
God's own personal life animating energy.  
Jon: It was hovering over the creation before it was e ven ordered?  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
18 
 Tim: Yeah. It raises a bit of a puzzle, because the first sentence says, "God created sky and 
land." But then the second sense of the Bible, who is it that is there in the midst of 
tohu wa bohu ? That's the instrument through which God creates.  And it's God's 
ruakh.  
 So right there in the first two sentences, you're like, "Wait, so who created God or 
God's ruakh?" I mean, the story, are they different? Are they the same?" It's 
intentionally connected. Third verse of the Bible is then, what does  God and God's 
ruakh do to bring order? And verse three begins, "And God spoke."  
 Of course, speaking is precisely what you do to breathe out your ruakh. So you have 
Spirit of God and God speaking a word that releases the ruakh out to bring order in 
creati on. So there's already this complex depiction of even the God of the Bible, of 
how is God present here in the world doing His work? It's God's ruakh. That's God. 
Yes, it's God's ruakh.  
 There's some complexity to God's identity that's beginning to be explo red even in 
this vocabulary that's really interesting.  
 God's ruakh comes in the story of the Bible, then to have an independent character 
like ruakh is its own being and character out there doing stuff. We'll see this again in 
the New Testament where it's  the spirit, but sometimes the Spirit of God, sometimes 
it's the Spirit of Jesus, or sometimes it's just Jesus. Sometimes there's this 
overlapping within God's identity.  
 But all that to say, the rule is, in the Old Testament a way of talking about the 
Creator God's, personal life, energy and presence here with me, which goes back to 
that question, "Where did I get my ruakh?" And right all across, it's a gift of God. So 
that's the image in Genesis 2, God breathes.  
 So God takes dirt forms the human, but t hey're still not fully human, so God breathe 
the breath of life and animates. So the vision of humans is that humans are 
creatures. They come from dirt, they also go back to it. But there is also something 
about humans that is heaven and earth.  
Jon: That's  divine.  
Tim: That's divine. And it doesn't say what that is, it just uses the image of divine ruakh 
that animates and energizes humans.  
Jon: So, the same energy, the same force that hovered over creation turning it from 
chaos to order, enters humans and s o now they are combination of earthlings and â€” The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
19 
 Tim: This spark of divine breath. Actually, it's not just humans.  
Jon: Animals also.  
Tim: All creatures have divine ruakh. Humans, for sure. Job talks about the breath of God 
in my nostrils. Ecclesiastes says, "When you die, the dust returns to the ground, and 
your ruakh returns to God who gave it." So it doesn't mean some immaterial version 
of you floats up to God. That's not what he's talking about.  
Jon: Really?  
Tim: No. He's talking about your ruakh. The animating life energy that you've been 
borrowing.  
Jon: It wasn't you. It's not your identity?  
Tim: No.  
Jon: So it's not like a soul that you identify with?  
Tim: No.  
Jon: It's just the energy that was keeping you alive.  
Tim: Is now given back to God, who gave it. Your batteries. God gave you batteries for a 
while, and then you died, and He took them back. Which  is Job 34, he says, "If God 
decides to take back his ruakh and gather His ruakh back to himself, all mortal 
creatures would expire." So even the ruakh that I'm breathing right now isn't actually 
mine.  
 Again, this is all very intuitive. If you've ever se en a human born you watch them 
inhale their first ruakh. So ruakh is something from the first breath that we receive 
from outside ourselves, and it is the thing keeping us alive. And the last thing human 
does is breathe out, breathe it back out. This is al l very intuitive to the human 
experience.  
Jon: There's something essential to our life that we didn't come with. We had to receive it 
as a gift when we were born, and it stays with us our entire existence. And this is 
ruakh. Then when we die, we exhale it and it's gone out of our bodies. But it was 
never ours.  
Tim: Never ours.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
20 
 Jon: It was always something we were rent.  
Tim: Yeah, yeah, it was rented to us. That's the vision of human ruakh, which is actually 
God's ruakh. This is different than Eastern Pan theistic worldviews where "I'm God, 
your God, the rabbit's God." Because I'm not God, even though God's ruakh is what 
animates me. I'm a creature who has received ruakh as a gift.  
 That's why Job says, "It's God's ruakh in my nostril." He didn't have to g ive it to me, 
but He does. And then when he chooses, He will take it back.  
Jon: So this isn't your soul?  
Tim: It's not your soul. Yeah.  
Jon: And so, animals have it, we have it. It's the wind around us.  
Tim: When we come down then to our English word, Spi rit, the Spirit of God, we're talking 
aboutâ€” 
Jon: Because ruakh is often translated to Spirit. Or usually.  
Tim: Yeah, the ruakh of God.  
Jon: Is it ever translated in our English translations as anything else, but Spirit breath?  
Tim: Yeah. When Job says, "The ruakh of God is in my nostrils," is translated, "the breath 
of God is in my nostrils," but it's the same exact phrase as the second as in Genesis.  
Jon: Genesis 1:2, this Spirit of God hovering.  
Tim: The Spirit of God. The ruakh of God.  
Jon: Is this w eird to say, "The Spirit of God is in my nostrils."  
Tim: Yeah, totally. It doesn't make any sense for us. This is why it's hard for us. There's 
one Hebrew word to talk about my breath, the wind in the trees, God's energy that 
He lends  me to keep me alive, and His animating presence that sustains all of 
creation. Then, all of that is rooted in a concept of who God is, namely, that God is 
ruakh.   
Jon: God is ruakh.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
21 
 Tim: God is ruakh. He's invisible and He is everywhere animating invisi ble energy and 
personal presence that authors all that exists. But when we use Spirit, what we're 
doing is we're saying it's personal. It's a person, not just simply an energy.  
 So, the Pantheism would be an impersonal energy which you and I all participa te 
and exist, so we are all divine. And that's not the biblical words.  
Jon: Spirit is? Where does that word come?  
Tim: Do your online Oxford Dictionary search.  
Jon: Anglo -French spirit, modern French, spirit. Latin spiritus. I think Latin.  
Tim: Latin wo rd? 
Jon: Spiritus means breathing and wind.  
Tim: Oh, spirit like expiration?  
Jon: Yeah, that would all come from the same â€”  
Tim: Yeah, Spirit.  
Jon: Spirare, to breathe. And then from Proto -Indo-European European, they think it 
comes from peis - to blow. So, it all comes from that metaphor of wind in Latin as 
well.  
Tim: It does. In modern English, Spirit, which comes from the same breath word, refers to 
a personal being that is invisible. And so, that came to be the English translation of 
ruakh when it wa s talking about not breath or wind, but about God Himself when He 
is invisibly personally present somewhere.  
 Here are a couple examples that are really interesting. Psalm 104. This is so cool. 
Verse 29, the poet says, If you, God, if you hide yourself fa ce from a creature, they 
are dismayed. When you take away their ruakh, they die and return to the dirt. But 
when you send forth your ruakh, they are created and you revitalize the surface of 
the ground."  
 So when a creature breezes out it's ruakh, dies, bu t when you send your ruakh, 
creation...So it's this connection â€” 
Jon: But their ruakh is his ruakh  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
22 
 Tim: Right. Yeah, exactly. So it's their ruakh that you take it away their ruakh, it becomes 
God's again. That's what he's saying. But then when God sends fo rth his own ruakh, 
that's when creation happens. Now, this isn't talking about Genesis 1. In the context, 
it's talking about the life and death of animals like deer, and lions and so on.  
 Like, imagine a pregnant they're squatting in the field giving birt h to its young. This 
poet would call that creation and that that is God's ruakh creating new life there as it 
takes its first breath. But it comes from a person. It's a way of thinking about life. 
Where did life come from? Which, as I understand it, modern  biology is still puzzling 
over that one.  
Jon: Sure.  
Tim: And it's a way of saying, God is the ultimate originator of life, and that it's a personal 
being that stands behind all of this. That's the idea.  
Jon: It says, "When you send your ruakh, they are  created â€” the animals â€” and you 
revitalize the surface of the ground." Now it's talking about just like compost. Right?  
Tim: Yeah, totally.  
Jon: Like the biology of the earth.  
Tim: We would call it like the ecological cycle or something like that.  
Jon: So the ruakh is responsible, not only forgiving breath to the animals but for the 
harvest or the vegetation in there.  
Tim: The energy that causes the plants to spring up around. Which is almost certainly 
what Psalm 33 means when it says, "By the word  of the Lord the heavens were made, 
their starry host by the ruakh of his mouth. Similar idea, except here, it's up in the 
heavens.  
Jon: So even the stars populate out of ruakh?  
Tim: Yeah. Their movements, what makes them move and what ordered them. Why aren't 
they always flying around like the shooting stars? What makes those certain ones 
stay fixed and move in these orderly patterns?  
Jon: When it says, "Made here," it doesn't mean like up here or formed in the same way 
that like animals made?  
Tim: I think made in terms of where did they come from, who is responsible for them.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
23 
 Jon: This is interesting, because it's like the ruakh is responsible for an animal being alive, 
it's responsible for vegetation coming up out of the ground, it's responsible for the  
stars appearing in the sky and the order they are in, and it's responsible for keeping 
this all going.  
Tim: Yes, yeah. So it's not creation, and then the sustaining and ordering and continue 
the order of creation. Those aren't separate ideas in the Old Te stament. That's why a 
deer being born in a field can be described as creation in Psalm 104. Creation is 
God's ongoing work in developing and sustaining the world, as opposed to when we 
think of it as a moment.  
Jon: It wasn't there, now it's there.  
Tim: Yes. 
[00:50:34]  
Tim: Maybe a way to tie all this together is to say, in the Old Testament, there's this, I 
think, beautiful. aesthetically, it's beautiful. It's much more similar to Eastern and 
mystical worldviews than kind of a modern Western materialist worldview of that 
God's personal presence is what animates and energizes all of creation from its first 
moments of origin right on through. And that there is a personal divine presence 
that animates everything that exists.  
 Or it's as Paul says, "In him, we live and move and have our being," He says in Acts 
chapter 17. That's exactly right. But statement of Paul's comes from a mind saturated 
in the Old Testament.  
Jon: It's much more a mystical mindset to think that I'm breathing in God, I'm looking out 
and seeing God animating branches.  
Tim: I'm breathing in the energy God is lending to me. I'm not breathing God; I'm 
breathing in what the energy He's let me borrow. It's similar to Eastern pantheism, 
but it's different in that the ruakh isn't God, or the ra bbit, we all are creatures 
dependent on God, who's not an energy but the person.  
Jon: So there's this distinction between God and His energy, and I am breathing in His 
energy and His energy is animating the trees, his energy has ordered the stars, it 
keeps  them in motion, and allows stuff to grow out off the ground. All of this is it's 
saturating creation.  
Tim: There's something that makes all this go. It's what my son Roman â€” The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
24 
 Jon: In him, I live and move and have my being.  
Tim: Yes. It's what my son Roman  asked me when we are first...There were no slugs in 
Wisconsin when I was finishing my PhD in Wisconsin. He was born and there are no 
slugs there. When we moved here, when he turned three, he noticed slugs for the 
first time.  
 We were watching one go, and  he asked me â€” I swear, this is what he meant 
because these are the words that he used. He said, "Dada, what makes it go?" I was 
stunned. I was like, "really? He's asking me this question."  
Jon: How old was he?   
Tim: He was three. And I was like, "Yeah, w hat does make it go, buddy? What makes 
anything go?" Then, the moment that I was like, "Is he really asking me that," the 
next thing he wanted to do was a spit on it. And then he moved on. Like his mind 
had already moved on. So I don't know what he really meant by that question. But 
he had never really seen it.  
Jon: It has no leg, how was it moving? Maybe that's what he meant.  
Tim: I'd like to think he was a philosopher too. But that's the question, what makes it go?  
Jon: What makes things go? So you're s aying there's a distinction between God and His 
energy. But when Paul says, "For in him we live and move and have our being, he 
says, not in His energy do we live and move and have our being.  
Tim: That's true.  
Jon: In God, we live and move and have our be ing.  
Tim: In God's own self. Okay. All right. I'll maybe step back from that one a little bit. We'll 
talk about this when we talk about Paul and Spirit. But he believes that human life 
and all of life, there's just a very thin veil separating us from the life of the divine.  
Jon: Because if we fast forward, we know that the Spirit of God in Christian Orthodoxy is 
part of the Trinity, so it is God. But this point in the narrative it's His breath.  
Tim: His personal invisible presence that energizes things.  
Jon: So I wouldn't say I'm breathing in God. I would say I'm breathing in God's ruakh.  The Spirit of the OT vs. The Spirit of Christianity  
 
25 
 Tim: The ruakh of God is in my nostril" as Job would say. It invites us to almost have a 
kind of reenchanted view creation.  
Jon: Yeah, it is very enchanting.  
Tim: I think it's exactly the view of our existence that was lost in the enlightenment 
because we're tempted to just view our emotions as chemicals in our brain, or view 
the sunset merely as the interaction of light or â€” 
[crosstalk 00:55:23]  
Jon: Our view of air a s cocktail of different - is it chemicals?  
Tim: Molecules and on so. What we've done is given names to the physical components 
and processes of the material world. But what we haven't answered by those is the 
metaphysical questions of where did it come fro m, what makes it go, and why is it 
here?  
 That's what the language of ruakh is asking us to see that there is a person behind 
the sunset and the air that I breathe, and watching the birth of my child and the slug. 
Through the story of the Bible, that is a  person who wants to be extremely close to 
us and for us recognize that closeness and embrace it and live with it.
