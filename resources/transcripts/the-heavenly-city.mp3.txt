today we wrap up our discussions on the theme of the city in the Bible the first city is founded by a murderer On The Run wanting to protect himself from others the origin of cities comes from the human rationality fear of death King City has a wall to keep others out and uses the threats of violence to keep peace the desire to preserve life in a Land of scarcity and death creates the city with walls where peace and prosperity secured at the cost of human life when Jesus shows up announcing the kingdom of God he gives a vision for a new type of city city that's run by a different Logic the city based on the trust of God's abundant and provision of eternal life in the city of Jesus operates by a completely different type of rational cane City takes the life of others but Jesus found the city in which she sacrifices his life for others Jesus died dedicated to that Vision Trust
 the God would vindicate him and raise him to New Life and found the Heavenly Jerusalem right here on Earth in the form of his followers followers of Jesus in the first century continue to live in cities but they began to talk about having a citizenship and a city become a Heavenly City right now what's most true about followers of Jesus is not the city that they happen to live in at the moment but rather as defined by this ship in the Heavenly Jerusalem that operates according to the polar opposite of the city of Canaan limit can Nimrod cuz that its heart is Infinite Source of abundance in life today to Mackey and I wrap up our conversations about the city with a look at the gospels Paul's letters and the scroll of the Revelation I'm done calling your listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 it's a good morning John morning you know we always say good morning to each other of course that has no connection to whenever any of you all who are listening what time of day it is for you last time it is for a good day today on the city to see the city on the theme of the city yes and we covered a lot of ground you going to take us into the apostles writings and I'd like to hear kind of you set the scene for where you want to go maybe as a form of summary well I feel like those of you listening if you've been tracking with the conversations
 I feel like we had some new Clarity around the really cool or ideas now they're connected just in the last few episodes here at least what we want to do with the videos in the content we want to make it so we began with the garden ideal I have it on her spot with eating and it's safe and it's secure it's a place where life is generated and preserved in peace because there's so much abundance and there's no threat of scarcity and so because the humans foolishly forfeit the ability to stay in that Garden ideal their Exile out into the Wilderness and in the Next Generation you have the first murder with cane
 and Cain is exiled further from the garden and he fears for his life and God wants to provide a sign that will protect him but can instead goes and provides his own form of protection and this is the origin of the city and so what we traced is from Kane and then to his descendant Lemak is the first human City also is a space this dedicated for the preservation of life that's why I came built it is afraid somebody's going to kill him but the ethical logic of that city is protect yourself from those who might harm you
 and if that self-preservation comes at the cost of another person's life so we'll be at so be it so you preserve life at the cost of life and not that the clinic in the song these things about I killed a man for wounding may have came to and it was the epoch of pain but now it's become a cultural Epoch in the city the city that's accumulated to the point where a guy like lemonick could sing a song celebrating Easter at Wilshire the city that's right cuz Kane was concerned had a scarcity mindset if God is going to exalt and favor my brother and what that means is there's no more favor and exaltation left for me and so that drives him towards the self-preservation ethic kill my brother plenty of opportunity for me so that's the CoreLogic of the city we're calling it and if Cain was lured
 into the murder of his brother from that envion scarcity mindset and it's that lure that inner voice is called by God a monster like a creature the creeper that the couch or in crouching at the door of that but you can rule it and it's called sin so Cain as it where it lets the monster within and you let the rule him both in the murder of his brother and then that continues forward in the creation of the city which is built on the same logic the mobster that came back within became the monster that we live within humans then live within that is because the city is like a scaled version of Kane yes it's the accumulation of a bunch of us together an extension of us but now the monster isn't just my own personal little monster that's making me want his murder my brother
 torpedo protect myself really is about protecting oneself and one's Clan at the expense whatever the expense Maivia if it costs us our lives and Soviet the monster has it's still there but it now has to become something that is in the culture and it's in the infrastructure and it almost like we create it we live within it and then it creates a specific lock the city becomes this just amalgamation of the monster yeah for emerging for me what gets intensified and carried forward in the next big bad city which is Babylon which is founded by Nimrod another one of these violent Warrior dudes and what's interesting about Babylon is that with its City and Tower that reaches up into the heavens it's humans trying to construct by their own wisdom and scheme to make a name for themselves
 never perpetuating your own name is about the gravity turn a life that's it we're making making your name last through the generations so that your name is not forgotten its way of living non-living and building the tower to the skies is a way to try to attain Divine status that I'd like that heaven on Earth ideal that the garden represents Babylon is built as a rival a human rival to that basically with those two cities or those three steps from Eden to Cain City to Babylon you kind of get the basic plot tension city which is God has a Heavenly ideal that he wants to bring the Earth and humans forfeit it and then they create this alternate pseudo Eaton
 that is for the protection of Sun Life and actually makes a lot of sense like if someone's going to come and destroy you build a wall that's right and if we have the capability to like create something marvelous like at our let's do it you know and the point of the Tower of courses to make a statement to ourselves and everybody in this great we can be yes and that we have built up a pass to the heaven we don't need God we've got our own we can create life on her own terms we can reach up to the realm of the Gods by our own wisdom and make the city of our own little Divine refuge and we need rocks to Poe's wife in the garden to life in the city in the garden the tree of life is at the center. It's thrown in the city the towers in the center it represents us on the throne
 now also to keep in mind though this is written by the Israelites who have been trampled on trampled on by the entities centuries and centuries so worn out of Egypt as a pressed slaves but then later Taken Out by a sea rattle on earlier like besieged by Assyria the idea of a city becoming great and their imagination is a massive problem if those kind of no wonder that these four stories of cities are portrayed as negative that's right but there is one city in the biblical story that's gets reclaimed as an outpost of the Heavenly ideal and that city is Jerusalem and so we've talked about that how the story of David bringing the symbol of God's Heavenly Garden ideal in the Tabernacle he brings it to the middle of Jerusalem after he makes it the capital
 makes it an outpost as aware of God's dwelling and God accept this and chooses this is the special Earthly hot spot where the garden presents in the Divine Throne will take up residence for a time this is a big turd in the story because you could imagine that The Story Goes let's just go back to the Garden we got a portable toilets in the wilderness and reclaim the Garden of Eden but stay out of cities instead the story gets to a point that says let's take the throne room of God of the garden throne with bring it into the City and now you've got a new thing yeah the Garden City Garden City awesome for a hot moment when they it is living by God's wisdom surrendered to God ruling in Justice and righteousness sharing the benefits of God's blessing in a bun
 dance with the people of the city and they're having a big cakes like those from this big trees and eating right it's just a party until the day of and best Shiva movement and then in the narrative begins to slow Corruption of the Garden City to become yet another Babylon eventually taken out by Babylon you know centuries later it's so this that this drama that actually sets us up for this conversation so there's this distinction between Earthly cities are created by humans and then there's this heavenly ideal yeah the city of God and there's one city in the biblical story where those to merge together right for the time the Jerusalem and For That season in the specially in the biblical narrative it's presented as a heaven on Earth
 opportunity and season for Jerusalem but then slowly as the Kings from line of David do what they do do what humans do they turn the Garden City back into another city of Canaan a new Babylon and so it's as if the Heavenly Jerusalem and the Earthly Jerusalem R1 for a bit but then they're driven apart or they become separable you just added an idea I don't know where she's at the Heavenly Heavenly Jerusalem the garden Throne of God lands in Jerusalem and David from then on in the biblical story you can talk about the Heavenly ideal at the Garden or as a Heavenly City in other words the Heavenly presence of God takes on the
 another layer of a new layer of imagery you can call it the Garden or you can describe it as the Heavenly City or Jerusalem and when the Earthly Jerusalem is being run rules and operating by the wisdom of God it actually becomes an incarnation of the Heavenly City and Temple but when its leaders lead to the Stray From that purpose like Adam and Eve but instead of being exiled from it they just corrupted it says if Adam and Eve stayed in the garden and begin to just ruin the garden God let them until the point where this is too much since the Tree of Life uprooted and left and then God lets you know the wild animals just take over the garden that would be the equivalent of what God allows to happen in Jerusalem ya might be interesting to start then with the idea of you do called Heavenly Jerusalem at first but the
 if that's the head but it's not the garden yet the abstracted guys and when it touches down on Earth for the first time would we get we get the garden at least get the garden throne and then we got cities which are saying okay we're not going to God like a dropped out of the sky for us pains like I don't believe you're going to protect me so I'm going to build something and imma try to reach out to this guy and now you got the City Jerusalem is the first time to say it's God's Heavenly throne coming back down to the thing that we've been trying to do the city trying to create a new type of touchdown a like the Garden of Eden but new yeah because now it's like dealing with the monster would create
 claiming it and then it gives the profits this new vocabulary of talking about the Heavenly rule as in the city of city of God the threat and so in the Psalms and the prophets the Heavenly realm of God is from that point forward described as a once the Heavenly rule of God is identified with Jerusalem or connected to it in the story of David after that point City imagery is now A fitting way to talk about the Heavenly realm of gods rule along with Garden in Madrid at the Garden City right that's why there is a stream that makes glad the city of God it's the river of Eden
 irrigating and providing water for a Heavenly City that's right that's still clear so when Jesus comes onto the scene here's some fascinating things that have taken place after the God allows Babylon to come and burn the city and destroy the temple and haul off lots of Israelites in Exile and some of the come back you know I was in 100 years and rebuild the city rebuild the Temple but it's nothing like
 its former glory and it's all under the thumb of new Imperial oppressors and so Israelites as they read and meditated on the scriptural story regarding the city they came to see a separation between the Earthly Jerusalem and this heavenly Jerusalem and recognizing that the Earthly Jerusalem is not all it is is a potential symbol of the Heavenly reality but I just want to hug intertestamental. Right does the Jewish literature of the second temple. And I just want to I'm the one mentioned two examples go Reed 11 isn't work now is called second place in the Catholic Canon no no no no it's in a collection that's not a part of the collection it has been collected together in second temple Jewish literature that's called the suit
 okay sudo means these are writing that are portrayed by their authors is coming from ancient characters from the biblical story but it's patently like the author doesn't expect the reader to necessarily by that claim it's a literary Persona the author's put on sober ook The Scribe who's mentioned is Jeremiah's partner and responsible for public opposition to The Scroll of Jeremiah it's all of a series of visions and dreams that he has trying to understand the long period of its real suffering under repressive cities in Empires and so there's this one section and second group chapter 4 or Baruch is looking at the ruins of the city of Jerusalem
 and there's an angel they're kind of helping and process through it all so Brooke is looking at the ruins of Jerusalem in the angel ass do you think that this is the city of which I said quote on the palms of my hand I have carved you that's a quote from Isaiah being said about Jerusalem and Isaiah the angel says it is not this building that is in your minutes to now
 it is what will be revealed with me
 that was already prepared from the moment I decided to create Paradise the garden and I showed it to Adam before he send LOL but when he transgressed the Commandment it was taken away from him as also Paradise I also showed it to Moses on Mount Sinai when I showed him the likeness of the Tabernacle and it's a vessel and behold now it is preserved with me at Paradise this is what we talked about what the pattern exactly that Moses got a pattern David got a pattern this is Bill like vision of what God's Heavenly throne and Rule looks like in the heavens but then become something that they could then create here on the land is why I want to show this to you because the summer is that we just did the you're not making this up right like this is a second temple Jewish author saying the same thing who sees the same thing
 namely the gods Heavenly rule has multiple Earthly incarnations but each of them gets forfeited ruined in some way that not once it gets ruined what you can say is that's not the real thing about it could have been maybe would have showed up but it's not the real city of God is something yet to be revealed and it's with Garden will come about here on Earth when God brings it right you know from the very beginning this conversation I've kept asking like what if Adam and Eve just chilled of God in the garden with me what they have built right God would have showed him a pattern and they would have just as a quick note this is why
 second temple Jewish literature is so important to read as of the link in the chain between the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament is cuz it shows you how Jewish Bible nerds were reading and making sense of the storyline in Hebrew Bible and often when Jesus the apostles quote from or allude to the Hebrew Bible they're doing it through all the developed thinking that was happening in the centuries in between and this is a great example so in other words the same idea is what appears in the New Testament text that we're about to look at this isn't second Brooks idea this is an idea that actually there in the Hebrew Bible
the movie that we made in the last couple episodes of saying that this pattern of what God's Heavenly throne and Rule looks like come down with Jesus yes and that it's not something that humans than get to build but it's actually got himself become human the gospel out their present Jesus as the newest incarnation of that Heavenly ideal Throne of God taking up residence here on Earth not in the form of city in the form of a person and it's fundamentally different than the pattern given to Moses or David but how would you describe the difference well it's not a structure it's not a building its occupant man creates yeah it's a human but a human whose Origins can't be traced to human planning scheming or Ingenuity right it says
 a miraculous conception of a human in a human womb but it's not made by human hands so to speak here yeah and you know it eliminate the little moment in the Babylon story back in Genesis 11 where they described the city and the tower like a person that has build a city and a tower whose head is up in the sky and describe their city as if it's a kind of person that has a head and the head is up in the clouds now heading to use metaphorically about the top of things so I might be making that but in this case the Heavenly ideal rule of God In the Garden City above becomes the person and Matthew wants us to see Jesus is that that's why in the birth story with the wise men use all the language
 the passage from Isaiah about the New Jerusalem City but describes Jesus's in the place of the city and that's why Jesus calls himself and his followers the city on the hill the Shine the Light to the nation's VR which which is pulling from other parts of Isaiah and other prophets we can really dig into this much and I think we'll do a theme video one day of the idea of the remnant to where the disturbance but this idea of a faithful crew of Israelites who will be connected to the coming anointed one and and Isaiah 61 rebuild cities are the rebuilding that's right and when a flood of Justice comes on a city it's what they do that will remain in our last conversation we traced Jesus saw Earthly Jerusalem as a corrupted version of what could have been an incarnation of God
 how to make swelling and so he announces that it's going to go the way of all cities mainly to be overwhelmed by a flood of violence that's God will hand it over just like he's handed over every other violent city but he and his followers are building and are the foundation of the Heavenly City and that's how Jesus presents himself the gospel others present Jesus being in thrown in the Earthly corrupt Jerusalem as the king of Heaven and Earth and so Jesus becomes the king of the Heavenly City Annabelle creation by being brutally murdered according to the logic of the Earthly City there's not enough for us to Jesus you can't be claiming to be the anointed one there is an anointed one already and her threatening our rule here and check the leaders of Jerusalem this is stated both in John's account and it looks and
 they're worried that Jesus would be perceived as a revolutionary in the eyes of the Roman governor and the Rome will come and take away our freedom it's all about it's all about the threat of violence it's red and white worry it's worried about the fear of the others which is not unfounded beer totally and so Jesus is murdered and executed according to the logic of kin and lemon to preserve life in Jerusalem we had some heads got a roll and one of them is this upstart Cheese's now so he's got to go but Jesus willingly surrendered his life to the logic of the city of Canaan Lemak in order to found a new city a city whose inhabitants have their Legions in a loyalty and hope and identity based in a city that's run by a different logical City based on the trust got the abundance and provision of eternal life
 and Jesus died dedicated to that Vision trusting the God would vindicate him and raise him to New Life and found the Heavenly Jerusalem right here on Earth in the form of his followers that's how he talked about his death and his followers knows we're going to see that's how the earliest Christians talked about who they were and what they helped in and as founding the city of God not something made by hands but people knit together by their allegiance to their Heavenly King and this is what Jesus said build your house on the rock what does that mean what are you going to build so what's all that track LED I just want to meditate on a few texts in the New Testament that when you see them from this light it just makes perfect sense and what's going on so for now I'll let some turn to flip Ian's Paul's letter to the followers of Jesus
 living in a Roman colony called Phillipi yeah
a lot of important history here and here I'll just flag the work of a important New Testament scholar who's also a friend named Jay Gupta is actor Pauline scholar specifically doing great work on the letters of Paul and lots of other topics but he has a little introduction to Flippin cold reading flip Ian's at the illogical introduction but he's also got a bigger commentary project that he's working on it so I'll just refer to his work but he draws attention to a lot of scholarship done on Philippians that the colony cultural atmosphere of Phillipi as an outpost of the Roman Empire isn't important backdrop to allow the comments that he makes within the letter itself and specifically he said the lines in Philippians chapter 3
 he's contrasting in context about the way of life that's common in the city where they live then he says a contrast statement for the followers of Jesus he says in Philippians 3 verse 24 hour citizenship exists in heaven the Greek word pull it to me and I could be translated are commonwealth what does that word mean Commonwealth refers more to like a realm of our homeland and the Homeland that unites us common members of that place that is citizenship so our defining identity as Citizens exists in heaven and if this is in the sky and this word pelicula citizenship I mean in in English the word citizenship the word city is there in the root word
 Blick to my little man has to put the word polis which is the Greek word for City or we get the word politics that's right and citizenship are so our defining identity is defined by the city of Heaven from which we eagerly await rescue are the Lord Jesus Messiah he will transform our mortal humble bodies to be conformed to his body of Glory in accordance with the power that enables him to subject all things to himself
 so right now what's most true about followers of Jesus is not the city that they happen to live in at the moment but rather defined by this citizenship in the Heavenly Jerusalem and Jesus is raining there he also rains over Earth but not everybody on Earth recognizes that rule but there is coming a moment where the reunions of Heaven and Earth will happen and it's not about the hope of going to that Heavenly City it's the hope for the Heavenly City and its king to come here and remake creation than in the tub and recreate us and recreate us as this passage continues to mention yeah yeah but the idea's assume just like an S broock like the relevance of Any Given Earthly city is kind of demoted and what's most important is not where you live on the plan
 who your allegiances to that's one example example. This interesting it's in Paul's letter to the Galatians and I guess the important context for this passage will look at Gleason's for is that he's riding to community of mostly non-israelite followers of Jesus
 but there are some passionate followers of Jesus who are Israelites and they really believe that to be part of the family of the Messiah of Israel not Israelites need to recite confirm their life to the basic practices of the Mosaic Torah and specifically Sabbath kosher food laws circumcision keep an electrical calendar in Saint Paul passionately disagrees and he keeps referring to the story of Abraham saying God's promise was that the family of God would be made up of all Nations
 and that the specific ways that God set apart Israel for work for time to keep Israel Israel until the coming of his real Messiah but that Messias for all nations and so the defining entry card for membership in the family is Messiah and Abraham is just trusting in the Messiah and not these prescriptions of the Mosaic to her that's a bigger context so he goes into this reading and interpretation of the story of Abraham and Sarah and Hagar you who want to live under the Toya do you really understand the Torah
 Abdel know I probably would not like he didn't avoid trash talk cuz they're all Bible nerds like the people he's talking about if I had to do so these are fighting words course I understand Paul yeah I live by the Torah it is written that Abraham had two sons
 one from the female slave and the other by the free woman Sara Sara the one the son that came from the female slave was born according to human descent and the one born by the free woman was just born from God's promise cuz that's important for the seems we've been so there's one son that's born according to the scheming and the plan and what seemed good in the eyes of Abraham and Sarah to be really clear about it Abraham and Sarah are old and infertile and they can't have a kid right and so Abraham and Sarah decide to Abraham have a kid with a slave Hagar and so by human descent meaning hey we can pull this off we could create our own son we can create a son from me and Sarah
 and like we're the ones I got made the promise to but maybe there's another way we could create a son and that would create stability yeah a family future someone to inherit the land and carry on my name which is yeah we could take the Divine promise to make it real do our own Ingenuity and if you go back and read the story Genesis 15:16 it's full of hyperlinks back to the store is from Adam and Eve's and Cain and Abel the Rivalry between Sarah and Hagar is all full of vocabulary from the Rivalry of Cain and Abel so he's reading the story of Abraham and Sarah and Hagar and wide of the design patterns and when Genesis so he says one son was born of human descent that is planning and scheming the other ones born of God the promise just the Sun
 brought out of the womb of Sarah this year did Miracle of God's creation when there should have been no possible way for her to have a kid she's too old and and if she was young like though she was having kids so what he says is there's 24 these things that are spoken or allegorical Lumina other fascinating prehistory that I would love to do more homework on but what is essentially means it's our symbolic and so there's lots of people to think that he's just creating his own little simple set hear some Scholars think that their other Scholars that sink know he's actually tracking with the way the symbols work within the design of what he's talking about his associations now especially in the process
 Christian Traditions that are primarily negative and associated with reading the Bible in a way that really is unanchored from what the authors were trying to communicate and that has happened and sometimes the word allegory doesn't refer to that question is what does Paul mean right what are you all doing hope all is actually reading the Bible by its own grain and the patterns that are there and he's surfacing up through somebody call that well then you can go on and he's going to he's going to call the two women to Covenant yeah these women are also two covenants 1 represents Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery that's Hagar this is why I don't understand how that move is Mount Sinai in Arabia
 and corresponds to present-day Jerusalem yeah that's I mean he just made two Master sleeps that is present day Jerusalem is a slave along with your children but the Jerusalem Above So Hagar represents the Covenant Mount Sinai represents present-day Jerusalem in what way is Mount Sinai human descent human scheming right if nothing that is God coming down from heaven and saying yeah yes here's the pattern yet live by yes but let's go meditate on Exodus 19 224 240 and when God shows up and Reveals His ideal to the people and invite some people to come up on the mountain to see and experience at all
 they don't want to go up there a phrase that God's going to kill them and so they send up only Moses and only Moses gets to participate and see and then when Moses bring down all of the Divine wisdom the people the first thing they do is break the two commands Ark PS4 the point is what Mount Sinai was supposed to do it which is creative people that could live by the will of God ended up actually to God came to do America essentially like in the way that he gave Sarah miraculous son came to deliver to Israel like a covenant that would be unbelievably miraculous for them to become the priest to the nation's and but he was going to do it but instead you're saying that Israel schemed yeah or more that they didn't take up the invitation didn't take a payment to go through the wall of Fire
 enter God's Heavenly heaven on Earth presents on top of the mountain they stayed below that God continues to keep the Covenant with them and have to keep a cup yeah so it's not like you goes okay as you did it wrong all right well that didn't work that's right he reveals the Covenant and the Heavenly pattern to Moses and what Moses goes down and finds is that they want the god of their own making rather than the smoking Fire Mountain Gods because I'm trying to say is maybe it is Emmy for rhetorical purposes I understand why you saying like Hagar's Mount Sinai but it feels like it's actually a mixture right it's like not is doing his miraculous thing but he's meeting resistance yeah which then create you know the conflict of the Wilderness and then going and read Galatians in his discussions about
 in Romans 6 the rate but what he has in mind in the fact that the laws of the Torah and the coven agreement didn't end up bringing eternal life
 Israel what it brought was continual cycles of breaking the Divine command and then suffering the consequences for it in greater and greater scale leading to present-day Jerusalem which is living under Roman occupation sure God's people living under foreign oppressors is one of the consequences for not living by the covenant made at Mount Sinai some outside I didn't lead to the liberation of Israel it led to the continual
 enslavement to foreign cities and Gun Room 608 and his discussion of the tour and Romans 3 that's what's in pause Minecraft so what led to Hagar and Ishmael what came from outside my what led to present-day Jerusalem it's all about humans trying to do by their own wisdom. What they can never accomplish you can't build a city up into the heavens can't produce a miraculous Sun by your own scheming you can't build an Earthly City by the logic
 Canon Lemak and create the city of God but he says the miraculous song from Sarah it came from Sarah's womb and he's for sure got a parallel to the Virgin birth on his mind here corresponds to the city of God that no human hands has made and that city is our mother Suisse has a 26 and here he's staying in different language the same thing you said to the Olympians which is our citizenship followers of Jesus Messiah which is a multi-ethnic family that is itself the children of a city that's our mom that's and he quotes from Isaiah 54 which is the poem about the Heavenly Jerusalem depicted as a woman giving birth to a huge family so this is a lot more complicated clearly because of the symbolic associations but what I'm trying to say is one and all these allegorical pairings he's actually try
 with a design patterns at work within the authorial eat intended design of the Hebrew Bible but then viewed also threw the fifth element of the story of Jesus the way we've been saying it with Jerusalem is that it was a touchpoint of Heaven and Earth for a moment I had the potential had the possibility of even the stories of those glorious moments. This was in them you talking about the story of David bring an Arctic true so yeah it was full of problems right now and then David has to go to the rain to sell them in and you know just like city of Blythe city of blood yeah so we were describing it as like kind of a momentary like the New Jerusalem touching down with Jerusalem in creating the city of God hear Paul just says look no actually it was always yeah she like it
 wasn't that like that's true cuz I would describe Sinai as that same thing it's the moment where there was a touchdown it was happening yeah it was a heaven on Earth moment but that was forfeited and not fully enjoy it because of the fear in the scheming of the people yeah he's parroting all these moments where Heaven could have touched her with the people ruined it because of scarcity fear self-preservation with Sarah though he still got the sun came yeah that's true so we'll try Sinai the Covenant still did come is now the Covenant and Sinai he saying is I think when he says these women are two covenants the one from Mount Sinai and then he never mentions the other one
 Adidas Mount Sinai is Hagar
 corresponds to present-day Jerusalem is it feel like a lot of sorry too I think the New Covenant represents the New Covenant passages from the prophets which once again is about God and initiating a recreation of the human heart resulting in a human who loves to live by the will of God it's their delight and joy
 so we can fill out Paul's logic when you wrote the paragraph it would be Hagar is Mount Sinai corresponds to present Jerusalem Sarah is the New Covenant hopefully by the prophets which corresponds to the truce on the bus
 I think that's what's underneath here so it doesn't say that it's supposed to be yeah I guess where I would want to iron this out some more is like in Hebrew Bible there is a true celebration of the Torah is good so it's not up and now we have like a covenant that's not the real cuz yeah we got the slave and said it's like no we got it now let's just follow it. Doesn't seem to be no that's a good point I think probably also at work here is Paul's rhetorical skills sprained foot to use for this crisis that he had spacing in this church community so he's portraying the Covenant Mount Sinai and pretty negative terms there when you turn the Romans 7 and 8 yeah it's much more nuanced and the Torah is all entirely positive and what's negative is
 human inability to live by the laws of the Torah which is I think probably more underneath here that's what I was saying there's some rhetoric year did you come by this get to the punch line in Jerusalem above is physiatry she's our mother he's our mother and it's free because it's not bound to the scarcity mine self-preservation mindset of the city of humans yeah it's the free city of God which means like Psalm 87 you can be the mother of all the nations so having the Heavenly Jerusalem is your mother is what creates the opportunity for Unity across diversity in the family of the Messiah
 and I think that's how it fits into Paul's argument that the messiah's family whose hope is in the Jerusalem above whose identity and citizenship is in the true some above means that when we sit down to take the bread in the cup of Jesus together there is no male or female Greek or Jew slave or free We Are All One in Messiah Jesus
Thugz Mansion a couple other examples and then we got to land the plane with the last page of the Bible all just know that the steam of the Heavenly City appears throughout the letter to the Hebrews to and I think in chapters 11 and 12:30 what school in chapter 11 is jiri tells the story of Abraham and talks about how Abraham was hoping for a Heavenly City
 and even though he never got to experience it that's what he was looking for his he continually camped outside of cities anyway it's just a reflection on how I did Abraham never make his residence in the city we talked about that like yesterday that he stay away from cities and stay away from cities yeah and the author of Hebrews sees in that series that in the context of the whole biblical story is that that's cuz he was looking forward to having my city and he says in chapter 12
 that you are the followers of Jesus have come to Mount Zion the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem it's already happened you've come to it look around you've made it over here and what he describes as like a worship Gathering you've come to myriads of angels to the general assembly to the Church of the firstborn let's enroll in the heavens you've come to God the judge of all to the spirits of the righteous who are made perfect in the Jesus the mediator of a New Covenant into the sprinkled blood but speaks a better words in the blood of Abel straight super-dense difficulty what he says is he I think he's describing that when this group of followers of Jesus comes together to worship Jesus and they're participating in the Liturgy in the worship of the angels and the Saints
 let's simultaneously happening in the Heavenly Temple that have a picture of someone they went up to my side a yeah or hears more supposed to leave and they're there but where they actually are is in someone's like house house and yet people debate whether this in Rome some other city in the Roman Empire but the point is is when Jesus people are together in the house taking the bread in the cup to come to New Jersey they are simultaneously participating in the Liturgy happening in the Heavenly city is a portal the sort of Heaven on Earth moment where is he says in chapter 6 through the spirit you were tasting the power of the age to come in chapter 6 The Gathering can become a port
 to the Heavenly Jerusalem where we join the Saints and the angels who are worshipping Jesus so rad that's a whole thing we could go down but let's save the choice for last
 this revelation we could do a whole episode that maybe we should have but in a way the Revelation is another Tale of Two Cities of the Heavenly Jerusalem and Avalon are the two main cities the cosmic Babylon Cosmic Babylon yeah who represents all the cities all that I am involved with interesting is the first time that the Heavenly Jerusalem is named in the Revelation this in the speeches the Jesus makes to the seven churches at the beginning and the conclusion of his speech to the church in Philadelphia
 he says to the one who overcomes and that's a promise he makes all the churches some of their facing affluence and apathy others facing danger and persecution and he makes a promise he says to the one who overcomes that is who follows me and is faithful to me I will make them a pillar in the temple of my God and he will never have to leave
 I will write on him the name of my God the name of the city of my God the New Jerusalem that comes down out of Heaven from my God and also all right on him my name
 my new name
 who's speaking hear Jesus sucker is making a promise to his followers who are faithful unto death even if the city of man executes you for following me I will make you a pillar part of the foundation of the city of God and you'll have a inscription on the pillar which is the typical sing scripture in Psalms about dedicating this pillar this part of the building to an honorary founder of it and what what would be written on the inscription on you the Peddler the name of the city and Jesus's name but his new name and the name of God another words you will become a part of the Heavenly city which we know is people Jesus said that the city at the Heavenly Jerusalem is you are the city the new Humanity so this corresponds
 Revelation 3 I'm at points forward as a bookend to the final scenes in Revelation 21 and 22 which is after the Babylon is Fallen Revelation 18 and evil is eradicated from God's world chapter 21 verse 1 then I saw a new skies and a new land for the first guys in the first land passed away a Genesis 1:1 new heaven in Earth there is no longer any see chaos no more of those dark half Waters
 and I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down out of heaven for God made ready as a bride here's the city as a woman again next all that stuff back from the gardening store then I heard a loud voice from the one on the throne saying look the tent of God the Tabernacle of God is now among humans and he will tend to dwell among them they will be his people and He will be their God
 and then he goes on to take a tour of the city of its walls but with Gates that are always open and never closed her made out of precious stones of the Garden of Eden and then there's trees and river and also in this Garden but look at the imagery it's a new creation new heavens and a new Earth
 and a new city that is also the Tabernacle tent that's also a woman but it's also a garden so he's bringing all the motifs together from throughout the Hebrew Bible, putting them together into one and we can buy in this with the promise that Jesus made back in chapter 3 what he says the New Jerusalem that comes down out of Heaven from my God the name of that city is also my name
 was it an actual City what is it what is it what is it what is New Jerusalem what is it to Garden City tent Temple woman New Creation Cosmo what is described its just a bedazzled like a spectacle with the tree of life like a woven wire fence on both sides and one spot like that this river river flowing out of the throne there's no temple in the city because the one sitting on the throne and the lamb are the temple which is the purpose of a temple is for the throne but there's a from so here we have a city that operates according to the polar opposite of the city of Canaan limit condemned rod
 cuz at its heart is an infinite source of abundance and life generating life right just life flow is out in the river the river goes it's just trees and license food near the gates of the city walls are never closed yeah this is connected to that is a Isaiah 60 the direct quote from Isaiah line a nice xxd and there we get a fuller picture of Nations streaming up and almost as picture of like a reuniting of humanity as brothers learning to live by the wisdom of God and then the Revelation later he says the Tree of Life there in the city like is some white heels for the healing of the gills things instead of his idea of that and Isaiah 60 and like there's no more war that's also in Isaiah 2 are there to talk to buy in here
 what's another word for the rationale for the city of Kane the origin of cities comes from this human rationale with fear of death of desire to preserve life in a Land of scarcity and death
 creates a city with walls where peace and prosperity is secured at the cost of human life and hear all that has been completely healed an inverted through colonizing of that Heavenly City here on Earth through the story of Jesus and the one sitting on the throne is ablam with its throat slit It's the one who let the city of humanity kill him what it different type of image of a king than lay back and never on right like that yeah if you really feel like you need to kill me to save your life do it my citizenship is in the Heavenly City and it will reunite with her with one day my name is written and enrolled
 in that City it so you can kill me or you can take my stuff this is The Sermon on the Mount this is Jesus but this is what the earliest Christians really believed and this has been the challenge of what it means to live as if your citizenship to send this heavenly City about how you after our last conversation continued to meditate on was Sermon on the Mount of the ethic of of the City of Heavenly Heavenly City because his vision of a time when there is abundance in peace and healing it makes sense you're like okay like I don't have to fear because we've been transformed everything is made new I mean I don't fully get it but there's this moment now that we live which is we're hoping in that we're believing in resurrected life
 but we're living in the monster yeah that's right threatening to take our lives and so when you're facing like the threat of death or the threat of losing something that you love and that's incredibly hard yeah it's a very powerful Instinct that kicks in I need to protect myself and The Sermon on the Mount is this Treaty of sorts saying like we can creatively and bravely like move through those situations in a way that can create peace but am I also and it probably will mean some suffering and some loss and some loss but that's the way that's the way it's the way of the Heavenly City
 and in a city which has the lamb at its Center as a source of unending life in that City that makes sense I kind of approach to living makes sense yes but when you're outside that City when you living in the monster of the city of humanity it is scary challenge presented to the people who stay when he said all the things that he said that made people not want to fall asleep and it represents the challenge of Jesus and the apostles and of the State draft history you know who have lived there many many followers of Jesus who have lived this way
 and who are living this way right now I think is I take stock of my own life I can see some ways where I am trying and other way is where I figured out a compromise with the city of city of man and I guess that's one way to think about the gradual process of discipleship to Jesus and transformation is letting more and more parts of my actual how I live in structure my life to reflect more and more the ethic of the Heavenly City yeah that's a good word because there's this you could have a sense of cats can't do this way too much and I'm just I'm a complete fraud if I'm saying I'm actually doing this
 we use painted there was a picture of saying with humility going I can see where I'm not doing it and it's not okay so I'm going to just fine opportunities to slowly align those things back and it's not going to be all at once it's likely it's psychologically possible but maybe it is I like that should be very tentative here because God Spirit does all kinds of things with all kinds of people and then they look real weird picture yeah but I think it is possible for anybody wherever they're at on the journeys following Jesus to begin to change like their habits of living and spending and consuming relating to embody this generosity ethic of the Heavenly Jerusalem I have to believe that's true cuz
 that seems to be the course this is happening in the lives of so many people I know including myself here in Portland to I think it's also true that it doesn't take much to make a real impact that when someone acts generously even just for a moment in a way that just doesn't make sense the logic of the city of man like it can transform someone even if it is just a momentary alignment with the ethic of the New Jerusalem like they can do some real something really beautiful yet. So Lord have mercy on us what a rich journey of reflection through the story of the Bible I feel like I've I've learned a lot and a lot of new clarity as we followed this team throughout the storyline the Bible to thank you
