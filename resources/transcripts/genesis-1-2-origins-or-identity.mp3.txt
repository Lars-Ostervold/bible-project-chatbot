play this is Jonah Bible project and today Tim and I have the pleasure of interviewing dr. John Walton he's an old testament scholar and Professor who has written extensively on Ancient near Eastern backgrounds of the creation accounts in the Bible that's what we've been talking about in his cosmology series and Tim has a reference to doctor Walton's work extensively throughout these discussions I was introduced to John Walton with his popular level book The Lost World of Genesis 1 it's a really accessible and helpful book for framing up the Genesis 1 creation story we're really grateful that doctor Walton spend some time with us to debrief all these ideas we've been walking through in his cosmology series to hear directly from him to get some of the new ways that he frames his ideas and some of the new things that he's working on it can begin the interview and you'll hear me jump in a little bit later thanks for joining us here we go
all right John Walton thank you for joining us on the podcast today it's really great to be in this conversation Tim yeah so we're going to talk about the early narratives in Genesis Concepts a creation and cosmology Cosmic stuff but first let's start with something very practical but it's really important that we talk about your work tell us some about you so maybe where where you came from your family Origins your face Community Origins and how does a human end up in a career of biblical scholarship the wonderful world of biblical scholarship is the Philadelphia I raised in a Christian home and so I was introduced to the Bible to church to belief in faith from my earliest years it really was a fully Christian environment in which I grew up and lived that result of that was that I was in a family that was very much interested in the Bible and as a result I learned Bible early and
 thoroughly nothing to do with me just that's how I was raised so even as a kid in grade school I remember well you know the time we spent learning all of the trivia of the Old Testament Bible quizzing and all of those things so I was immersed in all of that as I grew up another positive memories are awesome and I think it's even because the Old Testament has so much more trivia than the New Testament that that became an early interest of mine you know a good thing for all the wrong reasons may be a but that idea of being fully immersed so I always knew that I loved Old Testament but I had no clue that there was a career connected to that I thought you know if you'd like to buy but you would be a pastor a missionary you know that didn't really fit with the things that I was thinking but as result when I went to college I majored in economics and it
 that's because basically the vocational test told me you should major in economics and accounting in being a compliant child that's what I did cuz I didn't have any other option and so I went to college with that kind of background and it really wasn't until the end of my junior year when you start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and you figure out this is going to switch from being a major to being a career is that really what I want to do and you know I've been around Christian circles enough Bible camps Retreats summers at Bible Conference is things like that I knew the routine what are your passions you do the inventory your passions and gifts and hid think through all of those things I was having this introspective time conversation with with the Lord didn't this spring break and I'm thinking you know I don't know that I really want to spend my life doing accounting it's great but
 it just doesn't feel like it's me now so I'm thinking okay so what what do I what am I passionate about one of course I'm passionate about Old Testament that boy but but there's no career with Old Testament I mean there's nothing you can do with that unless you were going to teach it or something and it just never ever occurred to me in about 5 minutes if this wasn't a week-long retreat with prayer and fasting know this is a 5-minute suddenly the eyes pop open and you say their people to teach this stuff I'm going to do that and it was immediate switch route so I started taking Greek and Hebrew the next year and then moved into my graduate work from there so that's kind of how I got into it I was always interested in it I just didn't realize that there is a connection to be made sure and was there a specific teacher or class or kind of what you're saying was you just always had an interest and then it was this
 internal process that kind of clicked I'm guessing there was some teachers that you saw his models you like that's the thing I want to do eventually there were but of course I never studied the Old Testament academically I mean in college even though I was an economics major I took all the electives in the religion department but it was a religion department it wasn't a biblical studies department and it was not in a school that really cared much about the authority to text so it really wasn't until I got into my graduate work at Wheaton for my Master's that I started having teacher who you're with teaching me in at things of that sort about that material I think probably the biggest influence on me was in my Ph.D program my supervisor was hung on Brookdale a rabbi scholar and as I reflect back what I have come to understand is that he's the one who taught me to say
 to be curious to ask questions to look around for answers that maybe you hadn't thought of before to interrogate yourself about the texting about your interpretation to develop evidence and to be able to substantiate it to build a position to humbly recognize the limitations in the position that you take your all of those things just about thinking and critical study and I credit that to him along with other professors that I had it keep reunions but that's what I learned how to think through those things man what a gift you know is I think about it too I can trace a handful of influential figures and it wasn't just the content that you learn from them it was the mode of how to even think about something problem from the start like I do get acquainted how do you learn how to probe exactly all the things that you described that's really good and I haven't heard Herbert Herbert oh yeah
 that's what people called him I was in college I was first exposed his work I think it was an essay on the Elijah narratives and then I think all I've ever read other than that it was a long steady did on the golden calf narrative it was brilliant he did he did brilliant work he really did and I really did just really made you think through you know we had very different presuppositions about biblical texts but we both respected it until the challenge was to make the things that you observe and study dick in his contacts and of course that required me to depend on evidence more than on my presuppositions which may differ from ones that he had thank you thanks for that kind of personal a bit of personal by H I just always find a time goes on in biblical scholarship and I meet more and more Scholars I'm just always fascinated different temperaments and stories and how you end up in this wonderful field is just always so
 so so we invited you on podcast today because a big theme in your work throughout the years and was so when I say your work looks like a lot of books now you've been really busy and working in writing the nearest about 30 yeah so far it's just a thank-you your work has been a big influence and helped and stimulus in my own journey of learning and you've made a big contribution to the Bible project to use that influence to thank you it's great when the things that you do find a reception so now just kind of like a metal theme throughout all of those bucks and all of the talks and so on there for GPS so big steam underlying is the importance of understanding the ancient cultural context of the Hebrew scriptures one more personal but also kind of foundation on cuz it underlies all your work when did this Dawn on you as being something I don't need this just really important in understanding scripture but something
 that the audience you wanted to address if there's a deficiency or there's something missing that you thought man this is I really need to get this out there why do you care about this so much yeah I started to recognize it through my Graduate Studies and it was somewhat gradual but really didn't involve a huge shift at any point I've been raised to the context where the authority of scripture was important and of course it's one thing to say it's another thing to try to figure out what are the implications of that and how does that affect my hermeneutics my approach to the text what's important and what's not how do I weigh evidence against him until all of those things that I was picking up at Hebrew Union again in a different presuppositional context I had to try to bring them into the idea of the authority of the texting that made me work very very hard on hermeneutics that is so what counts what counts in our interpretation what counts as strong evidence that how do I make sure that my
 convictions about Authority are Rippling through my interpretation now what I eventually came to to call that is the idea of being accountable if we consider the text authoritative then we submit to it and that means we're accountable to it now in the large scope we could talk about being there for accountable to God because we considered inspired and therefore it comes from God up it's in some sense God's voice and we are accountable to God but of course it doesn't work that way because we all don't have our hotline to Heaven God has chosen to place his voice in a in a variety of ways in these human instruments that we often call authors but sometimes our editors are compilers these human instruments God has chosen to work through them and that means if I'm going to be accountable to God I have to be accountable to the instruments that he chose to use not that that's the critical building block
 this involved because once I admit that that I'm accountable to those human instruments now I've got issues of language and culture and literature that become not just important to but essential so I began to see that if I was going to be accountable to those human instruments that God used as my wife being accountable to God I needed to understand their language better I needed understand their culture better because as I increasingly came to recognize all communication takes place of courts in a language but also in a culture and as a result I felt like I really needed to understand whatever cultural aspects might be there the things that go without saying to an Insider conversation we're not insiders the authors and Their audience were insiders and their shared information that didn't have to be set
 I'm an outsider we all are and so we come to the text and we have to make up the slack for those things that didn't need to be said and I came to understand how significant culture was in all of that and of course that culture is only recoverable to us through the literature literature is an imperfect reflection of the culture but it's all we've got we we got material culture that's also important but there's rocks and stuff until I so I began really diving into the ancient literature at the time I was in grad school might have been the same for you most people were using ancient literature and comparative studies with Hebrew Bible we're discussing about borrowing or not borrowing and I found that distracting and not really the issue I wasn't really interested in who might have borrowed from
 homework whether the Israelites could have had a copy of this or that piece of literature in front of them and whether they were reworking it or not their questions but they're not ones that get to the core of what I was interested in I wanted to know about the ways that Israel was embedded in the culture not the ways that they might have been indebted to various pieces of literature and I think many people who read me still don't understand that they still want to push the discussion to it indebtedness and a borrowing and those kinds of issues I'm not interested I want to try to understand the embeddedness because that's the way that I can be accountable to the authors and especially the level of things that are not being said but that everybody understood yeah thank you for that real clear train of thought it makes me think of John I'm talking to John John Collins it makes me think I mean this has been a continuing theme throughout our
 4 years
that first building block that John has mentioned about being accountable to God through these texts means being accountable The Language and Cultural medium of this text to me was interesting John Walton you're describing I mean your kind of summarizing your intellectual journey of processing this through for you John Collins that process has been more shots there's no more tension there for you it seems as you know something about our conversations over the years we talked about what Paradigm you bring to the Bible and the Paradigm I grew up with the Bible is that it is a rule book or theological dictionary and I should just be able to read it and understand it and there's almost a sense of like it falling out of heaven in this pristine form so when you start talking about having to learn ancient
 picture to understand the Bible suddenly it started to feel just felt strange to think the god of the universe didn't think of a easier way to communicate with me then having to understand ancient languages in Asian culture and not that you have to understand those things but that to really start getting more to the heart of what's going on you do need to appreciate those things and so why is it that that's the communication medium to pick out of the University of us. We're not going to answer here but we talked a lot about being a good tourist being someone who doesn't come with our own he's up position of the world and and try to understand what these ancient writers are doing well communication is always contextualized read the Bible project all about doing that sort of thing didn't realize it is always contextualized that means if God was going to communicate he
 did you sew into a context he had to use a language if he's going to communicate to human beings he has to use a language she has to use a culture they're Inseparable so in one sense you can say what you got to do you know the limitations not on his side the limitations on our side that's how we receive communication now he could do it again every generation he could do it again to each of us as individuals we can argue with what methods God chose to use but the minute we realize that he communicated in time in space in a culture in a language we then have to acknowledge our responsibility to try to step into that Circle of communication I grew up the same way that you mentioned the idea that we should be able to go to open our Bible you are quite a time in the morning the birds are singing in the sun shining through the windows in my quietroom and open my bible and just to let it wash over me there's a sense in which of course
 when we open God's word the spirit can speak to us I get that I agree with that that's not the same thing as interpretation okay and so if we're going to interpret we need to use tools are we need to have controls now at that sense we still like to use kind of our intuition K but as I talk about a cultural river that metaphor the idea that when we use our intuition we are thinking and working from our cultural River and that is not a reliable approach to interpretation it's not that it's always wrong but it's not reliable because again we we have all kinds of baggage that we bring in from our cultural River and we have all kinds of levels of ignorance regarding their culture and we need to try to remedy that and so yes you're right John that makes it work and we don't like to think of our Bible reading as requiring
 we'd rather be intuitive people do think that the spirit is going to give you the right interpretation have missed something important about the spiritual ask him this question I'll ask you the same question if we didn't have these ancient texts and now we're talking specifically about the Genesis 1 and 2 creation story stories if we didn't have these other contemporary text to them and yeah I just knew that alone again or we we just knew nothing about ancient Israelite culture and all we had was the Torah would we be able to understand it I believe it absolutely we would be able to understand what we most desperately need to understand God has plans and purposes and he has communicated those plans and purposes sufficiently for us to be able to understand how we can be participants in them and he is told us the way that we can do that and he is shown
 the way that he's working out those plans and purposes in history in time now that's at the very macro level of theological significance and nobody can miss it but it's a different thing when you say I want to interpret the sons of God and Daughters of men that exegesis not certainly we believe that eventually our exegesis is going to filter up into our theology one hopes you can be dead wrong about the sons of God and Daughters of men for centuries and Millennia which maybe we have and it doesn't necessarily affect your theology now you may make decisions theologically that say oh there are these you know minions of divine beings and you might start to build a reality based on these
 worldly beings and their interaction that's the ology but that's not the big deal with Chi so yeah we have enough to get right what we really really need to get right. You think part of that is even though the scriptures in this case the Hebrew Bible it's embedded in ancient cultural context it's also written by people and I'm a people like a dream by Evans I'm human so there are even those vast differences in culture there are some basics of like light and dark water death and life right these fundamental image but have different connotations and different cultural settings but on that level I can get the communication that like there's a God With a Purpose to bring life humans do stuff that brings death and pain and gods on messenger how do you can get that it doesn't matter what translation you read the Bible if you get that one of the things I say is that culture has changed but people don't change his selfish
 selfless faithful or Unfaithful greedy or generous people throughout the ages people are people and so that's why we can resonate with the characters in scripture yet we shouldn't let that fool us into thinking that cultures are all the same so let's talk about that because while every person on the planet has an idea of what it means to be dad or lost or in the dark the images in the words we use from culture to culture will change and the Bible uses very specific images and words that come from an ancient near East context and I think one of the one of the things that's really helped me which I've got from Tim but also I'm reading your work John is this idea of having to try to understand those images from their cultural context I think the frustration that I have
 up in the church is that if I do that too much who knows where this will lead his kind of the scary like what will happen if I try to allow some translation to occur but I'd love to hear your thoughts on this on this idea of of cultural cognitive translation of a backpack, so we carry around our cognitive backpacks you know that our ideas and the backpack might have a label on it so think about the label creation so we've got this label creation and there are certain basic things that we think about creation what are backpack is full of things for my Diaz that are uniquely ours both in our own culture and across time and space and as I would compare my backpack and it says creation to either of yours there be some differences but there would be a lot of commonality ancient Israel and ancient Babylonia an ancient Egypt also have their backpacks that say creation on them but if you untag their backpacks you going to find a lot of things that are
 very different from what we have in our backpacks and sometimes we get we don't take enough cognisance of the fact that the label doesn't tell you the exact nature of everything in the backpack so I can't go to an ancient Israelite or an ancient Babylonian context and just assume that their backpack to his creation is going to have all the same kind of elements in it that mine does and that's that's not respecting them and it's not going to do justice to their ideas but whatever they have to say about our creation is going to come out of their backpack not out of my they have no idea what's in my backpack
 I don't know if that helps any or not but that's one of the ways that I think about sort of how this content can vary even though the general labels are similar
what's comparison of items from the backpack so really you're in this series of this conversation and actually read some of the coffin text from customology we read some of the new met Alicia and processed it together and then we do then to Genesis one really just verses 1 and 2 so let's take out some of these Concepts like concepts of creation cuz you brought that up or even maybe more fundamentally like what does it mean for something to be or to exist and just kind of paint that sketch of like an Egyptian says here's what it means to create or to be a witness Reliance Babylonian well actually of course creation and existence are inevitably related if creation generally means to bring something into existence if you have a an assumption about what constitutes existence and that gets back to one of the basic differences that I've tried to identify as we read the Bible because I'm convinced that the Israelites
 shared with most of the rest of the ancient world a concept of existence that's very different from ours and the way that I've expressed that is in what I initially called a functional ontology that something exists ontology when it has a function I've tweaked that some by leaning more toward the word order so the idea that me when I talk about function in my initial work I talked about the idea that things existed when they had a function a roll and a purpose in an ordered system and there's we get to work order and I've come to think that that's more important than the word function that in the ancient world something existed when it was ordered and it was outside order it didn't exist so it for the Egyptians they talk about the sea as non-existent
 they talk about the desert does not exist it the idea that they are not integrated into the ordered system as they understood it course we know well today how important to see in the desert are for Ecology and all of those kind of things but as they understood order which is order focused on them Humanity those things were outside of the ordered system and so to them they did not exist John Kahn so we had a whole conversation about it down with an Egyptian I want you to ask John what did you imagine me with it and I'm really grateful that you did and so I was actually really curious to hear how John what would we have this idea of there was nothing and then there was something and so it which is funny because if you really start thinking about what is nothing your brain spins and it's becomes impossible life
 but that's important to us it's idea of of nothingness and so I'm wondering if you sat down with an ancient Egyptian and you're like what do you mean by the abyss Morning Show Israelite what is what is that we have this idea of nothingness is that what you mean if they were able to understand what I mean by nothingness would they go oh yeah that's what I mean I mean nothing this I'm not sure that
 they would have thought much about I don't want to say they wouldn't understand cuz I don't want to be a realistic here but I don't know that they would have thought much about a world with no matter some people think that especially the Egyptians did but it's not Central for their thinking and they quickly moved to something would you price we have to do even when we talk about Big Bang cosmology we can't really talk about before the bang we just without words to do so so for them but nothing didn't mean that there was no material they're more interested in whether there was order or not so I can't really answer whether they would have comprehended nothingness as we might discuss it but in some of my work I talked about the difference between a house and a home and the idea that one way you can talk about the origins of the place you live is to talk about
 the building of the house the framing the siding the foundation the roof the electricity the plumbing right that's the physical material house and you can talk about the building of a house and we consider that a manufacturing a creation process but then there's a different level and that is making that house your home how is your house going to function how were the rooms going to be ordered what furniture goes where what room are you going to use in which way what's my route what's your room what's the kitchen and so ordering is what makes it a home now building a house is not the same thing as making a home but they are both creative activities which is more important or you can say we can't have the home without the house although explore other cultures and you might come to different ideas about that but you could also say but what could the house if it's not a home and so you could prioritize
 when where the other when we in our culture tell creation stories we want the house story cuz that's what science does and that's what we want to understand and there's value in that but when the ancient world talk about creation they wanted a home story they wanted an understanding of kind of how things work in the environment in which they live and that's also important and you could argue all day which one's more important but in one sense it might be a chicken-and-egg kind of discussion one way and maybe think about it is there's these Core Concepts humans across culture and time have had a mental category for there's what is and then there's the opposite of what is there is creation and something and then there's non creation and not no thing and so we were trying to say one in this conversation is different cultures have different whole imaginations
 around those two concepts but then the second part that's interesting is what's the possibility of real cross-cultural understanding and conversation between those Concepts sowjanya your John Collins you're talking about could you an ancient Egyptian reach Mutual understanding about a concept of nothing this is a fascinating question to think about I guess that's as much as to say could you you know go to a different part of Portland OR do I add another country in the world and talk to somebody have a different culture about whatever Justice or family and that's right it's the same kind of question ever asked we all know the cross-cultural communication is fraught with inherent places where we don't even know we don't understand each other but we do very deeply I almost imagine the ancient Israelite turning to me and going your idea of nothingness is weird like I get it now but I don't get it because what is what is nothing
 and isn't more important to talk about order and meaning then nothingness and I think they might actually help me a little bit and that conversation and you're getting the issue there because it comes down to a matter of what is your desired conversation what's hopeful what's relevant to you in your cultural context if I can check quickly and it was stration I use for that I think about you going to play and you get tied up in traffic and construction and parking problems and you end up walking into the theater half an hour late intermission comes and you poke the person next to you and you say how did the play begin and he says well the script is written in the 1930s it was very part and you say no no no no no I don't want to know that this what you can't have a play without a script how can I play begin without a script
 and the person on the other side of you says oh she says I can answer it this stage was built to suit this black box theater and you say no no no I don't really care about when the set was built she says the play couldn't happen without the set I mean it's very important I get it I get it by the person behind you say chips in and says I want the cast was chosen and turned out now I'm not asking about the cast the table there's no play without a cast okay I'm finally in your frustration you say what happened since the curtain opened now this is not a matter of competing truths they are all correct true ways to answer the question and they all actually do answer the question at least in part but there's an issue of what is the information that is important to me and anybody who tells the creation story any culture that frames occur
 in stories framing it and that sort of relevance Theory kind of way what is it that is most important to us about creation and if we go and tell each and Israelites that they really need to be more concerned about the building of the set that's our problem not theirs and that becomes our misinterpretation because they're not talkin about that that's a great illustration
is it okay I want to take us kind of back and then forward to something you brought up earlier John Walton about the indebtedness or the embeddedness of the equation are there than in the Bible Genesis 1 as ancient custom ology probably less copies than most popular version but I really appreciate it that what I really appreciate it and it was there and then I thinking your other work. Just engineer Easter thought in the Old Testament you talk about what we need them as soon as a spectrum of the biblical officers might just take for granted and assume certain ideas with their Engineers from Neighbors and then on the opposite end of that would be they actually are trying to provide an alternative or a counter to an idea that's very common and then within that Spectrum there would be a whole variation of ways that the vehicle authors
 can interact with ideas in their culture environment so I thought maybe was taken example you know from Genesis 1 and so whether you want to choose whether it's like the back of separating there's so much dividing and separating in Genesis 1:1 maybe the act of naming you creating a Genesis one those are shared motifs across a generous and cosmology is but the question is are the biblical authors assuming that act but also shaping it in the unique way that's different than how it depends are Babylonians what do it of course that's the most fundamental dictum of comparative studies their similarities and differences and you ignore either one of them to your risk to your peril because you really need to take a can of both so in one book that I did ancient near Eastern thought in the Old Testament I tried to develop all the levels of similarity so we understand how the Israelites are immersed in the ancient world and another book I did Old Testament theology for Christian
 I started with the ancient world but then tried to show all of the ways that Israel developed different a distinctive even unique ways of thinking the really didn't have much to do with ancient water so you can approach it from either end and both can bring productive results and the Genesis Narrative of course they share so much with the ancient world you already mentioned separating and naming as creative acts cuz when you're ordering two separate to distinguish things is part of that ordering to say this belongs in this room and not in that are part of making your home to name something no labeling is a wave to finding it and therefore is also a way of ordering and so those are things that they share with the ancient world and they're really when we think about it there's things that we can resonate with we just don't tend to think of them as creation because we are so scientifically minded in our approaches but
 they also thought about light and the celestial bodies and the dry land emerging from water the the Seas that they thought of all of these things the same way that people did in the ancient world are there's nothing really that distinguishes their Cosmic geography from the ancient world and so they thought about the world in the same way they thought about the idea of image of God and that's something that is pervasive in the ancient world but yet at the same time they did something very different with it they democratized it everybody is the image of God although less even to find out a little bit it's not like each individual is the image of God it's that Humanity as a whole as a corporate group is the image of God again they're not individualist they don't think like we do on that count their thinking of corporate identity that's different from us
 hey Bill we're only the King was the image of God and so in that sense again during the same room of conversation but they bring something different into the room and so in that sense we can see over and over again throughout the Old Testament that phenomena they're in the same room but they're bringing some different things into it they're very comfortable in that room so they don't always get along with the other people in the room it actually sounds a lot like the annual biblical studies Conference of the Society of the interest that they have a lots of different angles yeah thank you that that spectrum is is really helpful and and maybe this is just personal because when I was first introduced to these Concepts Bible College it was more of the either the Bible is unique and stands out in the ancient world or it was borrowing so I just was immensely helped by the Spectrum
 you begin to show and demonstrate that there would be a whole Spectrum not just a binary of unique borrowing maybe let's let's drill in on another text example from the early Genesis narratives that kind of shed some light on this whole topic cut from a different angle so Genesis wanted to begin with two narratives you have the 7-Day sequence creation narrative that we call Genesis one but actually it bleeds in the Genesis 25 22 verse 3 chapter to visit didn't have the Eden story which begins welders debate does it begin in Genesis 24 25 and that's something for another day but it goes through the end of chapter 3 of a really kind of continues on McCain and we got two narratives Genesis one begins with darkness and way too much water the Eden Story begins with Wilderness and not enough water Genesis 1 famously has humans as a climax
 after the animals Genesis to its opposite it's humans first and then the animals and so on so how do I receptions about all these things we've been talking about how have people throughout history approach these two narratives standing next to each other and how they relate to each other in terms of time sequence and so on to me that's always just been really helpful test case to how to my assumptions prepare me to see these two stories and how they relate in it in a certain way and then how does all of this open up with the biblical authors assume and why they feel perfectly fine putting these two narratives right next to each other. The mainstream biblical Scholarship today which is inclined to see them as reflecting two different sources and therefore two different stories and they don't shy away from considering them competing stories that's in the mainstream traditionally people have tended to think that Genesis to the Eden story is a recapitulation of day6 and that you're supposed to
 pick it up and just prop it in today 6 and that in that few some of those differences that you mentioned to become a little bit bothersome because if this is a recapitulation day6 and why is it that we have these differences so mainstream doesn't really care about the difference is a highlight them and use them to say these are just conflicting stories I would say I don't think sources is the issue regardless of whether there could have been sources or not that's not the issue but likewise I don't accept that chapter 2 is a recapitulation of day6 I think the difference between them is that chapter one is establishing order in the cosmos at the cosmic level chapter 2 is establishing order at the terrestrial level so instead of taking the whole view three-tiered Universe it's now moved to this tier and therefore non order is reflected
 the 12 and the cosmic stage where everything is non order everything is darkness and see non orders expressed on the terrestrial level with regard to people and their productivity and planting and harvesting and growing which is what those words into five and six really tie into and tell him that since they're just telling the story from a different perspective going back to the play and how did the play begin well there different ways to answer that depending on what Vantage Point you're adopting so I do not see chapter 2 is simply a recapitulation of day 6 chapter 1 day 6 does not mention Adam and Eve does not suggest that there only two people it just doesn't talk about it chapter 2 is now going to drill down on this particular aspect and it's telling a different story and so I think we do an injustice in the text if we try to enter
 awesome but likewise we do it in just answer the text if we try to problematize them against one another but they're both telling important stories and important levels of our experience and our existence and they both have important things to say I'm inclined these days to almost avoid labeling them as Origins stories because in our cultural River our modern world we immediately think of science when we think of origin's so I think it's more on track to talk about Genesis 1 as an account of cosmic identity and the Eden story as an account of human identity is trying to say who we are in relationship to God in relationship to one another in relationship to the animals in relationship to everything around us who are we are dust and that's an important state about Who We Are
 not about what we are and so I think that again this is one of those shifts of what's in our backpack you know the minute you say Origins we've got a backpack and we start unpacking the science so let's relay for the backpack here that it's really all about identity and that gives you a different perspective because even today identities are very important topic of discussion what I hear you saying I just want to say back to you maybe with an illustration as it's helpful if we are going to colonize so to speak the biblical text with our material creation mindset the creation is something out of nothing we see these two narrative sequences as being in somehow in competition with each other or we got to harmonizing is the classic term we got to make the details that what you're saying you're trying to cram the eating narrative in today 6. You also need some stuff from day three about the plant background a 3 and 6 together and always problematic
 this is much more akin to saying the lot more of the way that if John Collins was to sit down and we had a Renaissance portrait made of John Collins actually like to imagine what that would look like the classic Renaissance near wearing like a purple robe and then you were to do a Picasso style portrait you know it was like his cheeks are on one side and then he has two eyeballs and what look like the size of a different angles on the same subject would you say that that's more like how the two narratives relate in Genesis even with that they're not talking about the same thing so they're not proportion to John Collins yeah yeah that's good one is a trying to look at the cosmic level and another is trying to look at you know the terrestrial level human interactions is different from cosmic order so in that sense I think that they're trying to do different things both important things but it's it's really not the same conversation and maybe the Renaissance
 what is a John Collins like in the middle of a town square and the Picasso is you I don't know in your house or something like that anyway can I get what you're after you probably come up with one well they're both about order it's just different levels of of order and then you get to the Torah and that's about ordering society which is different from from kind of the human beings and their border with the larger level
well I want to throw maybe a curveball I think that once you start understanding this it really brings the stories to life and makes them more meaningful and more interesting and doesn't take away the Divinity of them actually brings me closer to to God and my purpose I've gotten there and I'm sure Johnny you seen a ton of students wrestle through this paradigm shift I think one thing that keeps people from getting there is honestly the culture War issues which is are you doing this just so you can then capitulate to evolutionists and be okay with these atheistic cosmology and should we really give them a leg up in a like there's a sense of us versus them have you seen that tension and how do you how do you tend to approach that absolutely and I get accused of that all the time
 people say I'm just doing all of these gymnastics and call you the ancient world in order to make the science that I want to work to work and that's not true and I when I kind of Jacqueline people think that they can unpack your motivations and and know why you're doing something I try not to do that other people and I wish people would treat me with the same respect that at any rate one of the things that I say is if tomorrow morning we would wake up in the headlines on the internet and the News would flash Evolution was proved wrong it couldn't possibly be my lecture that evening on this material wouldn't change a bit I'm still trying to understand the text better the fact that I believe that the interpretation I'm giving you a Genesis means that it's not making scientific statements and that it's there for compatible with a wide range of scientific conclusions dozen
 make me a promoter of some particular scientific view if the whole world changed tomorrow when the prominent science became very different I would still want to ask the same question is the Bible compatible with what the mainstream thinking is that's an important question to ask that's not cuz I'm trying to make myself agree with the mainstream science or promote that science it's just I want to know if there's compatibility and for me that comes down to a very basic distinction which I didn't make up but I think is very important and it's the distinction between mechanism and agency that is science really whether this science or that science or another science science is very much interested in mechanism how did things happen how do things work and that really entails Sciences Pursuits but science can't say much about agency
 they can only talk about making itself inside in writing by agency you're talkin about that there is some sort of purpose or personal intention in a mechanistic process exactly and the Bible talk about agency God's one who did it God gave it order God gave it purpose God give his shape whatever extent they talked about that material and immaterial visible or invisible God did it in the Bible is all about affirming agency and I believe says nothing or at least nearly nothing about mechanism it's just not what is there to address and in that way the Bible about agency and not mechanism science is about mechanism in that agency it's easy to see that they are compatible because anything that sign says about mechanism can be brought into what the Bible says about agency whether you're talkin about the novo immediate things appear or what you're talkin about long process is over billions of years God's the one doing it
 what is the agent and so what we've tried to do is sometimes people read the Bible have tried to make that a story of mechanism and they're certainly scientist who is try to make their science say there is no agent but both of those are errors and we have to recognize what each is doing and you would say that there are not just cuz you disagree with that but their errors and how to think about something there are is Method category are thinking we could talk for a very long time about these things but maybe I'll just try and help us plan the plan to questions that may be short one is so you've been researching and communicating about all this for a couple decades now researching for longer really communicating for a couple decades as you look at students and people who are adopting this and now doing new research and sticking who are you excited about where is there any one of authors
 or organizations that are working with the contextual understanding of the creation narratives but then also integrating with new science and so on optimism about this conversation certainly there are two organizations they could be immediately identified who are doing a lot of work with this integration process using some of the ideas that I developed a lot of courses biologos I here in the United States founded by Francis Collins and now president dead horse, and there's an awful lot of information they're trying to to work this work this intersection this conversation into duty gracious ways which I really really appreciate and another centered at Cambridge is the Faraday Institute which likewise is trying to do a lot at the intersection of faith and science is just too though I'm sure there are more that are doing that they both have websites full of information and
 I'm very much involved with both of those organizations and I really appreciate the the opportunities they give me to contribute to their development of ideas that's great I think we can leave include links in the show notes for those of you listening on the podcast lastly what what are you excited about right now what project are you working on now I don't assume that you're going to want to work on Genesis 12 to your whole life parts of the Bible you're interested in the last three years I've been working intensely on a commentary on Daniel Prayed different end of the of the cannon but where can I buy commentary on Daniel at Swift's erdman's their nicot series and I'm co-authoring it with my colleague Aubrey Buster so we already have passed the 11 hundred pages of manuscript this is going to be so good quite extensive commentary so that's been occupying a lot of my time
 another book that is in the planning stages is that since Lost World of Genesis one came out now more than a decade ago I've learned a lot I've presented it hundreds of times around the world in podcasts in lecture series and I've learned a lot and so I'd like to do a book called advances in the Lost World of Genesis it's not a revision of the books I've already done it's saying what happened since then and so illustrations like I've used on this podcast with house and home with how did the play begin with the backpack get imagery with the focus on order and all of these things which really have developed out of my continuing involvement in these conversations so hopefully we could pick up some of that so those are some of the things that are that are floating around awesome you got a lot of projects in the hopper
 thank you thank you for all of your hard work you're doing it's really helping a lot of people and it's helped us and I have to say I'm really appreciative of what you guys are doing you are reaching an audience that I would never reach and you're doing it in such an effective ways I'm really excited about the ongoing project thanks John thank you and thank you for being on on the podcast here with us today thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast we got one more scholar interview in his cosmology series that's going to be next week we're going to sit down with Dr Joshua swap meet us he works at the intersection of data and genetics really interesting field people called bioinformatics and you might be asking yourself why is Bible project talking about that stuff well you're going to find out I'm really excited for it that's next week following week we are doing a question in response episode we don't have time to accept any new questions for this series so
 we've gotten any questions in excited to hear those and discuss them Bible project is a nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that we did everything we make is free because of the generosity of thousands of people just like you today's episode was made possible by Cooper pelts are producer Dan gummo r-read editor Zac mckinlay assistant editor Lyndsay Ponder with our show notes and the theme music by the band tents thanks again for dr. John Walton spending time with us and thank you for being a part of this with us and I'm from Abuja Nigeria I first heard about the Bible project since 2018 through friends and I use the Bible project us and fight guide in studying the Bible and it helps me to understand the right perspective to the story of the Bible build
 we believe the Bible is a unified story that needs Jesus by Crowder funded projects by people like me find free videos 30 News podcast classes and more as very protective cup
