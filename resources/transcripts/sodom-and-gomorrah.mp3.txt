before we dive into today's episode of quick content warning today's episode contains some heavy subjects including sexual abuse rape and incest
 we are exploring the theme of the city because of that thing we're about to encounter the darkest parts of human nature today we're talking about the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah which brings us face-to-face with some of the most difficult stories in the Genesis Grill all you can talk about the city in the Bible without talking about the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah Babylon is an icon of everything that's wrong with the human City thought and Gomorrah as far as when Abraham inlaw choose to go their separate ways lot looks to the East and see the land that he thinks it looks like the Garden of Eden so he heads out there to Sodom and Gomorrah but when God visit Abraham God tells him of the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah that is great and the outcry of those suffering a writing up to this word outcry is a synonym of the blood of Abel crying out from the ground so when there is an outcry to God that this call to God against some Oprah
 weather for someone is committed Injustice the fact it's Autumn looks like Aidan but in reality it's full of evil and sin is all the language of the Garden of Eden versus the city of Cain the Injustice and oppression in Sodom and Gomorrah is so pronounced that God brings a flood of justice and completely wiped out these two cities it's the lowest point in Genesis story so far you suck me in for moral compasses are so easily scrambled bad becomes good and good becomes bad the store is like a diagnosis that become a warning that I think should make all of us meditate on the little city that is our own self and our community or family and then the cities in which we live today to Mackey and I discussed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for doing this.
 it's a John hello hello hey we get to talk about Sodom and Gomorrah today yeah one installment of our ongoing series of meditations on the theme of the city in the storyline of the Bible the city God first put humans in a garden because I mean all I need is a garden fruit trees and and in the ancient cultural context of the biblical authors cultivated Gardens on high places streams running out of them to water all the lands around was a well-known cultural image of a sacred Place yeah of a heaven on Earth place a place where the divine power or Powers have staked out a little Outpost of Divine Life here on the Dryland so high well watered Gardens you are a sacred place and the Divine place
 not a city in fact when City's art well when it when the city is introduced in the Bible it says a solution to a problem with the surprise of the city which is the ideal setting in Pay just wanted to is of humans and God living in Union together in this ideal spaced we're having another one and it's depicted as it's kind of garden which has deep resonance with the biblical authors ancient cultural context do and then when humans are foolish they violate the one Divine guidelines that they've been given to maintain their presents and life in this Garden they eat from the forbidden fruit and their Exile out of the garden space and then their children get violent and their son Cain was exiled even further from the garden spot and God promises to protect him
 with a sign of a Cane instead goes to do is provide some protection in the form of the city so we're summarizing you know the first four conversations that we've had here so the city was Cain's solution came murdered his brother he was worried someone was going to come and take him out yet bring blood recompense. Promise to protect them pecans like you know what I need I need a wall yes okay so the cities in the Bible are primarily associated with a walled enclosure to keep out the Pelican refer to a walled enclosure of you know what we would call the Village or Hamlet or a town or something that's bigger like a ancient Babylon you know that was surrounded by walls but house tens of thousands of people and as we read on in his genealogy we are introduced to some people who are doing some cool stuff in the city
 sing animal domestication more likely happening outside the city walls but in a little box shoot that connected by Road and protected protected by Kansas City I can't City we hear Metallurgy and the development of iron things to 3 and then the development of the Arts and Music right creative they're a lot like their images of the ultimate creative one so it started out as a way to protect ourselves because of our own violence still was able to birth something good that's right yeah this concentration of creative human images can produce things that are necessary for human flourishing and survival like tools and animal domestication but also things that are not necessary for survival they're just good like the Arts and both
 come out of Kansas City which is cool I mean that's a good thing it is a good thing it's also kind of a neutral thing and then you can use that's right metal to make a plow and you can use it to make a spear yep that's right you can use art to help us understand each other and the world better you can use as propaganda to make at 8 each other misinformation that Spread spread lies or tell stories about reality that are not fully in sync with reality so here we have a city and started in a place of self-protection and now it's creating things that can be used for good or bad and so the human potential is just increasing and then we get to this character lamech who is like you know what I'm going to take all this potential and use it for bad and it's very brief but in telling us that he took two wives instead of one which was identified as the
 Garden ideal and eaten this for a man and a woman for a man to leave his father and mother's house between to his wife so Lemak deviates from that Garden IDL and then he begins taking life by his own authority and power which she claims God's own authority but for himself when he says if God was going to protect cane you know 7 * yeah for murdering someone then you just a certs then God will avenge me 77 * yeah I don't think I told you that but I guess he thinks it got so yeah it's a picture of the scaling of what Canyon did on the race small one-to-one basis is now scaling with the human City of Violence in what do you say self legitimation legitimation the powers of the city to take life and death instead of life so the cities can spread that story
 read life right and that's the portrait of the city from the service pay just let me know about that city is it goes on to produce a lot more death it becomes associated with the giant Warriors that spring out of that weird story about the sons of God and about as human and Genesis 6 but we know that emerge out of that crazy mixing is a whole bunch of that called The Gipper ring for the Violet Warrior Kings of old to have a great name in the land I think it's a portrait of limit like figures but now violating the boundary between heaven and earth right it's talking about Israel would have known as its neighbors of their histories of having Kings who were violence and then their stories were giants and would Define the lad with often with mounting pressure from those early chapters of Genesis you get this contrasts where God has exiled
 is human Partners Into the Wilderness because of their Folly but they're in the wilderness you know it's this is so all human wisdom and whatever artifice and stuff we make it gets Stripped Away and broken down and so humans in the wilderness have a choice we can stay here and meet God in the wilderness and let him test us and remake us or we can go the way of can which is to go reproduce our own fault eaten in the form of a city and spread good and bad throughout the land that's the portrait the cities are primarily their semi neutral but tend more toward negative in the way they're introduced which makes it a surprise then that is you go forward what God does is he's going to redeem the human City and incorporate it into his new creation plans but throughout Genesis and exodus as we're going to see as we go forward into Abraham stories in this conversation is it
 portrait of the city remains still primarily - yes okay so we've left Leigh mix rain is in the city of Kane and things are bad remind me how Nimrod comes into the well so after the flood Noah has three sons the youngest son Tom they say its name in Hebrew he pull some power sexually with his father or with his mother who is called the nakedness of his father he does something in a tent with his dad. His dad is eating of the fruit of the garden and become naked and so then you get this programmatic statement that Noah makes that the line of sham will be the line of the blessing the new Humanity blessing in the lineage of the snake Crusher come through sham and the oldest son off at he's going to get in on that blessing cuz he gets to dwell in the tents
 but the grandson of hum is going to be a subservient and lower and a servant to his brothers and then you're giving genesis10 the table of Nations big genealogy but it's more like a map graphic map of the ancient world is a difficult first thought and divided up into these three lineages in the lineage of that youngest son you know who's disrepute in The Narrative and that guy he's like Canton he's isolated from his brother he sent away and all of his kids are like all the bad guys in the Bible Egypt comes from half line and then hamsun Koosh gives birth to a son named Nimrod who then goes on to build Babylon and Assyria and then you get the narrative about the building of the city of Babylon in Genesis 11 where it's presented
 the human creation that's meant to reunite heaven on Earth the trend of Drayton Bridge back up to the skies to make a name for themselves and God brings the flood of Justice on by scattering the project cuz he says man of humans unite and use the city to focus all of this distorted way of seeing reality that they've created in the city then that will be really bad for creation so at this point we should be highly suspicious of cities yes very worried about humans inclination to build cities there's this sense of man we need to get back to the Garden which my thought is I would hate to lose all the innovation of the Cities you know but that sounds biblical authors are dwelling on necessarily we're going to get there like we're just at the early parts of the same way you know but the biggest greatest City
 scattered yeah that's right and got confuses everyone's language so they can't now work together in a unified way and they have to then spread out and so in this Gathering we then get the genealogy that leads to a room that's right the leads to Abram and God tells Abraham like a I'm going to the city give you a big family big family and a great name and a green named and we learn this feeling like a nation and a nation is going to need a place to live place to be yeah so Abram is called out of the scattering Babylon in from the region of Babylon Southern his family were told them urges and so he goes on this great track through uninhabited lands to go west to the land of Canaan we're going to focus on this conversation and then particularly this Dynamic and Abram is named his change Abraham in Genesis 17
 he is depicted primarily a somebody who hangs out on the margins of cities that you're just never was there's only one story of well there's just a couple stories of him going into cities proper and never goes well when you go to Egypt or you go down to Egypt but then also he ends up in the city of garage door and he lies about his wife a second time and that lay still hold a series of bad situations so the cities that Abraham encounters become the setting for for bad things happened to the people in the city is also him like Abrams the lines to make decision making process but mostly the Abraham stories take place out in the fields and in the wilderness surrounding cities and that it's going to be an important contrasts on throughout a I like to do there is one super important city that features
 the Abraham stories and that is actually a network of cities five cities but two of them have become famous Sodom and Gomorrah and so I'd like to take us on the trail that leads to what happens to Sodom and Gomorrah and then Abraham's roll got invites Abraham into a special role in relationship to the city and what happens out of that but you can't talk about the city in the Bible without talking about the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah cuz they're like icons of if Babylon is an icon of everything that's wrong with the human City Sodom and Gomorrah is like a close second it's just like right alongside their kind of mirror images of each other so how does a story about Abraham intersect with the story of Sodom and Gomorrah well it begins in Genesis chapter 13
 so we've talked about the story and our tour through the Torah last year also in the firstborn series we talked about the story you're actually so this is early when abrahamism still Abraham when he goes into the land that God promised him the land of Canaan and he's got a lot of stuff in the form of lots of tents lots of people working for him and then Mobile City town and lots of animals he's got an animal domestication program gone and what we're told also is his nephew lot came with him from the East his nephew lot have lots of the same
 and they can't sit on one piece of land they're migrating herds and all their Shepherds fighting so they're cruising through the hillside setting up and letting the animals go and eat the grass and their live in kind of there just you would call when I call this kind of lifestyle semi-nomadic or they're they're migrating herds men camps yeah that migrated around seasonally to where all the best pasture and grass is following the weather patterns and yeah just like a live here which is actually is interesting because that's the opposite of setting up a farm which then leads to then setting up a city walls around so you're not settle in one place you depend on God's provision through the weather to provide what you need for your operation which means that you're kind
 only going from spot to spot based on what God provides and then if we're in the city you just settle and you just make all your own provisions of course dependent on your forces but it's easy to forget yes they do depend on God when you live in the city we're talking about this is if this is ancient mentality I think about this all the time ride my bike run Portland and it's like there's not one square millimeter of the space anything that even looks like maybe natural like what it did before I got got all paved over and built you know hundred fifty years ago has been cultivated to look like how it might have looked beforehand but like none of these trees original anymore and that comes a maybe a couple yeah that like they're just the world that humans didn't make right when all you knows the city that's interesting is if you do settle down build a city you can just pack more more people in and
 can build pretty great cities and here we have a story where Abraham and lot realize like the way we're operating out here outside the city outside the city we can't cram ourselves together on this one else yes that's right that's right in the reason was because their herds men were fighting over here it also seems like it's the case of maybe there's not enough grass fresh grass while their animals but also like our Shepherd's just can't stand each other and violent Cain and Abel such a separation in fact win Abram is trying to reason with what what he says it's listening Genesis 13:8 don't let there be a dispute between me and you in between my Shepherds in your shepherd's we are brothers are brothers so then Abram solves the problem though in a reversal of Kane's violence he opens his hand
 doesn't believe there's enough that God will be General yes that's right Abraham believes there isn't enough that's right and he says lot you can you decide where to go and I'll go and I'll take the rest because there's enough that's right so we explored the story out of what I want to focus on here is it from says you picked the first spot where you want to be and I'll go somewhere else and so Genesis 1310 were told lot listed his eyes he saw all the Valley of the Jordan River so he's looking East down out of the hills looking East to the valley of Jordan River it was entirely watered
 you like a watery Lush Valley that sounds like eating and had to get the narrator to stop the description of the valley and inserts this was before Yahweh ruined Sodom and Gomorrah and they picked up the description again it was like the garden of Yahweh it was like the land of Egypt which apparently is also like the garden of y'all at that's going to be important as far as you go to so are so sore as far east as far as one of the one of the towns in Easton Valley Lotto store em self of course
 the eating spot there and he journeyed Eastward but we were just told he's choosing a spot that looks like heden but they're just gonna for some reason to get ruined you always going to ruin it because you're supposed to know that it's out of the morons out there so it's a good example where the narrator assumes hey dear reader if you read the story for the first time the cities that are in the valley that lot just feels yeah they're going to get toasted but this before any of that happened the narrator kind of drops a little trail of breadcrumbs letting you know that he didn't make a good choice this was a poor choice he was going off of what it look like
 but what in reality it was outside the lands that you always has blessed so the reason I bring this up as the first time I saw him come or as mentioned in it seems like the whole point is it seems like a good place seems like an eating spot but it's a spot that it's going to get ruined in your life. Why I don't know the reason why so he got to keep rocking Abram dwell in the land of Canaan Esther lot he dwelt in the cities of the valley there's a red city is in the city's yep he's not in the valley just roaming around anymore he's like to hang out in the city so Abram were told is dwelling out outside the city regions by The Oaks of mamre thereby Hebron a City so he's you know the District of a city but he's he's hanging out in the forest in the trees in the Hills where you build an altar to Yahweh
 contrast lot he just goes right into the city's he's just City Life City Life and then reversed 13 were told now Start Spreading the News 13 years old now to Yahweh the men of Sodom where he set up his tent in the city they were Raw Liver bad Hebrew word is raw word that was introduced back in the Garden of Eden and they were a team because translated as Sinners but the word send means to morally fail fail morally but the word bad in the word send come from the Eden narrative we know about Sin the last time that we're too. It was loaded in the story of Cain and I was the last time. So what I know about Sin is Sin is like sin is a snake that will tell you a story in your heart and your mind
 about how there's not enough and I need to take and build for myself what I need to because I can't trust God to provide or protect me the word sin is associated with that in the story of Cain so now here's another city actually became kind of people full of people like the snake or people who follow the direction of the snake Macy is what is bad and they are
 captive to send very much so we're setting up something bad's going to go down in Sodom that's what we're all the way here and chapter 13 so all of these themes just sit here simmering in the background until much later in the story in chapter 18 and hear the really the story about the ruin of Sodom and Gomorrah begins proper and Genesis 18th but that's the office do it cuz I'll just see it little lines little phrases that are connected with hyperlinks so that the fact that Sodom looks like heden but in reality it's full of evil and sin is all the language of the Garden of Eden versus the City of Kent and it's drawing on all those connections for Mark UniFirst few conversations so with that in mind we're expecting that Sodom will become like a greater than
 on the city of cane that was before 7 Genesis 18 Abraham and Sarah are still waiting for her son and we're told that you always shows up to visit Abraham in the form of three humans the rating for a son still waiting another story that's right God promised them a great family went to do I guess say that and then you kids they try to produce a son by their own wisdom through an Egyptian slave Hagar and that resulted in a lot of pain and Division in the family and in Genesis 18 Yahweh Yahweh comes and Promises than the Sun but you always appears in the form of three humans and one of the humans began talking and the narrator just calls that human Yahweh but then July, who are these other two so after God promises that there's going to be a sun going to them Genesis 1816 the story picks up from here we've never talked about the store
 so what we're told is after they have that conversation about the future child of Abraham and Sarah Genesis 18 or 16 the men arose from there and they looked down upon Sodom that makes it there up in the hills and member lot looked down to the East and he could see the valley and down to Sodom and so now the man arose from their neck okay well there were three of them there so I guess the three guys got up and they look down upon Sodom and over hum was going with him to send them up like any good host we are 17 and you always said so we know that y'all appeared as one of the humans
 so it's just interesting. Haven't you always said and what happens if Yahweh has this conversation with himself in front of Abraham in front of Abraham should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do this is so funny it's like well I guess not since you're saying it in front of them and Abraham's about to like here and speak up for Abraham will certainly become a nation Great and Powerful and all the nations of the land will discover blessing through him indeed I have known him so that he would command his sons and his house after him that they should keep the way Yahweh by doing what is right by doing what is just so that y'all way will bring upon Abraham already spoken about him
 weird conversation to have with yourself in front of the person that you know what I mean
 and you always says you have a second speech the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah it is huge and their sin it is heavy very much the outcry outcry against the outcry yep literally it's a Hebrew phrase the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah but this word outcry is a synonym of the blood of Abel crying out from the ground so when there is an outcry to God call for justice call to God against some oppressor when someone is committed Injustice so what the phrase means is the outcry against so there's that have a Prussian happening in front of the word violence and Injustice that there's a crying out you would imagine from those being a prize from the oppressed in Sodom and
 God is hearing and their sin again that word that goes back to Kane in the city build their sin is heavy very much I should go down
 so that I can see if the outcry that has come up before me is what they have completely done and if not then I'll know God has to go see for himself God portrayed here as a judge there is an accusation that the Risen against a city and what a righteous judge will do is not judged hastily just by report they will go investigate and see if the outcry matches the reality and if so there's time to bring justice so I think it sounds funny to us cuz we're just like will of God knows he knows but the narrator wants us to imagine like God's this righteous judge and he's deliberating with a crew like having a conversation and you like I get there are three of them there this is kind of a Divine Council type of moment than Divine Council moment this is so this is important.
 speech right there in versus 2221 Genesis 18 is drawing language from three different stories earlier in Genesis so when y'all where sister can what is this you have done you can front scan the voice of the blood of your brother is crying up from the ground the outcry and let God says here is the outcry has reached me I need to go see if it matches what somebody has done when it says the outcry has come up before me
 that's connected to What God Says after the Nephilim in the gibborim spread the violence in the days before the flood and God says the end of All Flesh has come up before me and the word end the word the end has come by both Rhymes and is a synonym with the word outcry here when you always says about Sodom and Gomorrah I should go down to see
 this is what you always said to the Divine Council
 about the city of Babylon Yahweh came down to see the city in the tower and said look this is what they've begun to do now nothing which they purpose will be impossible for them so come let us go down and confuse their language so no words this moment was Sodom and Gomorrah is being portrayed as Sodom and Gomorrah brings together into one city what earlier in the story was about the city of Kane the generation of the flood and the story of Babylon all wrapped up in Sodom and Gomorrah so if you're falling all these you realizing God speech here
 is depicting Sodom and Gomorrah as a mess like this is as bad as Kane's violence know it's as bad as the violence during the time of Noah it was so bad God it wasn't flood to wipe it all clean No in fact this is as bad as the Tower of Babylon which was when all of humanity were trying to become reach Divinity on their own to their own tools and wisdom and got asked out of that threat recalled that both the flood and the story of Babylon are about either Spiritual Beings Crossing out of their appropriate boundary come down to the realm of humans that's the sons of God that's a sword Before the Flood the last straw wear and then Babylon is the inverse it's a human trying to assess
 into the heavens but by their own wisdom and skill to make a name for themselves so they're inverted and what we're going to see in the story to follow about Sodom and Gomorrah it's packed with hyperlinks and key phrases that link all the way back to these three stories the story of Cain in the city the story of the Nephilim in the flood and the story of the Tower of Babylon so in this phrase we just read this little paragraph. Speech it's already set us up to expect that Sodom and Gomorrah are like a new city of Cain new generation of the flood new Babylon and that's just going to start to notice all sorts of hyperlinks in the story to follow so that's important as we read the story of Sodom and Gomorrah which I think we should do this is what we came for
 you ready
so what happens next in the narrative proper we could spend a whole episode just on what happens now
 Abraham of course overhears what God is saying to go she ate and hold on are you telling me there's no rights as people in that City and that you're going to just sweep away the righteous and the wicked together in one act of Justice he says far be it from you who is the righteous judge the Justice bring her own all the land what you do justice but what he does as he begins interceding on behalf of the righteous and the city and he thinks that God is going to be stingy So It Begins like in bartering mode and God just doesn't play the game at all he just gives Abraham everything he wants so what if there's fifty righteous okay I won't really 45 and then goes down to 4030 then goes down to 20 then he goes down to 10 and at
 Point God doesn't he just just like go to message yep yep so it's as if the narrative is portraying Abraham is perceiving the God will be less merciful and then he has to barter and then every step God is more merciful than Abraham ever anticipated and it's interesting that Abraham is the one who stops at 10
 which leaves open the question of like well or don't want what about what what about none
 what's the score of the flood well enjoy it down to 11 righteous it's the same word righteous to be clear is that really the logical destroy the flood is God is like look there is not one but Noah right yep that is the right this one here as it's going to turn out there is only one but it's interesting even lot is depicted as kind of morally questionable and the one that the narrative has named the righteous one is the guy sitting here interceding cuz just three chapters ago we learned the Abraham was counted as righteous before God because of his face so Abraham's the right to Swan but he's not in the city so you have in this it's a Twist you have the righteous ones and on the high place in the counsel of God but it's a human interceding on behalf of the wicked City down below where I have a nephew who I guess maybe he'll be counted as right to speak
 Abraham really interesting this whole thing is a meditation on the righteous intercession on behalf of the many I'd like to make a video about the interview for the mediator cuz it is you have no righteous Among Us real but you have one I guess you have one righteous Israelite intercessor who is the servant and if that one intercedes before God God will forgive the many and that this is your your Jobe Revelation to me is an image of the suffering into set a 30-minute sensor and it's when do the emerges from his suffering and intercedes for his friends that's what God forgives them big medicine if that leads up in the role of the high priest is in there and then all of these images get bound together in the Gospels
 Apostolic writing anyway so this story that I said we weren't going in that what Noah did After the flood was intercede on behalf of Creation with his sacrifice is not so no is intercession comes after the flood judgement here Abraham's intercession comes before he's trying to prevent it so you walk away okay so if there's ten righteous I guess God won't ruin the city so I may just have to read on and we're told then Yahweh went away when you finish speaking to Abraham in Abraham return to his place what's going to happen next
 Genesis 19 verse one now the two Messengers went to Sodom in the evening the 202 they give you the key information long after you need it for her which forces you go back and reread it tonight you're like so I guess it was Yahweh and two angels are the two angels came to chill with Abraham messenger is a word for Angel messenger is the Hebrew word that gets translated to English translations has angel in the Old Testament is just the Hebrew word for Messenger and its use of human Messengers to okay but it's a spiritual being so just to recap because this is really dense Abraham is visited by three Cubans but then Abraham start calling one of them Yahweh in the narrator says the narrator says, Yahweh visits Abraham and Abraham saw three humans
 does some sense you're always there but every humans are there it's this weird puzzle what's going on but now we're moving forward and Yahweh has said you know we're going to go check out Sodom and Gomorrah now we get in the chapter 19 and two Messengers go to sign with Maurice like two of the three you're saying is you meditate on that she kind of think okay so it was Yahweh tattoo of the Divine Council Angels they had the Divine Council moment Abraham was invited in and now the angels are going out and remember so you have to Angelic representatives of the Divine Council and they are entering into the city that's in a region that looks like the garden of y'all lay to Angels Cry entering into the garden of Yahweh and they're about to bring fire
 okay so I just said he's going to get tested by fire are you saying I should be thinking about the two Cherry Beam at the Gate of the Sword of Fire and sword fire so that Angels I'm totally yep I'm just saying Rolf well Tara be a multi-form animal hybrid creatures that stand as bouncers at the boundary of having a nurse and what I'm just saying is the narrator here has already told us that this city for the in The Valleys that it looks like the garden of y'all and now we have two Spiritual Beings coming and they're going to bring the fire of you always judgment on the city for being like the city of Kane and we learn I'm sorry this is Tucker to me the other day of Y2 why does emphasis on the two in the story and I think it's because they're being set on analogy with those
 2 Cherry Beam with the fire and sword at the boundary of the Garden of Eden is saying these guys are cherubim another cherubim look like humans I'm just saying there's that are the Nets suggestive and announcer the two Messengers go to Sodom in the evening it's night so this whole story is being set as the light of the sun goes down
 now what just happened to be chilling there in the gates of Sodom Lissa upstanding citizen did the ancient world and citygate Lotsa and he arose to meet them he bowed his face to the ground and he said look please my Master's please turn aside to the house of your servants stay the night wash your feet rise up in the morning and then go your way
 mechanicus OST very hospitable helps Welcome to our city and they said they will just stay the night in the city Square we got blankets
 and he pressured them very much so they turned aside to him and they went to his house and he made them drinks and eat baked unleavened bread and they ate classic Eastern fatality
 but here in America Southern Hospitality that he is doing is the same sequence of events of what Abraham did when the three guys showed up at his house like almost verbatim so he's being portrayed as like his righteous uncle
 sub before they laid down that is to go to sleep the men of the city the men of Sodom surrounded the house from young to old all the people completely fairly fairly Broad and we're like really meditating on all the men of the city from Young told everybody
 and they called out to lot and they said to him where are the men who came to you at night make them go out to us so that we can know them so this is very suggestive intentionally ambiguous terminology used so what level does lot showed great hospitality and so you could read this on one level and be like how they just want to like get to know the guys in the party who is here but of course that this is ironic meeting cuz that's not literally what they mean it's going to become very clear that the men of the city want to bring these guests out into the square and a gangrape them so the word know here is activating a Nuance of the word know which means to have sexual intimacy with that's a meaning of the word
 it was used in Genesis 4 with the story of Adam knew Eve gave birth to Cain & Cain knew his wife and then built a City Line right here is reminding us of Kane in his City cuz this is what Cain knew his wife and then built for City
 so that's what the men of the city say so lot went out to them at the entrance and as for the door he closed the door behind him this is on his house and he goes out through the door and then he closes the door behind him and he said my brother's my brother's don't do this evil thing to wear draw as a verb the word from the Garden of Eden Story look please I have two daughters who have not known to man
 let me please make them go out to all of you and you do to them what is good in your eyes just don't do anything to these men cuz this is the reason they came into the shelter of my beamed roof
 I done this is this is a horrible story this is one of the handful of like most stomach-turning stories in the Hebrew Bible both what the men of the city want to do but then also watch response response yeah it doesn't it doesn't make any sense to me it feels like a lot and I have completely different moral into a yes or some reason he thinks it's the right thing to do to spare his guests by offering his own daughters and it's like what father would have that intuition and yet they just not make any sense I think some commentators appealed to the fact that would be harder for us to imagine the in a very hierarchical patriarchal culture
 daughters are less social value in the chain of social Rank and so some people think the speaks to the fact that the fact that lot would protect two strangers who are men at the expense of his own daughter's some people think that it's drying out that would make someone in that time. What I'm just saying some people have brought up that's a cultural dynamic in strong patriarchal cultures traditional cultures daughters young daughters are the lowest social rank in the police they're not as marriageable age at which I mean not that bothers me to my core but I'm just saying that is a part of the cultural backgrounds The Narrative however even saying that I think the narrator is expecting the reader to go into convulsions here like what are you doing well and also the language so I have two daughters that have not known to man that is if they're still of marriage
 wedge and do to them what is good in your eyes this is another creative reuse so that phrase that was introduced back in the Garden of Eden story where the woman saw the tree of knowing good and evil good bad and she saw she desired and she took she did was good in her eyes so now we have one character commending that somebody else do something good in their eyes by gang-raping not two men but rather my two daughters now there's also a whole level of like there's a hyperlinks leaping off the page right here. Just these three stories that we talked about and that's important Dynamic too but I just want to finish reading the scene here verse 9 so the men of Sodom said get away
 and they said this one has come as an immigrant to talk about a lot and he's going to bring Justice like he's a judge you can tell us what to do now we're going to do evil to you lot even more than what we're going to do to them
 and they begin to pressure against Lot very much so we're imagining a mob against the door and they drew near to break down the door but then the mend inside the house they sent out their hand and they brought lot into the house and they close the door
 and as for the men at the entrance of the house they struck them with blindness from the littlest to the biggest and then they groped about trying to find the entrance of door so this is his action scene has a dark story. What is that that's not a man who are as depicted as a bunch of people are like you know what I want to do it when a stranger comes into town to do a game that's what sounds good. Stop us and we're going to we're going to punish you or he's already highly disturbing and makes you want to stop reading it at that point that's a dark dark story you can kind of lingo okay but you know we are getting used to like dark stories where I can just go really bad and we need someone who is righteous who can like help set it right so the guy can choose
 you're in this story the guy who's the nephew of the righteous guy has got who you actually just went all the way to say like invited the guests in just like Abraham the sky were rooting for he is like you have the worst idea possible his sense of what is good and bad in the obviously a very complicated crisis scenario is even his sense of good about has been distorted yeah so this point for the Angels just to shut everything down just like all of them this is a moment where the biblical authors are in much more like what do you say you know I guess you can just compare it to movies and TV series that are tragedies that explore the Human Condition in a realistic way to the end and that's the point and No Country for Old Men
 old man Breaking Bad whatever in the previous generation The Godfather series and it's just sad sad violin tragic sad Violet tragic sad but that's the point is to just show you how we really thinking how we really act and then none of us is beyond going down the road to being like this
so now there's a little conversation inside the house and the men say it's a lot how many are here with you do you have sons-in-law or Sons or daughters or anyone who's in the city Who belongs to you get them out of this place because we are about to bring the ruin of this place because the outcry against him is great before y'all way and you always sent us to cause it's ruined so a lot went out and he spoke to his sons-in-law would marry his daughters and he said you guys got to get out of here you always going to cause the ruin of the city
 but in the eyes of his sons-in-law he was just trying to make him laugh they thought I was a joke I think the Chuck so the narrative is comparing the men of Sodom to Kane in this city we seen that with the outcry and the earlier hyperlinks we discussed but then also the men of Sodom in this whole city is being set on an analogy to the generation of the flood to hyperlinks that the author is put there so isn't it interesting that the story of the last big like disaster or Rebellion Before the Flood is a story about Spiritual Beings
 crossing the boundary and having illicit sexual Union with humans that is with. That's Genesis 6 the daughters of a dumb here is a story about human beings crossing a boundary and trying to gang-rape Spiritual Beings to see the inverse of each other so yeah your zakovich and Israeli biblical scholar little book introduction to enter biblical interpretation sadly has not been translated into English at Stigmata Hebrew LOL that's great he noted this long ago that there's a really important analogy between the story of Sodom and story of the flood so the story right before the flood is about Spiritual Beings sons of God
 having illicit sexual Union with the daughters of a dumb humans and that's male and female presumably then right after the flood story of Noah and ham and what's weird about that is you know where told him went into the tent and he looked on the nakedness of his father and that phrase is ambiguous but it does refer to sexual Union specifically to a son sleeping with his mother with his mother-in-law but his wife never figures in that store is x + away it's just about what I saw on does to his father so notice how in the story of Sodom it begins with a story of humans trying to gauge and illicit sexual Union with Spiritual Beings and then even worse story is after the destruction of Sodom
 lot goes up into a cave with his daughters and his daughters get him drunk in a cave and have sex with their dad in order to propagate the line
 does that make sense the analogies between these two stories right we didn't write yes we have read that story you know but you're saying it's on Parallel to ham Danny Vantage of his dad yet lot's daughters take advantage of their dad just as ham took advantage of his drunk father in a tent so the daughters of lot take advantage of their drunk father in the case you know this stuff doesn't play well in Sunday school does it no man no this is this is why we're at the breaking bad moment this is like but it's realistic this is what humans do this is how humans behave and notice it's an especially here in Sodom it's in association with cities it's like when your Insidious evil Creations the snowglobes of human making and we create arts and Metallurgy to write technology they become little story Little Mini World unto themselves and
 City can create this alternate reality we're good as bad as bad as good so much so is that appropriate lines of good and bad get all mixed up and crossed and humans start doing crazy crazy stuff to each other I think that's the portrait here so the fact that illicit sexual Union that doesn't correspond to God's eating ideal setup back at the beginning of the Genesis scroll he comes in this story one of the sad what he says sad like symptoms of this disease human imagination in the inability to take two wives and I'm going to avenge myself yeah and it's almost like the city bread that kind of mentality here we're seeing the City breeding mentality where
 everyone in the cities like you know we do two visitors we have sexual revelry with them either will ya and noticed how sexy is joined with violence in the in the story of Sodom so it's not just sex and it's not just about illicit sex across the program and Reliance it's sex combined with public shame rape and violence that's just it's the new low point it's the lowest point in the Genesis story so far. You just like me and humans we are so easily our moral compass is there so easily scrambled yeah and what results in this case is violence towards vulnerable women like that I think that's the low point of the story is that a father would expose his daughters two sexual predators
 the reality of a city being that it creates its own little world and that it becomes an environment in which it brings out the worst moral intuitions I'm just saying I think if I'm just meditating on the porch this portrait of the human City and that how did humans reach a place where doing what's good in their eyes do what's good in your eyes and I guess what's good in their eyes will be too sexually abused all these people in the story how did the how do humans get their first do people wake up thinking that's a good idea
 but at some point humans been humans do and have reached a place where they think that is a good thing to do how does that happen and I'm just trying to end up happening in a city yeah you know when we start this conversation you introduced the idea of the surprise of the city here we are again yeah it's kind of like man let's head for the hills you know it's lit lot actually done but he goes to a cave humans are just as bad in caves as they are is there won't be a nice way to tie Redemptive bow on this conversation yet cuz we're just following the biblical narrator's and how they portrayed the city Sodom and Gomorrah from this point in the biblical story
 becomes alongside Babylon the most mentioned City in the story of the Bible in the Lord's Babylon and Sodom become icons of the distorted corrupt human City
 so I have here in our notes but just a small sampling but through all the parts in the Hebrew Bible in the Torah in the prophets all the profits on into the writings the destruction of Sodom where the Divine Justice against Sodom is brought up as this like Perpetual memory of when the city gets so bad too far gone Yahweh will hear the outcry and bring it into that City so maybe I guess the meditation here is we began saying cities
 have neutral elements things that can go good co bad and this story is particularly meditating on how things can go really really really bad will the only mention of anything good is a little detail in the beginning of Kansas City works like and there was Art and I was Yak Knology has there been any other like story or moment where you're like cities they can be wonderful so what you did at the very beginning is conversation is you want a couple of like I saw my thing and you said look God is going to do something with the city going to do something with the city and so that's in the back of our minds but at this point and reading to the narrative you're like titties
 I what are we doing yeah let's just sleep short sleeve for the country has the Wilderness becomes the real strong binary in the biblical story everything God does and everybody God works with to try and solve all of this is all happening outside the city in the wilderness which that's for sure on purpose cuz people can't do very much out there in the wilderness but men get people in cities over the course of many generations and bad becomes good and good becomes bad and there you go so let's just end it right there the store is like a diagnosis that becomes a warning
 that I think should make all of us meditate on both the little city that is our own self and our community or family that's a little mini City and then the cities in which we live and you know we just have to keep reading the story to see where it's going to go but for now let's meditate on these things
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we're talking about the first time a city is portrayed positively in the Bible and it's the capital city of Egypt under the leadership of Joseph under the leadership of a wise human image of God cities can become Storehouse in the life of course it's the Bible like things are going to get all twisted and go terrible again so let's just honor the moment so the first Redemptive positive portrait of a human City Health associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor Dan come on editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey also mix to this episode and Hannah Who provided the annotations for the annotated podcast on our Bible project was scrapped for the nonprofit We Exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that leads to tease us everything that we make is free because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you thank you so much
 being a part of this with us this is Greg and I'm from Lawrenceville Georgia my son I use Bible project for enhancing my study of the word and if that's what I used to think was so difficult to understand just how much more simple than the Holy Spirit reveals that Jon do the death of knowledge and the love of Jesus is just so clear and them we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus podcast classes and more Bible project.
