in the scroll of Genesis we meet a young man named Joseph he's a mere boy and he's got 10 older brothers and he tells his brothers a dream you just had a dream about being exhausted up high over his brother's over the sun moon and stars now his brothers they don't like this in fact they kind of hate Joseph for it and they scheme up a plan to kill him and while the scheme they throw their brother Joseph and a pet down into the pit below the ground you think you're meant to be a ruler of this guy well now you're a dweller of the pets from the Heavens to the Grave he goes from one end of the cosmos to the other so to speak today we begin the Fourth Movement of Genesis it's all about Joseph and we're tracing the theme of Exile in the Port City Mini stories Justice descent to the pit 50 Cent to Egypt as a slave are all going to be accumulating as images of his Exile from his family
 Exile from his Royal special status exiled from the love of his father and from the promised land going down you probably know what it feels like to be separated or left out to be set aside or to be banished from relationships Exile is a form of death and in these stories we're going to explore Exile and one of the most extreme forms this is about someone who's kidnapped separated from their family in a very vulnerable state sold to traders who take them to the place where they have no identity no money no family this is about human trafficking or John Collins in this is Bible project podcast and today I talked with Tim Mackie about the Fourth Movement of the Genesis scroll the stories of Joseph and as we read them we trace the theme of Exile thanks for joining us.
hello Tim. We are here again in the Bible together to do in the Genesis scroll in particular which you think man who these guys are going to move on with their lives hey but we are making some progress yeah we are moving on we're going through some stories that you and I've never talked about before we're going to actually finishing out and today's episode and the next one our journey through the Genesis go and maybe just as a quick note somebody might notice that is just John and I hear is we're going through Genesis Karissa has been a part really amazing cover part of the conversations about the Paradigm that released last year and then the early parts of the Genesis call Karissa has refocused attention on some other projects here Bible project and so it just to be John and I finishing out the Genesis protocol here and yeah we never talked about the Joseph story so if Joseph and his brothers the dude my goodness that's so much awesomeness going on
 so we maybe it was quick set the table big picture we are going to be the Genesis scroll because earlier than 2022 rerelease the Bible project app and one of the features is about these guided interactive reading experience as we were taking people through the Torah in 2020 to just five books of the Hebrew Bible in a year if you are ready to the Bible are the hardest they're really hard and you probably aren't going to get through it but if we could do it together with our friends I think it's going to be more Rich experience yes let's do it together so just real quick the original organization of the biblical Scrolls was not done two chapters and verses even though that's how we now encounter biblical books in the Bible they were originally designed as Scrolls and not what chapter and verse numbers but the biblical authors use repetition of words patterning of stories
 cycling of themes to indicate the flow and the design of the content of the Scrolls and so we are trying their best to follow the q's of the authors and then the Genesis quality pay attention has been organized into four large movements about the cycle of generations of God's Eden blessing in his Covenant promises kind of passing on from generation to generation and we are now in this conversation and the next focusing on the 4th literary movement of Genesis which is the story of Jacob's sons fourth and last and final yeah that's right the first one tells a story from Adam to Abraham if I come through the store is three kind of cycles of generations from Adam to Noah and then from Noah to guide him Tara who's Abraham's dad those three Cycles kind of work together as one literary movement the three Cycles or the first literary movement yep three Cycles
 ten Generations each time resulting in the birth of Three Sons one of them is chosen out of the three to carry on that promise a blessing the second movement of Abraham who gives birth to a bunch of stands first and primarily to and again it's one of the sons the second one who's chosen to be the vehicle of God's promise and blessing the third literary movement is a story of Isaac and Jacob just Abraham's son and Grandson Isaac has two sons Jacob and Esau and once again it's the second born who is the chosen as the vehicle of God's promise and blessing who will give birth to that long-awaited snake crushing seed of the woman promised all the way back in Genesis chapter 3 verse 15 and so are we just spent a couple episodes talking through the seam of blessing and curse in the Jacob story and that leads us to where we are now talking about the story of Jacob's sons witch make
 we call chapter 37 through 50 of Genesis 12 of them the beginning of the 12 tribes of Israel cuz what we learned in the last story of Jacob is that he wrestles with God and God names him Israel that's right which means struggles with Elias Sarah is from struggles with Russel Swift and then L is short for Elohim just got struggles with God struggler your name struggler struggler it's not a great nickname know I struggled over there struggling when we were in college that was a term people use like a how's it going away if you weren't having a great day was just struggling right now with little kids I stayed snuggling and struggling I'm snuggling so that's the name
 the you know the father of these twelve sons and you know so much of the Genesis scroll is these meditations and stories about the children replaying and intensifying the failures of their parents especially with the first set of parents Adam and Eve is every generation has stories where people are not just replaying the failure of Adam and Eve but the actual vocabulary as we seen of the stories is patterned after the failure at the tree and so that it's not just cool literary art it's making a real profound statement about the human condition that as much as you generation wants to think that we're different from her parents in a way we are a more elaborate and more developed radical but just variations of the same struggle that our parents had and so the story of these twelve Sons is going to in every way replay and intensify
 stories in the life of Jacob in actual vocabulary the stories of the struggles of the sun's is going to be retold in ways that are patterned after the struggles that Jacob had with his father with his brother and Jacob was just an intensified version of his grandfather Abraham yes and Abraham is an intensified version of version of Adam and so on and so you have all this cycling of God chooses a human and just out of his generosity gives us human a promise of abundance and asks the human to be his representative to bring blessing to all of creation to become partners with God's Divine Purpose to spread that you can restore the Eden blessing that was lost but restore it to all of the nation's that's the end game here Adam and Eve first had this is the representative humans and
 their failure is very the classic failure and as a result they are exiled from the heaven on Earth place from God's presence yep from God's Presence at the Centre of the garden there exiled from the garden out into the land of Eden and then once their son Cain does his own replay an intensification by murdering his brother this is all going to be important for the Justice store for Joseph and his brothers Adam and Eve's older son looks upon the favor that God shows to his younger brother got the elevating the younger one and it makes cane so angry at God says hey buddy you got a animal called sin crouching at the door leading hear it wants to sneak out of Eden in Lees Pond you just like it to see if your parents he's struggling yeah he's struggling and Kane gives into the Beast he lets the snake rule him and so he murders The Chosen brother and then God
 exiled him I mean he was already outside the garden but now he's exiled from Eden even the land of Eden and out in into the desolate Wilderness where he builds the first city further east and all these patterns are going to be developed in the literary movement were looking at at the end other end of the Genesis Scroll of Joseph and his brothers but I don't think we said what we're focusing on and what the readings are in the in the app will be focused on this the repeating theme of Exile and Homecoming in a story of Joseph and his brothers but that's introduced in the story of Adam and Eve and Kane so it's actually a whole thing through the whole Genesis scroll we're just going to pick up with it in the story of Jacob's sons there's going to be a deception is going to be attempted murder there's going to be Exile there's going to be division among the siblings but there is also going to be a men's good because God is going to raise up a seed chosen seeing from among the brothers to come to a place of rule and Authority as an image of God
 and it's going to be like a Noah who rescues everybody from her ID creation is coming so it's just a story has a tall man just like the whole scroll comes together
Genesis chapter 37 through 50 is the final movement it begins in 37:2 but the reason you know why that's the beginning of this movement is actually there's a key repeated phrase opening says these are the birth generations of Jacob and it's actually been a key structuring phrase throughout the whole Genesis scroll walking you through each generation of characters and so this is the final appearance of that phrase a 10 times in the book and this is the final one and so you wondered okay this is the story of what will issue the generations of what will come out of Jacob and the first son you're introduced to it's not the 12 is a hole but it's the youngest son at the time and that is the son Joseph Joseph and he's a teenager he's a teen yeah when you're a teenager you feel like you know everything but your brain isn't even fully developed
 what is a dangerous combination for me I'm glad I made it to a car accident I had a I had a pretty I had a really stable upbringing but even so you know just a teenage brain that's some stupid life-threatening things without even knowing any insurance companies do know this they price it in so why you told about Yosef is that he was a Shepherd in fact all of his brothers were shepherds interesting why is that interesting well it's interesting for two reasons one the crisis moment between Joseph and his brothers is going to take place out as they're shepherding the flock out in the field but it's a hyperlink setting you up for a dear reader who else was a shepherd
 Jacob turns out was a shepherd and he had a division with his brother Abraham was a shepherd and in fact his division from his nephew right to his family rivalry was with his nephew lot and why did they divide oh because of their flocks were multiplying and then back to Cain and Abel Cain was a shepherd and it was actually the situation that led to his division from his brothers so it's the first thing you told us already you're being set up for here's the new generation and their Shepherds it's a good example of the meditation literature it's only after multiple re-reading that you might notice that every generation in Genesis has divided siblings are divided families and that often it's the moment you're introduced to the fact that they are Shepherds that the conflict begins not something you would notice like in a movie maybe on the first viewing but after the most
 do you think she might be like they tell you that or they show you like that piece of clothing right before the character always has this thing happen to them or something you know if we got on the mantle so he was a shepherd with his brothers then what you're told is he was a young man in a 17 and he was with the sons of Bill her and with the Sons Sons of zilpah the wives of his father so you reminded many of these guys are half brothers and so here's here's Joseph and the first thing you told of what he does is he brings a bad report about his brothers back to their father now let's talk about Justice relationship to his father Yes Ralph the guy named struggles with God he loved Joseph more than all of his son's favorite son because he was a son of his old age those are both look glowing hyperlinks back to her earlier moments in the story who else loved ones Sun more
 the other Abraham you know his second son Isaac was born of his his wife Sarah was first son was born of a concubine so he favored the back and Son actually that little phrase a son of his old age is Verbatim what was said about Isaac and relationships Abraham so what Isaac was to Abraham Joseph is to Jacob the son of his old age and the loving is about the love that Isaac had for Esau and that Rebecca had for Jacob so the favoritism of parents for certain children were now replaying the failure of the father and the mother and then with a son of the old age being the favored one we're replaying the favoritism and failure of Grandma and Grandpa
 another good example where you're just being set up to expect what's going to happen next but you are told to something new this time that's what was the tangible sign of that favoritism an extra love that was the Technicolor Dreamcoat the code or the robe of many patterns are many colors so Joseph got the kind of peacock a little bit with his brothers so yeah I like that I've never heard that is a verb
 this robe is super important cuz the robe is going to be stripped off of him later in the story and then he's going to go without his robe for a long time but then he's going to get a robe put back on him again and that's going to be kind of the framing images around this first part of the Justice store here so that's the setup he's more favoured he's got to rub that we're going to see is an indication of favor but also his Royal aspirations and when his brother see it's his brother saw that their father loved him more than all of his brothers they hated him and could not speak to him in peace sibling rivalry totally so what happens next is Joseph has two dreams and the dreams are about how he was in a field they were gathering wheat and his little bundle of wheat stood up in the field and all of his brothers bundles of weed came and they bow down to his bundle of weed
 good me. I think that's actually kind of it is like he's depicted as a teenager is important he says are you going to rain as a king over us you think you're going to rule us going to be a ruler come on you're the kid my dad gave you the coat but you still get Josephine and another dream and he said to his brothers was so weird like the whole universe was bowing down to me
 what he says is the sun the moon and Eleven stars were bowing down to me the last time that the that phrase the only other time that phrase is used in the Genesis scroll was in the creation narrative the phrase the sun and moon and stars sun moon stars and also ruling stars are the hosts of Heaven to rule over the sky and the calendar the time day and night yeah it seems like a hyperlink to like not only am I going to rule over the land I'm going to rule over the sky this is so potent man I mean the significance of this won't strike until you reach Genesis 49 and 50 but this is all part of the larger strategy of the Joseph story with in Genesis and the tour on the Hebrew Bible as a whole and so the last literary movement of Genesis picks up the steam of a human exalted to rule over the nation's and over the cosmos and
 we're talking back to the image of God in Genesis one except even more cuz the image of God was called the rule the land right in Genesis want me ring as a mirror to the rulers about of it sky but now the guy has a dream about becoming the ruler of the land and over this guy now at the tents so this takes off his brothers and his dad his dad's like this is just inappropriate son yeah it's not okay. Thank we're all going to come down here that's what Jacob says to Joseph so you told his brothers were jealous but his father kept the matter kept the matter in mind so that's the opening of the story so we'll does paraphrase here but Joseph brothers are out in the field right just like Cain and Abel went out into a field Joseph's brothers are out in the field and Joseph is sent out to them and what they say is look here comes the dreamer and
 what their first plan is what they say is let's murder him and the word for murder hot dog gets the same word used is for what Cain does table out in the field and now here's the younger son favored coming to his older brothers and what they say out in the field is let's let's pull the cane with murder but you know we could do we could murder him and then spin a deception spin the Y about how wild animal of the field 8 him these are Genesis three Echoes coming in here animal crouching same crouching like an animal and I'll switch in the cane store in Genesis for is the corresponding image of the wild animal the snake of the field telling a lie to the human now that they're saying is we will tell a lie about a wild animal eating our brother but one brother the firstborn reuben reuben steps up and he says no no no no
 don't kill him don't spill blood and that's what having a ball is the blood spilled on the ground and and that's important blood spilling on the ground and I don't fully understand the significance of that yeah okay so cuz the ground is supposed to be the place the material out of which gods ruoff can breathe life and some in life but when humans return life back into the ground in the form of blood soaks oil that becomes an outcry What God Says to Kane is the outcry of your brother's blood has reached my ears and so when the land is soaked with the blood of the innocent God becomes obligated to bring the creation of water that will purify the land not it's what the imagery of the flood but now we're now in a mini cycles into the story and so spilling Blood on the ground murdering someone out in the field so that they don't receive an honorable burial is like the ultimate sacrifice
 and we will call down God's justice upon us so don't do that don't spill his blood instead let's just throw him in the pit which he said this in order to save his brother and return him to his father so big brother Stephen up here so we're not the Exile explicitly but we're beginning the symbolism of Joseph just had a dream about being exhausted up high over his brother's over the sun moon and stars and what they do is one instead take him down into the pit below the ground he goes from one end of the cosmos to the other so to speak and so what happens when Joseph comes up to his brothers first they take off that robe they're over that robe so they strip him of the robe and they throw him in a pit and then they sit down and have a meal with sit down to eat bread so it's over a meal so weird.
 it is it's the Adam and Eve story in the Cain and Abel story that have been merged together cuz they're cutting after one another and the brothers are replaying an image of both stories deception over a meal. Going to deceive with a lie about an animal and you known this all about murdering the brother or making him you don't go away how every detail is important in this type of literature and so for the store just be like I said down to eat bread and then all sudden you're thinking about the significance of food as a relates to deception yes a little hint about eating bread as a part of a deception plan that's connected to the murder of the brother in the spilling of blood like none at all these words and sentences have been very carefully check
so what what happens then is there sitting having this meal and they look up and what they see is a caravan of you smell lights coming down and that's it smell is Abraham's first son yesterday so they see descendants from their great-uncle coming and they are camel riding merchants and Traders and where you're told and there's 25 chapter 37 they were going down to Egypt so this is the first appearance of a major Motif that's one of the key giveaways for the Exile see him in the section of the book going down to Egypt to the image of going down to Egypt is an idea of going into Exile so it just so happens that the way we Orient are maps today is if you see a picture of anywhere on your phone or on a paper map up is always oriented towards the North Pole of the globe North is up it could have been
 could have been that the South was what in the first map that were made you know why do I have so interesting to think about so if you look at a map today of like the Mediterranean you'll notice that Egypt is in a down relationship to Israel Israel Palestine down into the West so that's that's more kind of just a coincidence of history that our maps are similar yeah that we say I like how you go down to Egypt so similarly for the biblical authors Egypt is down from the land promised to Abraham but more likely the damn language is actually like vertical because the main chunk of the land promised to Abraham was up in a hilly High Country and the road to Egypt was just one long downhill into the Flatlands down to the Sinai Peninsula another one down when you get down to Egypt so this imagery of going down to Egypt is the Ender going to sell them he's going to
 sold to these Traders as a slave and he's going to be taken down to Egypt in the section of the story and so the fact that he just went from up in his dreams from above the sky down to a pit and then down to Egypt these are all coordinated elements in Genesis chapter 37 and they're meaningful because they're setting all these images alongside each other kind of like the wave parallel lines do in biblical poetry so Joseph descent to the pit his descent to Egypt as a slave are all going to be accumulating as images of his Exile from his family Exile from his Royal special status exiled from the love of his father and from the promised land going down to go down is to go into Exile just like Adam and Eve went down from the high in Mountain Garden into Exile just like Cain went out of Eden
 Exile Court images got it so what I'm trying to do here is just notice in the narrative what kind of stacking up Associated images that describe Joseph moving away or out away from his family his father the the camps for the home so the first was he went out into the field he was sent out into the field to meet his brothers okay so it's away from the camp so he goes out into the field then in the field he goes down into a pit and then from in the pit he's taken down to Egypt what's the verb use going down the narrative is marking the series of decent and in Hebrew the Pitts is a synonym for death right yes and that which is about to be named in the story that's what Jacob supposed to say but I'm just noticing you goes from up to down there but he's also going from inside to the outside when he goes from his home in the camp to go out into the field yeah That's Amore
 horizontal orientation and that's the Eden framework of in the middle is the tree of the life and then the middle of the land of Eden is the garden and Eden is in the middle of the land so to speak is like concentric circles and Exile is going from the inside being out to yeah okay so you can take know you have the two creation narrative so you can go from high to low that's a form of dissent as a form of Exile or you can go from the inside to the outside that's the Eden framework and the store is combining both he goes from high to low and he goes from the inside to the outside and that is what is going to be named at the climax of the story of the division of the brothers the brothers bring a robe they bring a deceptive robe that is covered with the blood of a goat they bring it to this Dad and this is all replaying what Jacob did to his dad when he dress up with the with the skin of a hairy Goat as his rope as his robe
 the old classic Harry Road deception and Jacob falls for the deception has my son and so he begins to grieve and mourn and his sons, they try to bring Comfort to him and what he says is he refuses to be comforted and he says surely I will go down to my son to the grace namely show all by my grieving yeah my grief is it going to take me down into the grave so that the same word as pet no different but they are related images so it's the Hebrew word sheol grave is it's so interesting but so notice in the narrative Joseph went from high to low from the inside and outside and all the words describing Exile or now the field
 the pit down to Egypt and now his father thinks it is as down into death and down into the grave so death is a type of Exile I want to death that's what the Eden story taught us that right in the day you eat of the fruit you will die and then in the narrative the day that the age of it they are exiled yeah yeah so not only is exile kind of death but death is a type of Exile from the land of the living that's right and that's the image of going into the ground being buried in under the ground under the point is that the narrative has now been filled your imagination with a variety of terms the feel of it I've repeated many times now but that's all those images are not combined and then go check out some lament Psalms in the Book of Psalms and you'll just watch all this vocabulary like when the poet will describe the having a really bad day
 what are really sick yeah he'll say like I'm in the pit yes I'm 69 it's a great example so I've been betrayed by my friends and he describes it as a flood waters coming over his head he describes it as being in the pit and as being cut off from life which is it or you drown in a flood the poet's writing a poem means they're alive but they're describing themselves as being dead in the flood and a pet because they've been betrayed by their brothers or their friends and so what are they getting after hear the poem like that is using all the images that have been developed in the Torah that are associated with forms of Exile separation from God cut off from God and cut off from my neighbor are the anti Bliss The Curse is anti a blessing anti-life death you can be in the state of death and be physically alive in the biblical story
 Genesis 3 taught us anything that's right the day you shut the eat the fruit you will die that's right and they're just they're banished yes they don't physically die but they're cut off from God to cut off from the good land they're cut off from unity and Harmony within the family and so in these biblical narratives division in the family hostility away from home these are all different ways of talking about the opposite of God's dream for the Human family and so just asking to be taken into Exile and so in the next episode we'll just kind of Blow Fly more quickly but this opening story Genesis 37 kind of stacks all the vocabulary the images together and we're going to see is the rest of the Joseph story is going to be about the reversal of every single one of these images of Exile he's going to be every taking up out of the pit he's going to resend actually in the next storage Genesis 39 he goes down to Egypt and he's a slave in the household of the sky on Spotify
 are Elevate him to play some authority over the whole house and you know sweetie but then he's deceived restrict by Potiphar's wife and Potiphar's wife to see the whole house full in to see Spotify cuz she wants Joseph sleep with him he won't and she's so offended by this sheet you know conspires against Joseph so she tells potifar that you know this Hebrew slaves you brought into our house tried to rape me and part of our beliefs his wife good so he takes Joseph and commit him to a prison and then Josephus put into prison and later in the story he's going to call that prison my pet so he went from one pit right out in the field and his land to go down to Egypt and then down into prison which is we call the pet and you can't get much lower than being out of the land in Egypt in prison the pit of pets that's right
 just cuz this may not be how the story strikes many modern readers this is about human trafficking this is about someone who's kidnapped separated from their family in a very vulnerable state sold to traders who take them to a place where they have no identity no money no family very vulnerable and they're just suffering and surviving on their own and it goes horribly for him. This is not an ancient reality this is a reality that has been the lived experience of millions of humans right now it's happening right now at the lived experience a lot of people it's so horrifying to really think about what this kind of experience would be like I can't imagine it is the middle of these stories are meant to take our minds their you know this is what humans do to each other at the story of Abraham and Hagar you poop
 find out that Hagar she said Egyptian woman so she's an Egyptian slave and her name Hagar literally in Hebrew means what immigrant The Immigrant yes the Immigrant it's a story of how Abraham treats and Egyptian immigrant wife and he banishes her to death yeah that's right that's your story and when you like think of it we think of it you know as a story of her that's sad but then when you realize too that it's talking about something that's happening on repeat and civilization a civilization just gets a little like more intense and then we have Joseph it's a reverse in Egypt being treated poorly being sent into the biblical stories we can learn how their language Works they're offering with the most
 realistic in raw portrait of human patterns of behavior ya certainly more than most literature I ever read so is this a low point in our conversation right terms of the mood you know this but that's what this team is about it's about all the way back to the first Exile so when Adam and Eve go from their high mountain garden write the place of God's abundant generous love when they are exiled got informed them of the sad consequences for their behavior and he talks about how the seed of the snake will be at odds with the seed of the woman the people who are aligned with my purposes and people hostile my purposes and it's going to be an endless battle and that's what the story is and the irony is that Jacob stinks that a wild animal has eaten his son and in a way that's true it's just that the animals are his children well as good news like this Joseph in the pit and Egypt is the lowest
 going to get but it's just a raw portrait of real human behavior and I guess one thing I didn't know is that the narrative highlights is that they're in the pit down in Egypt were told at the end of Genesis 39 that Yahweh was with Joseph in the pit he was with him doesn't prevent it from happening but that doesn't mean that Yahweh isn't there something in the story I think we all have to sit and Ponder what that means so next we're going to do is trace an episode where the mood will shift the all about Joseph I sent he went through many desentz down down down down down and then he's going to begin a series of us cents back up up up up up to a place of Royal Authority and that's what we talked about but not just that his brothers are going to come down
 to meet him in Egypt in Exile and their he's going to test them thoroughly to see if they've changed their ways over the 13 years they were apart and so are we we're going to kind of dip into the theme of the test as well you can map it as a series of Exile and homecomings cuz by the end of the story he's going to get to go back to the land just briefly to bury his father the first stories about him being exiled from his homeland the last story in the Genesis Scrolls about him going back and then in between is his descent descent and then his brothers series of descent I sent back and forth back and forth up and down up and down until they all go down to live in Egypt and what does God do he makes Egypt into a little Eden a temporary evening to protect his people during the Great Famine but that's next door. Thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast
 next week we finished the Joseph stories Joseph is brought up out of the pets he meets the king of Egypt who can see that Joseph has the spirit of wisdom in him the ruach Elohim said so it he says you are going to rule over my house only in the throne will I be greater than you he will become an image of Farrah second like the Viceroy the deputy this is all Genesis 1 and 2 imagery hear the Bible project is a non-profit we exist to experience the Bible as unified story that leads to Jesus all the videos that we make this podcast hour app and the classes that we have there are three because of the generous support of thousands of people just like you said thank you so much for being a part of this with us hi this is Erica Bowden and I'm from Sweden I first heard about father projects through one of Jefferson Bethke kids videos on YouTube this was in the very beginning when the first video on the tour I was launching
 can you wait for the next one is 56 in my own studies of the Bible and this material in the home group at Church my favorite thing about Bible project is that it makes me want to read this complicated amazing but it gives me the tools and inspiration to do so we believe the Bible is a unified story that leads to Jesus with a crowdfunded project but people like me find free videos that are not spotted cows cows and more at the Bible predicted call Pedro Diaz be than an inherently better if it's too difficult Coast to Coast Bible project 2
