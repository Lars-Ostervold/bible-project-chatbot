this is Jonathan Collins at the Bible project and Tim Mackie So today we're doing something different on this podcast instead of having a discussion on biblical theology which is what we usually do I want tell story yeah so John got all investigative and he found this really cool story that even I don't know that much about and so the first thing off here is what is this story that we're all going to learn about this story is about two young man and it takes place at Harvard Business School which is out in Boston right now they both go there for different reasons they become friends and they decide to write a paper together on what the Bible has to say about money and what they see confuses them challenges them because of their lives to completely change
 this is a story about God and money
so Tim money can be really dangerous doesn't the Bible say the the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil or something like that in the first letter to see from Paul the Bible has tons of warnings about money but it also has tons of wisdom about what to do with it and really constructive ways to the Bible recognizes that money is as paradoxical saying in the world people who think about money for a Biblical point of view and through that ran into these two guys two young guys making a ton of money in the early twenties and they plan on making a lot more money in their lives they they have this really interesting story so I fly out to Nashville to meet them every somebody equipment with me to record them we're in this this friend of a
 friends living room and I'm just trying to figure this all out this is rookie John on the trail house like I sit down and I first asked them to tell me a joke I heard them tell once at a church service this is this is John's joke it's a great Pastor joke and warning it's a really bad joke yeah so a guy has the chance to talk with God one-on-one and he's asking got all these questions and he's like God you know what is a billion years like and got to do a billion years that's like one second what you got to understand about John and Greg is that they're both Uber geeky dudes Greg is in finance Johnson engineer me this joke is right up their alley thinks about it and says what about a billion dollars what is that like God says you know that a billion dollars to me is like a penny these guys are smart and they know how to make money the guy gets smart and says what God can I have a penny and God's
 you know sure give me one second
 yes you guys like to start with that that's a is that a crowd favorite it it can be that were nice and loosened up let me introduce you to John John cortinas currently living in Orlando Florida in his early twenties John was making $150,000 a year working for Chevron so a fair bit of coin and John had secured and overseas job with Chevron where he was going to make 350000 to $400,000 a year as an expat there's all this talk about the 1% It kind of felt like being not only in the 1% but in a position where it's like we're the maybe the top of the 1% in terms of opportunity in terms of the ability to build wealth and then there's Greg I am Greg bomber I actually live here in Nashville Greg's early twenties he was making $275,000 a year working for a private Equity Group called admin never explicitly thought I really
 want to earn as much money for the rest of my life to be honest I wasn't doing a lot of long-term planning I was enjoying the moment so a couple of balls so John and Greg have these plus jobs but four separate reasons they go to Harvard Business School to get an MBA and this is where they meet and they find they have a lot in common first of all they both want to make a lot of money in their lifetimes and secondly they're both Christians so they love their families they go to church and most importantly they tithes we both ties before business school give 10% of our income and we thought that's what a good Christian does you tithe and then you're good with money that's like a membership fee at my church essentially a membership fee to the church that's fascinating part of your membership fee
 in America at least think about the word member if you are a member at Costco or Sam's Club going to cost you something yeah you pay your fees and it's and then you are entitled to the Privileges pertaining thereto and all that cousin but on a real note let's be honest for many churches they're working on a budget if you've got people who really believed in this membership Church work and the last thing you want is for them to begin to question whether or not they do need to tie their membership fee find themselves then so Greg he figures this out in one of the classes he has to write a book report we had to write a midterm book report
 and I wrote my book report on a really terrific book by Professor David called you mean I don't have to tithe so I had to been a lifelong don't either and it really rocked me because as you can tell by the title of the book Professor croteau argues that we do not have to type here and get the book up he can see it have you are you familiar with this but I don't know you mean I don't have to tie the deconstruction of tithing and the Reconstruction of post tired of giving yeah there's some optimism there I already kind of like the book cuz it's deconstructing something that's not super helpful to people yes it says the biblical practice of tithing again most of our listeners know we are committed at the Bible project to reading the Bible and its historical literary context so the ties commands come from
 the laws of the Torah give the ancient Israel was interesting there's three places the tithe is talked about in the laws of the Torah and there's some debate but we know for certain is the 10% was not was Israelites were called to give they were called to give a tenth of their produce in their land does it ever sent to the temple temple annually they were also supposed to save up a tithe another 10% once a year and hold a big town party and invite all the poor people and Levi it's the day now that's Deuteronomy 14 and then also every 3 you're also simultaneously saving up for every three years of a tie that you donate to local essentially food food bank for the poor so there's some math you know differences about are the two types of the same atom
 minimum and Israelite is tithing 23 Samad percent of the total income with interesting is that that practice is bound up with the Covenant between God and Israel it's like their tax and that's why it's mentioned in the New Testament by Jesus mentions tithing because people pay to tax to the temple in Jerusalem but what you don't find is the mention of the 10 or 23% practice being done in any of the earliest Jesus communities in the New Testament tithes was specific to Israel living in the land with his Temple the early Christians did something different which it again that's surprising when most people learn that so
 you don't have to dive
 the earliest Christians practice tithing but they were committed to extreme generosity within their Church communities and that opens up a whole new Vista that isn't attached to the number 10% yet this is why I like this story so much we haven't even gotten to the store yet but John and Greg begin to encounter the Bible and what got actually has to say about money and it isn't as simple as just write a 10% check that God was asking for a lot more from them and that was a total shift in my thinking and I didn't know what it was going to look like or what that meant but I knew that things were going to be changing
 okay so we know that both of these guys had a lot of money in their young but but we haven't established their views on money are very different completely different so when you have extra money could have fit in one or two buckets either you become a saver or a spender and now John is what you would call Classic saver so my online banking password which has since been changed was retire at symbol for T John is a guy with a clear objective in his life so obviously and this began at an early age and my dad gets home at the end of the day empties his pockets that's the keys aside and drops all the change in there so it's like the family change bucket right except it was it was my you know the Johnsons bucket you commandeered it in the can was underneath the master bed to go to my parents bedroom pull this can out that might even be heavy as it gets more more overtime and
 play down on the carpet and just dump it out you see the money spread out and it's like oh yeah there's all my money and then the Sorting process begins and you kind of like realized quickly that the pennies are not you know if they're not going to do much for you with the quarters or where it's at and then I had this Post-It note and I would like write my new total of the amount of money that I had which you know my net worth basically and that was my first image of assets going up over time and getting excited about that so John gets the bug for communicating well then he devotes his life to it but John doesn't just want to be a slave to making money he wants a job we can make a lot of money but it doesn't require a lot of hours how can I make the most money in the least hours how can I make a really comfortable six-figure income and kind of be home at 4:30 p.m. everyday so Tim you can imagine Johnson number geek he wants to find the perfect job for accumulating wealth but also a job that doesn't require to work long hours so what do you think of strategy
 it's going to be a man I have no idea the numbers guy he loves in putting numbers know if I calculate an Excel spreadsheet. Just like you. I'm not in a key right next to each other and it's not uncommon for me to look over and see John working on a Google spreadsheet okay well imagine on a scale of 1 to 10 like, 3 John is a spreadsheet 10 that's hard to imagine how did you design this just kind of researching jobs there so there's this graph in there that's like 2 hours per week versus total income and you want to be like in the right quadrant of that graph for like high-income low amount of work John Wick spreadsheets for everything My love language
 guess what are the top two jobs and his spreadsheet where 400 hours behind Capital H high-income playoff not a Bible scholar not a doctor that's what I was forcing it but that's you give your whole life you have it right here on a pager something I don't know I don't know something to do some computer computer coders people who people who build things Architects to make a lot of money you can take a lot of time though okay what are the top two jobs for working the least amount of hours and getting the most pay according to John spreadsheet were two best jobs I can find were being a dentist or being a petroleum engineer and I was like I don't want to look at people's teeth cuz that's gross I think I'm going to be petroleum engineer does the starting salaries were like $100,000 a year you know you could do that right out of school and so that that's basically what I did so John goes to graduate
 Texas A&M he starts working for Chevron as a petroleum engineer his spreadsheet dream job he's pulling down more than $100,000 a year but that isn't as far into the right quadrant you can go when I started learning more about the oil and gas careers I learned you can make even more money if you go overseas it so if you're making a hundred or a hundred and fifty in the States you can go do the same job in Nigeria or Australia Kazakhstan and make three or four hundred thousand dollars a year and I was like that's what I want to do I want to go overseas and do that the problem with this plan was John would need 10 years of experience before even being able to apply for an expat job like that I said no way I don't want to I don't want to wait 10 years so what's the faster way they said well you can get an MBA and apply to the special program we have and we only take a couple people every year maybe three or four people that you could try for that so I said okay that's what I'm going to do they told me they get about a thousand resumes apply
 for that program in a given year and in my year they took six interns and so we all interned for the summer and then they ended up only selecting 3 to get the full-time job and I was fortunate enough to be one of those three so John has secured his most upper right quadrant job that he can imagine working in the oil industry overseas and while I've never personally had a dream of being a petroleum engineer John actually made it sound pretty cool some of the biggest projects in the world are oil and gas and so I was looking at being on some projects in Western Australia with a 3240 billion-dollar investments just unbelievable scale and scope and you're thinking about bringing energy to the world and then again the work-life balance is pretty decent in that industry compared to financial consulting they usually provide some amazing housing for you there's in some cases you have a staff got a gardener and a cook and a driver promising that to my wife to a Meghan we're going to go overseas it going to be amazing
 Rihanna live in like in this mansion on the beach and there's going to be like people serving us and said that that's kind of what we had in mind and then all the while you're putting you know a hundred hundred fifty thousand dollars cash into the bank every year that you're over cuz you're not spending it exactly so I was really excited by the prospect you on some of the biggest engineering challenges in the world living like a king and and putting away a ton of money the entire time you're done it this is a Savers Paradise but John doesn't want to just sit back one day on a beach with a big retirement fund John has big aspirations for his family was reading books how to create and sustain a family Dynasty you think of the bushes were the Kennedys I was like What if I could create a family like that with millions and millions of dollars that you know it does all these great things so that's John a saver with a vision for family doing great things in the world and will be back to his story soon but let's turn to Greg if John's the classic saver Then Greg is a classic spender Greg was making
 $275,000 a year in his early twenties what's a guy like that do with all this money I enjoying spending most of it frankly so we were living in a fancy apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston spinning a grand a month on fancy restaurants taking Five Star International vacations easy to applaud someone for saving money like John it's wise to take self-control and is easy to judge someone for spending money frivolously and carelessly the talking with Greg about this time in his life I didn't get the impression that he's a careless and selfish guy told me a story that I think captures why he felt so free spending money to see his dad ran a side business he saw it as a hobby of sorts where he would import things from China and then sell them on the weekends at the flea market I used to go with him every Saturday to the flea market to help sell stuff and then also as I got a little older too kind of man
 the money that was coming in and I remember one day I was packing up at the end of the day and I had this big pink box that was full of hundreds of dollars in both paper cash in coins my dad taught me the keys to the truck and not thinking you're just reaction I dropped the box to catch the keys in the box broke on the ground Queens flew everywhere in the flea market dollar bills are fluttering Away In The Wind that you can imagine how upset his dad is going to be at this moment the look of horror on my dad's face sticks with me to this day and then he immediately repealed that look and saw how sad or I feel like I let him down and he could see that and immediately sort of changed his countenance and came and help me clean it back up I can imagine Greg their little kid realizing in that moment that relation
 chips are more important than money you do money comes and goes don't hold on to it so tightly don't worry about it so much the real Treasures in life are each other but in my dad not Mom and I also kind of phone image of God is like he's our father and he cares for us he provides for us. So it's a moment I thought I stuck with me so Greg he goes on to study finance and early in his career he lands this amazing job at a place called Mackenzie and from there he's hired as a junior associate at a private Equity Firm called Advent now this is the big leagues this is where you can get Uber Rich private Equity this is where people like Mitt Romney made most their money and this private Equity Firm collect money from investors not rich individuals but rather Sovereign wealth funds University foundations family endowments and then invest that money to buy companies that own those companies for a period of three to five years in an attempt to sell them for
 Prophet returned the money to him at the investor is an intake a cop for ourselves and we're talking big money here Advent managed an 11 billion dollar fund the average check that we would write for a deal was 400 to 600 million dollars I was 26 earning $275,000 a year and I was the jr. guy the senior Partners were earning Millions the leaders of the firmware in in tens of millions of dollars a year and as we already established Greg was having a good time spending it was incredible and has grown up in the church so I knew I was supposed to tithe so I did I did tithing during that time but honestly to do two things about that one is when I was earning that level of income and it was just my wife and I even feel the tide you know at either on 275 is 27 that's twenty-seven thousand I have plenty left
 and into I always thought of that type of more as for the cost of admission to keep got happy so I can spend another 90% higher I wanted Greg's Junior associate job there. Vent is about to end but he's hot he wants to come back move up the ranks the first he has an opportunity to go do some more school and he chooses to go to Harvard because I saw how much the senior leaders at the private Equity Firm relied on the network that they had created what when they were in graduate school and the way it worked out was my boss and his boss and his boss we're all Harvard grad so there we go John the classic saver is heading off to Harvard to get his MBA it's his last prerequisite in order to get his dream job as a petroleum engineer overseas and Greg the spender he's also heading to Harvard to get his MBA in order to go back and make some serious cash in private Equity this is where they meet and form a friendship and it's in the
 Stream here at Harvard where God shows up and gives them a paradigm about money that turns their lives upside down
okay so Jonah Greg they're both heading to Harvard to get in there and BAS
 first day of school is about to come yeah you did Graduate Studies do you remember that the longtime first day of school
 so different so different I mean I actually thought this might be my only season of life where I get to study this much cuz I don't know how this is going to get me a job when school's over I'll probably have to have a normal job totally different experience where you going already having had a good job and then you're going as the step forward to your dream job in a way doubling down right people would be satisfied to just keep going on the track they were on so they but they have different strategies I show up at Harvard knowing that what I want to do is form relationships with these 900 other students who will accomplish great
 things in their career first day of class I sit down in my seat there's 90 other students in the room we start doing introductions one guy played in the NFL one woman skier in the Olympic trials one guy had operated 13 rescue missions in Afghanistan one guy was an emergency room physician at Massachusetts General Hospital so sitting down in the room in the classroom that first day I think prove that I was in really fortunate position John on the other hand could care less about the networking this MBA was just a box to check I had the job locked up that I wanted and so I wasn't as worried about the social side of my wife and I also went to school with a four month old child and so my priorities were get intellectual engagement and learning is out of the program I'm not a business guy I'm an engineer so learn business get the intellectual stimulation and then spend time with my family so I'll Jon buckles down and
 studies Greg starts networking is face off at tending all kinds of networking events career events social events it fills up your entire calendar and you live in this little bubble and this is how they me what are the social events that they both decide to attend is this men's bible study slash study group kind of thing for Greg gets the network John he gets to study so every morning they do a devotional together for 15 minutes or so and then they spend the rest of the hours studying for their classes together when there wasn't a lot of study they would just chat about life instead we're starting to become very close and sometimes we would talk about money and is devotionals so I think that was kind of a uniting point between the two of us something that we are each interested in both want to make a lot of money in their lives and they want to honor God with their wealth in the best way they know how but they quickly realize their attitude about what to do with money was completely different I'm talking about my spreadsheets and how awesome they are and then like in
 staying and I've got this big thing on Vanguard in like where do you invest Greg and he's like I don't know where they stick the 401K if you know like I don't even know and so that's kind of where the Judgment started and I'm like this guy like he's in finance but he doesn't even know like personal finance how does how do you like see him sort of visibly like energized at the the mission of the word Vanguard and I mean John has a Vanguard t shirt and mug she was making so much money like more than me before school but he spent it all like that's that's kind of weird why would you do that what shocked me about John is what I do. Is incredible conservatism with respect to life and he like doesn't save money like that doesn't make sense or I go to John's house I use his Vanguard mug ingest it felt kind of like The Odd Couple to some extent
 and yeah it really started coming out more and more when we took this class together in our third semester of business school you told me about this part of the story they sign up to take a class at Harvard Divinity School because they get a couple of electives at HBS and Greg's thinking it would be cool to go to the Divinity School one of my good friends at the church we attended in Boston was getting his PhD at Harvard Divinity School this friend's name is Scott one day Scott calls me and says hey Greg I have the perfect class for you to take at Harvard Divinity School called gotten money and we said we like God and we are pretty big fans of money so let's sign up for this class and it's just like the little walk up a hill from the business school the class was actually set up in some ways similar to a Harvard Business School classes and that they were case-based for the for the most part we would have assigned readings beforehand and then we would come to class and
 discuss and debate some issue. Related to God money a few examples might be whether or not we should build casinos in the state of Massachusetts which at the time was a huge debate another is the Prosperity Gospel pros and cons another is the Great Recession of 09 and the culpability of Wall Street as well as the responsibility of Wall Street for Main Street so those are the types of things that we would debate in the class so they're debating all of these ideas and it's feeling very esoteric but for the mid-term they have to do a book report and I wrote my book report on a really terrific book by Professor David called you mean I don't have to tithe so I have been a lifelong tither and it really rocked me because as you can tell by the title of the book Professor croteau argues that we do not have to type in Greg's thinking weight
 we don't have to tithe really that midterm book report ripped away this idea that I was being obedient to God by simply cutting my 10% check every week and never thinking about it again more over the class really convinced me that money is something that God deeply cares about so now there is this void in my world you are avoiding my theology so to speak a gap about how I should handle well mean while I'm at Harvard Business School with the great capacity to create wealth in the future now course there's no guarantee that will happen but we're it to happen I was worried about what I would do with that money so Greg goes from being excited about making lots of money too worried about making lots of money because he doesn't know as a Christian what he's supposed to do with a lot of money meanwhile John he's in class 2 and he's getting convicted as well
 particularly convicted by a conversation they're having about this guy named Clement of Alexandria she had Clement of Alexandria just a few Generations after Christ talking to his congregation about your there are those of you who are storing up well for yourselves and your families without being generous to those in need and it dawned on me this is not just a problem for the 21st century for me to do but it happened all through the church's history and so that was really shocking to me to see that this is a problem in the human heart it's not just our modern economy we are wired to accumulate for ourselves but the Christian church that always stood against that impulse must have been kind of convicting for the moment because doubt you had this multi-generational plan going on and you had this this I'm going to pile up and retire 40 did that feel convicting or drawing or what did that feel like in the moment I felt totally jarring and another thing that really got me was the parable of the rich fool Luke chapter 12
 let's stop here I'd love for you to set up this Parable yeah yeah this is a classic parable of Jesus about the rich fool someone in the crowd approached Jesus and said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me so somebody wants Jesus to get involved in family politics a family dispute and Jesus replied man who appointed me is a judge between you and then he said to them watch out be on your guard against all kinds of greed life doesn't consist in an abundance of possessions so we told him this terrible the ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant Harvest and so he thought to himself but shall I do I don't have anywhere to store my crops
 he said this is what I will do I will tear down my Barns and build bigger ones that's where all store my Surplus grain and then I'll say to myself you have plenty of grain you've laid up for many years take life easy eat drink and be merry
 but God said to him you fool this very night your life is demanded from you then who will get what you've prepared for yourself this is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich towards God
 Jesus master master Storyteller so what is the parable have to do with the the guys that want to divide the inheritance Jesus apparently discern that the motives of this guy this is about storing up for himself so that his life is easy this is a powerful Parable by itself it's also happening in the section of Luke that's called The Journey section that goes from chapters 9220 and this is Jesus on the road to Jerusalem and sexually interesting in these chapters of Luke Jesus talks more about money than anywhere else in the gospels put together and it's paired with Jesus constantly making himself and his mission available to the poor to like the poorest of the poor. So he's extremely critical of people who have lots of wealth you do
 get away unscathed from the Gospel of Luke if you have a lot of wealth and part of its cultural World there were fewer ways to make a lot of money fairly so this is somebody's wealthy you're instantly suspicious that you got this from somebody else you got it through Cricket means but also Jesus just had a huge value on a radical generosity to the poor and so he most of his teachings on money reflects suspicions towards people who want to accumulate it loads of wealth for themselves will John's feeling this suspicion from Jesus he's like he starts identify with the rich fool of the rich fool and realize this is my hero this is a guy who is building bigger Barnes to store up his Great Harvest and he's going to be financially independent he's going to retire that's what I want to do so I love this guy and then Jesus turns around and says you fool and Ira
 lights at that moment that's what he was saying to me in the plans that I had built around my wealth was there any part of you at this moment that was like well maybe that's true but maybe it's not your trying to wiggle out of it a little bit totally I was trying to to wiggle out of it and trying to find ways to say
 you know Well it Well may be that you know 10% is generous and I'll just give 10% and if 10% of a lot is a lot and I'll feel good about that but something in me and knew that it was not going to be the same after I'd been exposed to these Concepts from God's word so at this point John and Greg are feeling totally exposed and confused I mean if you aren't supposed to give 10% of your income it's not that simple then what's the answer what are they supposed to do with all this money they're planning on making they don't have an answer and so they decide as their final assignment in this class to write a paper to write it together and they're trying to answer that question what does an obedient Christian do with their money John and I elected to write our final paper on sort of created the modern framework for giving in the 21st century like should I give more I'm going to give 10% do I just give 15% now
 is it is there more to it how should we think about this and so I I had no idea what the answers were but I kind of wanted to spend some time thinking hard about it and maybe talking to people who were further on the journey than we were we were trying to create a plan for what we would do with the money that we thought we might get some day they get access to Harvard Business school's Christian Fellowship alumni my database so this is like 300 email addresses of Christians who had graduated previously from from the same program they were in and they send all of these people a survey asking them questions about their giving in the survey was super aggressive it was Anonymous but it was like tell us your net worth tell us your income tell us how much you give away tell us why you do that and unbelievably we got over a 50% response rate and so we had this very rich data set of people who have given us this information so then we started digging into it
 and as they dig around they begin to see answers in the survey that blow their minds they begin to encounter story after Story of people just like them who have a radically different view of God and money and the survey becomes like like the turning point that moment where they realize that everything is going to change neither one of us had any idea that the project would take on the kind of life that it has that we'd be sitting here with you almost a year later I mean it's been mind-blowing what has happened will find out what the survey said and what's next for them in the Final Act
find a really interesting they send the survey out and even though it's Anonymous these aren't things that you really allowed to ask people usually like I don't go around in my friends saying how much money are you making now and how much are you saving and I'm sorry giving and I really like you don't sit down in a small group and say like hey everyone pull out their tax returns from last year let's check it out and it's another way that's odd I mean the the founder of the Jesus movement Jesus the way we relate to money is so important he talked about it nearly half of all his teachings he's using either money imagery or about our own relationship the money one of his most famous line where your wealth
 is shows where your heart is your ultimate values and commitment that's why he stressed such radical generosity and why the early Christians were known for that too so it's it's odd it's comfortable not to talk about it even in Christian communities but it's odd we're we're betraying Our Heritage with what Jesus actually sad about money so John and Greg. They've never heard anything else other than the typical give away 10% of your cash because people don't talk about it so they send out the survey to 300 of the Harvard Business School alumni and they're asking them all these questions about their wealth unbelievably we got over a 50% response rate and so we had this very rich data set of people who have given us this information so then we started digging into it and then looking we would see people like oh that guy gives 50% of his income away like I did
 that was a thing like you can do that and then people would leave comments like you know I go to work everyday to make as much money as I can so that I can give as much money away as I can and we're like What like that you're not going to retire at 40 if you're doing that and so we so we done the survey and then we actually sent a follow-up email and said you guys are Anonymous we don't know who you are but some of you had these crazy like giving percentages and stories about giving if you're willing to come out of your anonymity will you do follow-up interviews with us since we started doing this phone interviews with people and that's where it got incredibly Rich to hear stories of generosity or some of the standout stories
 there's this young couple in their early thirties and Southern California who had started doing well financially they were thinking they might upgrade their house and they felt led by the Holy Spirit to write a $100,000 check to their church and they used part of that money to set up a scholarship program for an orphanage and then used the rest for a variety of causes within the church but again it's just totally blew our mind in terms of like why would you not put that into a college fund for your own kids or pay off your mortgage or upgrade your house like just how could you use that much money for something other than yourself doesn't make any sense does not compute doesn't fit this Reggie Wright doesn't fit in the spreadsheet at all even even more mind-blowing perhaps for the saver guy which was me a hedge fund partner who makes millions of dollars per year and he tells us like you know guys I intentionally avoid building my net worth because scripture warns against the danger of doing that and I'm like that's my whole life plan is to
 my net worth and it's guys like you know right I give generously and I have a ton of fun giving my money away and I also don't want to build wealth year-on-year so I avoid doing that
 how did he avoid doing it this is an amazing story this is one that really got me he buys really big insurance policies honestly that's the strategy is I don't have to save because if I buy a large life insurance policy a large Disability Policy then I will be fine and my family will be fine if something happens to me and in the meantime I can just give all my money away and clear he doesn't he doesn't save $0 so he's got a smooth path to retirement Envision but he could save it in like 3 months but he's like yeah I'll take 30 years to do it and so it's just a very different mindset around that I'm not going to accumulate for myself quickly I'm going to give now and save later
 and it sounds like he really enjoyed it and that's what really started rocking my world so as a spender I always thought I was obtaining Joy from nice meals and fun vacations but the joy that these individuals who lived highly generous lives The Joy they experienced was literally like radiating through the phone in these interviews and I was like emotionally and spiritually impacted by the Holy Spirit working in their lives and by the convincing and convicting the stories they would tell about how much better their lives were from like a happiness perspective when they elected to live generously so that was really rocking my world.
 I found the foundation was stuff before that and did you get a sense of like I want those kind of stories I want that can enjoy badly tonight I definitely I would hear these and I remember one instance in particular that this woman with whom we were speaking who was
 expressing the incredible Joy she and her husband
 felt from riding a large gift to their church and your I was like feeling emotional feeling convicted by the Holy Spirit I was feeling jealous I wanted to experience this feeling that I had never felt when I had just cut my faultlessly cut my 10% check into the offering plate in the past they finish their paper it turns out to be ninety pages instead of the required 30 and as a result of writing this paper they start to have thoughts they never had before I think money had always been a self oriented tool that I would again tied on but the benefits of money will accrue to me I will have more wealth I might have a nice house someday and I'll give some money away because I should do that it's like a membership fee to my church essentially something like that and I was beginning to catch this vision of money that was grander than that to say
 my money can number one be a part of God's mission in the world and number two if I give that might help me unlock something in life that has more joy and purpose to it than just having a big pile of it when I die soon as papers finished and begins to circulate around people would read it and they loved it and they pass it to their friends who would read it and it got a life of its own paper got emailed around from person to person and eventually we got a call from the president of generous giving giving is a Christian organization it's a nonprofit and their goal is to help Christians have a radical shift in the way they think about money or bad as they just think about it biblical way to think about money and the president is this guy named Todd Harper and the president comes to meet with us in Boston and ends up making a job offer to each of us
Todd thanks for making time happy to do it. Harper to get his side of the story because John's side of the story at this point is that the job offer not only came out of left field but for him was really really disturbing you know I didn't go to Harvard Business School to work for a Ministry the whole idea was really frustrating that's actually an understatement we hated the idea of doing it Todd went to go meet with John and Greg because he thinks they have a really compelling story and the main thing that he does at generous giving is he let people tell their stories of radical generosity and they say see look this is normal this can be normal way to live it seems absurd to be so radically generous but but actually it brings a lot of Joy I went up to Boston in February to meet with them and about
 you know 30 minutes into our we've carved out about 3 hours to to visit and 30 minutes and I was just taken by who they were or what God was doing in their lives their vision for for being difference-makers so it really felt like a Divine encounter so you didn't fly out there with the expectation of offering them a job at some point in the conversation you thought to yourself I want these guys to work for my organization that I have no idea if they're answer ought to be yes but it it it felt like a kind of a unique encounter and that that maybe God was doing something and I think fairly quickly for John there was a quickening of his spirit and frankly a little bit of anxiety because
 he had his plans we were like going to go overseas and make a lot of money we don't want to we don't want to work for a Ministry but but we felt like I was calling us to that you hated the idea but you felt God was calling you what is that what is that actually look like I think it's it's kind of like being Jonah where God says go preaching in a bind you say I don't really want to do that and he says no I want you to do it and so for us you know I was fasting a little bit and praying and feeling like I was being led to take this offer and then convincing myself no I'm going to go work for Chevron and then I get an email from a missionary who's in Hong Kong doesn't know my situation and he says hey by the way you know the father put you on my heart last night and wanted me to tell you that maybe there's something he has for you besides Chevron I don't know what that might look like but you should think about it and I'm like seriously God come on with this if we'd spent five years I mean doing everything we could to line up this job and so we would put our son to bed and then go away on our own
 and cry and then we basically limit to each other this is our life this is what we wanted and cannot really be asking us to lay this down so this really messed with John after you gave him the offer you you said he had anxiety he he said he would weep with his wife about why you were screwing up his life
 this is a guy who could be making $400,000 a year and if he does have this Paradigm of generosity he could be giving a large portion of that away how did you feel okay messing with someone's life plan like that I told him in no uncertain terms that if God was calling him to do this he could mobilize
 infinitely more resources through coming to work with generous giving then he could by making a great salary and living modestly and giving the extra away and I think that captivated his sense of vision
 it did Captivate John but it didn't make him happy it was kind of just this this unrelenting frustration with God I don't know if I would say anger at God but just frustration that he would spoil our plans in what felt like such a severe way I mean here's the perfect world that we have created and all of our labor has gone into getting us to this point and like I said you could have called us into Ministry three years ago before I even had this job but I literally am getting calls from the Chevron mover saying can we send the trucks and I'm like well give me give me another day or two and it's like why would you do it like this and it's like super dramatic fashion god
 it was in my third 24-hour fast on this decision and by the way I'm not like that fasting person but I feel like this was such a big decision I wanted to do everything I could and so I fasted all day hadn't felt like I heard anything from God and I was taking my evening shower got out of the shower and felt like maybe I'm supposed to do it and my wife Megan says to me I've kind of known all along that you're supposed to take this job and I haven't wanted to tell you cuz I don't want you to take this job but God almost chastise me over the last half-hour and told me that I need to tell you what I've known all along so take the job are you feeling at that moment
 still a little bit like I didn't want to take the job but a sense of Peace in knowing that my wife was with me obviously it helps to be United and at some point it was an act of obedience just say alright we will step out of the boat and do this
 experience has been incredible I've seen the fruit of the decision it it would be
 selling something untrue to say it's been you know this tide of Joy the entire way through I think something we've experienced is that obedience in the Christian walk sometimes comes with pain and sometimes you know the tears we cried when making the decision haven't been the last 2 years and kind of adjusting to a different lifestyle adjusting to a different income level comes with its challenges in with its struggles but I don't think either of us regrets it so many people make decisions in their life regarding how much money they can make and so taking that kind of off the table like drawing a line somewhere modestly where that ceases to be the primary criteria for decision-making creates a freedom to follow God's call in a very powerful way and again what I like about John and Greg story is John
 I felt called to to the nonprofit space Greg still felt called into the marketplace and he didn't limit his income potential it would have lost track of Greg there but if you remember Todd offered both of them a job and John felt like it was something he was supposed to do but Greg didn't Greg wanted to continue on with his career path so I'm really torn during this season because I see the Holy Spirit working powerfully and John and Megan's life graduates and get the job at this really promising Healthcare technology startup in Nashville but I felt like I was sort of selling out a bit because we had just written this manuscript of that called for significant changes in how I thought about and behave with respect to
 mountain and money and then I was going to go run up the corporate ladder yeah I was going to professionally at least pursue the exact same path that I had thought about before hand and it felt B false a bit selfish a bit shallow but engaged in research on the LG of work really reading a few different books or resources about what God thinks about work and really came away convinced that God values work no matter even if you're not a minister and that I can accomplish his purposes working for a Healthcare Company in Nashville just like John can working for a Ministry in Orlando part of the job offer he acquires some equity in the company which by the way was his plan all along build equity build wealth I joined the company and six weeks later we get acquired by Cardinal Health which is a huge Healthcare conglomerate in Ohio for over 400 million.
 suddenly Griggs Equity position is worth a lot of money that was mind-blowing is clearly what it revealed to me is that I wasn't being left out of the story Greg thinking this is crazy this must be God he must be working in my story just like John and so him and his wife have to decide what are we going to do with this windfall how much of this money should we give away what God had taught us is that first everything belongs to him there for this question I've been asking my whole life how much do I need to give with the wrong question instead I should have been asking how much do I really need to keep since it's all God's anyway so I'll provide for my family I'll save responsibly for the future but then everything I must be on that should be given away so they talked about it and decided
 the number that felt right was giving 20% of the gross away so before paying any taxes 20% off the top and this wasn't an easy decision so I came out of graduate school with $150,000 in cumulative grad school debt because my wife also into grad school at a private school so at the same time we're saving up for a down payment on the house we have a two-year-old son now my wife expecting another kid on the way so we need to start thinking about college savings another is one Warehouse shopping and the Nashville real estate market right now is hot but we realize that for us to buy a home within a reasonable commuting distance for me which is our number one criteria we were not going to be able to obtain the type of house that we really wanted for a family in terms of size features niceness area Etc and there were plenty of times as we were going around the houses with r
 agents say no no no that my wife and I would look at each other and say can't we just give a little less money away or or even better we'll give it later which I think is even more danger also Greg was shopping for new car what was your favorite card to look at it that moment Acura SUVs because clearly a BMW or Mercedes is on how late is fine and the Holy Spirit is really can fix me like you do not need a car like that so suffice it to say now I drive my grandmother's 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis the gate some of the money to the church they had been attending in Boston while in school they gave some to the missions fun for the new church they were involved in in Nashville and they even wrote checks to individuals they knew just needed money but one of the coolest parts of the story I thought was that they decided to start saving for an adoption did you feel the joy like that was the
 to have those stories I've been tired in my whole professional career and never got any Joy from that because I now in retrospect I know it's because I brought the wrong attitude to that decision or church here in Asheville at this big December fundraise for these three international missions groups that the church supports that just a few weeks ago they showed video of the impact that our funds are having issues like the foundation being laid for the school in Africa and for a house for this missionary who we support back to commute 90 minutes each way so two-and-a-half 3 hours a day round trip that we get to save them now and I like got emotional watching that video which surprised me actually because I'm not a crier I guess until now I guess until I'm really engaged in God's purposes for the first time and what was cool as I felt useful that was probably the best thing about it and I think that I've realized that sort of the Genesis of the joy just like you sort of feel I feel really good after a hard workout or a
 this work I feel like now that I'm like actively contributing to God's Kingdom in my own little way but it's still very meaningful to me personally if I think what drives the the joy that I'm now be able to experience
you know it was kind of a fluke that John and Greg met decided to take this class decided to write this paper but as a result go through life's change dramatic so I asked them imagine you hadn't written this paper
 What would life be like so I'm probably overseas saving over $10,000 a month in cash and building a life for myself and I'm probably pretty happy and satisfied in that as well and I think the shuttle tragedy that would come is that I would be creating a life of the rich fool for myself without knowing it and and you know I probably would have lived my whole life no bigger Barnes for myself in and that is not the most satisfying life that one could live for me I'd be living in a fancier house driving a nicer car cutting my 10% tithe check every week and I would probably think I was happy
 but it's almost like I wouldn't have the capacity to experience the things that I have experienced as a result of living out this message so I don't even know what I was missing I think of Luke 18 the Rich Young Ruler where this man comes up to Jesus says teacher what must I do to enter the Kingdom of Heaven had kept all of God's commands for Into The Ten Commandments and Jesus says sell all of your possessions and come follow me and scripture says that the man walked away very sad and I feel like I would have got to the end of my life have been Austin Sibley obedient quote on quote but totally missed out on the exciting right that God had planned for me because I never had the courage to go follow him
