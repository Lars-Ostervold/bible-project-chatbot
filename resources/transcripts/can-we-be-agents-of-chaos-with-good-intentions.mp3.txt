we have come to the end of a very long series on the chaos creature the dragon and we release the video I'm just a couple days ago in real-time couple days ago so by the time this is out to be a month or so and we're really proud of it man it's so cool really really cool Dunning stunning R Animation Studio did themselves touch Murphy's director just really wrestling with us how did like visualize all these things we were 26 minutes grab that turned into a three and a half minutes of your kind of their Direction which I think it just feels really good moves really fast and gives you all the right ideas it does make you have to then go and do some of your own work it raises so many questions that it does not a no answer you follow the podcast it feels like wow what a cool video
 brand new to you again like really I know I've actually just anecdotally as we've been going through this series have had multiple people share with me this is a brand new set of images and ideas you had no idea any of this was in the Bible which is so awesome and it's fascinating because this is not a small team in the Bible like there are dragons in all the parts of the Bible so anyway I've been really fun and it does generate a zillion questions at the video can't wrap up in this podcast Series has raised lots of questions that you have been sending in so we're just going to go for as many as we can so should we just go for it still okay with a question from Tyler in Michigan
 hi this is Tyler in Ann Arbor Michigan this Series has led me to meditate on the role that deception plays in sin I wondering what implications stem from humans being deceived into sand by the snake rather than choosing it independently and Luke 23 Jesus seems to touch on this what he asks forgiveness for his Killers while stating that they don't know what they are doing how should the centrality of deception as a part of Saint inform our view of both Justice and how to live as Christians now that's a really good question yes we didn't talk about that that I can think of. Yeah but I appreciate it because I have been becoming more aware of the importance of Deceit deception
 in moments in the biblical stories that are all patterned after each other starting with the snake it is super important that the first story of somebody doing anything wrong in the Bible is a morally innocent couple being deceived into doing the opposite of what God Said so they're culpable in that like I said because I can listen to God's voice it could have yeah they were deceived they were deceived by a crafty and a room that are bad and then that snake is connected to the chaos forces connected to the waters and the money and the dragon Genesis 1 and that seemed of deception is huge in the Hebrew Bible people dealing on truthfully it's a main theme in the Jacob stories right from the beginning it's a main theme of the Joseph stories it's a big theme in the laws of the Torah there's a lot about truth-telling connected to Oaths and vows and then
 in the Hebrew Bible Joshua Judges Samuel Kings is all these stories of people tricking each other deceiving each other and they're all ways when humans don't behave honestly yeah it's chaos we introduced chaos we just recently reading a song where like being kind of a righteous person person living right light ships they're not accepting bribes I'm half an innocent and they're not like talking bad about people is kind of like you can you can create a web of deception and like falsehood with your actions and that's like a tragedy when Jesus forgives soldiers crucifying him they don't know what they're doing that is very much a part of the Bible's portrait of The Human Condition sometimes
 our moral compass is so skewed our desires are so missed erected and distorted that we will do bad thinking it's good thinking that it's good and so even that is the kind of stuff deception like very rare is the person who does bad because it's bad it's usually that's because they actually find some kind of good in it at least for them even if it's really distorted kind of gun right so there's a self-deception I think that's what the cane story it's about something crouching in his imagination that wants to ride get us some good at least for him even if it cost the life of cuz they're good he wants is God's favor that's a good thing to want not a bad thing to want the deception is then how did it get it and that deception is crouching to have them know we did talk about how this helps me I think we frame a lot of times when I'm offended by someone to
 remember like it's very often that they are trying to do the right thing in their mind as a strategy that timing me to harm me necessarily or at least I could see if there's actual what does intentions I don't assume that we're all kind of living in our own web of deceptions that are influencing us anyways yeah it seems like this understanding of Truth and deception of self-deception also really underlies Jesus's ethic in The Sermon on the Mount responding to enemies with prayer and blessing taking the speck out of your own eye before yes fixing the other person nonviolent creative responses to evil in this mystery straight-up retaliation that requires that kind of empathy to be able to try and see
 through even you know the size of people who who have hurt you are hurting you to at least be like I can at least understand how someone can be so self to see if they do what they're doing right now it's a kind of empathy and this is a big part of the biblical loss of portraits of human nature and how humans become agents and use the power of the chaos Dragon often cuz we were duped into thinking that that is the good way to go about trying to get something to eat does Tyler I think I agree with you and it's kind of an implication of the chaos Dragon theme none of us really know when we're backing the dragon both allows us to try to have more empathy for the other but also be more introspective for yourself as both things way more stuff
 cool thank you Tyler great question now let's hear question from Rebecca in Iowa hello Rebecca from Indianola Iowa and as I have listened to the podcast about the chaos Dragon my mind can't help but go to the New Testament when Jesus calms the storm or when he invites Peter to walk on the water or when the scales fall from Paul's eyes when you say those stories are connected to the chaos dragon
 cool you know we do talk about you smoking water I came for that scales in the eyes we had about that totally so they were many people who send in questions about the things that fall off of Paul's eyes next 9 so many that I was like like I got to make sure we talked about this so you're right in the podcast in the video oh what a cool scene in this video Jesus trampling on the the waters Waters so definitely Jesus walking on water heater out so we did talk about that but not the scales from the eyes and to be honest it never even occurred to me that that was related to people occurred to them awesome way to go Community reading community so I did look it up though and here's what's super fascinating cut sew in Acts chapter 9
 which begins with saw which guns are there is Hebrew name this Roman or Greek name is Paul his name didn't change when he started following Jesus seems like he was known mainly of saw in his previous life it seems like he was known by both but mainly as Paul in the Jesus movement but he's called back and forth with the name changed anyway after his vision of Jesus he goes blind yeah that's a key part of the story and then he goes to this guy's house named ananias who gets up and praise for him and then we're told that he regains the site and is filled with God's spirit and immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales
 and he regained his sight it's a very strange little detail this word scales appears only here in the Greek New Testament row is not a common word however wonderful genuine Discovery so if you look up in the classical Greek English lexicon of Adele and Scott so it's not just New Testament all the classical Greek literature so the word is the piece emphasis on the second syllable scale it can refer to like a belayer of an onion okay that's in listed it is it can refer to the scales of fish that's in Herodotus
 and also of serpents specifically in Aristotle and nikander of other things you can talk about is there's a like a blacksmith was hammering out copper and their little shards of pieces of copper flying off that happens it meant I had to be some valuable you wouldn't have a Shard I don't know but that Charlotte is a is a piece of the first-century uses this word e cause of Peace Catholic youth of flakes of copper the fly off when the blacksmith is hammering it you can also refer to really thin sheet metal yeah that makes sense why would ya believe it can be use a fish scales and a snake scales and then just have this is fascinating so the word doesn't occur elsewhere in the Greek New Testament it does
 however appear in the Greek Septuagint the Greek translation Hebrew Bible Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible and where does that appear in particular it appears in the kosher food less and specifically talking about things that live in the water that have scales Leviathan would definitely qualify is that so all that to bring us back to what are we supposed to imagine and what is the significance of something like scales coming off of Saw Vise really fascinating because it was a story is talking about is his own self deceit or his own preconceptions about who Jesus crucified one was and he was like he was going at it like he was in a way like weaponizing the snake towards like let's using the Christians arrest getting followers
 Jesus arrested unfairly put on trial and then subjected to really terrible fights and he was he is in violent version Jesus by sneaking move and then something like nosliw qualifies it something like scales fell from his eyes so we're at least being invited to see something what do you say in aquatic aquatic creature something like a a reptilian our scaly creature a setting something shedding something associated with aquatic monsters if that's really fascinating so I haven't done other than looking things up and concordances Mexicans I would be curious if we want to survey now all my acts commentaries and see if anybody
 has notes on that there's ever been any essays written that would be the next step to see if I have other people seen this to people see this in the Ancient Ancient readers of Acts that would be the next place to go but anyway Rebecca thank you for bringing that tonight many people my attention and yeah a lot of people did but Rebecca you ask the question in the most the sink for you to get on the podcast yeah so the how cool is that snaky eyesight you can see things in the snake away and then yeah and then act accordingly terrifying really good image take the scales terrifying is another question oh yeah this actually is also a question that was asked by many people and we're going to hear Zeb basket who's from Tasmania
 hey Tim and John my name is Deb and I'm from Tasmania in Australia you guys in the whole Bible project a more amazing and you such a blessing he briefly mentioned in episode 12 right and you link the name and told him to the sea monster image I'm just tracing my Joshua and Jericho is there some sort of inverted link between redheads name and character portrayed against the city of Jericho and eats name and character in the story right head seems to be the only thing of fragrance in Jericho and the city itself is more like the chaotic Sea Dragon. What are your thoughts about the incredible work thanks
 exam okay great this is one of those elements where I love that so many people when they learned that Rahab with a name for the Sea Dragon specially in the poetic books the profits in the Psalms of the uniquely Israelite name and then people think of the character of the book character of The Prostitute Rahab who lived and rescued the spies in the city of Joshua so first off I love the people seeing the connection cuz that's totally how hyperlinks work it also was a good opportunity to say learning some facility to learn how to use original language concordances or lexicons can be really helpful in this case even though the names are spelled the same in English they are different in Hebrew
 so Rahab the dragon is from Reish hey bait spelled like it sounds an English which is from a verb revived to her like a raging Storm raging one is the dragon named they have in Jericho is a different word even though it's spelled it b b so rock on with means to be broader wide-open where there's a is a sausage and a heartache and then there's just so that's the character in English we don't have that so we just like the stage is fine although English translation that's what I do to represent set yeah yeah ooh Ooh Ah Aah witch in English can sometimes yes like Johann Sebastian Bach Bach
 but no lady means yes and so if somebody doesn't know that and they say c h in English darts they were you on Sebastian botch so I prefer the transliteration kh4 the weather outside in which case of beer at 5 so it's a different word sounds familiar with the word I'm thinking of compassion that's right so there's actually not a connection between rajas the rating dragon and roskov the character and Joshua chapter 2 but you know this is a lesson I learned that can graduate school my one of my main teacher is my advisor for my dissertation Michael Fox it was a scholar of specialty of the wisdom literature threatened Renoir commentaries on those books and he instilled in me the value that sometimes when you research a negative conclusions just as valuable as like a positive Discovery meaning
 meaning when you come to an idea you ask a question research that leads you to a negative answer you're still learning so excited cuz it's not discovering feel like the absence of both types of it and we're talking about dissertation topics once and I was telling him some ideas that I had and so I don't remember what it was one idea was I think you know people think this and I always think that that's wrong but the whole dissertation just to say that people think this but it's wrong and he was like now that's very valuable just as I am able to hear something but nobody stopped before okay and then if it's something that is a popular wrong thing the thing earlier
 anyway so it's Deb and all those who ask the question wondered about connection to your on the classroom using the skills yes so what do I do okay like I got connection I'm reading an English what tool do I use so it depends on what tools you have you could go to something like blueletterbible.org that's a pretty one and find one of their English versions so I'm going to put in I'm in Blue Letter Bible Joshua verse what idea and I click on tools then it gives me an Interlinear which means it's going to show me the Hebrew while it shows me the English that's right I need to scroll down scroll down it's like every English words on the left the Hebrews on the right yeah her name is almost the last word yep and then there's this is that each 73-43 is that strong
 yes so Strong's Concordance it's an old tool but they've given every original language word a number and then with the digital to like this you can and click on that are here's the here's the sound translate 73-43 in Hebrew what does look intimidating people but then you can click on the strong and there it is there's all this is a free Strong's Concordance that's what Blue Letter Bible offers this the digital Strong's Concordance but then the way to search for it and see everything and if you're in a digital Bible Software there's also ways you can pick a lock or something for me and you can look up the street in a couple clicks all the other places for that occurs so in this case what you notice is all those passages and Isaiah never are not connected
 call to the name of the female character from Joshua chapter 2 all right next let's hear a question from Wayne in Georgia hi this is Wayne from Atlanta Georgia and my question is is the chaos Dragon evil because of what it is or is the evil because of what it does when you write question versus Raw the first Cuban are episode that we did in the cast Dragon most of the questions we've pulled together we're about this so that would be a place to go back but we didn't quite hit the question in this way in this concise so I thought it'd be good to tee it up again so yeah one way to say is what is the word evil mean in the bible another one
 would be to say is what does it mean to say that a creature is evil evil that is in its Essence is evil. So here's one first way to respond to find multiple ways to respond one is that in Genesis one which is where the dragon is first mentioned on day 5 to be on need to go to done eating it is a part of what is called good a day five you know I thought about that more it's the chaotic sea itself it's the you know and what God is doing is putting boundaries yes it seems like the boundary making is good but is also the sea now also in some way good yeah what is called good both the ordered rounds of sky land and sea each with a boundary that's good but then they five is just about the filling the water is in it with the creature that's true but doesn't the the tiny in their represents also the chaotic see the creek
 represent the cast of The chaotic C represents non creation disorder and then the dragon there is using one of the Dragon taming strategies for the biblical off the tablet just downgraded from a cosmic. That's a rival to the Creator God if it's just an image of the cat Waters that's clearly not good at Waters in and of itself needs order in which is why there's no good on day two okay on day two. Separates the waters from the waters so nothing is printouts good cuz the water is they're not they are nothing there is not an order and the dragon was the most famous ancient symbol of winded non order of disordered nothingness all the sudden casting agency and when that symbolize some agency it's just another creature yet God's good world according to Genesis 1 no creature animal or human
 in its Essence evil Creation in his Essence is an expression of the generous mind of God and it doesn't mean it's always safe but nothing in creation is in its Essence evil God according to Genesis one yeah so in that sense the dragon as a symbol of disorder is sort of like a neutral morally neutral the same way a bear or a lion this morally neutral but when intelligent creatures spiritual or human use the power of the Dragon on each other that's even know why even we mean there's a moral intent to destroy exactly to undo good. Do good evil is a good high in typical star but it's like a purposeful undoing of good is anything in the Bible can be
 describe this evil because of what it does not because of what it is so then biblical thought any creature that does evil is actually violating its own Essence which is why it's a form of stuff self-destruction I didn't think I would Jobe talks about the Leviathan he's kind of like just remember correctly when God God in the book of God in the Book of Job he'll talk about it maybe it's when I remember but it's like he's coming off of the creature you just like don't stand in its way and the sense you get out of it isn't like that because it's evil because it's just wrong and it flashes and so if you get in its way you're going to get beat down he doesn't have the sense of like this world of moral evil it's not yeah so there ya God is describing the Dragon
 and it's kind of classic sense in the ancient context of a agent of disorder but when that symbol is applied to a spiritual being
 that uses violence and disorder you to accomplish its purposes which is classically but the word thus upon means in Jewish. Now we're talking about something that's choosing moral evil that again not in its Essence evil cuz nothing according to Genesis one is and it's Essence evil even the chaotic water is not a necessity right I just it's nothing it's disorder non order yeah we're entering another culture's way of viewing the world which is why it's
 takes effort to wrap their minds around it but there you go grab another question from Rica and England hi Tim and John my name is Alorica and I'm from Lincoln in England you said that humans can become agents of chaos and that's easy to see with people we might consider a evil such as Nebuchadnezzar's Hitler, the most people didn't set out to cause chaos so often we become agents of chaos inadvertently or without intending to be I love you so it's on that thanks so much for what you do by
 yeah this is the connected to the self-deception yes back in the first some teeth that Tyler had his talk about brought up and yeah it's a good reminder like it is so easy to point at the other and see the chaos and it's so hard to see it in yourself and with your people your crew like we can be really pathetic with our friends and family to the point where we don't see the true like chaos that's been created that we should be aware of thinking about some of the most intractable if possible conflicts in history are in our world and it's usually between irreconcilable differences of who thinks who is unleashing chaos right so you know and so I mean just pick any of the conflicts raging in the world today and yes there are
 occasionally individuals who Delight in doing evil but even then there's usually some aspect of some good thing even if it's only good for them. I think they're pursuing and then when you scale that communal a ride it's very easy to get the destructive implications of another group's behavior and that might make me then think we'll of course if I'm against that then like we're the good guys and it blinds me to may be destructive implication of my responses to that in which case it's like two dragons battling each other this way to look at it yeah you know we've stationed the best bad guys in cinema are ones that actually don't think of themselves as a bad guy they think of themselves as the hero of your own story
 right hand knows wanted to save the universe yeah that's right yeah destroying half of it and so you kind of like he becomes this character we're such an interesting bad guy and I just find that we can appreciate that in art a lot more than appreciate it and I said yep that's right yeah I think the takeaway is probably in two directions so thank you Erika for asking it because it both should invite critical reflection like we talked about earlier the specked in my eye before I look at the log into another person's eye but then also really trying to see that login the other person's I like maybe how can I try to imagine life through their eyes and maybe is there actually is something to it and you know what I see is a log that may be expecting something more like a small twig
 really see what they're after what's the good that they are after but in a destructive way and what are the good things that I'm after through even unintentionally destructive ways so yeah I think they're really valuable seemed especially in the chaos Dragon series cuz we had a question in the last killing our episode about how this image is potentially dangerous yeah if it can be used at the label right like you're the dragon where the Dragon Slayers yeah so it's good that we kill you you know and well keep time I saw them out on our brain yeah that's right because next year some of them out so I'm thinking about Jesus saying do not murder you've heard of sad you don't murder don't call I say to you don't don't call your brother fool don't say you. I could label of like when you label someone that's like you're on the road to destroying them you know some of the coolest like leaders they will be here
 nice people with these labels that then makes it feel okay to then do horrible things to them so there is that danger of like yeah when we pointed someone else to say the dragon is over there reduce their image of God complexity to so Jesus says hey when you see the spec that you thinks the dragon like First Look inward deal with your own dragon in England hi Tim and John this is Tom from Bristol in England on a big fan of the podcast
 in June 13th of Satan himself and to ring Judas at the Last Supper before he goes out into the night to cause Jesus arrest this seems very connected to the theme of people becoming snakes I've been participant of Tails I wonder if this is the most romantic way with this can happen and what I really mean for Satan to your end of him many things for ED
 is it the most climatic way in which this can happen is this scene of Judas Satan answering you this cuz they're like kind of its climactic moment here showing what it looks like to become a big ass picture let's go let's leave the Last Supper that for a moment go back to we had the the snake in the garden with deception is a key theme and it's so the snake influences through a false a distortion of reality and putting that in front of people's imaginations than the cane story even though it's implicit and we've had to meditate on it for years there's something about him an idea entering his mind
 that is called sin it's like an animal that wants him and then when he act on that he murdered his brother in the field so it we're being asked to see some kind of influence like a beastly influence on his imagination and so that's when we introduced that image of putting on the costume another way to say it is you incarnate you become an embodiment as it were of the Dragon so the cane story really kicked off that Motif and then you get Lemak and then all these moments later in the story where people start doing horrible things to each other Were Meant to have like the cane template you know, underlying all of that which is why people can be called dragons so what's interesting then John uses two phrases actually
 all the way back in John Chapter 13 we need to scribes okay so I held on so Judas Judas is the person who got Jesus arrested so if Jesus is portrayed as and Steve to the woman here to crush the head of the snake but the snake gets a strike right on the heel of the snake Crusher Judas is that one like he he he was like to snake out of the cage so yeah yeah that's right of sorts I mean he's like we were the snake in cilicia spas and just say that he's a very significant figure in the story of Jesus you have to imagine after that first generation and the Jesus movement Judas sell real low on like the boy baby name list so it's the Judah and that one you can you hear it on the end and then he becomes an archetypal kind of bad guy but let's get on
 I never understood when they noted you this was without you this like you take him out of the story they could have still Found Jesus they could have still arrested Jesus like he is an important part of the story is he cool to the like the logic chain of Jesus getting arrested and I think so Jesus was super secretive in that last week he was retiring to a secret place has secretly arranged the places but when he was out in public he was in the temple courts and were told there that they do I need to get in there multiple times in Mark Luke and Matthew cuz he was so popular they arrested them there they didn't want to cause a riot okay so there's political kind of motivations of how they wanted to know if they had to be a low profile and at the end of each day Jesus will just slip out of the crowds and then he was gone
 look at the end of these is the one who Reveals His whereabouts at night until I see why you'd think that we set up the Godfather he's the the link I just live in a time where it's like the government knows where I'm at any point if you want to pick me up I think it's in a missile directly to me right now okay it's not about not like that like James Bond and Judas is the mole haha so as the gospel authors look back on that sequence of events
 they're portraying Jesus as a snake Crusher Judas is the key person who delivers son of man over into the pants of the Beast and so the gospels have different ways of describing how that happened John Chapter 13 begins saying during the supper the Diablo has translated the devil but the slanderer the Accuser
 the accuser had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot some Simon to betray him so there that's kind of using the cane model right there this purpose in the heart what is Judas want to hear totally okay so actually you want to know what to dust wants and you want a great piece of historical fiction who's the New Testament scholar Adam win who wrote a really well informed historical novel about the backstory of why to discuss what he does is called killing a messiah I listen to it it's wonderful to relate and the goal is to get an empathetic understanding of why would somebody and Trey Someone Like Jesus and why would the Kaya Fest in the high priests how would they have received Jesus and why did they do what they tell you why would pilot
 who is he why did he do what you do, and they create the backstory that's all historically informed but oh well we know that he was what do you say filching money from their purse John tells us that that they would have already so we know that Jesus is kingdom of God message and movement and his acceptance of the word Messiah that title very sparingly meant that Jesus knew he was walking on the nice ads with being perceived as yet another militant like revolutionary who's going to overthrow the Roman occupation
 unseat the high priesthood you know and that's like the Maccabees you know not long ago and she has to stay so that's the angle that Adam when explorers okay in his representation of Judas and that seems likely cuz what would cause somebody to be attracted to a leader and then become disillusioned with them and then eventually sell them out he becomes concerned that he's going to try to take power in this case it would be the opposite it's when he begins to learn all that he's not going to be not going to do that and that he's actually going to die he came to Jerusalem to die and he thinks that's how he's going to save the world okay and I might as well get on the good side The Winning Side so this guy is going to think she's going to die she's not going to start a Freedom Movement
 but all the people love him and what's up the temple leaders were told they see Jesus as a threat because all the people love him but yet he's claiming that the way that Israel is partnering with Rome going to lead to destruction is going to lead to destruction and they think well this guy's going to start a riot and this wouldn't be the first dry at this would be like the umpteenth Ryan Jerusalem the brat pilot to bring a heavy hand of that he's trying to keep the peace the trying to keep the peace so Judas is like I see this is going to Jesus is going to get taken out I I should get on it. I should get on the side of the victors here yet so that I've got a place at the table there could also be one thing Jerusalem doesn't need right now is another Riot and so he's trying to like hey I'm going to deliver Jesus quietly
 just do this behind closed doors and like keep the status quo but it's such a deceit and what's really going on which is really need to do is described in the gospels is being tempted by the devil what was it the devil put it in his heart into into his heart right cuz we know from Jesus teachings for him it's actually leading Israel to see that it's only by letting go
 of some Vision that we have of how Israel supposed to exist in the world
 that this is a family called to give up everything and surrender over to God even if that means death to open up the gates of Eden in eternal life and for the Nations with Jesus played was Israel's unique calling in the world to suffer
 the unbleached the life of Eden to the Nations and to not fear death and just thought that was apparently thought that was insane moves that was only going to bring more trouble so let the devil put it into his heart then later at the end of John 13 when it actually happens we were told is that the Satan entered into Judas so he's a different phrase to Satan entered into him so he has two ways of putting it the devil that slander putting something into your heart or the opposer entering into somebody that's another way of thinking about Cain yea
 yeah the same crouching at the door it was like putting the thought his mind I need to cut my brother and then there's this like The Devout than and it's the monster devouring Kane is kind of this idea that incarnating becoming one with yeah just like a two-step process anyway putting the idea in time in idea enters our minds we have to choice about whether to entertainment meditate on it and that can generate all kinds of other stuff or you can drive it out stomp on it so I can be done with that.
 it's at something like with Paul mentions there's that kind of well-known mind uses about taking every thought captive for the Messiah you doing thought so anyway thank you Tom I do think it is a way that John is showing a climactic moment of Jesus versus the power of the snake that has the word takes over Judith but I think it's important not to minimize judases own journey and his own agency and participation in the way of the snake thank you for your questions yeah always really wonderful man we spent I did we spend nearly half of your talk about the dragon yeah I guessed one almost 20 episode something that's half that's almost started in August the end of August worthy topic I think so thanks for hanging in there with us and I hope I hope it was worth so many hour
 hours of conversation and if you think talk about one subject for six months is a lot for all over the next year next year three chapters of the Bible all year that's the run now and I'm sure you've seen maybe a trailer of The Sermon on the Mount but yeah starting next year we're going to be reading slowly Sermon on the Mount we'll talk about it more next week we'll have our end-of-the-year podcast while Steve on Fearless CEO of the Bible project yeah kind of a year and recap will talk about Sermon on the Mount but since we have your attention right now one way to engage of some of the mountains in the app we're going to have this weekly playlist will show you will walk slowly and you can read it with us slowly and will give you videos and just clips of the podcast and articles and I'll
 you have engaged with that part of The Sermon on the Mount and then of course just on our YouTube channel will be releasing things January one will be the release of the first of a 10-part series on The Sermon on the Mount lots of content on top of that and so we're leaving the dragon behind and I'm sure he'll sneak out yeah he's never never never far outside of Eden and around but so is the presence of the snake Crusher thanks John I really enjoyed doing the series really really excited about what's going to happen with Sermon on the Mount of so much to explore and learn and be challenged by so yeah 2024 here we come here we come today's episode was brought to you by our podcast team producer Cooper Peltz associate producer Lyndsay Ponder editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey mix this episode and Hannah will provide
