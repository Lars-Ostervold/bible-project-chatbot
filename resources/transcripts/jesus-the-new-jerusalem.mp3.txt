the story of the Bible has created an expectation for us we build our own cities full of corruption and violence but there is a city of God coming and the gospel authors identify that New Jerusalem coming down from heaven as Jesus himself coming down into the form of a human baby getting put in a feeding trough and what is happening in and around that baby is such a filament of all those hopes for the New Jerusalem that you read about in Isaiah so if Jesus is the New Jerusalem what is his relationship to the actual pictures of Jesus clearly understands that Jerusalem as it stands in his day as opposed to the purpose of God and the ships not going to turn around he wanted to be a part of helping the generation turn and avoid the fire the flood but not only are they not going to do that Jesus knows that he's going to lose his life by standing against the true slim of its de Jesus
 followers become the city of God when they live out the ethic of Jesus which is the opposite of the ethic of cities cities and body human fear is scarcity is not enough for everyone we need to protect ourselves creating a cycle of violence and revenge followers of Jesus break that cycle when they live lives of radical generosity is leading the New Jerusalem to be a movement of people who will surrender their lives out of self-love for others to birth and bring about the city of got him a key and I talked about Jesus and the City of Jerusalem from John Collins and you're listening to the Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
it's a page on all right we are talking about the City theme in the Bible and we did a big recap episode last week it aired and now we're continuing on we did this recap episode kind of right in the middle of talking about Jesus yeah I think we took a few days of a break I've been thinking a lot about our conversations and I feel like getting some new Clarity but we didn't means we interrupted the story of Jesus as we talked about the City airport to talk about it and just a position to the Garden which we started because the big move becomes we've got what we got the garden but God's Throne is there's a bundle and got cultivated it and it's good it's for the generation of new life and so it represents what does it look like for Humanity
 Ted well with the wisdom of God where the Throne of God exists as access to the throne of God and the people can live in right relationships with each other and there's a bun dance and there's a God's protection album this is pretty important for people living well with each other as we know from our experience, you know we tend to not trust each other and start treating each other poorly and totally and it doesn't take much at all in my mind maybe that's something by psychologically you know I know we differ from animals many degrees but you know squirrels have something driving them to get all those acorns in might put him in the trunk of the tree you know what I mean and they'll fight over those acorns and trees other each other terribly like in my front yard I watch it happen
 just barked at you oh yes yeah there's these seed pods at fault for my neighbor's tree in the sidewalk and I watched them like just destroy each other trying to get one of these you know Demetri Martin's joke about squirrels because they realize they're late for something
 the squirrel that the species is an animal they're constantly late yet but yeah it's not hard to do all that today is scarcity the presence of abundance is actually really crucial to the Peace of the city because when their scarcity is the worst in human nature and that is kind of the well we did we did talk a lot about that the beginning of this theme the abundance of the garden and trusting in God's abundant but I think to set us back up I think it became clear was that Jesus was acting like a new David and at the same time as the gospel authers talk about him are describing him as the moment in the prophets where this new creation Act is happening and donning on a new city of Jerusalem where this anointed one will come and rain and his servants will reign with him
 and there's going to be the city or the nation's can flock to and find peace flock they can stream to about 2 if I peace and so all of these hopes of a city on a hill where the wisdom of God the presence of God is going in and recreating things in creating peace amongst all the nations is now all of that is being focused on Jesus as a person and now Jesus as he goes out and start killing people and doing his teachings he's all realizing all this prophetic hope of the new dawn of the sunrise of God who then would shine on on the city if that's right just like King David he and apparently alway chose Jerusalem as this city it was formerly a Canaanite City
 but David brought the throne presence of God in the Tabernacle up to the high point of the City established it and it becomes rules it with righteousness and Justice he's led by the spirit of God and there's blessing and a huge feast and everybody gets lost to eat and it's like a little Garden of Eden moment but now in the city like the Redemption of the city with the Gaga Kingdom in presents takes up residence in the city so in parallelism to that but with differences with the gospel authors are saying is after that version of The Garden City got corrupted now here is the dwelling Throne place of God coming down but not over Jerusalem coming down into the form of a human baby
 getting put in a feeding trough and what is happening in and around that baby is the fifth element of all those hopes for the New Jerusalem that you read about in Isaiah so I like that parallels and they make sense then why Matthew specifically it would be where we have the famous words of Jesus saying about himself and his followers that they are the city on the hill shining their lights of the Nations and he's doing this well outside of the city of Jerusalem explicitly so like up in Galilee he's not in Jerusalem and he's telling then a group of people who are just the non-point people or unimportant people of his day you're the city you're the Servants of the anointed one is essentially kind of what he's getting at 2 is that will seem and Isaiah of a group
 faithful group within the city with a God will establish resources the city so now this group needed to go and take Jerusalem and roulette with righteousness and Justice cuz that's where the prophetic hope goes is there's going to be a city and that city is going to be on a hill and it's Jerusalem and the Nations will stream to it so they need to go and take control of Jerusalem right that is one way you could understand clearly where your mind would go totally Jesus is the new David and he has his crew then they should take interest in Jerusalem and they do and by the way I'm Jesus I mean all Jewish people took interest in Jerusalem there was a pilgrimage there multiple times a years where the temple was and the temple features large in Jesus's teachings and in the way the gospel
 betray his relationship to the city but it's with a Twist to the twist it already is hinted at in the birth story in Matthews account pacifically where the present King and Leadership of Jerusalem is set in opposition to Jesus the king and his Jerusalem because Herod was trying to kill Jesus from the start so that's the first mention of Jerusalem in Matthew is as a source of death for babies that means really horrifying and it's the place that the the star that the light that's shining will come and then pass it over to the Bethlehem so Jerusalem is already standing in opposition to the thing that God wants to do with Jesus
 it appears we're going to do is just take a survey of depictions or mentions of Jerusalem in the teachings of Jesus as it goes rotten or my highlight Matthew and Luke specifically just a quick Mansion honorable mentions John the baptizer Johnny Mercer is a renewal movement down by the Jordan River Matthew and Luke say that all Jerusalem and Judea and the district around the Jordan we're going out to him
 and being baptized Sam and he saw Pharisees and Sadducees Pharisees were all over but sad to seize our Temple leadership it's Jerusalem Jerusalem leadership contingent comes to John and what John's cause of them is the seed of the snake brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming anger yeah that's not a good night as well, can you imagine someone at church was going to get baptized here like baptism it would have lost cuz I have that doesn't Klaus guy comes out as like I told you to come out here
 produce fruit worthy of repentance
 I don't think you can say whatever hams our ancestor not Abraham. You can raise up new Abraham's from these rocks the axe is at the root of the trees every tree that doesn't produce good fruit cut down thrown into the fire every bit of this description comes from the day of the Lord in the prophet Isaiah some Jeremiah from Zephaniah so what's important here is to realize that John is identifying with the Sadducees coming the intention was not to align themselves with what God was doing current there for some other reason that's not explicitly but Johnny B's reaction your kind of like he's some kind of a that look what your mentality in the way you're going about this is so backwards is so problematic yeah like God's judgment is coming on you through this alone is not in a state to ever be
 the Garden City it is destined for destruction so what were they doing up there why did they come to John I'll be baptized just as they were going out to him I don't the story doesn't say but I think the way Matthew Paints the scene is that when John looks at the leadership of Jerusalem and he's down here saying what Israel needs to do is to turn and repent because we have not been representing the god of his I see it doesn't say they came to be baptized they were just coming to his baptism people that's right when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism I started reading that as like they wanted to be. It is kind of funny but when John sees his guy they are just like them so the point is is John depicts a coming disaster to God's going to bring about in Jerusalem and as he does so he
 Sans and continuity with the prophets Jerusalem is not in a state to become the Garden City and is Matthew you already know that the light is already starts shining on the Garden City and it's in the form of a person
 so Jesus picks up John's message and so the first time that Jesus is described as saying anything is in Matthew chapter 4 it's exactly what John says repent he went around Galloway saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven has come here then you get The Sermon on the Mount literally sentences after he says repent and he calls his followers the city on the hill the light shining to the nation's and that's at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount then you get The Sermon on the Mount
 then you get the conclusion to The Sermon on the Mount and here it is is Matthew chapter 7 everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock so a person with wisdom building a house up on a rock you through the up in there but well yeah but oh well a mineral rocks going to be elevated I guess unless it's just a flat stone with a notation anybody like Jesus is mine too saturated in the profits in the song Zion means Rock cuz I had every time we talk about God being the Rock God on Jerusalem that's right this is clearly and the word for temple in Hebrew is house it's the word house okay the house of God so we're there isn't a separate word there is one called hey call less common but Tabernacle is its own words and the temple is
 your house is just through our house. There's no word that means Temple it's house there is a word that refers specifically to Temple structure call way less often than just the Hebrew word for house and it can be a human house where God's house so when Jesus talked about building a house on a rock you're like very clear Jesus you're talking about building a temple what it has all of the Echoes of Illusion and Jesus spoken hyperlink to riddles from Hebrew scripture all the time and this for sure one of them because there's a flood coming the rain came down in the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house but it didn't fall down cuz it's Foundation was on the rock
 everyone who hears these words of mine and doesn't do them is like the fool who built his house on Sand the rain is coming the river's coming the winds are blowing the beat against the house and it will collapse and its faults great so there is coming a flood coming and how that Israel has his day fairs through the flood all depends on whether they will listen to The Sermon on the Mount and live by it you know that's another thing we didn't recap that is part of this which is how God deals with the crushing of cities that like Sodom and Gomorrah being this example of a city that's going too far and then God's judgment comes going to suddenly and severely threatened the city of Kane and let Mac goes too far
 and you get the flat Wright City of Sodom Gomorrah goes too far and you get a flood of fire city of Babylon and in Genesis 11 goes too far and gets guy that gets scattered pharaohs of Egypt goes too far and Pharaoh's Army is destroyed in the C and D created in the 10 play Candy created the ten plagues and then Drew Salam goes too far and God lets the Assyrians and Babylonians take them out that's right but then when the prophets talk about this they're like but listen Babylon gone too far yes but they're going to be taken by another Army so there's a theme of of Justice coming that a city has to always be aware that like there's going to be a refining moment yeah if it's Injustice goes too far God will hand it over to self ruin or to be ruined by another bigger badder City and when that ruin comes like a flood or fire
 that would it lays what it shows is what actually could stand that's right answer the question becomes like are you creating something that can stand to write what will remain John the baptizer Johnny B says a fire is coming and it will clean out the threshing floor so he says Jesus says a floods coming and all that will be left is what was built on a rock which is
 not very cryptic way describing the city on the hill with the temple of God in the Mist
 used to some other comments that Jesus had about Jerusalem this one's from Luke Chapter 13 so one day some people came to tell him about the number of galileans whose blood pilot had mixed with their sacrifices coded code speak basically some people are coming to tell Jesus is doing around doing this kingdom of God announcement saying that there's a bunch of people from up here in Galilee where you live Jesus who went down to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple and pile the Roman Governor attacked and killed a bunch of people in the temple
 and so their human blood was spilt along with the animal blood of the sacrifices that's the event has been a tragic event in Jerusalem the mixing of blood is like the violence that spilled blood is now mixed with what was supposed to be a surrender of animal blood like this would have been the same effect as when there's like a mass shooting here in America at a religious gathering as has happened many times over in multiple different religious communities here that's the same thing and they are killed while they worshipped so pilot was a cruel governor and there were numerous times where he ordered violence order to soldiers on Jewish crowds protesting in in various
 so this particular incident isn't recorded like by Josephus who's one of the main historians we have for this. But pilot told a number of things like this over the course of his career so what's interesting is Jesus's response he answered them and said do you think that those galileans were worse Sinners than any of the rest of the Israelites living up here and go away just because that happened to them know I tell you unless all y'all turn around we're all going to perish like that as well
 or you know those eighteen on whom the Tower of Siloam fell this is not recording would be the last month or something who knows and kill them do you think they were worse Sinners then all the people living in Jerusalem no no no I tell you unless you all y'all repent y'all are going to perish as well as far as coming coming far as coming and what you saw was like a momentary blaze of that fire which is hard to stomach but it's also this kind of reality that God continues to use a nation's evil against other nations evil that's right and so here is like an evil corrupt person but why Jesus see that is just like the long arm of God's justice like Nations what they want the reason I highlight this passage is the Roman Governor is key to the scene what pilot did that day and the temple is just a sign of what room can
 do handle their own will do unless you repent and for Jesus with enemies has turn and follow me and live by The Sermon on the Mount And if you live by The Sermon on the Mount the fire was still come right boy says unless you repent you will perish as well I think if you live by The Sermon on the Mount of Olives will start living by The Sermon on the Mount and then those galleons who were in the temple like whatever it was that provoked the Roman Governor whatever protest whatever I mean you know Revolution was in the are the of the Zealot Jesus recruited you know a freedom fighter of an Israelite onto an esteemed Simon the Zealot so there may have been some sort of Revolt happening at they shut down almost always pilot was responding to some he was as cruelly as being like you know what what's take out some no no no no
 times that Josephus and Israelite contemporary historian the times that he mentions pilot you know getting violent with Jewish crowds it's because they were protesting or he's responding to the bachelor like Freedom Fighters and revolutionaries cuz The Sermon on the Mount very clearly talks about how do you relate to someone who's pressing you and you relate to your enemies and relate to your enemies it's right and to do it in a way that creates peace through non-violence creatively but not through lack of suffering in other words in Jesus is New Jerusalem the way we respond to scarcity and violence and fear is radical generosity even if it cost you to break the cycles of fear and violence that tend to characterize cities
 suck unless you follow me Rome's going to consume us all just like he did in those days and this was Jesus called This is placing Jesus's call it is first century context with the facts on the ground as they were and then that case The Sermon on the Mount just pops cuz it was about living in occupied territory
 so Jesus is warning that if he's not follow this the New Jerusalem that he's claiming to be that there's a fire coming and it becomes clear throughout Matthew and Luke that Jesus gets a clear understanding but no one's going to listen to him or very few or going to listen to him so drinking apple juice a good example in Luke chapter 13
 verse 31 around that time some Pharisees approached him saying hey you should get out of here Herod king of Jerusalem wants to kill you and he said to them go tell that fox did not a compliment in English it might be a compliment to be a fox go tell that fox cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow and on the third day I reach my goal nevertheless I must go on today and tomorrow and the next day because it cannot be that a prophet parishes outside of Jerusalem
 Jerusalem Jerusalem City that kills the prophets and Stones those sent to her how often I wanted to gather your children like a hen gathers her children under her wings but you would not have it and so your house is left you desolate I say to you you won't see me until the time comes when you all say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord that's a lot a lot a lot a little puzzles in here Jesus clearly understands that Jerusalem has a stand in history as opposed to the purpose of God and the ships not going to turn around he wanted to be a part of helping this generation turn and avoid the fire in the flood but not only are they not going to do that Jesus knows that he's going to lose this life by standing against the Jerusalem of the stay
 what he's talking about here when he says you won't see me till the day when you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord Jesus is referring the head to what happens when he rides his Royal donkey up into Jerusalem and who these are people that came from the Pharisees first season came from Jerusalem okay the leader Jerusalem wants to kill you and Jesus is kind of like yeah I know it's always been that way I know
 and when I come in next like that's The Showdown to start The Showdown will start and what he's anticipating is Passover weekend coming up and Jesus timed everything for The Showdown with Jerusalem now he doesn't say he doesn't like the thing is here it is not Jerusalem here it is like ruling over Jerusalem but there's still this hope of like there's a Jerusalem that can be restored that hair it's the problem and we should clarify this is not the harrad to kill the babies when Jesus was a baby that Herod has died. This is now a sign of Herod and we're at later herod's none of them were any better but we're a little less paranoid or what and if you go back up when Jesus says oh Jerusalem Jerusalem the city that killed the prophets he's inviting Jerusalem here. Herod I understand that that is true
 but Herod yeah I guess you could say is an emblem of a much greater reality that is just the corrupt leadership of Jerusalem the Jesus views them the same way that Isaiah Jeremiah veered the leaders of Jerusalem in their day six hundred years earlier so Jesus rides into Jerusalem and there's a whole crowd that is singing psalms of praise to greet him blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord the Pharisees in the crowd or like tell these people to shut up and Jesus that's why I can't I can't because if I do that then the rocks will start praising me so miserable as well as he approached the city he saw it and he started weeping saying if only you had known on this day the things that would make for peace
 but now they are hidden from your eyes for days will come upon you your enemies will put up an embankment against you surround you press you in hard from all sides they will raise you to the ground you and your children inside and not leave one stone on the other because you didn't recognize the time of your visitation so he's describing here very typical scene for the walled City being besieged what's interesting is he's taken all of this language from Jeremiah Isaiah and Ezekiel to describe what the Babylonians did to Jerusalem 500 plus years earlier and the time of the visitation is another little hyperlink to a number of text but primarily first to the time when God visited Israel when it was enslaved in Egypt was called the visitation God came to visit Israel and he visited and attended to them
 so he's describing himself and his followers and Israel of his day as being enslaved to Jerusalem it sets at the analogy works is God visited enslaved Israel in the days of oppressive Pharaoh now God is visiting except this time the oppressor Pharaoh is Jerusalem so he's really need to be rescued from Jerusalem in the same way that is really to be so it's like the flood comes on Egypt and out of Egypt a Passover which is easier on Passover weekend comes a remnant of the righteous Remnant that comes out the other side
 so this connects to you know a couple days later Jesus and his followers are up at the temple will then he pulls a stunt at the temple turning over the tables and through clever hyperlinks to the prophets announce the downfall of the temple yet again
 when the his followers start to go on a little tour around the city and they're like pointing out how beautiful the city is in the temple in this long description I'm in Luke's account Luke chapter 21 he starts talking about what he said when he wrote Into the City not one stone will be left on another the whole place will be torn down and they say teacher when is this going to happen and what will be the sign that all of these things are going to take place so he goes on a long speech are but what he describes as the downfall of the city and what he says a 20 is when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies you will know that it's desolation is near the big clue yep and they said later 24 Jerusalem will be Trampled Under Foot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled
 who is tapping into that pattern that you mentioned about God handing evil said he's over to other evil cities
 and eventually he'll bring all nations to account but there's going to be this long. Of Jerusalem being handed over and then he says in verse 32 this generation will not pass away until all this takes place so he's pretty clear and soon was tricky is that what he describes in between is Wars and famines and earthquakes and the Sun going dark and the stars and all of the language in this comes from cosmic flood decreation language the Jesus has adopted from the prophets to describe the downfall of Jerusalem to Rum so this is Jesus's relationship to the city of Jerusalem so you come with this expectation that okay if Jesus is God's
 thrown and its presence, I actually got himself now with us and all of his prophetic hope and Isaiah specifically is about then the establishment of a city in the anointed one in the city and the city's on the hill and the Nations will stream to it then you imagine in okay Jesus needs to go and him and his crew need to become the leadership of Jerusalem and when he comes to Jerusalem what you learn very quickly is that it's not what is going to happen that in fact he's going to stand off at you some supper or maybe it is going to happen but in this weird reimagined since we may well right here always done if this point is say the Jerusalem and its leadership is going to be destroyed by another
 yeah but not then so they don't like that week which is like Jesus is said hey I'm going to come back and I know here it's going to have Caleb I get it he comes back and you know The Showdown starts and that's what the flood coming but he's talking about the flood coming and like in the future than the generation to generation that's right but we also know that he knows that he's going to suffer but now so Jesus gets arrested for pulling that stuff in the temple and for all the problems that the leadership has been having with him for quite a long time and he gets taken to the Council of the elders the High Council just called the Sanhedrin and in the trial scene which we talked about many times over the years but just relevant to this point this is the city holding Jesus to account this is Jesus the nude
 Iceland versus
 battle Jerusalem there's L Aslam so to speak Jesus is the New Jerusalem Full Gospel authors of trying to tell us that Jesus is the Heavenly temple of God Temple presence of God become human and that he and his followers are the city on the hill. Is the New Jerusalem redefined at 3 to find what the prophetic hope of a future New Jerusalem would actually look like the light of the New Jerusalem did in fact shine but it shined up and go away as Jesus was doing this thing that's kind of where all that imagery was going okay you all are the city on the hill let your light shine before the nation's when Jesus is doing that he sang me and y'all are the dawn of the New Jerusalem and it's not happening down in Judea does that Jerusalem is corrupt and it's headed for Destruction okay so that's different than the way I was paying the picture I was trying to picture of
 now okay clearly Jesus needs to go and establish his yeah I see his rule in Jerusalem and what you're saying is actually the move that we should be picking up on is that our concept of Jerusalem needs to change it isn't the place up on the hill where the temple is it came down and it's Jesus he's in Galilee that's the new city that is the New Jerusalem Jesus is the New Jerusalem I mean that's what you sent I think that's the logic of where Matthews and Jesus is trying to take us they are the Earthly embodiment of the Heavenly Jerusalem so he's not called the New Jerusalem but just to like make the case right the star back to the Bristol representing God's light shining as Isaiah 60 yes Matthew has painted the birth of Jesus
 putting Jesus in the slot of the city on the hill shining at the light to the Nations who, for the gifts the all the languages all the way with him he's the dawn of the New Jerusalem Jerusalem City and he calls his followers the city on the hill and the light to the Nations and lets the nation's the gospel author calls Jesus the Tabernacle and so could very confidently say whatever New Jerusalem is whatever they like the hope for ReStore Jerusalem suddenly like it's what you Jesus and his crew which creates attention and raise his question will what's the relationship of Jesus and his New Jerusalem to the actual Jerusalem Thursday Jerusalem down in Judea. So we can talk about this conversation was that relationship is you guys are going to experience a flood
 yep Jesus was trying to get Earthly Jerusalem and all of its failed but to turn you to follow him or else face the fire of Rome and it became clear to him that just like in the prophets of old Jerusalem was going to choose the way itself around so he doesn't just leave it at that though to be like well cool we'll plan our movement up here and he keeps going to Jerusalem as we know from the Gospel of John and then for this Passover weekend he goes to Jerusalem and Mike intentionally provokes The Showdown knowing that it will get him killed why is it doing that that's the question. So as Jesus is being held on trial in this is Luke chapter 22
 Sanhedrin meets and they say if you are the Messiah that is the anointed Royal priest-king tell us and Jesus said if I tell you you'd not going to believe me
 and if I ask you what you think you're not going to answer me straight but from now on from this moment on you will see the son of man
 seated at the right hand of the power of God
 yeah which is biblical allusions hyperlinks for Cosmic divine-human of Daniel 7 and The Royal priest-king of Psalm 110 that's me I am the king of the city and of God said he basically said like I'm going to tell you but yeah I am but from this key has From This Moment forward which is you're about to kill me so my entire execution is in fact my throat my enthronement so then they say what further testimony do we need this is the linchpin he's going to be there right at 1 and this is why the gospel authors include all these details about Jesus getting the road but what are you going to say was you're about to make me you're about to make me
 the cosmic King of the city of creation right here in Jerusalem and the gospel authors and Jesus are trying to tell us that his execution actually was his enthronement as a seed of David over the New Jerusalem in Jerusalem like it's happening but it's all getting flipped you say this way like what Jesus is actually living out the ethic of The Sermon on the Mount where he is leading the New Jerusalem to be a movement of people who will surrender their lives out of self-love for others to Burris and bring about the city of God cuz that's what it will take is to not protect know all the way back to can sort of been Lemak sore like you wanted me my pride so Atlantic says I'm going to kill you I'll kill you that's how the city
 Amanda logic of the city is not turn the other cheek it's ya kill for a wound what those walls represent are like you're going to kill me then I'll either build a wall to protect myself and if you try and climb my wallet chop off your head that's the logic of the city and that's the city's way of preserving life is to kill anyone who tries to get in my wall and now here's the Heavenly City become human who goes to the Earthly City and becomes it's King by letting his enemies kill him and I think we're back to that scarcity
 and what's the way to actually preserve life so that they can flourish and Jesus flips the script by living out the ethic of The Sermon on the Mount in also something you know Cosmic is going to happen which is his death and resurrection and then the getting of spirit and so that his death has been thrown meant is not just him giving example of here's how you surrender unto death for peace but it's also saying and when I do it I'm going to unlock I'm going to unlock salvation I'm going to unlock like Resurrection I'm going to unlock like the spirit of God poured out like yeah that's right well which is like the enthronement you know like you're going to kill me my true power is going to come to this play and that power is resurrected life and spirit that's right another words a kind of life
 that humans cannot take away because humans didn't create it so humans build a city and then we can control how life gets protected generated in here but it keeps happening at the cost of some human life or many human lives not just what are cities accepted some flourish usually at the expense of Ethics you can usually see it really dramatically cuz you have the flourishing and then on flourishing usually living right next to each other so what if there was a city where the fear of death was taken off the table with that change how people relate to each other what if there is a city where you so trusted that there was so much Abundant Life that even if I die it's okay because my life wasn't given to me by some other people in the city it was given to me by God and so my life will continue on even if the form that I have it right now
 and that would really change how you lived in the city I think not seem to change how Jesus lived and confronted the leaders of his City because he knew that his life would be getting back to him I think that's how this works and so when we talked about a city not made by human hands or the hope of the New Jerusalem the can't be ever taken away by the city of man I think that's what we're talking about
 so I get it but we've introduced a phrase that's new which is the logic of the city and it was really interesting phrase and you applied it to Lenox poem and I'm wondering if that is something we need to pay attention to the logic of the city is to preserve life what are those walls for protect and preserve life one thing we did talk about early on is how the tree of knowing good and bad in the garden represents the choice to attach this or will I trust God's wisdom what is good and bad or will I take it on my own
 and then you made a point of saying hey the city is now the tree of the knowledge of good and bad like warm us choosing that now like become manifest like institutionally so the logic of I can know good from bad I can decide good from bad now become like institutionalized and how that can be leveraged to do incredible good yes this was Joseph in Egypt I can but on a knife's edge can be leveraged to do horrendous horrendous evil and the logic of the city is to push things over on the wrong side of the knife-edge to say like hey if God was gracious with cane than I get to be I get to murder people who just insult me if you are threatening me I can take you out to try which is a move that humans make in order to preserve life
 just their own lives or the lives of the people that care about so The Logical the city is how will you serve life how we preserve our protect life here and and often has to do with threatening death yeah I will protect Life by threatening death and it works it's actually very powerful way to get yourself if it's right threatening punishment for death is very effective way to manage him in for an acting it and then sometimes killing but in the storyline of the Bible that's never a solution that's just always like a cycling of violence it's always like violence and doing violence and doing violence but it's never the solution to how then will there be yes that's right a city of Peace yeah but what if there was a new a colony
 Heavenly calling a lot of here on Earth a new type of City whose ethic is explored in The Sermon on the Mount and whose leader in body. Ethic by giving up his life in order to preserve and protect the lives of others and receiving that life back from God you know infinitely more in Eternal Resurrection Life so what is the threat of death was taken off the table how would you live in that new Heavenly Colony right I just use new Freddy Freddy the servants and Isaiah a group of people but not the majority is minority group who are being faithful to God's wisdom and Justice and righteousness that a city being re-established will come through that
 and those people will be associated with an anointed one and become little like a note in one that's all and Isaiah and so in Jesus calls his followers the city he is invoking the image of that group that's friend but they're not a city they are what's going to be remaining when the cities destroyed yeah sure yeah they're the thing that's going to stand when the flood comes and so then in a sense they are the city will remain and so when you say create colonies you're almost also saying what you said is like build your house on the rock like create community in a way that when the flood comes it will stay because a flood will come
 and what remains will be the city and there's this prophetic hope that have an ultimate flood where Babylon will no longer stand I can't wait come back and re-emerge it's now if you got it done forever and in which case what remains will be New Creation that lasts cuz you have all the cycling of floods in Jesus says look another ones come other ones coming he talks about it as a cataclysmic Cosmic flood of Justice the funny the Greek word for flood is the Sun Goes dark and you know he's like that's how we talked about it but it's Jerusalem being seized or destroyed my room and so
 we're all visiting I've been thinking about okay we live in the city I live in the city of Portland every single human civilization 6 around long enough and it's and it's something bad's going to happen right just going to hit the fan at some point could be a literal flood you know out here we just have an earthquake yeah that's right on the west coast on the West Coast or West Coast of the United States but also is always the threat of like what nation what other group might come and just take over and you know we don't feel that here living in the northwest corner of America but imagine living in the train right now so like this happens it does happen and another way it happens is the slow rot and decay of decadence and affluence
 and disparity of wealth and just the whole thing just crumbles from within over a slow painful process of many generations yeah that's right I like an economic collapse that comes out of just letting me in 3 claps in slow-mo so these are all floods of sorts yeah that's right and so I guess I guess my point was like there's wisdom and kind of anticipating not only the like future Cosmic one that will wipe waiting for good which is like this theme but that there's going to be more Regional little come in cycles and waves yeah yeah that's exactly right so the question is how do you live in the present as a follower of Jesus how do you build
 the city that will remain I'm curious why you say build cuz it's very small number of people who ever going to start a city that actually like becomes a city most people just find themselves moving to cities that are they exist and then adding to it may be contributing to it yeah I want to be helping lead it I guess when I say build I didn't mean like build a new city but when Jesus says like you are the city and it gets them in a sack right. A project create something creative community. So I guess I'm saying like what are you going to create and what is the thing when she says build your house on the rock
 what's he talking about he's not saying like go find a new Mountain create a new Temple right but he's saying what's coming to community
 just fundamental way of relating to each other is built on trust in the generous love and power of God that is more powerful than any type of scarcity or threat or fear or death itself and if you live as if that's true then that will change the way that you relate to your neighbors in that community and if you live that way it's costly like she's a sick it could result in the end of your life we're losing a lot but in reality what you'll be doing is sowing seeds of new creation is really connecting
 yeah let's make a balance where we could go, just far enough when I actually have to suffer in that kind of intensity but I'm just saying like you read The Sermon on the Mount and you're like wow wow that is a way to be
 human
the ultimate embodiment of the ethics of what Jesus is doing in Jerusalem but didn't body to self in Jerusalem in the days after Jesus rose from the dead when all the sudden all the Widow's you know and their communities were cared for and they start making a list of who's the Widow in your Jesus community over there in North East Jerusalem we got to get food and people start donating property and possessions losing their possessions so that others in the community could find a meal right like that before and it started taking in Jerusalem and I was going to have us look at this in the next conversation but then you get Stephen who actually speaks truth to those in power
 and it gets him killed so it takes a variety of forms but some of the more mundane looking some of them. All of them were based on this basic ethic of self-sacrificial love for the benefit of the other even if it cost me or takes away from my self security or self-preservation I'm trying to get the logic of the city seems their magic of The Sermon on the Mount just like the polar opposite of the logic of Candor Lemak in the logic of the human City look up the useful contrast so there is how come you embed the logic of the garden into the City and that can at moments make it to the city becomes like Joseph Egypt perhaps there might be moments like that but also there's going to be lots of moments where that logic finds itself at odds with power and asked us
 do we think of the city of God coming to Earth
 this is what Jesus is imagining his he's imagining that that's $0.01 that's like the in terms of thinking about the kingdom of God as both here and yet to fully come while we live on earth used to write this biblical cosmology language what we live on earth as the resurrection in the coming of the spirit first signs of New Creation right here down on Earth that's the forms at the ethic takes but because we live outside of Eden living out that vision of the New Jerusalem will take a toll it will cost and it will actually cost like that our mortal bodies are dying so any effort or any energy that I give out comes at a cost
 what I'm trying to say is what Paul says very briefly in 1st Corinthians 15 is that Flesh and Blood the mode of existence that you and I know of In This Moment cannot inherit the kingdom of God requires a full Resurrection in re-creation of power mode of existence of God He reigns in this Temple over his Heavenly City I'm using it as shorthand for it to just say in the capital of his kingdom in the present I think what we are called to is both believe the city of God has begun begun but at the same time it will involve a full re-creation of the universe as we know it and as long as the universe exists in this form as we know it or experience of the city of God will always be in that kind of a diminished
 seed form in my own life in my body and in my community was the theme of Babylon still exist like they're still in the city of God is being established in the prophets then that's the end of the story city of God comes and then all the nations stream up to it story is a complete copy ending in Jesus city of God comes and then he suffers and dies resurrected and then his rain begins but the nations are still like in an uproar and there is a piece
 and then there's this hope that will it started but it hasn't finished and that's where then you exist now and so this is why that this is a way to transition to The Next Step this helps explain why in the letters of the Apostles they will continue this language and imagery describing Jesus's followers as colony is Paul
 actually in Philippians the colony of Heaven that is a genuine Outpost of the presence of God here on Earth but from there from heaven we await a rescuer who will come and transform our lowly bodies in this mortal world into a new creation colony of Heaven All right so that's then yeah where we'll go next to the spine Land This Plane on the team of the city so is Dan going with the Bible project podcast team and I'm in the studio here today remind for another employee in adduction can you go in as yourself my name is Christopher Mayer tell me a little bit about what you do hear about butter yeah I've been with Bible project for 3 years now I do a few different areas of writing I write the monthly for your email that goes out I do some website copy for our support channels and then I'm in the inbox answering old
