we're in the middle of the second movement of Deuteronomy and we're reading a lot of ancient law and its natural as we do this to wonder how in the world could this apply to me or anyone that was the day on the show we're going to explore how the laws of Deuteronomy applied to Jesus in the first century Christians and remember and do time me 12 the land of Canaan is being reclaimed as a Garden of Eden and what is the Garden of Eden that's the place we're having dinner there one for God and his people are one together and so in the New Testament Jesus comes on to the scene and even will say the in the temple that he is the temple where he'll say the temple is my body or the one greater than Temple is here and that when my followers get together just maybe two or three of them guess what I'm in the middle like the Tree of Life the Apostles of Jesus we lied on the
 construct early Christians how to live in their world in fact the Apostle Paul may have had Deuteronomy on the mind when he instructed the Corinthians to donate financially to their impoverished brothers and sisters in Jerusalem the law as stated in Deuteronomy 15 is stating an ideal like a true north but of course there's all of these others mitigating circumstances or
 things that will require wisdom and discernment and the law as word it doesn't address those be kind of gives you the core and I think essentially because that has been such a contrast to the Nations around them the laws in Deuteronomy were important for ancient Israel to know how to make the transition from being a nomadic people wandering the desert two people settled in the land of Canaan but these laws are also important to us to as we try to live as people of God in an ever-changing cultural landscape is it begins with the word in the beginning and tell the story about all humanity and how all of humans organize their life in the world is the story of the natural he's going to have an expansive vision for all of human life in the world and so it's just turns out life's complicated need to be wise in Weston today
 talk about the wisdom of the law on Collins and you listening to buy wood project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
hey John we are in the 50 g and the last conversation we talked about how the laws in the whole world including was here in Deuteronomy our wisdom yeah we are sectioning the middle of the center section of Deuteronomy chapters 12 through 25 a restatement of a couple hundred laws some of what your new but many of which are restatements of laws that occurred earlier Torah not overdone and the purpose of the law as we discussed is to create a people who are wise and understanding and can live in right relationships with others in other words be righteous and with God and with the one who they relate to by means of these Covenant or if you can cuz you just said love God and love your neighbor is one thing
 yeah and then that's righteousness but then also it will create Justice which is when things are out of alignment how do you get back yeah so the laws do all of this and so the question became well do they really for me when I read these ancient laws I just feel stuck and defensive or confused and it's so hard to then go to them and go okay what's the wisdom underneath and what I posed to you at the end of last conversation was yeah this is great for an ancient Israelite who's pretty close to the context is short of these laws were given but the farther removed you are the deeper the wisdom is hidden it seems like yeah or the more work it takes to get there yeah that's true and I guess when we're reading scripture especially the Hebrew Bible it's the same principle of
 communication do that we have to live by every day when we talked to any other person talking to a couple though which is like turned up yeah we're just saying that the principal is empathy and seeking to understand what someone means open-mindedness and openness to another person's way of seeing and talking about the world that there might be something for me hear the will at least allow me to Cana delay Matt cardle a frustration but none the less it takes work it takes to work the hope is that this will shape us into people who live what's a good word for people who live in peace with God and neighbor you the blessing of Eden which is peace Harmony
 now we're not in eating so you know anytime earthquake and just ruin everything but you can create a little taste of Eden outside of it when you live by the wisdom of the Torah
 so you're not spirit I thought what we can do is go to some different sections the La Collection in the center of Deuteronomy has two Big Blocks what we call chapters 12 through 18 is mostly about maintaining right relationship between Israel and God through worship and what we would call I guess and religious loyal and then how they structure their leadership to help guide them and loyalty the second big block chapters 19 to 25 is mostly neighbor to neighbor family community relationships so we'll just kind of take me to turn this episode will be will choose some Flack the laws and 12 through 18 of Deuteronomy so let's start with something
 really disturbing and complicated but nothing for it 12:30 oats which you so observe in the land which our you're the other name of your father has given you to possess as long as you live on the land it's speaking of possessing the land yes speaking of possessing that Land This is the first law in this whole block you sell out early destroy all the places where the Nations whom you dispossess serve their gods on high mountains and on hills and under every Green Tree tear down their altars smashed the sacred pillars burn the sacred trees are called Asurion cut down engraved images of their gods and erase their name from that place obviously that's a positive so I can do this in relationship to the gods that are there and then it will flip inverse poor
 don't act that way towards y'all way your Ella him so don't treat me with that kind of like the Canaanites treat their gods rather verse five in the whole rest of the chapter is going to be about how you always going to choose the place when you go into the land Yahweh will choose a place from among all the tribes to put his name there for his dwelling and that's where you all will come the place where the Tabernacle supposed to go basically another word establish a centralized place that will become a new center of worship so that is better contrast one is I think we should honor the intensity of the opening commands will get us some time but just to summarize it is Canaanite shrines were all over the scattered all over ya all every Hilltop and it's basically it's a way of marking out a region or a forest or a valley
 territory under the responsibility or owned by or given in the Regent's to that particular deity and so is all over so in contrast when Yahweh reclaims this land that he said a part for his Covenant Partners just like in Genesis chapter 2 you had a region called Ethan but then you had a garden in the eastern part and then it's the center of the garden you had the tree of life and so this is the land of the tribes that then Yahweh will choose the place for his tent to dwell and then in the middle of the tent is named dwells there so we're sticking out a new land that will begin to take on the aspects of the terms of design patterns Renard patterning that's kind of what we're going for here
 so in this we're framing at the other gods who are worshipped by the trees and on the high places are feeling the same slot as the deceptive spiritual being in the garden Hulu through a deception gainza Allegiance and Trust the humans snake so make sure there's no remnants are evidence of any sneaky worship happening in the land so do the snake so that we can replant this land us so I think sympathetically if we read the chapter within the storyline of the Torah that's essentially what it is it's clearing the land of snakes so that you can establish it as the new Ethan with the centralized place of worship for all the tribes can come together as one to be in the presence of God you so that all sounds very nice
 I also don't want to dismiss the fact that I mean they could have gone in and repurpose that stuff and have more carefully disassemble these things it's like the languages like just go to town and obliterate me what's Difficult about this is unit has been moments in our lifetime were there have been Civil Wars I'm thinking specifically over in Syria for example where you have different religious militias that was in a seizure territory seized the town and in a lot of these towns like over in Syria have really amazing ancient Roman ruins or even earlier from like the you know the. Of the ancient Assyrians and some of these religious militias have gone through and gone into museums and they're like shattering ancient Roman
 carvings and statues that are carvings of Zeus or different gods and Salon almost precisely the same mindset as this phrase right here and so you know when I hear about this I think like what does it's like a good artifact of it cuz they are amazing artifacts I mean these are like yeah but don't they like obviously tipped you towards the powers that you should not be dealing with what you're saying what you're exposing their is in my mind I so secularized a militia coming in and the burning down of mosque or yeah I like going into Museum destroying artifacts the same impulse is there of like this is dangerous to just get out here and no settings or just kind of like come on in our sitting right now that is viewed as a part of what's wrong with the world people who behave that way and intuitively
 the modern Western mindset I'm just saying like it's impossible for me not to read the opening of Deuteronomy 12 with those stories in my mind to write because what you don't want this to become is license for someone to then go okay that's what Israel has to do then right so that's what Imma do in my neighborhood exactly and these very versus have inspired later generations of followers of Jesus to do literally these things to the religious structures and property of indigenous people. Where Europeans are Americans or coming in to spaces weather here in the Americas in north or south
 it's a travesty
 okay so let's get into it because the case is this is wisdom literature OK Google home reading this the wisdom underneath of this seems to be that if something is used as an object towards worship of a spiritual being given your allegiance to another power that is so dangerous that the right thing to do is just to wipe out the object completely that's the wisdom that it is to have no place among our land our people now so it's a player that was dumb but all I said was we see that wisdom being applied in future generations and new contacts working squeamish right away and we're going is not the wisdom here
 so what's going on this is a Greggs really wisdom let me just turn up the tension on your Bible you can turn forward and find the section of Paul's letter that we call 1 Corinthians if you're British it doesn't actually say 1st Corinthians it's just the number one with Corinthians don't know and it's not the first letter it's at least the second so anyway in chapter 10 he's needing to address the situation about followers of Jesus how they relate to meat from animals that have been sacrificed in the temples to other Greek and Roman gods down the street from the house churches were and what is fascinating here is the in all of the instruction she gives the one thing he never says is let's form a nighttime group
 angle like tear down this Temple that be the most complete option like we don't have to deal with whether this meat is been sacrificed for Zeus or not you could say like he could have president for that cuz you could say what is Deuteronomy 12 let's just get rid of it so the question is is that a faithful response to Deuteronomy chapter 12 cuz what Paul actually goes on to say is within the community of Jesus followers that meets you know in the house throughout Corinth you have people who are in different places in their journey of following Jesus and having their whole life be given an allegiance to him and so for some people when they eat that meat that was sacrificed their to another God like it's not a big deal to them it's not going to lure them back
 and worship does this but for some people it might it might if they knew that this meat you know that we're having at this meal was given through prayer and dedication and offered up to Zeus it might actually be a real problem for somebody maybe they just stopped worshipping Zeus like 2 weeks ago and so Paul says here's what we should do you should just not bring that meat that Gathering have it at home but like don't put it in front of another person and definitely what he says that the end is in chapter 10 don't go to the Zeus Temple yourself and take part in one of the sacrificial meals there that's what he says any laws from the Torah or anything he quotes from narratives in the Torah about the story of the golden calf and then a story in the Book of Numbers about how the Israelites started having sacrificial meals with the moabites and
 offering sacrifices to their gods and emerges those two together as the wisdom that informs how they should respond in this moment that's the wisdom for like don't go to the Zeus Temple and do the sacrificial ritual yeah right like because yeah basically what he says is in the past God's people brought God's judgment upon themselves by giving their relationship to other gods but this whole idea of let's be respectful that this might trigger some one you know when you're at home eating this to me you know you didn't participate in the ritual but you got the Zeus me and it's good protein yeah you know like go to town it's not going to be like Jesus isn't going to get more powerful and he's not going to get back to you but someone is around and they're going to be influenced to actually then want to go and give their allegiance back to Zeus
 where'd you get that wisdom the wisdom of your brother real quick here to take listen to steps so one is noticed that Paul is saying there should be a zone free of anything that might for somebody in the community lead their conscience astray or their mind us trade to another deity and if the potluck Zone and it's the house church and not even the building just the group of people when you assemble together and have meals together let's keep it out so Paul actually is very concerned that there is a zone free of any trace of something that would say Jesus is King and that is the group The Community of Jesus followers so actually that is certain what Paul is pulling from a Deuteronomy chapter 12
 and remember Deuteronomy 12 the land of Canaan is being reclaimed that's like the garden the Garden of Eden what is the Garden of Eden it's a it's a place we're having dinner there one we're God and his people are one together which is the church and so in the New Testament Jesus comes onto the scene and even will save in the temple but he is the simple reason he'll say the temple is my body or the one greater than the temple is here and that when my followers get together just maybe two or three of them guess what I'm in the middle like the Tree of Life to Jesus said he's the temple and then he calls and the apostles call his body the temple Paul actually said it earlier in this very letter that we are y'all are the temple so in other words Paul takes the land of Canaan and how you relate to the gods of the Canaanites
 as an analogy for the community of Jesus followers and he doesn't see the violence with violence removal of the shrines as being some sort of model or precedent free marching down the street and protesting at the Zeus Temple or we're tearing it down but he might if the house churches were doing Zeus worship you would go in and there would be some like city of like let me get this out of here let's just like burn it that's right and so in another place in the letter where he finds out the guy who says he follows Jesus is sleeping with his dad's second wife for his mother-in-law he says yeah that guy needs to be excluded from the community ideally to induce a sense of guilt and awareness and remorse for what he's done so that there could be restoration of redemption is life so there's a protectiveness
 yeah yeah supposed very protective of the community because he sees the community in the body of the Messiah that is the expression of Eatin eatin expression so that it's a really good example in the Hebrew Bible it tells a story of God at the stage of the story has committed himself to an actual like a nest nosson a people group and the moment God has done that much like God self limits God's Own freedom and authority to rule the world through humans and then commits to what that entails
 so this actually very important because throughout church history very often when followers of Jesus or Jesus communities get in mashed with institutions of state or National Power what often happens is the Bible can start to be appealed to especially the laws of the Torah start to get it you just watch it through history they get appealed to and then applied in these Colonial situation especially in European and American history as if somehow the kind of christianize state or Community is like a new Israel or new Temple Temple and that everybody else who's not a part of our group are like the Canaanites and you can just watch this about church history and treating the Bible that way is failing to read the Bible as a unified story of the Beast of Jesus
 because Paul definitely didn't see the world that way for him the community that is not a new Israel but rather a group of people that got grafted into Israel is that community that is the body of Messiah or an expression of God's his real plan among the Nations and the way that we relate to our neighbors with marching orders from the Messiah is to love your enemy and not tear them down but rather to build an alternate Community the Bears Witness by how we live so this is helpful plan on taking it to your house but I think that's what a faithful Messianic reading an application of Deuteronomy 12 so we're playing like more of the Paradigm book by Paradigm were referring to. I'm serious we did the Seven Pillars what type of literature the Bible is wisdom literature
 communal literature we talked about those two last episode and we're ripping on those right now but then you just brought up a third pillar at the Messianic and where we said that cash out here is the land of Canaan was to become the new Eden which is the temple of God which then Jesus comes and says I am what that was pointing to and the people who follow me and I will lead us to me are now also my body and are the Temple and so to apply the wisdom through Messianic lens okay let's be very protective of anything coming into our communities that's going to give our Legions to other powers which requires a lot of communal discernment discussion learning dialogue openness other points of view
 but yeah it's a lot of intentionality in a way you could say the equivalent of tear down the altars smash the pillars don't act like this towards Yahweh your God is reflected in something like that Romans 12:2 Rapala right to the house churches around and say don't be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so y'all can discern what the will of God is that's good you're perfect so sneaky in the modern world because we don't have any we have maybe what you would call the equivalent to a stripper poles and there are things like that a Ouija board or up for some people to Harry Potter novels or you know we like things we could point to be like that connecting you to switch Powers as dangerous as the other but there is like there's actually potentially even more Sinister things that we just are used to which is
 like it's how we think about money and currency yes which is like it's being conformed to the way that the world Works totally right. Every time I meditate on the early chapters of Acts and you can see the early Jewish Messianic communities living communally sharing all the things selling property donating it to the community I mean not in this was not just like this is an interesting way to try this. Could this was how they express their allegiance to each other and how they obeyed the teachings of Jesus in that context and so that is such a foreign way of thinking about money and possessions and mutual responsibility within the church Community Fair example of many of us there are many Traditions that have tried to preserve the wisdom of that way of life there many of them if not it's a it's a good example of like wow
 how I think about money and my possessions in like my house for example I've been shaped by some other way of thinking about private property no not saying it's completely wrong I'm just saying it's not neutral comes from some other way of thinking about property and maybe it could stand to get challenged a little bit and reshaped as a process renewed and transformed yeah I have a thing about money I always think about family community nationalism that's at the root of his setting is like you've got Roman nationalism that you're trained how to conform to be a Roman nationalist so I could just in the water system for Monday to power to Caesar and how this whole thing works instead of in Jesus's mind that's why it is a misnomer to say Jesus started Christianity
 but he was very clearly trying to sound a renewal movement within a People Israel that was called from its Origins to be a contrast community in the eyes of the nation that gave its allegiance to a different set of values to a different God that lived in a very counterintuitive way and the policies himself carrying that on that's what it's going on here and in Deuteronomy that's what Moses is after here is worship Yahweh the way the Canaanites do but rather we're going to live in a new Eden and organize ourselves in a totally different way than Canaanites would ever imagine
 so you made it through one we had I didn't say this is going to be quick let's let's do let's go forward we might think this is a shift in topics but Deuteronomy 15
 at the end of every seven years you but is that you was plural y'all y'all Israelites she'll Grant a forgiveness of debts or a remission of deaths this is the way you saw grant that permission if that's every creditor has anybody who makes lumps Banks would be a prime example but Banks is a different way of organizing it hero is very personal wealth in the end individuals so everybody who makes alone well release what is lying to his neighbor you shall not exact it from his neighbor from his brother because you always release has been announced this is the Jubilee this is every seven years yeah this is the year of release your release is what's called ya and then after seven of these is the Deauville is the Jubilee soup kitchen
 this on steroids, every seven years that I canceled for 3 from a non just realized you can exact repay me for a long but your hand will release whatever have yours belongs to your brother. This is why examples of we're marking the people group of Israel at the stage of the story is the contrast community and so it's a sibling knows the language of neighbor and sibling really ramped up here so the community of Israelites is to be this contrast Community where we don't do loans the way the nation's do we have this sabbath cycle where it's the Sabbath magnified Sabbath rest remember that's all about the life of Eden which is a life where abundance is what you received as a gift instead of producing it for yourself
 and so live in such a way that you have to force your loan programs to reset up and reset the idea is if you let this process of learning with interest go on forever it will eventually start to create severe disadvantages from which certain people won't ever be able to escape so you do a Eaton reset every 7 years there will be no poor among you because Yahweh will bless you in the land which our God is giving you to possess that is if you listen obediently to the voice of Yahweh you got that I'm commanding you today
 that's a pretty big if so there will be no poor among you this message if you studiously obey all of the laws of the Torah Moses just solved Jesus said the poor will always be in in about two more verses that you will always have a point there will be no poor among you if you were to do this simple thing if you release each other from your debt obligations every seven year no more poverty and remember debt is the flip side of slavery in Israel in and how ancient near East economies worked like so if you have a field this maybe like a family possession and you have like multiple bad years in a row you can't sustain it financially anymore you get a loan yes eventually you forfeit on that loan then
 what you would do is sell yourself for your family members into Hebrew or slavery that slavery and so being in debt and being in slavery are synonyms in the Hebrew Bible cuz they often were literal like both would happen at the same time so we're talking about a Perpetual class over Generations just compounding of people who are just buried in Perpetual debt slavery and so every seven years you have this break in the cycle where everybody gets a fresh Adam and Eve take that the garden and that's the vision hear the Bold economic vision for people group I mean has any Economist unlike any work on trying to imagine what would actually happen of course I'm certain you know sometimes when you ask a question like that on the podcast and then
 how do you say I love you listening you know there's like I don't know a couple of dozen Economist nerds are listening and then you send us. Obviously the concern you would have about doing this aside a level is that no one would then treat their debts sure that's seriously and then no one would want to loan money and then the whole thing will fall apart and I asked you this before like we just never actually done the Jubilee cycle but then I guess this sabbath here as well yeah and they were they were done and this is where I learned a lot from a Jewish scholar Joshua Berman his book created equal have the Bible broke with ancient political thought so good but it's chapter actually on the seven-year release its really and the Jubilee's really interesting because these release years
 were practiced we know in Babylon but they were randomized and particularly as they would be declared when new Kings would come into power so as a political tool of winning favor and also declaring that their rule is like the inauguration of a new era in the kingdom and so what he draws attention to is that what was a political tool in Babylon here is like institutionalized on a stabbing cycle so no King can never know what is the weather like in could ever go out of the release year at the tool but it's always too well as King Sooper pet really give each generation multiple opportunities to be there on Adam and Eve in the garden all you would have to spend you.
 we have to love the people that you give money too because if you know in 7 years if you haven't repaid this I'm on the hook you're doing it because you actually really want to help them in your hoping they'll tell you but you're you are on well being tied up with Eric and if they and their family is trapped in debt slavery for Generations that will negatively affect all of us so this idea here later on this is verse 7 chapter 16 hear the case law continues to says so if there is a poor person with you and your brothers in any of your Town's don't Harden your heart that's language of Farrah don't Harden your heart close your hand you so freely open your hand and generously lend him what he needs
 be careful that there is no destructive or bad thought in your heart sang seventh year the year of release is near and that your eye becomes hostile to your poor brother and you give him nothing then he can cry out to Yahweh and it will be a sin against you so if it's year 5 of the cycle and you see your neighbor and he's like you just had to sell his daughter and that slavery in the ask you for a loan you can say what now it sounds kind of Orphan 2 years still can't do that and that is called sin world
 because I noticed the Echoes of Genesis here this is Cain and Abel that he may cry out against you because this is your brother called in like he's your brother so all the sudden the wealthy Israelite becomes like Cain and the disadvantaged just realize like able and if you neglect him his blood will cry out against you and it will be send not just in way of using the language it is interesting let me ask when it comes to doing Miss Potts this is like an example of doing you know last week which was a way to help the vulnerable and poor to get to a place of my relationship so when it comes to doing that
 I guess it's the classic question who is my neighbor or let me ask my brother yeah because yeah there is familial language here and we just read earlier that the seven-year cycle was only for the Israelites so someone who wasn't one of their kind they were obligated to do it and I've heard it argued that when it comes to doing the hot air only obligated to fellow Christians okay so I guess let's do the parallel move that we did with the lawn Deuteronomy 12 so what are they looking then is among the community of God's covenant people that is to be a contrast Community among the Nations that is it relates to itself in a way that is totally different than the structures of how people outside the community operate I see examples of generosity
 samples of this in the Greeley Messianic communities so I referenced earlier the stores in Acts chapter 2 actually two through six and this is where people are selling fields and donating what they have to come and find and the Apostles of ever seeing it widows are being fed so that's one whole way example and that's a inner Israelite Community it's a sub Israelite Community but of different cultural language backgrounds you've got the Aramaic speaking in the Greek speaking widows and it's not perfect but they're working it out there figuring out ways to make it work so that's an interesting example because you have different cultural language groups but within the Israelite family living together in Jerusalem
 but then a great selection of chapters for meditation on this theme in the letters of Paul is in Paul's was about to say a second letter but sex is fourth letter in 2 Corinthians chapters 8 through 10 where he's talking about his mission to raise money among non-israelite churches around the Mediterranean to collect this big fun that's going to be sent to their impoverished brothers and sisters in Jerusalem who are ethnically so he starts talking about how the church is Macedonia and thought it was a privilege to get even though they're poor just this really cool story she tells like they thought it was a privilege to give out of their property because they really believe that the rich because of God's generosity so then he uses that as a lesson to the Corinthians who have been kind of Stingy and not contributing very much
 and then when he starts appealing to the Torah what he starts appealing to is the story of the Manna in the wilderness and so he says this is a 14 of 2 Corinthians 8 at this present time your abundance can be a supply for other people's needs nearest talk about Israelite followers of Jesus in Jerusalem
 so that at some future time their abundance could become a supply for your need so that there is equality forming principal here. Like at this moment they need what you've got. Then there could be a future time where you need what they've got and then he says just as it's written any quotes from Exodus 16 the one who gathered much too much and the one who gathered little had no luck so policies Israel's provision is coming from God like Manna in the wilderness cuz that one comes from the store clerk in a manner that's right and remember that story was all about the bread of Eden that's the Bread of Heaven that just comes as a gift to you you didn't work for it and so when God gives the gifts of Eden they are given in a way that is both for you and for your neighbor right for others because he doesn't give more to one then to another
 another he gives enough just so that everybody has the whole Community comes together so it's another with Paul's mind is on these themes of God's eating provision so even though it doesn't quote Deuteronomy 15 think what his point he would meditate on Deuteronomy 15 and say if Israel was obedient to the laws they get eaten blessing so that there would be no poor among them and even though that's not the world we live in now we could approximate it we could begin to taste it and so at this time that means you who have more than what you need so people don't
 so that's just within I'm not answering your phone question but I'm saying I think this is how Paul would read these laws and see within the community of Jesus followers which is like Eden we need to reimagine how we think about her stuff yeah before we get to my full question I think it's the Press on this little bit more is Paul talking about just giving out of abundance I've got more than I need why I can think it's because I'm special but God gave it to me and I can share I don't need to be stingy is the principal in dry 15 that we just read which is if someone is in need give it to them and if they can't repay you release them from that. So yeah just going to hand in glove the question becomes what to what end what if it's the fifth time sure you know that your brother
 Ben said man I'm in a hard spot and you like yeah but this is the fifth time and then this was going to happen when I give you this money and then you're going to go and hear me foolish in these ways you were full of just me. I ain't too busy to that I can't have the right this anymore yeah yeah totally yeah it's kind of like the story of Israel and the apostles ask Jesus how many times should I forgive ya ya so once again where are the great the law as stated in Deuteronomy 15 is stating an ideal like a true Norris but of course there's all these others mitigating circumstances or things that will require wisdom and discernment and the law as weird it doesn't address those kind of gives you the core ideal and I think essentially because that is in such a contrast
 the Nations around them and that that's the kind of rhetorical purpose of that paragraph in Deuteronomy 15 but what if you actually start to do that it's going to raise all of these other situations that you're going to need some wisdom and knowledge and discernment to know how to respond cuz you're right there are going to be circumstances that the law as where did never anticipated the so you're going to have to need wisdom for that too and I guess you're going to need to go to some other laws and do some meditation there do you have anything to say about whether this should apply to everyone everywhere or to just allow your community I mean I think
 for the Hebrew Bible we have to remember that the Hebrew Bible was the possession of people group that for almost all of its history with a persecuted or underpowered religious ethnic minority so even within Israel the group of Yahweh loyal Israelites was always the minority and a small persecuted group within this realm so when we get these laws about how the whole nation is to be shaped we're in the language of ideals and hopes not the way Israel actually ever was but it is is pointing a true north till I can eat and ideal and of what God's covenant people could have been like or when you go to the New Testament and then you have the Messianic communities like you know in the early Roman Empire because it was not a democracy there wasn't it
 like some hope that Paul's vision for this offering could become like legislated for the whole reason you know right so it just wasn't on their radar that these values could be translated on a broader scale however when Jesus says all authority in heaven and on Earth belongs to me go to the nation's and make disciples like what he's saying is creation belongs to me and my father and it's a vision of life for all of creation not just for sub-communities we're back to the image of God that the values in the story that shapes followers of Jesus in the Jesus Community is are meant to become guidance and wisdom for how you do your work you know I mean I pray for followers of Jesus so I can mind city government here in Portland and I pray that they would have wisdom to know how to live
 the ethics of Jesus and their roles on City commission you know in the police department but how it relates to them vying for legislation of more specific value is associated with the teachings of Jesus for a broader population those are vitally important questions that are above my paygrade yeah yeah I mean Jesus say love your enemy what does it mean to love your enemy when you read these laws at a very specific about like you know doing Miss pot for the poor among you and you also see these really wonderful bright spots in Christian history where they're the ones out there taking care of the sick when there's a plague or they're starting Hospital you know in like there aren't being like are you in the inside or the outside dude is that is absolutely faithful response and carrying forward the wisdom the wisdom yes
 listen for the nation's yeah the absolutely no way that that is done is the adventure that God's people have with spirit cuz there's no handbook on that there is in a scripture offers wisdom and guidance and I think God's wisdom on how to carry that forward but what it will look like in different times and cultural application I think will really take different forms so I am at we're we're getting into whole fields of important conversation cnxx yeah political Theology and Missy ology that is how Jesus Community begins to Branch into new cultures and translates the life and death of Jesus in the new times and places but and a story that begins with the words in the beginning and tell the story about all humanity and how all humans organize their life in the world
 is a story that naturally is going to have an expansive vision for all of human life in the world and so it's just turns out life's complicated you need to be wise you need wisdom yeah okay so we got there to kind of water laws interesting lawn Deuteronomy ways that Kim seems challenging for us is based on our social location it but then viewing it in light of the biblical story of seeing how Jesus the apostles I could do more of these great let's do another round in the next conversation.
 thanks for listening to this episode of Bible project podcast next week we wrap up the second movement of Deuteronomy taking a closer look at laws around marriage and divorce focusing on how do Jesus read and interpreted these very lost but clearly we're in a different social setting and it's Beatles bothers them to us because it feels like it's reinforcing issues of the gender value differential and letting you know allowing the men in the situation to just do what they want and this woman has to suffer so yeah it was just named that if that's how I feel that too that's right there and every person I've ever walked through in a class setting our conversations with this law has the exact same reaction episode was produced by Cooper Phelps with the associate producer Lyndsay Ponder I did buy Dan dumb ol Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza and a woo provided the end of stations for annotated podcast in our app Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified
