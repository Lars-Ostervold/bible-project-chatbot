we've been talking about sea dragons in the Bible it's a common symbol in the ancient near East to represent chaos and death today we look at the first mention of the sea dragon in the Bible it's on page one of the Bible know that God created the Sea Dragon on day 4 when he feels the Seas with all sorts of creatures and interest fee dragons related to another creature that God creates Monday 5 and that is the Stars in the Sky Dragon and the stars for the others are just two different ways of talking about something they believe is very real for Rochas seadragons and Rogue stars both of these represent Cosmic Powers been on destruction the stars and the sea monsters these are not Rivals of God they're the rivals of creation through the rivals of order these are ways of describing something that actually is really dead
 identify and describe when the Bible wants us to think about hours of disorder it wants us to think about that Sinister creature and so it's no surprise that in the very next story you meet a slithering Sinister creature who wants to drag Adam and Eve into destruction what do we mean when we talk about a creature your tool being the Satan the Devil the accuser it's a creature but that has some sort of real power in agency to drag creation backwards into the nothingness from which God called into being today Tim Mackie and I are talking about the chaos dragon in the literary design of Genesis 1 2 and 3 I'm John Collins and you're listening to Bible project podcast thanks for joining us here we go
 a 10-page on hi hello hey what type of dragons because it happens to be dragons in the right there along with unicorns in the oldest versions of the King James there's a an ancient species of wild ox is referred to in the Hebrew Bible called the am and when the old Greek translators translated the bible translated that but translate it as a model car has the one-horned and then is it is it described as having one horn know it's described as having horns but when early English translator so we're trying to figure out how to translate I am they depended on the Greek translation and so in the early earliest English translation of the word
 unicorn in there but that's different different than what we're talking then we're talking about because it feels like and it almost I got an accident after it happened. It was never of species identification dragons it wasn't like that where it's like someone slipped in and a translation to wear dragons right like and Hebrew panin Leviathan like this is a common sea monster creature this was a very common cultural Troupe of the sea monster and in many many cultures there is a very similar story of a storm God having to fight and destroy the chaos sea creature and it's this way for humans to try to understand why there's so much disorder in the world and released to put a symbolic store
 a line to the constant threat of disorder death danger that happens in a world that is also ordered beautiful and good and the sea monster became a symbol to talk about everything that's scary and terrifying and dangerous about see because of the sea is the chaotic Force that's trying to destroy the land if you're on a coastline that where the Sea comes in crashes up against the rocks yet I feel that and when you go out to the Sea you know you're in another territory like we don't exist out there and so the Sea Dragon sometimes it is the sea but then sometimes is the manifestation of the sea just I didn't say this my last story but these are stories that still captured the modern imagination this is Moby Dick stick King Kong Godzilla
 hunting desert sea creatures with her that one Syfy so anyhow all that to say is the symbols are very much alive today it's not like they're primitive and of the ancient past like the phenomenon of the monster movie Thriller still with us and so we also made a point to talk about we're not interested in the question of where these creatures real or did ancient people or did the biblical authors think the dragons are real interesting question is not what we're talking about but they are true or real in the fact that they meant something real and true they refer to real feelings and experiences that we all have that's the feeling but a reality that there's a awesome and it's coming for us and it'll sneak up on us
 and it brings death and disorder and it is quite an enemy and that's a very real thing yeah yes it is and why is that happening yeah what's going on that's the question that the bill causes want to wrestle with the threat so last episode we explored the ancient near Eastern kind of cultural context of the dragon-slaying we also introduced three dragon taming strategies that the biblical authors use and just real quickly just to summarize them the first one is that the biblical authors will be writing a poem or story and they'll just straight-up use the dragon-slaying storyline but they'll put Yahweh in the place of the storm God
 so what the storm got to do in those other cultures yeah we can do it too and do a better another strategy is what we're going to see here in the opening story of the Bible Genesis 1 which is the scale or the terror of the Sea Dragon Gets downsized minimized and the dragon just becomes a creature of God that plays around in the ocean compared to God it's not a big deal and that's a definite lead like we're trash talking the Sea Dragon that's not the way you tell the story of taking taking a teeth adopting the story and adapting it at the same time
 so let's take a look at how the Dragon Gets introduced in Genesis 1 and also have the literary design for Genesis 1 gives us already sense that what the dragon represents is something much bigger and much more Cosmic than just a sea creature
 here we are with Janice the 7-Day creation narrative again you're welcome and I'm sorry so just to recall the 7-Day creation story that goes from Genesis 1 verse 1 John 2:3 it begins with a prologue the week all verses 1 and 2 that describes both a summary of the whole story in the beginning God created skies in the land opening summary and then you get a depiction of the pre-creation state using the language and imagery that was very common and they should nearest just describing
 anti order the opposite of order which can be depicted as a dark chaotic ocean waters or is it empty and desolate desert and the prologue combines those two images so the land was wild and waste or formulas and void in our English translations but those vets desert Wilderness language and Hebrew and darkness was over the surface of the deep Waters and that's language of a dark open so the foreman for multiple translation and that is a way to refer to the Wilderness an empty Wilderness empty lifeless within us and then there was Darkness over the surface of the deep it is usually translation and that's the word I don't remember a best best and that's about the catwalk yeah this not meaning of pit Abyss meaning to home
 the waters that have no bottom scared of water is a how deep is that going down there yeah oh yeah my kids are terrified of swimming in the ocean really yeah we're working on were there finally got there the rest of the story begins then when you get is a sequence of six days we got working days 123 deal with the unordered and wild chaotic nature of those images and then days 4 through 6 deal with the empty and uninhabited nature so what God is he brings order through forming and that's what first three days are about which happens in three acts of separating and then he steals these grounds with inhabit everyday the bordering three days of feel like that's right okay so
 what happens on the three days of separating is days one through three are bound together they've been bundled together as a really meaningful little literary unit that you're supposed to meditate on just by itself Days 1 to 3 so you will discover to chaos Realms to chaos images disorder images so three days in summary goes God separates light and dark they want that the default beginning stages dark sea pull some light out of the darkness yep that's right so there was Darkness yeah the prologue so God said let there be light and if you read on through the Hebrew Bible you learned that light is God's Own glorious light his own life sustaining the eternal light shining into the darkness. Saw the light was good and God separated between the light in between the darkness
 and this is what this is about but it's interesting to create order you separate that's right that is how we create order of a junk drawer to you and I share an office we've all shared not a suit up our project and you never bring it up and it doesn't seem to bother you but I'm kind of a messy office mate and I remember one day cuz we share this one like I don't know table with drawers and I was fine just having piles of stuff that organized chaos that you just showed up one morning with like a little bundle of like drawer separators like the little internal separate any luck with the pens all together once separated and I know I love opening that drawer and I can it's really easy to find to thank you for doing this to me I am the worst to like stories of my roommates in
 like this is a total of side but when I live with Dave Smith and our room with literally like you could like draw a line down the middle and there was my chaotic side of the room and then his perfectly an idea I did not respect that we're not we're more similar than we are different so creation through separating and ordering stilled how we think of Christian today
 so notice that what God doesn't do is banish the darkness all together or he doesn't permeate it completely with white the darkness is still there you just separate that the darkness was associated with the opposite of creation but it still remains what does it remain forever will not if you be done in the story The Bible because I was there will be no more nights to coming coming a future with there is no Darkness but somehow there is this alternating light and darkness get day too. Separates the waters from the waters so the waters above from the waters below cuz member is just one big mess of water and don't try and imagine that in light of how we think of the cosmos today it won't make any sense the way I imagined swimming in a universe of water what the universe is itself in order reality so what we're imagining here is nothing with our concept of
 is there a concept of empty space floating out into the cold empty that's right I swear there's no hydrogen atoms at all so separating is about overcoming the waters and then creating an in-between space where the order dry land can emerge but we're not to the dry land yet right now we're just separating the waters above look up Blue Sky Waters up there down below last day to day three God addresses the waters below and he says let those Waters be gathered together so that the dry land can emerge up out of the water slide at the dry ground be seen become visible at the where the water's drawback
 and so then you get the dry ground which is called land and then you get the waters that are gathered in the deep pools in theirs are called sees the see the screen order so now you've got a reading what we have to actually come to call the snow globe cuz he have by the end of day three calls no-go because you got the curve sky above and the land Below in the way it's in the waters that surround the land and that are also under the land because the drive-in emerged up out. That's not part of a snow globe you do have Waters under the land that's a good point yeah okay so here's what is interesting and important here noticed that days one
 and three have God separating between order and non order cuz they too is just God's separating Cass water from Cass water the water from water and it's the space in between that has the potential for order but there's no actual ordered element on day to accept God create space for its space so only there is one and three have this binary of order and goodness and non order like a dark was also significant is only on days one and three does God see that something is good so there's no good on day 20 interesting so and what is it called good is the light on day one what is called good on day three is the land up out of the waters
 so the reason a significant as you get this binary of good not good good not good on days only has one and two three there's no not good as good as well if the light is good then that implicitly communicates well what is Darkness then Darkness has good doctors not good pictures of like the logic of the narrative so there's a binary of light and dark and the light is good and good is associated with the stuff to make a J-3 you have the dry land and the waters the Seas and the setup is what's called good so notice the darkness and the waters are the things that were the non creation at the beginning of the dark the best they still remain
 but they have been founded what do you say they're contained they are giving a realm where they belong but God is sticking out around of ordering goodness in the sea of darkness and water is a different than saying that God created a perfect world tour perfect I think we typically mean absence of anything bad right not good yeah right here it's not that it's something different more complex World in which the forces of non creation or antique the opposite of creation still
 our house about to say exist but in this way of imagining them they are non-existence cuz they're the realities that will reduce existence in his back into non-existence so I don't know if this is quite the same way that the dry land in the lights exist but they are there as potential threats to the good
so darkness in the waters and they met and the literary design of days one and three are worded different ways in which they matched as a little three-part bundle what you call like a symmetry so that all of a sudden your mind you're associating the darkness and the water's cuz of the remaining opposite of good except when you turn to the next 3 days 6 4 5 and 6 and you begin reading those as a bundle and close to comparing you will notice something that is just just a bit too interesting to be before matches they won they won got separated like dark day for God fills the realm of the Skies within habitants namely with the Sun the moon and the stars so just noticed something I'm just going to read day for Genesis 114 so God said let there be lights in the Dome of the sky
 to separate the day from the night night. Already separated from night but now he is appointing or delegating the thing that he did take one now he is delegating these lights to do it for him so speak let them be for signs for sacred feasts four days and four years let them be for lights in the Dome of the Skies to give light on the land and it was so cool awesome
 and God made the two great lights the great light to Rule the Day the sun small light to rule the night so he just said I'm going to put these inhabitants here to separate day from night and God made two great lights the great light for the day the small light for the night and you would think we're done right I'm going to make like separate day from night do they aren't the two great lights on your son and then and but you have one little bonus at on the end and also the Stars 2016 reads I know he made God made the two great light great light through the day small light to White
 and also Stars
 yeah that really stands out especially because hey I'm going to about two great lights and yeah like literally here's two things that God made one too and also three that's basically effect and also all of the other stars in the billions and billions start for us well actually bring anybody up there there's a lot more of those little lights that there are of the big lights now you know so you're not the great lights for is about these two lights and also and also so there's a bonus 7 Habits right cuz of the day it's really about the two main ones but then just throw in these other ones they stick out stick out from the West. That away also when do the stars do their business in the darkness right they only come out in the dark
 they five-member they five matches and goes back to day too we got separated the waters above from the waters below now matching that our day 5 and he's going to fill the waters above and below with creatures so God said let the waters swarm a swarm of living creatures and let Flyers Fly Above the land against the face of the Dome of the skies above and then there's 21 and God created us pause for 20 he said I want to make two sets of things here I'm going to make the water swarmers in the waters and I'm going to make the sky flyers in The Wanted the first 21 and God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves with which the water swarms and every bird of wing after its kind
 and God saw that it was good
 so what God said he was going to make we're creatures that swarm in the water creatures the flap above and then one that what God actually does is he makes creatures that swarm in the water creatures that fly in the sky above and the great sea monsters it's a bonus it's another bonus creature
 God says I'm going to make two things and then what he makes us three things
 I'm not saying as clearly as last time okay so I'm going to make water swarmers I'm going to make Sky Flyers life and then he goes to create first thing crates of the sea monster in Monsters water so it's in the waters but then every living creature that moves with which the waters swarmed so those are the water swimmers exactly and then every bird I see you do if you took out Gracie Monster they would actually feel a lot better exactly exactly two things Sky Flyers what are swimmers and then why do swimmers done what's the deal with this inserted sea monster thing that sticks out the God didn't say he was going to make that it does make a sea monster
 and where does he want to do their thing in the waters and bundle them in with just the sea creatures every living creature that feels like it has an identity that's that's supposed to be kind of good let's read it again verse 21 God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves in swarms in the waters of the great sea monsters not one of the one of those why are we singling out the sea monsters this extra third item in the list that God said he was going to make two sets of things and now there's God makes three sets of things and the sea monsters didn't need to be mentioned but some reason they are
 yeah well they just wanted you to know like hey when we see every creature yeah we also mean the sea monsters yeah I'm 23 with two things that we're good the two Realms of order that we get the light and the land the opposite of that was the darkness and the waters
 as we start to meditate on days four five and six what we notice is that there is a bonus inhabitant of each of those two Realms the dark brown and the water around in the darkness around there's the Stars which are called the host on the conclusion of a 6 they are called the host of Heaven the army of had an army of Heaven and the bonus inhabitant of the sea are the Sea Dragon sea monsters so this is not coincidental what you walk away with it is in imagining Gods created really sweet set up here as you finish the story of gardenland humans as God's Own image on the land but being given exalted place to rule over the lands the waters and the creatures of the sky
 but on the perimeter of the good land both above and below in the darkness and in the sea there's some not good for the opposite of good in those opposite of good Realms there aren't have been singled out for our attention if you pay attention then the habitants of the darkness in the waters they are the stars and they are the sea monsters it is no coincidence that is you read on through the rest of the Hebrew Bible the cosmic bad guys are described as either rebellious host of Heaven that is rebellious what we will call him Spiritual Beings but Spiritual Beings are associated with the host of Heaven the stars stars and there's going to be bad guys of the biblical story that have as their will the opposite of God's Goodwill for creation and you can describe them as either the Stars
 Rebel stars or you can describe them as sea monsters and oftentimes both images will be used to describe so it cannot be coincidental that you have the bonus third inhabitant on Thursday at 4 and 5 that are in precisely the tears that make sense well what we're supposed to connect to these two bonus creatures in our mind to what end okay I would n't think of this as significant until I started to notice later in the Hebrew Bible that whenever really bad Tyrant Kings of terrible Empires that Unleashed lots of violence into Israel's history when the prophets and Poets of the Hebrew Bible try to describe what really is at work and then through these Kings and their Empires the most regular images that they drop on our of monsters
 of the desert order of the sea or of stars so do you want to see an example of the Prophet Ezekiel live in Babylon and he's he's a priest so he's literate he's a nerd he's a school nerd and he's also like how do you call it a performance artist oh yeah that's right yeah he dressed in strange ways and did street performances of symbolic actions that's right so busy chapter 28 he senses the word of the Lord coming to him to write a poem about what a tyrant jerk the king of Tyre is tire is an island
 off of like a mile off the coast of what we would call him up by Beirut in Lebanon it's a little I forget north or south of that and it was the shipping part of the Eastern Mediterranean and therefore it was a really wealthy City cuz a lot of money coming in my tire so here's what he says about Tire this is what the Lord God says because your heart is lifted up and you have said I am in Elohim I sit in the seat of the Gods I sit in the heart of the Seas part of the Seas island in the ocean
 but you are human you are not Elohim although you have made your heart like a heart of Elohim he's describing a human who is taking on Divine what do you say Divine responsibilities prerogative as he thinks identity identity yeah so long tirade to say like listen you are really wise and you're a smart trailer and you have made the whole Mediterranean all the wealth of Mediterranean ship industry and everything is being shipped flow right through here yeah good job good job but you are a human not know him then inverse 12 he begins to compare the king of Tyre
 to a Heavenly a spiritual being that was in the Garden of Eden is beautiful spiritual being in the Garden of Eden decorated with jewels namely which don't think fat little babies little babies things are the hybrid creature hybrid creatures yep yeah and I placed you there on the Holy Mountain of God talking about Tunisia. You are the king of Tyre anymore he's comparing the king of Tyre to spiritual the king of Tyre onto a spiritual being that was in the Garden of Eden
 and you were awesome on the day that you were created it was amazing until unrighteousness was found in you
 and then he ships out of the Garden of Eden story back to the king of Tyre by the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence and he goes back to the Garden of Eden story and you send you more later felt morally failed therefore I cast you out as profane from the Mountain of God I have destroyed you or banished you but this is where this is the places he can wear a dance called the Mount of God your heart was lifted up because of your beauty you corrupted your wisdom because of your Splendor so Tara Beane angels are the hosts of heaven and Eden Eden is up on high mountain that is it's in the heavens it's a heaven on Earth type of spot so here you have a rebel human King is being compared to a rebel Angelic figure that was made to be one of the inhabitants of the heaven on Earth spot a pie in the skies
 but became filled with arrogance and wisdom apart from God's wisdom and found themselves banished from the heavens have an owner's Garden
 I was supposed to be thinking about the snake oh yeah but here it's so we may not think of this is happening in heaven but a cherub is a Heavenly being one of the hosts of Heaven and the host of Heaven means the stars in the sky so the king of Tyre is being compared to a rebel Heavenly being is one way of describing them as being one of the stars in the sky that fell from heaven so to speak that's the subtext of the story right here
guess what Lee that's the king of Tyre that's Ezekiel 28 Ezekiel 29 he takes up and write the poem about Pharaoh king of Egypt and God says to kill son of man set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and all of Egypt us says the Lord look I am against you Pharaoh king of Egypt the great Tan in that lies in the midst of his Rivers you have said the Nile it is mine by myself made it so he's depicting him as a great river monster monster and it's actually exactly the word used in Genesis 12 Italian
 but I'm going to put my hook in your jaws make the fish of your Rivers cling to your scales like the serpent I'll bring you up out of the river official cleaned your scales and I'm going to drop you in the wilderness remembered Waters and Wilderness are the two images of non Creation in Genesis one so I'm going to take you out of the waters drop in the wilderness you'll fall in the field and give you this food for the Beast of the earth into the birds of the sky this is key part of the Dragon the dragon slaying met heart of the sea so here now Pharaoh king of Egypt I came down in the south in the Mediterranean is being compared to the other calf monster of Genesis 1 C of two kings Susie Q looks at 1
 he Compares them to a rebel spiritual being one of the stars and the host of heaven and then he looks down south and he Compares pharaoh to the sea monster and they are they're both ways of saying the same thing they're just one is in the skies ones in the waters
 but the one in the skies shines in the dark and then the one in the waters is brought into the Wilderness where does all this come from what kind of imagination does a person have to have to write poetry like this and it could just be a coincidence you know the one Kings compared to spiritual being that shines in the dark and the other one to a water monster but I don't think so I think Ezekiel mine was saturated in the view of the world that comes from Genesis chapter 1 and this is not the only examples as we go through this conversation series these will be consistent the bad guys are either Rebel Stars where the rebel seadragons and they're both ways of talking about the same thing OK Google let make sense I don't know where you want to go but I've got a question so
 evil kings are real yes they are a real thing so Nebuchadnezzar the Pharaoh these were like Global bad guys big problem some my sense of the world that exist now we have this other these two creatures were calling the the tunning sea monster and see and the the host of Heaven in the sky now and my tradition growing up the Angels the host of heaven and think of them as the stars have been taught to think I'm that way but I was taught to think about them and they were real and they are real there is an actual real spiritual reality that exists that can influence and is in Rebellion against God or could be in alignment with God
 but when we talked about the sea monster I kind of wanted to start to put it in a category of like just a complete how we're time of myth and yeah it's like it's true it's speaks to something fundamentally important real but like the Bible doesn't want me to actually believe that there's a creature out there that is shaping my reality in the same way that there isn't a spiritual being out there that I can counter it says like deliver me from the evil one that's right right like I'm picturing like the evil spiritual forces he's not talking about the dragon or sea monster and so I guess I'm just trying to figure out like
 well I guess I'm talking I realize that when Jesus on when Jesus is totally precious two headed snake so I guess those two ideas become merged yeah okay yeah that's one thing is we haven't read the next story catches the Garden of Eden story which is going to take things a step further all I'm trying to do is point out the kind of imagination the biblical authors begin with in which a spiritual being
 there is biblical authors think is real and they want people who believe the story to think that that being is real but they want us to know why they're constantly going to be using the symbols of the stars or of sea dragons to refer to that spiritual being and the reason why is because these were for them in their cultural heritage and context and then also in just the biblical literature itself these are ways of describing something that actually is really difficult precisely identify and describe which is what do we mean when we talk about a creature
 spiritual being the Satan the Devil the accuser that's a creature but that has some sort of real power in agency to drag creation backwards into the nothingness from which God called it into being what are the appropriate ways to talk about that in the biblical authors chose these images of stars that don't do their job the deviate from their job and what the planets really and trying to do something different yeah that's how is Leia thinks about the will get there eventually or the Sea Dragon which is the main one and this is going to be in a video about the dragon but as I was working on the project it became clear to me how the dragon and the stars does Big Lots have just two different ways of talking about something they believe is very real which is a personal force of anti creation is so what a
 King of the earth is kind of an in alignment with the chaos he can be described as being a sea monster he can be described as being a fallen host of Heaven yes creature yeah that's right and a big part of this is Genesis one is not describing the plot conflict yet they're just filling out a picture of the world picture it's the Garden of Eden story where the snake will become very clearly identified with that anti creation Forest that's a good point to notice and I'll conclude with the snow that the darkness and the water's the stars and the sea monsters these are not Rivals of God like they are in the ancient near Eastern versions of the Dragon slang
 there's the dragon really gives the storm got to run for his money through the Stars sea monster are not Gods Rivals they're the rivals of creation there's arrivals of order they're not God's enemy as such they are the enemies of the thing that God wants to make their ways of talking about nothing the opposite of existence and they're going to get applied more specifically to a creature in the Garden of Eden story here they are just the opposite of creation it's a new category that had to create in my imagination that I hope at least become more clear as you keep talking but this section on the run the other day and somehow they became really important for me to say out loud to myself
 cuz there are views of reality like where there's the good and there's evil and their rival to each other and history is just the constant cycling battle. Yeah that's right that's not how the biblical authors that's not how Jesus. Reality
 rather God wants to bring something good into existence in partnership with that thing itself creation but to bring something into being means that its existence is dependent contingent cuz it comes from nothing and it could go back to nothing again and so that nothingness that death and disorder a chaos is what these symbols are trying to describe until take on more meeting but that's their core stuck or meeting okay well there's a lot there so we'll wait through that more we will do ya this will be once we get into the stories and poems and get cycling from eating forward will just basically talked about this with different stories giving us examples to talk about these ideas the only image I have in my head is The Neverending Story did you watch that it wasn't there and it's been such a long time
 basically he's the bad guy is like nothing this coming till like the create it's not like a creature or anything it's just it's just chaos coming and I forget what they call it but yeah it's called the nothing there you go it's a power which destroys fantastica and you noticed if I remember in The Neverending Story doesn't have to have walked by two big Caribbean yes that are the way these symbols work in the story The Bible anyway yeah the Garden of Eden story will give us a lot more clarity or I think if these ideas feel strange and unfamiliar
 to be continued is the moral of the Bible project podcast next week we're talking about how humans can actually become a sea dragon you yourself can be the snake based on voices that you listen to so this is why it's you go on throughout the rest of the tour of the prophets the rest of the Hebrew Bible when you see bad people compared to snakes and scorpions and dragons and lions this is what's underneath all of that imagery brought to you by our podcast team producer Cooper pelts associate producer Lyndsay Ponder lead editor Dan Gumball editors Tyler Bailey and Frank Garza Tyler Bailey mixed this episode and Hannah Liu provided the annotations for annotated podcast in our app all the music for this series was written by Bible project staff Bible project is a crowdfunded nonprofit and we exist to experience the Bible as a unified story that
