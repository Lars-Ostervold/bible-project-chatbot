is John a Bible project and today we are going to continue our conversation on the family of God I've been a theme in the Bible in the next two episodes were going to look at the Apostle Paul and what he has to say about the family that God is creating Paul saw himself as an apostle to the Gentiles the non-jews the Nations and he planted many of the early first Jesus community and he wanted them to live and unity even though they come from so many different backgrounds what's a day we're going to look at Paul's letter to the Romans the letter to the Romans is Paul's longest letter in the New Testament and it isn't a letter of Paul Just Waxing theological about God's salvation Paul wrote this letter for a specific purpose to Champion a vision that he had for the Jesus communities in Rome and so Paul really his dream is for a unified multi-ethnic family of God and that's what all this theology
 he packs into chapters 1 through 11 of the letters about the why was the church fractured in room what happened was the Roman government expelled all the Jews and that included Jewish Christians later Jews were able to come back to him and so these Jewish Christians came back to the church communities what they found was that the church there had moved on and saw themselves as Superior the Jews didn't have any status in these trick communities anymore and there was conflicts about how to reintegrate and so just imagine the dynamic at work in these churches Paul talks about two groups of people these two groups of people that are at odds in the church and he doesn't use ethnic designation for it and so what are you does he has two words to refer to people who want to observe the Jewish calendar eat kosher and apparently are still very attached to and want to continue to pray
 circumcision and what he says about them he calls them those without power often translated as the week that's not what the word that means someone without status people in opposition to those who are not powerful is the same Greek word but reversed those with power so what he says in Romans 15:1 is we who are powerful ought to bear with the weaknesses of those without power until all of Paul's theology in the book of room it's all building a case for certain type of unity and so in the early chapters of the letter but he's trying to show is that all along God's purpose has been to build one family of Abraham out of all the nations So today we're going to look at how the Apostle Paul wants the early church to deal with cultural conflicts as they arrive in the early Jesus communities thanks for joining us.
 all right Tim here we are here we are we are talking about family we are trying to land the plane play up two more episodes left Bank since I have any questions you asked. So this theme of the family of God let me try a really quick recap the story the Bible is about God creating Humanity to be as partners His Image and in order to do that we need to be unified and it's because while I singularly represent the image of God in some way the reality is much more rich in that all Humanity together create the image of God and we get a taste of that in the in this poem in Genesis one where the image of God has both male and female not one of the other applies to the larger species of humanity
 dumb a dog is made in the image of God but atom consists of a diversity of creatures male and female so it's if they both individually but together in their unified state are the image of God together and both of those aspects of the image of God really important this Unity is corrupted almost immediately as male and female can't trust each other blame each other the first casualty noted in the Garden of Eden narrative even before the Rapture and their relationship with God is mentioned the first thing is that they hide from their bodies from each other but Unity is lost to the family is broken family the Human family is broken in half the other thing about being the image of God is to multiply and subdue the Earth and so as Humanity
 guys has babies those babies have babies that is going to eventually become tribes and groups of tribes become Nations and so you get this picture of if everyone is the image of God together collectively there needs to be a Unity among them all the diversity that's going to come about through multiplication or what was true of male and female as both distinct and yet one human image of God together in Jenison Genesis one that's true for those to the logic of the narrative is the call is also true for all of their descendents who we are all very different from each other but the same ideal still holds that they are together one image of God creating this ideal of unity for the whole Human family is there a deal that's presented in the Bible but the story actually goes on to show that every generation just
 10 uses Brokenness and the fracturing the Rivalry and rupture of relationship between brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers and husbands and wives it's like one of the main things going on in the specially the Book of Genesis in the Book of Genesis especially these first few chapters are really interested in what brothers has become what nations and it creates this map of basically here is all the nations and all the tribes and we were once all Brothers but now you're going to as you get in a narrative these are all going to become enemies yeah Heather generation just tractor is even more that's right however there is one or early attempt at the Human family to reunify itself but not around being a jog not around being the image of God it's rather to exalt the name of one particular City and one particular place in the
 Babylon is Babylon and God says you know humans are pretty amazing creatures and if I let them kind of continue on this path of unity it's going to be a mess this is what they have begun to do nothing will be inaccessible for them it's a got scatter them and then out of the scattering of the nation's God chooses one family and this is where we start talking about the idea of election electing one family not because that family is better than any other family not to create more sibling rivalry of sorts right but because God wants to use that family as an instrument to bring the Eden blessing back to the rest of the world which follows with the logic of having a human image of God be the bearer of God's image and presents back on page one that's what you humans were to be to all creation
 now he's choosing one particular family to be to the rest of humanity is going to become the nation of Israel the calling of this family that begins with Abraham and we actually see that Abraham's family book Justice is what four generations of Abraham's family and there's constant rivalries even within his family correct between siblings and then this family becomes a nation they become slaves in Egypt and this is where the book of Exodus begins God rescues them and then calls them to a covenant partnership again as this family to be his representatives to the rest of the nation's the kingdom of priests and I think where I started getting kind of tripped up is this theme of then if this is at the DNA of the steam which is now go and bring unity all the siblings
 stations that doesn't seem to be the story that unfolds us with our fold is go wipe out these other nations out of the land of Israel understand well sure I guess one one way to say is they are to be this model family and so the laws of the Torah now that humans are outside of Eden and living in the midst of severely broken fractured families the laws of the Torah like a triage to create a unified Federation of tribal family Manifesto trying to make the best of a bad situation namely The Human Condition within this route so they are to become this Beacon the Priestly Beacon of what could be once it's magnified out to include all the other nations but they issue you just raised was about how in the notice of Joshua when God calls his people back to the land promised to Abraham
 those are their siblings yeah there's a bunch of descendants from other way of ham there as specifically through hams grandson grandson yeah that's right so essentially it's rude design patterns what the narrator of Deuteronomy and Joshua are trying to show us is that the Canaanites who were in the land when the Israelites show up or another iteration of the generation of the flood who is corrupting the land through violence and bloodshed so it needs to be another flood of sorts and that's why all the language of the battle commissioning sin Deuteronomy and Joshua use the language of the flood story there to go in and cut off Flash from the land to bring an end to they didn't leave any living or breathing thing all of these phrases in the Book of Joshua come from the flood narrative and so I'm just saying on the narrative logic presenting that part of the fan
 the Human family as being beyond the point of return so just because portrayed on Knology to the generation of the flood so I personally resonate with all of the tensions did the Canaanite Conquest raises messing up personally but I'm also trying to put my issues aside and just hear what the authors are trying to communicate communicate yes these are brothers but like the generation of humans that became so violent that they were wiped out with a flood there's a sense of day of this has gone too far they need to go over to The Logical outcome of their choices and we just got done talking about all of that previous turn on ringer oh God yeah but another piece is that the Israelites are going to go into the land and then become just like the Canaanites that they fought against all of a sudden the Israelites
 become like the generation of the flood in Babylon be wiped down Babylon becomes the new flood that comes in to do you take them out to the point is we're coming we're working other biblical themes right now so I brought that up just to say that feels like a hiccup in the Apple Family theme your kind of like I'm ready for a cool let's all get along now it said we're not getting along more conflict and in fact Israel is not acting like God's image representing with a family of God looks like and Babylon comes and takes them out but then we talked about Isaiah still hoping for this time and all nations will stream up the new Eden and will learn about the way of God and and there will be this this unity and I love that image and and fast forward I think we'll talk about this later but that same image appears in Revelation where all the kings yeah yeah them together and then just like everyone's diversity comes in a unified way was really beautiful and recall very brief
 but the book of Isaiah culminates in the last 15 or so chapters by also staying on top of that high New Jerusalem new Eden God's going to exalt servant somebody called the servant and everybody will rally to that servant and then that servant turns out to be the one who is in his exalted Place suffering and dying for all of the violence and evil done by all of these sibling rifles who are not returning so to speak back to the mountain so it's a pretty epic picture of the reconciliation of the nation's happens because of the death and the exaltation of the suffering servant the table book resume Works which leads us right into Jesus and then the gospel of Matthew Jesus is shown to a genealogy to be in the family of Abraham even more specifically the family of David where this this servant is this Messiah King will come from
 and lo and behold all these Canaanite women in his genealogy we looked at that there's this strange diversity in his own genealogy we also looked at how Jesus just thought about family it was kind of that intense scene where his his flesh-and-blood you know his can come and they want to hang out with and talk to him and Jesus is like you know my real family and so he seems really interested in not just being about family that you was born into but a bigger family and however we also looked at how Jesus Focus was clearly on Israel correct that he saw himself as coming to to serve and Tina Sevilla
 the mission of the calling of Abraham's family in the first place he goes out of his way to make sure that he stays focused on his real correct and we looked at that avoids for the most part being around on this realize but Matthew's gospel that we looked at includes all these stories where none is four lights just keep coming to him even though Jesus has this laser focus on Israel all these other people from other nations get in the mix just kind of like how all these women from other nations get in the mix of his genealogy that's right there's just this magnetism is suggest keeping the drum beat in the background saying remember even though this is all about his real a story that's all about his real is that the same time a story about all Humanity cuz it's all about Israel so that they can bless all of humanity logic that's the logic of election biblical election is about one being chosen for
 on behalf of the many so after his resurrection the keys put an end of sorts to this intense focus on just the family of Israel cuz any commissions his disciples to go out to the rest of Israel but then also to Samaria and then to the ends of the Earth so he has shown is what it is to be a faithful Covenant partner have to be the to be the family of God and now any more specifically he was that that Faithful Is realized who in his own person embody the family they Abraham surrendering himself fully to God and God's purposes so that the mission to the nation's can finally take its next step and it does and there's a cool moment we're all of these Jewish people are together who are deciding we're going to we're going to
 follow Jesus and his vision for Israel to be the true Israel the true family of God to be blessing of the Nations and then God's spirit comes down and they start talking and all these different languages and this is the moment we're Jewish people from all over the world and come back to Jerusalem on pilgrimage right cuz it's going to cost correct so they're coming to do white like a ritual sacrifices and stuff and they're all their people speak different language group of Jesus Jesus followers are all the sudden speaking in all their language and it's kind of the reversal of Babylon and its this moment where the family just breaking out even if it's growing even larger and multiplies and then a Roman Centurion and non-jewish man who follows Yahweh
 yeah he has a vision and he meets Peter one of Jesus's apostles and Peter has a vision that this is the kind of crazy Vision where a tarp comes down all these unclean animals in our on it are part of the Covenant requirements of Israel that set them apart from the other nations yeah which by the way is a bit of a kind of this strange thing where it's like you are to bring Unity to all the nations but there's going to be parts of my Covenant law that actually keep you separated very cleanly separated totally ditched and talk a little bit more about that back but maybe I should fail but anyways because if if non-jewish people like this Roman Centurion are going to be folded into the family then do they need to follow all of these these Covenant laws that kept is real separate and show that they were the family of
 because some of these are going to require pretty big lift to change your life circumcision for example for example at least fifty percent of whatever for the men in the butt your butt your diet Sabbath Sabbath in the big-3 but here's the thing if you're going to make a radical decision to follow the god of the universe and be part of his family to make some adjustments these things too and there's precedent in the scriptures of Israel that circumcision was how members of the non chosen for 3 lines were brought into the family of Abraham and Ishmael is the fifth kind of a gram of that in Genesis 17 so this is how God has already provided four people who aren't of the chosen family to be become part of it
 makes good sense it makes good sense but instead Peter has a vision where God shows him all these unclean animals and he says Peter kill and eat and will you point it out was Peter didn't change his diet yes that's right this isn't God setting aside the kosher food laws for Christians so to speak that's not what Peter's vision is about vision isn't like hate Jewish people Wednesday for Christians you need to do that yeah you still have this Heritage and it's an analogy it's a metaphor for the inclusion of Gentiles into the family of God cuz they were considered unclean animals were considered unclean you wouldn't dare eat these animals Peter Wright in the same way you wouldn't eat with a gentile yeah well this is all changing and and so this Roman Centurion gets part of the family and the Holy Spirit comes and does a Pentecost type of move
 appearance that with all these non Israelites so here's the problem now what is this Jewish Messianic thing supposed to do with the fact that non-jewish people are getting folded in Cornelius just got included in the family and none of his household were circumsized and none of me kosher evidently doing it that's the conundrum a powwow in Jerusalem all the leaders and what they decide is that the spirit is telling them that non-jewish followers of Jesus do not need to get circumcised and don't need to follow all the rules they do say at this moment don't eat animals with Bloods still in them that's a kosher thing like flick still not to do that but otherwise and don't have meat that's like slaughtered or butchered in idle temples
 attention to the logic of their discussions is Acts chapter 15 verse from the last episode of the series but their logic is they see what the Holy Spirit has done so experience then they go to their Bibles and what they see James notices a passage in the profits that strikes him in a new way in light of the things that the holy spirit is doing and he see is like oh wow yes the whole point is been for someone from the line of David to come in to rebuild a house that all of humanity will come and seek the Lord all the nations and James says it's happening and so who are we to argue with the Holy Spirit that's so it's not experienced this. They go back and they can see the significance of significance of the passages they've been reading for the whole lives and then they put it all together and what what they say in the letter at the end of this the second we did draw attention this in the last episode the conclusion is the apostles with the unified voice
 it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us delay no further burden on the Gentiles than these Essentials and that's the things no food sacrificed to Idols the things with the blood and have sex with somebody you're not married to but that little phrase it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and the US what they're referring to is the big like debate and argument they just had the US yeah they heard stories about what God was doing they open their Bibles at a Bible study then they had a healthy discussion they come to a conclusion together and how we summarizes all that is it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us it's always struck me that they see the spirit working in the middle of all the storytelling if I was by the Holy Spirit of the Apostles you brought that up years ago when we did the Holy Spirit
 Israelites to do it when you get into the letters of Paul you see all those call doesn't even honor these things he thinks it's fine to eat food that's been sacrificed and I'll take a look at Beck's depicts the leaders of the Jesus movement as growing in their awareness of God's purposes for all the nations there's so many cultural hurdles that it's taken him a while to clue in to this and this is a really important moment because this is where the family of God it's crossed the boundary line that it's that has existed went from Babylon down to just one family right now from the one family Abraham and we're going out or come back out and there's been little was Ben movements in that direction along the way but this is like here we got that thing that God said Abraham you're going to bless the nation like the fruit is now
 budding and so it's game on like at the book of Acts is all these Gentile Roman citizens and all sorts of other people being folded into the family now you have this really diverse family I'll follow Jesus this Jewish man who has fulfilled the calling of the Israelite people to be the Covenant partners of God to bring the blessing to the nation and here we are how are all these people now going to be the family of God yeah so one thing we could do is just go throughout the Book of Acts and we actually have already done that in the series the videos and in the hole podcast Series. So that's back in the archive walkthrough and we're really struck me about all those conversations with how obsessed Paul was with the unity yes yes good okay so let's go right there
the Apostle Paul also known by his Hebrew name shower stall he is highlighted in the book of Acts as being an important to a spearhead figure of the Jesus movement an apostle to the Gentiles what I want to do for the rest of this conversation and then maybe the next one will see is just camp out on the way Paul begins to reflect its theology eyes do biblical Theology of his Bible which we call the Hebrew and Greek scriptures about also then in light of the story of Jesus and the coming of the spirit and he begins to put all this together in the Theology of the family of God that the really we're going to look at a number of his letters to do that but then also we get to watch him apply and think and do biblical theology applied to very specific culture clashes and ethnic tensions in
 the family of Jesus and so does the wisdom here for the family of God through all of all times and all places cuz what this tells us is that there's a movement or how we started this conversation the Jesus movement is the most ethnically diverse religious movement in the history of the human race and that's baked in why is that they kicked in the ass at the core of the story but it's wrapping its arms around the whole Human family but that creates problems and challenges cuz when people who are different try to live in a family but even people who are really similar in order to be the image of God we need everyone's differences but dealing with differences. Conflict so what are the conflict resolution tools and resources built into the story of Jesus that uniquely
 should and Siri give this family the ability to work through those conflicts not that it has throughout history in fact just the opposite but that's family so Alice first public profile Paul's view of his own vocation and calling
so there are three times that the story of Paul's commissioning and meeting of Jesus told and retold in the book of Acts and so this is just a quick highlight here it happens in Acts chapter 9 but what Jesus says to a guy named and the nyhus who supposed to go to Paul who's sitting in a house and you can't see anymore cuz he's been blinded but Paul is going to learn there that he is God's chosen instrument to proclaim the name of Jesus to the Nations and their kings and to the people of Israel attacked 9:15 so it's right there in the story from his first calling he's the one who dissent among the Nations and their kings in this is how Paul talks about himself later on in the book of Acts so it's no surprise then when you turn those letters he's really self aware of this unique calling here among the nation's so let's just look at the first paragraph opening
 graph of this letter to the churches in rum it's a super-dense little palm but it has a really poignant kind of way of putting out all saw himself opening lines with letter to the Romans a bond servant or slave of Messiah Jesus called as an apostle just a Greek word for a sent one commissioned one I like the word Deputy both right at word Emissary maybe I'm sorry set apart for the the good news that's from God now that good news was promised before hand through the prophets in the scriptures to read the Hebrew Bible gospel gospel what you learned from the Hebrew Bible is about God's son he was born a descendant of David according to the splash he was declared to be the Son of God with power by his resurrection from the dead according to the holy spirit this is none other than Jesus the Messiah our Lord
 not through Jesus Is Our Lord we have received and we just passed talking about his crew is missionary crew or the lack of Timothy all the screw we have received a gift that you often see grace and you English translations but we received the gift we were talking about this unique special gift that has been given to him this crew we've been given a gift and a commission as deputies apostleship to bring about The Obedience of Faith from among all the nations that will be into faith is a great Semitic kind of Hebrew turn of phrase written in Greek butt face here meaning loyalty or faithfulness and then obedience meaning Allegiance so believing or trusting loyalty to Jesus
 the Messiah the king of the nation's so grateful loyalty loyalty loyalty for his namesake and then last thing he says is and you Romans you also are among that group that are called by Jesus slides to so we're on the same team and he said in the ground here cuz it was about to say I can't wait to come visit you all so you can help me raise money for a missionary effort to spend so he's very strategically opening with this announcement of the good news about the universal Messiah King of the Nations and then I want to come visit you cuz me and my crew have the special calling to announce to the Nations that Jesus can help people give their loyalty to him
 faithful Allegiance from among the Nations nations were sitting here two thousand years after we wrote this and obviously the story about Jesus has spread all over the planet now so just try and imagine you know those really decades when this was still just a network of you know a few groups of thousands of people scattered about the Roman Empire I mean this just would have sounded Ludacris see anybody outside looking in it would just sound crazy is that because it isn't normal for someone to try to bring Unity among so many different types of people at the Roman Empire was doing all these different the Pax Romana that the Peace of Rome spread the good news about the piece of Realm that is led by the August Divine Emperor you know the son of the Son of God for this all language used in Roman property
 and that people noses for a long time and it's Echo the the biblical language that they're using about Jesus's the same political language being used by the Romans for what kind of family were going to build the Pax Romana which wink-wink is going to be another Babylon there is another and whose leaders bring good news when a new one is born so wouldn't be weird for someone who got a hold of this letter that he's trying to bring Unity amongst all these people that would be that it's a group of people who are giving their allegiance to somebody who's dead but who they say is a lie for it or you and present among them all. It's a Jewish sect that calls themselves away and they believe that their dead leader who they say is alive but nobody is seeing since around the time he died but he's the king of the world and that everybody
 including Caesar should give their allegiance to this person that's what I meant all the nations are being united together as one family thanks a lot again if you get to get yourself outside as think outside looking in this sounds so bizarre and it was bizarre but it was also really attractive because of how the story called these new family members to call Diamond Street each other so here maybe just to recall in our how to read the New Testament letters conversation we actually did a long couple sessions in Romans so I just noticed that I'm Paul was writing this letter to bring Ashley to bring Unity to a set of fractured house churches in Rome and so in the early chapters of the letter but he's trying to show is that all along God's purpose has been to build one family of Abraham out of all the nations and that issue of circumcision it was a big deal and acts this is the front line issue
 kind of on the ground for Paul cuz in room there's Jewish Jesus followers and then there's no if I remember correctly certain Jewish people were expelled from the city correct and then came back and now it's like how are they going to find Unity service even more charge than normal so we just read from the first paragraph of the letter to understand why he's writing this letter a really easy thing to do is turn to the last page of the letter that's what do that real quick cuz the reason he's writing this letter is because of cultural ethnic tensions in this church that he wants to try and help find a way forward to resolve so that means turn into Romans chapter 16
 Romans chapter 16 is maybe the chapter of the letter to the Romans that most people like they've lost energy is energy that's probably true it's actually a super important chapter 16 16 it's the chapter that has the most number of the greatest number of greetings of any new testament letter. Where Paul is telling certain people like a say hi to someone so say hi to happen at us say hi to Uncle Otis and Herb on us and so on so what does your does other than just a list of greetings it's actually very strategic and Paul's goal to unify these churches and what's collars have been able to do is actually notice all kinds of things in this list that would have never stuck out to me so freaking Apple if you look at this 24 verses in Romans 16 he greets I forget the total number of people that he greets
 almost 2,000 I think he lives for a number of them black hills say of Aquila and Priscilla sees me he always puts her name first Priscilla and Aquila he says in verse 3 say hi to them and also greet the ekklesia the community to gather Community or church that is in their house that's one of the house churches and greeting all these people and he mentions and also said that this person and those of their house and this person that was at their house is that mean they're their family and their servants and such or is that mean the church that meets in the house seems to mean the people who Gather in their house so it seems like you can he mentions altogether about 45 houses and so if you do somewhere between 4 to 6 house churches is there can fit about 20 to 30 people in these atriums of ancient Roman houses we use of DNA is writing the letter to a couple hundred people
 engines one two three four or sometimes you just to say hi to fill the longest Julia and those with them and the whole crew there crew Scholars have paid attention to the origins of the names yeah I was wondering if you could trace the origins of the end so there's a lot of Jewish names Ameri Maryam Aquila Rufus herodian for Ermac number Rufio from Hook no man probably the old that Robin Williams hook your Lost Boys when Peter Pan was gone and then there's lots and lots of Greek names Olympus
 we've got a bunch of juice I got a bunch of Romans and we have bunch of Greeks cool chapter 16 is that there are some in their midst who are the Super 17 and following he says watch out for those who cause dissension or Division and cause hindrances literally obstacles that are against the teaching that you all have learned just turn away from those people these people are slaves not our Lord the Messiah but of their own appetites but man they have smooth flattering speech it really persuasive and they will deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting so there's people that are trying to divide persuasive people trying to divide these groups and again this isn't sixteen and you already know what the divisions are you read all about them in chapters
 14 and 15 lizard people who are trying to exploit the same issue at work in the book of Acts the dynamic created by non Israelites trying to live together with juice in a common family except now the tables are turned you know the book of Acts it was Israelites in place of authority try and figure out how to integrate Israelites what's happened in Rome is the opposite of summarizing things from previous conversation so you remember this that the Jews had been exiled from Rum by ever Claudius and that happened in at the 49er and a whole bunch of background there just refer back to that earlier series but after somewhere between five to ten years Jews were allowed to return back just try to imagine that you're escorted by Roman guards you're giving like noticed a day in the pack up your stuff just a mansion
 happy birthday of us of course this was a big part of what happened in the Holocaust the events leading up to the Holocaust A government rounding up one ethnic group and so this obviously puts people of that ethnic group in a very vulnerable place you're obviously on a very low rung of the social ladder cuz they're now Outkast and and so somewhere between five to ten years later people to pay the day it's here Jews are allowed to be turned around and so just imagine the dynamic at work in these churches here in fact we made a video about this and so Paul talks about this family in the letter this is in chapters 14 and 15 and I just want to recall Paul talks about two groups of people these two groups of people that are at odds in the church and he doesn't use ethnic designations for it
 interesting and so what are you does he has two words to refer to people who want to observe the Jewish calendar eat kosher and apparently are still very attached to and want to continue the practice of circumcision and what he says about them he calls them by two words he either calls them those without power in Romans 15 verse 1 he calls them those without power often translated as the week that's not what the word means it means someone without staff okay and the group of the people in opposition to those who are not powerful is the same Greek word but reversed those with power so what he says in Romans 15:1 is those we who are powerful ought to bear with the weaknesses of those without power the other words that he uses he describes those who are weak in faith week being a different world than the powerful
 yes okay yeah and then those who have faith and essentially Paul's of the conviction that the Holy Spirit has made it clear back at the Jerusalem Council that following the kosher food laws for non Gentiles that's not required now there might be there might be Messianic Jews who want to do that that's their way of honoring Jesus and there might even be some. I just realized that's what they wanted the remaining who did but no longer a requirement for 2 and make it a requirement is to be weak of Faith correct that's right it's to not trust Paul showing his cards here here but it's not trusting the Jesus fulfilled of the commands of the Torah I'll just let you read the paragraph. This is in Romans 14 in the name is the dynamic now except the one who is weak in faith but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions one person has faith that he may eat all things but he was weak eats vegetables only cuz it's a
 I think cracked the one who eats anyting yeah the one who doesn't eat kosher non-kosher person is not to regard with contempt the one that does not eat kosher and the one who does not eat kosher is not the offer judgment to the one who eats it for God has accepted him who are you to judge the servant of another to his own Master he stands or Falls and he will stand for the Lord is able to make him stand one person regards one day above another another regard every day like in this is speaking to Holy Days festival correct another Jewish thing that sets you apart each person must be fully convinced in his mind what's this servant Master stuff what he's telling those with power and those who don't eat kosher what he notices that they are treating with
 tempt yeah those without power and those who do eat kosher only like two problems one problem is those with power that the Gentiles the non-jewish people got to stick around so these marginalized Jewish people come back in they don't have any power they want to keep kosher cuz that's what they do the Jewish even if they follow Jesus and some non Israelites and so then you got these people who have the power status going you idiots and the treating them with contempt for continued kosher which Paul thinks is a problem but then he says Those Who choose to eat kosher are condemning and judging the people who don't eat culture it's not just the One Direction for a while here both groups are being mean to each other both the birth point fingers yeah
 they both have their reasons and so watch it cuz first of all who are you to judge the servant of another Master follow the same Master exactly so basically his point is Jesus except the one who eats kosher Jesus accepts the 12 dozen each kosher who are you to offer judgment on another follower of Jesus on this kind of issue okay he stands or Falls before Jesus regardless of what you think of him he should just said that a lot easier and then he Dad's this whole thing as well he will be able to stand not because he'll do it under his own power it's because Jesus died for him and the Lord will make him able to stay a little sidetracked cuz that's one thing these groups are being mean to each other so one way to think as I get it what Paul wants them is that have Unity so we're going to have a Reconciliation ceremony here
 where they treat each other as equals and that's actually not how he sees the dynamic going here to go back up to Romans 15 look what he says here he says now we who have power he says we are obligated what did he say we cuz he's not he's Jewish but he includes himself that's why I said this isn't purely and ethnic categories are there could be Jews who have decided not to eat but I think it's probably the majority like he was flexible as he says the 1st Corinthians 9 I became all things all things to all people but look at the dynamic here when there's a cultural divide first of all stop judging each other and treating each other with contempt Step 1 Step 2 how do you actually achieve some sort of equality or unit in and look at the dynamic and Romans 15
 he says we who are the ones with power we are obligated to carry the weaknesses of those without power and not just do what's easy for ourselves therefore welcome one another just as the Messiah welcomed you powerful or obligated to carry the non powerful just like the Messiah welcomed you all into the family of God it was this was Scot McKnight reading Romans backwards when it's out do you see there's there's a power differential a social status differential and Paul is saying it's not hey now everyone just let's find some new quality everyone put the chips in and make this happen he's saying those of you who have status and power it's up to you to make the equality those of you
 Which social privilege you have an obligation to accommodate and go that extra mile make that extra effort to come under those without social status to make sure that the family of God is a place where they are treated as equals I just wants that became clear to me it just hit me square and the analogy is just as Jesus your who is definitely a hired himself became a slave died on the cross right just as he lowered himself to welcome me so I might be people listening to this conversation and I know I go now Tim and John are getting political and religious like this this is about listening to the Bible smack a little bit of and I don't know much about this oh what a critical theory a critical race Theory and stuff where it's
 his power struggles power differentials and the way to find Liberation for all people as for the is to fix this power structures any specific kind of philosophical theory of race relations right thing this this is Paul thinking through how different ethnic groups learned how to live together as a single-family Sia using the story of Jesus as the model ethic or how we get along well it smacks of his teachings yeah it's serving the week yes tell him first will be last message absolutely so yeah so Paul and visions that these Romans who feel quite comfy in Rome and almost certainly you know what we learned in the list of names in chapter 16 is that these houses house churches are divided along ethnic lines and so Paul really his dream is for a unified multi-ethnic
 family of God and that's what all the theology he packs into chapters 1 through 11 of the letters about actually here let's go back now to chapter 4 and I just have exerted a wine here is some sections through chapter 4 and you'll see how Siri tells the biblical story trying to compel these people to start treating each other's family
 as Roma chapter 4 starting verse 9 Paul says for we have been saying that Faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness whole big theme in the letter he's quoting from Genesis chapter 15 when he was reckoned as righteous before God or uncircumcised Paul asks rhetorically the sign of circumcision a seal or a symbol of that righteousness of the face that he had while he was uncircumcised and then Paul thinks that significant that he was reckoned as being one who walks with God righteous and blameless in his eyes just like Noah while he was uncircumcised and that it was simply his trust and got the promise
 so he was in right standing with God and Paul thinks it's significant and he thinks the point of that is to show that he would be the father of anyone who believes without yet being circumcised that righteousness might also be be reckoned to them now he is the father of all those who are circumcised but not only of those who are of the circumcision the also anybody who follows in the steps of the Faith of Our Father Abraham not Faith remember he had when he was uncircumcised for the promise to Abraham and his Descendants the day would be the inheritors of the world that was not given through the law that is through circumcision but through the righteousness that comes by faith so that Denver 16 the promise would be guaranteed to all of Abraham's descendants not just those who were part of the the law the Covenant with Moses but all who are of the faith of Abraham who
 is the father of us all it's just like it got said Genesis 17 he quotes I have made you a father of many nations so this argument of justification by faith for Paul is a theological resource for how to achieve unity in the family of God interesting I don't know what that's what comes to mind when made me feel more time by faith and not by works that's a very important steam specially in Protestant Christian Traditions when Paul chose that language and the reason why he wrote included all of that in this letter was to achieve equity and unity among people of different ethnic groups and cultures in the justification by faith is the tool that you use when you want to show the people should be unified across ethnic cultural lines my point is the saying that's not always the use to which this idea has been
 all right. You're just to be sure and that's okay but for Paul this Theology of righteousness by face is about Unity so anyway we spent a while in Romans now but this is powerful stuff man yeah the weak and the strong thing is powerful you think about I've been translated in Modern English translations and Powerful in the entire I don't know why I just think of bodybuilders
 but yes exactly what is a powerful and non powerful then I start to think in more social terms here and that's what Paul is addressing sorry to interrupt you but well you know that without getting political it seems to me that it's about power and ultimately you hope that those who end up with power are looking at the best interests of everyone but it's just human nature that when you have power you use that power to help you keep that power and to protect yourself and then those who you like yeah and so just this this idea of the kingdom of God the ethic of Jesus is about when you when you have status and power you use at the serve and how this become such a concrete like issue in the Roman Church and Paul doesn't have to worry about it he's like look this is how we
 all this problem this is the way of Jesus if you have power use that for Unity and specifically not pleasing yourself don't let your privileged or comfortable social situation and way of life lull you into ignoring the huge gaps that exist within the body of Christ and the the division division creates Dynamics Paul says for people who don't have that same kind of social power and he thinks the obligation is on those who have a more privileged that him and his flows naturally out of the ethic of Jesus to hear there's another way that Paul does this that I had never noticed before this is of an observation back about Romans chapter 16 this is from Ben witherington commentary on it in all of those greetings and Romans 16 every one of these greeting glines begins with a verb or he says Hey greet
 Tukwila this person greet that person and Ben witherington is paying attention to the fact that the verb greet it's it's the commander an invitation that's plural so all of those verbs where he says Hey greet someone so great this person that person their second person plural the word Paul is addressing a group of people and telling them to greet the people that names that make sense so then it begs the question of full Tuesday talking to this brilliant so Ben witherington draws attention to see says notice that Paul doesn't directly greet all of his friends and co-workers and relatives in rum will do it for him he has the predominantly Gentile audience all greet my friend so and so are you always so brilliant so whether he says this is part of his rhetorical strategy to help affect some sort of
 conciliation among the Christians in Rome before he arrives there in particular he wants the marginalized Jewish Christians many of them newly back in Rome after exile to be embraced it is not at all an accident the Paul again and again and again In this passage uses the Greek verb spots of my that doesn't merely mean to greet that say what's up it means to wrap one's arms around each other to embrace them and when coupled with the command for 16 to offer a holy kiss it amounts to a command to treat them as family to welcome them into your home and your Social Circles Paul is going all out to create a new social situation in Rome overcoming obstacles to Unity that were mentioned in chapter 14 and 15 powerful stuff men treat them like your family like this the family of God
 yeah people who are not close to actual family. Clearly different ethnic group anyone listening we have siblings most people know we're siblings know that tension and siblings are really different and it's hard to get along and so it's that same Dynamic but just expand it out to people of other families and then of other cultures than that about the Catholic groups and so on and to be a part of the family of Jesus is to have an obligation by participating in this store in this family to be a bridge-builder especially if you're in a place of higher Social Status or opportunity or privilege it's just a very clear directive yeah and Paul talk about this more than just in Romans yes We've ran out of time I think the one last step to take his Paul's letter to the Ephesians he does a robust and much shorter
 Ecology of unity in the family of God and that also kind of paved the way for some of these scenes in the last book of the Bible revelations depiction of the unified family of the Lamb
