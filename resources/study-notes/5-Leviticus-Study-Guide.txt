STUDY GUIDE FOR LEVITICUS   2This is a problem! The whole 
purpose was for Israel’s 
priests to meet with God.  
But Israel’s sinful worship of 
the golden calf has damaged 
the relationship.Exodus concluded with Moses completing the 
tabernacle to host God’s presence, but unable to 
enter it1
EXODUS 40:34-35
What happened?! Leviticus 
happened: God takes the 
initiative to provide a way to 
reconcile his relationship to 
rebellious Israel.
Leviticus is all about God’s 
grace!The next book of the Bible, 
Numbers, begins by showing 
this problem has been re -
solved. 
“The Lord spoke to 
Moses in the tent of 
meeting in the Desert 
of Sinai.”The book of Leviticus opens 
by highlighting this problem.
“The Lord called to 
Moses and spoke to 
him from the tent of 
meeting.”Moses not entering the tent 
on Israel’s behalf shows the 
relationship still needs to be 
repaired in some way: How 
can rebellious Israel restore 
its relationship with God and 
live in his holy presence?SEE THIS THEME IN

each with a different meaning:3
Two are ways of saying “Thank you” 
to God by giving back a part of what 
he’s given to you in produce and 
flocks.Three are different ways of saying “I’m sorry” to God for 
wrongs done to others or to God, resulting in forgiveness of 
sins.
The three  “I’m sorry” offerings are all said to “provide atone -
ment” for the sin of the one who offers it, so that they are 
“forgiven”

dained as Israel’s mediators 
who will enter God’s presence 
on their behalf in an elaborate 
ceremony that marked them 
as holy. There’s also a story of 
two priests who violate God’s 
holiness and are destroyed by it 
(ch.10): a haunting tale remind -
ing us of the seriousness of the 
problem caused by Israel’s sin in 
the presence of God’s holiness8-10 21-22 
The qualifications for being a 
priest involve a higher degree 
of moral integrity and holiness: 
kind of like the way the assis -
tants to an important governing 
official are called to unique kind 
of lifestyle appropriate to that 
role of service.The people of Israel as a whole had demonstrated 
their own failure to keep covenant with Yahweh, and 
so needed a mediator, someone to represent them 
before God.5
God called the family of Aaron, Moses’ brother, to carry 
on this role after Moses: a special group of people who 
would enter God’s presence on behalf of Israel. 21-22 8-10

LEVITICUS 11:45
These are symbolic practices 
that reminded Israel that every 
part of their life was lived in 
God’s holy presence. 
God is the author of life. Any 
contact with things connected 
to death, like dead bodies, skin 
disease, blood, bodily fluids, 
rendered a person impure , and 
thus unable to enter into God’s 
holy presence.
Being impure is not a sin , you 
simply have to wait a few days, 
and take a bath before being 
pronounced “pure. ”
What is wrong is barging into 
God’s holy presence when 
you’re in an impure state. It’s 
a symbolic violation of God’s 
holiness.Israel was called to a level of 
moral holiness that correspond -
ed to God’s own goodness and 
set them apart from the other 
nations. 
These areas of moral integrity 
focus on sexual integrity, social 
justice, and right relationships 
within the family and commu -
nity. Their moral lives were 
to correspond to God’s moral 
goodness.6
Because Israel lived near God’s holiness, they were to 
reflect God’s own holiness and purity to the nations: 
“You shall be holy as I am holy”11-15 18-20

RITUAL PURITYSTUDY GUIDE FOR LEVITICUS   8At the center of the book is a 
ritual day that addresses the 
relational rupture between 
God and Israel. The priest 
takes two goats, puts his 
hands on them, and confesses 
all the sins of Israel, symboli -
cally ‘placing’ the sin on these 
animals.And the second animal is 
another powerful symbol: it’s 
cast out into the wilderness 
and symbolically ‘removes’ 
the sin of Israel away forever. 
They are free from their sin.
These symbols are explained 
in chapter 17: These sacrifices 
are not Israel’s efforts to ap -
pease an angry God. Rather, 
they are given by a gracious 
God who loves his people: 
he wants to show Israel just 
how serious and destructive 
their moral corruption really 
is as well as just how much 
he wants to save them and 
restore the relationship. 
And that’s what ‘atonement’ 
means: covering over some -
one’s wrongdoing, to restore 
the relationship.A B COnce a year all the sins of Israel were atoned for by a 
critically important ritual7
One animal is killed, and its 
blood brought into the very 
hot spot of God’s presence. 
This symbol is explained in 
17:11-12: when Israel wrongs 
God while living in his pres -
ence, it’s so offensive that it 
deserves some kind of  conse -
quence. God says he provides 
these sacrificial animals to 
take that consequence it, by 
dying in their place. LEVITICUS 16:1-19LEVITICUS 16:20-22

DSTUDY GUIDE FOR LEVITICUS   91Read Exodus 40:33-35, Leviticus 1:1, and Numbers 1:1: How does 
Moses’ inability to enter the tent demonstrate the problem between 
God and Israel? How do the first sentences of Leviticus and Numbers 
give us clues about the purpose of the book of Leviticus?EXODUS 40:33-35

NUMBERS 1:1
2Skim Leviticus 1-7: Notice the different purposes of all five offerings: 
How do the Grain and Fellowship offerings express gratefulness to 
God?LEVITICUS 1-7
3Skim Leviticus 11-15: Notice that all the ways a person becomes 
“unclean, ” are signs of mortality or death. How did these symbolic 
behaviors communicate something powerful about God’s holiness 
dwelling in the midst of Israel?LEVITICUS 11-15
4Skim Leviticus 18-20: In these laws about moral purity, notice the 
emphasis put on sexual purity and social justice. Notice how living by 
these laws would set Israel apart from all other nations (see especial -
ly Leviticus 18:1-5). Why does God call his people to holiness in these 
areas specifically?LEVITICUS 18-20
5Skim Leviticus 23-25: Notice the emphasis put on calendar rhythms 
and how important they are to help God’s people remember who 
they are and who God is. Do you have any rhythms of this kind in 
your life? Why or why not?LEVITICUS 23-25
6Read Leviticus 16-17: After watching the priests perform this ritual, 
what insights would it give to your own sin and selfish decisions? 
What would you learn about God’s character? Read the description 
of “atonement” and sacrifice in 17:11-12: how does it highlight both 
God’s justice and mercy at the same time?LEVITICUS 16-17DISCUSSION
