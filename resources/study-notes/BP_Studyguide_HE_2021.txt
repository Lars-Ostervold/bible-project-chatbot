HEAVEN
& EARTH
STUDY GUIDE FOR HEAVEN & EARTH   2In the Bible the word “heaven” is used in different 
ways depending on the context. 1
It can refer simply to “the sky.”
It can refer to “God’s space,” using the sky as 
a metaphor to describe God’s transcendence 
over all things.
God’s space is in contrast with “earth/land” 
which is human space. 
There is also recognition that God isn’t literally 
located in the sky, but rather his presence fills 
all creation. GENESIS 1:1

 Heaven and earth are depicted as distinct 
but overlapping dimensions of divine space 
and human space.2
Check out the following biblical stories that explore or assume this overlap:
JACOB’S DREAM
OF ANGELS AT BETHEL MOSES’ ENCOUNTER 
WITH GOD AT THE 
BURNING BUSH MOSES’ ENCOUNTER 
WITH GOD’S PRESENCE 
ON MT. SINAI 
GENESIS 28:10-17 EXODUS 3:1-6 EXODUS 19:9-12
Notice how the place 
he lies down becomes 
a ‘connecting point’ 
between heaven and 
earth (28:12). He says 
“the Lord is in this place” 
and so he names this 
place, which is located 
on earth, “the gate of 
heaven” (28:17).Notice in 3:5 how the 
space around the bush 
is called “holy ground,” 
i.e. space that is marked 
by God’s presence. See 
the similar story about 
Joshua near Jericho in 
Joshua 5:13-15.Note the descriptions of 
God’s presence that are 
appearing on earth!STUDY GUIDE FOR HEAVEN & EARTH   4 In the Bible these overlapping spaces of heaven 
and earth are specifically associated with T emples. 3

EXODUS 25-31

EXODUS 29:42-46
1 KINGS 8:27-30The garden in Eden is the archetypal place where 
heaven and earth fully overlap and humanity and 
God dwell together. 
The two temples described in detail in Exodus 
and 1 Kings are full of images and materials 
designed to recreate the garden scene.
God says the express purpose of the temple is to 
dwell among and meet with his people.
Solomon acknowledges that God’s presence 
fills all of creation, however he has chosen to 
become uniquely present in his chosen temple in 
Jerusalem.

Animal sacrifice is established as a means for 
dealing with Israel’s sin and injustice which enables 
God to remain in their presence.4
The animal’s life is offered in place of the one offering for their sin.
LEVITICUS 16 LEVITICUS 17:11
On the Day of Atonement 
two animals are sacrificed 
for the sins of Israel. 
Note how in 16:21-22 
the priest confesses 
Israel’s sin and places 
it symbolically on the 
animal.“For the life of a creature 
is in its blood, and I have 
given it to you to make 
atonement for yourselves 
on the alter; it is the blood 
that makes atonement.”STUDY GUIDE FOR HEAVEN & EARTH   6In the New T estament Jesus is described as the 
temple where heaven and earth overlap as well as 
the animal sacrifice offered for sin.5
