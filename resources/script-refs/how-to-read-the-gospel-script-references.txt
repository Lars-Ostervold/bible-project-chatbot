How to Read Biblical Narrative: The Gospel
Script References
Introduction
Jon: There are four books in the Bible that are ancient biographies of  
Jesus—the Gospel according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
Tim: And while individual stories about Jesus and his teachings are familiar to 
many people, these books have way more to offer if we read them from 
beginning to end and see how they connect Jesus’ story into the overall 
biblical storyline.
Jon: So let’s talk about how to read the Gospel.
Jon: First of all, this word “gospel.” What does it mean?
Tim: Well, it means “good news.”
Jon: Which raises the question—good news about what?
Tim: Well, in Mark’s Gospel, Jesus enters the story announcing that “the time is 
fulfilled, God’s Kingdom has come near, so turn around and trust this  
good news!” 1
Jon: So the good news is about God’s Kingdom arriving. But what does that 
mean?
Tim: Well, it’s Jesus’ way of summarizing the whole biblical story that leads up 
to himself.
Jon: The whole story. Okay. Give me the short version!
God’s Chosen People  
Tim: Well, the story begins with God creating a good world and then appointing 
humanity as his representatives to rule it. 2 But then the humans rebel over 
and over, leading to a world of violence and death. 3
Jon: That’s a problem.00:00–00:55

Genesis 6:5Tim: But God is committed to making it work. So he chooses Abraham and his 
family to restart the project. 4 Then through Moses, God brings the family 
into a garden land of abundance so that he can restore all of the nations 
through them. 5
Jon: Right. Israel becomes a kingdom with amazing kings like David. 6 But 
eventually, Israel rebels too, and it leads them into destruction. 7
Tim: But Israel’s prophets said that God wasn’t giving up. He was going to 
personally come and restore Israel, so that his justice and peace could 
spread to all nations and to all creation. 8 This hope was called the Kingdom 
of God.
Jon: And that’s what Jesus said he was bringing to Israel. 9
Jesus Brings Good News  
Tim: Yes. Jesus’ good news is about God’s Kingdom, the new creation that was 
arriving to restore humanity to their role as God’s partners in ruling the 
world. This is why the Gospel has so many stories about Jesus liberating 
people from death and disease, along with all of his teachings about 
generosity to the poor, or forgiveness and loving your enemies. 10
Jon: He was inviting people to live in God’s new world.
Tim: Exactly. And so this is one of the main goals of the Gospel, to show how 
Jesus is bringing the whole biblical story to its fulfillment.
Jon: So that’s why the Gospel authors are constantly appealing to the Hebrew 
Scriptures while telling the story of Jesus. 11
Tim: Yeah. Like when Jesus is born in Bethlehem, Matthew reminds us that this 
was anticipated by the prophet Micah. 12
Jon: And he directly quotes from Micah. 13
Tim: Yeah. These direct quotes are really common. But more often, the Gospel 
authors weave biblical phrases into the story without telling you, so 
you can discover it for yourself. Like when Jesus is baptized and God 
announces from the skies—
Jon: “You are my Son, my beloved; with you I am well pleased.” 14
Tim: Now, if you do some digging, you’ll find that God’s statement blends 
together phrases from three biblical texts to identify Jesus as the royal son 
of David, 15 the seed of Abraham, 16 and the servant who’s going to suffer for 
the sins of his people. 17
Jon: Woah. That is subtle.
Tim: Yes! And the Gospel accounts do this on every page. Every book is 
constantly showing how all of the biblical stories about Abraham, Moses, 
and David, and all the prophets—all of it points forward to Jesus. 184. Genesis 12:1-3

Jon: Now why are there four different accounts? Wouldn’t one be enough?
Tim: Well, the diversity is on purpose. Each of the four Gospel authors has 
shaped and arranged their stories about Jesus differently, so they can 
emphasize different things about him.
Matthew presents Jesus as a greater Moses, and so he’s grouped Jesus’ 
teachings into five large blocks, just like the five books of the Torah.
Luke highlights how Jesus is God’s royal servant from the book of Isaiah 
who brings God’s light to the nations.
Mark presents Jesus as a new start for humanity, bringing the mystery of 
God’s new creation crashing into the present.
And John focuses on Jesus’ claim to be Yahweh the God of Israel become 
human to do for us what we could never do for ourselves.
Jon: Those are really different from each other, but they all tell the same basic 
story: a man from the region of Galilee teaching this good news, but who 
is ultimately crucified as a criminal.
Tim: Yes. All four books of the Gospel are showing how the arrival of God’s 
Kingdom through Jesus led him up to the cross, where he was enthroned 
as the King of God’s new world. 19
Jon: He’s given a robe, a crown, and a scepter. 20
Tim: Right. As Jesus suffers the consequences of humanity’s rebellion, he is 
showing that the power of God’s Kingdom comes through his love and 
self-sacrifice. 21 And when he’s raised from the dead, we’re watching the 
dawn of the new creation. 22
Conclusion  
Jon: So the Gospel authors don’t just want their readers to know about the 
good news of God’s Kingdom. They want them to become a part of it.
Tim: Yes. The Gospel is designed to persuade us to trust and follow Jesus so 
that we can participate in the new creation that he began.03:27–04:57
