Generosity 
Script References
Modern Dinner Part y
Jon: Imagine your friend invites you to a party. You arrive and there’s lots of 
people, decorations, food, and drink—there’s enough for everyone.
Tim: When you’re hosted by someone that generous, you don’t have to worry 
about your needs. You can just enjoy yourself and focus on the people 
around you. 
Jon: Yeah. That’s what a good host wants for her guests.
Garden of Ede n
Tim: And this is the picture of the world that we find in the Bible. Creation is 
an expression of God’s generous love. 1 He’s the host, and humans are his 
guests in a world of opportunity and abundance. 2 
Jon: And we’re called to keep the party going, to spread his goodness. 3 This is a 
beautiful picture, but it’s not the way people experience the world. Rather, 
we find a world of scarcity and struggle—not abundance.
Jesus’ Biblical Imagination
Tim: And Jesus grew up in that kind of world, under military occupation, people 
losing their land, their families to debt and poverty.  
And yet he would say things like this: “Look at the birds. They don’t 
store up food for themselves, yet they have enough.” Or “Consider the 
wildflowers. They’re beautiful, and abundant, and they don’t stress about 
their existence. And you all should live that way too. ” 4
Jon: But surely Jesus knew that things don’t always work out. I mean, 
sometimes there really isn’t enough. 00:00-00:20

4. Luke 12:22-34Tim: And Jesus did experience poverty firsthand. But he viewed the world 
through the story of the Hebrew Scriptures, which claim that our scarcity 
problem isn’t caused by a lack of resources. Rather, the problem is our 
mindset that God can’t be trusted. 5
Jon: Maybe God’s holding out on me. Maybe there isn’t enough. And maybe I 
need to take matters into my own hands. 
Tim: And once we’re deceived into that mindset of scarcity, we can justify the 
impulse to take care of me and mine before anyone else. And that leads to 
envy and anger, violence, and a world where it seems like there’s  
not enough .6 
Jon: The party's over. It’s turned into a battleground.
Abraham’s Calling, Israel’s Failur e
Tim: But God wants humans to experience his generosity, and so he chooses 
one people, the family of Abraham. And he promises to give them the 
abundance that he wants for everybody else .7 God will provide what they 
need. 8 All they have to do is trust his generosity.
Jon: And through them, the whole world will see how generous the host  
really is. 
Tim: But that’s not what happens. Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites, enter 
a land of abundance, and they promptly forget the host who gave it to 
them. They act like it’s all theirs and like there’s not enough, and it leads to 
war and to Israel’s self-destruction .9
Jon: If I were the host of this party, I think I’d just give up.
Tim: But God doesn’t give up. What he does is surprising. He gives another gift.
Jon: Another gift? 
Jesus Living Out Generosit y
Tim: Yeah, but this gift is different. What God gives is himself. 
Jon: Oh right, in Jesus, the host himself comes to join in on the spoiled party.
Tim: And notice, Jesus lives with the conviction that there is enough and that 
our generous host can be trusted. His mindset of abundance allowed him 
to live sacrificially and generously, even towards his enemies. 10 
Jon: And Jesus called his followers to trust in God’s abundance like him.
Tim: And that’s why he said things like, “Sell your possessions and give to 
the poor.” 11 Or “Don’t worry about your life.” 12 He’s inviting us to live by a 
different story, one that is built on trust in God’s goodness and love.5. Genesis 3:1-6, 11:4

Jon: But living generously doesn’t mean life is going to go well. I mean, look at 
Jesus. He was betrayed by his friends, and he suffered. 13 
Tim: And this was no surprise to Jesus. He knew that people would take 
advantage of his generosity. In fact, that was his plan .14
Jon: Really?
Tim: Yeah, think about it. Jesus knows that we’re all hopelessly deceived by this 
lie that there’s not enough. 
Jon: Yeah. That lie needs to be defeated. 
Tim: And so that’s what Jesus was doing when he gave us the gift of his life. 
Jesus’ death was the ultimate expression of God’s generous love. 15
Jon: Yeah. God’s love can turn death into life and scarcity back into 
abundance .16 
Jesus’ Generosity Transforms the Early C hurch
Tim: Or as the apostle Paul put it, “You know the gift of our Lord Jesus the 
Messiah, that even though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so 
that you through his poverty might become rich.” 17
Jon: And Jesus called his followers to live like the real party has begun. 
Tim: Yes. He called it the Kingdom of God. 18 And our invitation to this party is 
yet another gift, the personal presence of God’s Spirit that can teach us 
how to trust the generosity of the host, just like Jesus did. 19
Generosity Toda y
Jon: And when you believe there’s enough, you start seeing opportunities for 
generosity everywhere—with our time and money, our attention.
Tim: Yes. One of the most important ways that we can experience the 
abundance of God’s new creation is sharing with others because of our 
trust that God is the generous host. 03:21-03:59
