Son of Man
Script References
Introduction
Jon: If you read the New Testament, you’ll notice that the most common title 
people used to describe Jesus is “the Christ,” that is, the Messiah.1
Tim: But surprisingly, Jesus almost never used that word to describe himself. 
Instead, he called himself the Son of Man.2
Jon: The Son of Man? What does that mean?
Daniel’s Dream Part One: Beasts and Empires
Tim: Well, the phrase comes from an important chapter in the book of Daniel in 
the Old Testament.3  Daniel was an Israelite prisoner of war who was forced 
to live in the empire of Babylon and work for the prideful, violent king who 
destroyed his home.4
Jon: That sounds horrible. 
Tim: And while he was living and working in Babylon, Daniel had this crazy 
prophetic dream. You ready for it?
Jon: I’m ready!
Tim: He saw four beasts crawling out of a dark sea—hybrid, monster-like 
animals, each scarier than the one before. And the fourth beast is so 
mutant there’s nothing to compare it to! And it’s violent, leaving death and 
destruction in its wake.5
Jon: What in the world is this about? 
Tim: Well, he’s told that these beasts symbolize violent, prideful kings and  
their empires.6
Jon: Oh, like the one Daniel’s enslaved to. 00:00–00:20

6. Daniel 7:16-17Tim: Yeah. And these creatures might seem random, but these images 
are developing an important biblical theme—how humans are these 
remarkable creatures capable of doing great good and horrible evil.  
Jon: How we can behave like animals. 
God’s Intention for Humanity in the Beginning
Tim: Right! Look at the first pages of the Bible. God creates the beasts of the 
field and humans, together, all from the dust.7  But then the humans are set 
apart and given a royal task of being God’s image.8  
Jon: So humans are like the animals but called to become much more.9
Tim: Yeah. They’re to be God’s representatives on Earth, ruling on his behalf like 
kings and queens. But keep reading and the humans are deceived by a 
beast, who says that they could be more than just God’s partners. 
Jon: Yeah—that they could become gods who rule on their own terms,10 which 
sounds good to them! 
Tim: But God knows this will be a disaster, and so he expels the humans to the 
realm of the beasts.11 
Jon: The partnership is lost.
Tim: But God makes a promise that one day a human will be born who won’t 
give into the beast. Rather, he will overcome and strike the beast while 
being struck by it.12
Jon: Okay, so for the rest of the biblical story, we’re waiting for that human. But 
instead, in story after story, we find people acting like beasts.13 
Tim: Yeah, like in the next story about Cain who’s jealous and angry at his 
brother Abel.14  God warns Cain that he’s facing a beastly urge called sin, 
a dark, mysterious kind of evil that consumes humans. But God says that 
Cain can rule the beast if he chooses.15
Jon: But he doesn’t rule the beast. He lets this urge devour him and he 
becomes a beast.16
Tim: And then after this, Cain’s children spread their animal-like violence,17 and 
it leads to the founding of a whole civilization known for its beastly pride, 
the city of Babylon.18
Daniel’s Dream Part Two: The Son of Man and Renewed Partnership
Jon: Okay Babylon! So fast forward—this is where Daniel is enslaved having this 
bizarro dream. 
Tim: Exactly. Now, watch what happens next in Daniel’s dream. He sees into 
God’s throne room where a court is set up, and God condemns the beast 
to destruction.19  01:20–02:53

19. Daniel 7:13-14Jon: That’s great!
Tim: And then Daniel sees that there’s actually more than one divine throne.20 
Jon: Oh right—the throne that humanity left behind.21
Tim: Right. There hasn’t been a human who was able to overcome the beast 
and rule alongside God until now.  Daniel sees a figure called the Son 
of Man, which means “human.” And he rides on a cloud up into God’s 
presence and then sits down on the divine throne to rule the world.22
Jon: The partnership is renewed.
Tim: Yes, and even more, all humanity worships and serves this Son of Man 
alongside God.23 
Jon: Huh. Worshiped? So this is no ordinary human. This is like a god-human.
Jesus: True Son of Man
Tim: Exactly. And so now you can see why Jesus of Nazareth, when he came 
onto the scene centuries later, chose this title, the Son of Man, for himself. 
He was claiming to be that truly human one on a mission to confront the 
beast.24  
Jon: He was tempted to seize power on the beast’s terms.
Tim: But unlike every human before him, Jesus resisted the urge.25 And then he 
went about banishing the beast from people’s lives, and he was teaching 
people how to rule the beast instead of being ruled by it.26   
Jon: Okay so how do you rule the beast?
Tim: Well, Jesus did it by giving up his life.27  
Jon: Wait. Rule the beast by dying? 
Tim: Yes. When Jesus was on trial in a human courtroom and being condemned 
to death, he said, “From this moment on, you will see the Son of Man 
sitting at God’s right hand and coming on the clouds.”28
Jon: But this is the moment he’s about to die.
Tim: Exactly. From one perspective, the cross looks like a beastly torture 
device. But Jesus viewed it as his throne.29 And on this throne, he exposed   
the sub-human nature of our evil by letting it do its worst, and then 
he overcame it with his divine life and love.30 Jesus’ execution was his 
exaltation.31
Jon: So Jesus is the first human to overcome the beast, and as a result, he can 
partner with God to rule the world.32 20. Daniel 7:14

and power, so we can rule the world as God’s partners, but Jesus-style—in
