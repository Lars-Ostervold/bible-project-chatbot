God’s Desired Partnership with Humanity  
Jon: If you’ve been around Christians, you’ve probably heard of the idea of 
having a personal relationship with God, which can mean different things 
in the Bible, like having God as a friend, or your father, or maybe your 
teacher.
Tim: But there is one particular way that the Bible talks about this relationship 
that you find all over, but, strangely, we don’t talk about it that much, and 
that’s the idea of a partnership with God .1
Jon: A partnership, like working alongside someone to accomplish a goal 
together.
Tim: Right, and this is actually what you see at the beginning of the Bible. God 
creates this good world full of all this potential .2 And then God appoints 
these unique creatures, humans, as his partners in bringing more and 
more goodness out of all that potential .3
Jon: But the humans don’t want to partner with God. They rebel and try to 
create a world on their own terms .4
Tim: And so this broken partnership is the Bible’s explanation for why we’re 
stuck in a world of corruption and injustice and the tragedy of death.
Jon: It’s not like there’s just one or two humans who have bailed on this 
relationship. In the story of the Bible, everyone has abandoned the 
partnership with God .5
Tim: So what God does is select a smaller group of people out of the many, 
and he makes a new partnership with them called a covenant .6 And 
in a covenant, God makes promises and then in exchange asks his 
partner to fulfill certain commitments. And the purpose of all of this is to 
somehow use this covenant relationship to renew his partnership with         
everybody else .7 00:00–01:40

7. Genesis 12:3Jon: Now there are actually four times in the Old Testament that we’re told 
God initiates a covenant relationship —with Noah ,8 Abraham ,9 the nation of 
Israel, 10 and King David .11 
Tim: And it’s through these that God is forming a covenant family into which all 
people will eventually be invited.
Jon: So let’s see how these work. The first one is with Noah .12
God’s Covenant with Noah 
Tim: So in this story, God has just brought the flood to cleanse the world of 
humanity’s corruption, and Noah and his family are the only ones left. 13 
And so God makes a covenant with Noah saying, “Listen, I know that 
humans will continue to be evil, but despite that, I’m not going to destroy 
it like this again. Instead the earth will be this reliable place for us to work 
together. ” 14 
Jon: Great! So what does Noah have to do?
Tim: Nothing. And that’s what’s so interesting about this first covenant–is that 
God is promising to be faithful, even though he knows humans won’t be. 15
God’s Covenant with Abraham  
Jon: The next time we see God make a covenant is with a man named 
Abraham. God chooses him—promises to bless him, give him a large 
family, lots of land where they can flourish .16 
Tim: And in return, God asks Abraham to trust him and train up his family to do 
what is right and just. 17 And the whole reason for this covenant is that God 
says somehow he’s going to bring his blessing to all families of the world 
through this one famil y.18
God’s Covenant with Israel  
Jon: So that’s Abraham. The next time we see God make a covenant is when 
Abraham’s family has grown into the tribe of Israel.
Tim: And this covenant is with the whole tribe. God asks them to obey a set of 
laws, which are these guidelines for living well as a community of God’s 
partners. And if they do this, then God promises to bless them, and then 
they will become a people who represent him to the rest of humanity. 19
Jon: That’s the covenant with Israel. The last covenant is with King David.8. Genesis 9:1–17

19. Exodus 19–2017. Genesis 18:19God’s Covenant with David  
Tim: Yeah. The tribe of Israel has become a large nation ruled by David, and 
God asks David and his descendants to partner with him by leading Israel 
and obeying the laws and doing what is just and right. And God promises 
that one day one of David’s sons will come and extend God’s Kingdom of 
peace and blessing over all the nations. 
Jon: So those are the four covenants that God makes in order to restore his 
partnership with the whole world. 
Tim: But here’s what happens: Israel breaks the covenant. They worship other 
gods, they allow horrible injustice, and so they lose their land and are 
forced off into exile .20
Jon: So it seems hopeless, but during this time, Israel’s prophets talked about 
a day when God would restore these covenants in spite of Israel’s failure—
somehow .21 
Tim: Yeah. They called it the new covenant.
Jesus Fulfilling the Covenants  
Tim: And this is actually what’s so interesting about Jesus is that he’s introduced 
into this story as the one who fulfills all of these covenant relationships. 
 We are told that he’s from the family of Abraham ,22 and so he will bring 
the blessings of that family to the whole world .23 We are told that he’s the 
faithful Israelite  24 who is able to truly obey the law .25 And we’re told that 
he’s the king from the line of David .26 And so he goes about extending 
God’s Kingdom of justice and peace to all .27
Jon: That’s really remarkable for one guy. 
Tim: Yeah, and what it highlights is perhaps the most surprising claim of all 
made about this man—that Jesus is no mere human, but rather God 
become human .28 And God did this in order to be that faithful covenant 
partner that we are all made to be but have failed to be .29 And so 
through Jesus, God has opened up a way for anyone to be in a renewed 
partnership with him .30
Jon: So Jesus calls people to follow him, 31 and become part of his new 
covenant family.
Tim: And despite their failures ,32 Jesus is committed to making them into 
partners who are becoming more and more faithful.
Jon: The story of the Bible ends with a vision of a fully renewed world full of 
goodness and peace .33
Tim: And there’s this renewed humanity there, partnering together with God 
to expand the goodness of his creation .34 So the end of the Bible’s story is 
really a new beginning.03:06–03:42
