Chaos Dragon
Script References
00:00-00:31 Introduction
Jon:  In the ancient world, many cultures told stories about a monster of 
death that lurks in the deep, dark sea. In these tales, the dragon, and the 
sea it lives in, represent the chaos that threatens to drag creation back 
into nothingness.
Tim:  The ancient authors of the Bible not only knew about these symbols, 
they also used them in stories and poems all over the Bible. 
Jon:  Really—dragons in the Bible? 
How the Bible Uses Dragon Imagery
Tim:  Yes! On the first page of the Bible, God brings order by separating the dry 
land from the chaotic sea, and there, he contains the sea dragon.1 And 
this monster is connected to that dragon-like snake that confronts Adam 
and Eve in the garden—a spiritual being using the power of chaos and 
death to lure humans into their own self-destruction.2 Biblical authors also 
use dragon imagery to describe violent human kings, like Pharaoh, who 
enslaved and murdered the ancient Israelites.3 Even the famous Goliath—
the details of his armor and weapons depict him as a scaly, snakey giant.4
Jon:  So the sea dragon is loose in all these forms, but it can be defeated.
Tim:  Yes. But be careful because the power of the dragon is strangely 
appealing. A dragon slayer can be enticed to use the dragon’s power.
Jon:  And so become a dragon themselves.5
Tim:  Right. 1. Genesis 1:20-2100:32-01:37

5. 2 Samuel 11:1-12:15Dragon Empires and the Son of Man
Tim:  In fact, entire empires can become like dragons. During Israel’s exile in 
Babylon, the prophet Daniel has a dream about four monstrous beasts 
rising up out of the sea. 
Jon:  Whoa—mutant dragons?!
Tim:  They represent violent kingdoms in league with dark spiritual powers.6 But 
then, a new character appears, rising up from the land to sit beside God’s 
throne. And as the dream ends, Daniel sees those monsters destroyed.
Jon:  So who is this dragon slayer?
Tim:  Well, Daniel calls him “one like a Son of Man.” 7
Jon:  The Son of man—that’s what Jesus calls himself.8
Jesus Confronts the Dragon
Tim:  Yes. In fact, the gospel authors depict Jesus confronting the dragon in 
many ways. Like when he tramples over the stormy sea,9 or when he 
resists the tempter in the wilderness,10 or when he overcomes death and 
sickness in others.11 And even when the power of the dragon does its best 
to entice Jesus … 
Jon:  Jesus doesn’t give in. 
Tim:  Jesus resists the dragon in a surprising way. He surrenders his life and 
willingly enters the belly of the beast.12
Jon:  Wait?! The dragon slayer is slain by the dragon?
How to Overcome the Dragon
Tim:  Well, that’s how it seemed. But Jesus trusted in God’s power to create new 
life on the other side of chaos and death.13 And he called his followers to 
confront the dragon in the same way.
Jon:  Which means?
Tim:  Resist the temptation to use the violent, destructive ways of the dragon.14 
And also, don’t be afraid of it. Jesus’ victory over the beast has created a 
way to escape its power.15 And trust in the power of God, who will one day 
defeat the dragon once and for all.1601:38-02:17
