Heaven and Earth
Script References
Our Space and God’s Space  
Tim: So in the Bible, the ideas of Heaven and Earth are ways of talking about 
God’s space and our space.
Jon: So I understand our space really well. We live here. There are trees, rivers, 
mountains. But my understanding of God’s space gets a little fuzzy.
Tim: And what we do get in the Bible are images trying to help us grasp God’s 
space, which is basically inconceivable to us.
Jon: So these are two very different types of spaces.
Tim: Yes. They’re different in their nature. But here’s what’s really interesting, is 
that in the Bible, these are not always separate spaces. So think of Heaven 
and Earth as different dimensions that can overlap in the same exact 
space.
Jon: So we talk a lot about going to Heaven after we die. But this idea of 
Heaven and Earth overlapping, we don’t talk a lot about that. 
Tim: Which is kind of crazy because the union of Heaven and Earth is what the 
story of the Bible is all about—how they were once fully united, and then 
driven apart, and about how God is bringing them back together once 
again. 
In the Beginning  
Jon: So let’s go back to the beginning where Heaven and Earth—they’re 
completely overlapping?
Tim: Yeah. This is what the Bible’s description of the garden of Eden is all 
about. It’s a place where God and humanity dwelt together perfectly, no 
separation. And humans then partner with God in building a flourishing, 
beautiful world, and so on.1
Jon: But as humans, we wanted to do things a different way. We wanted God 
out, and we wanted to create a world apart from him.200:00–01:00

1. Genesis 2
2. Genesis 3Tim: Yeah, so we have these two spaces now. And the Bible actually uses lots of 
different kinds of words and phrases to refer to these two spaces to make 
a clear distinction. 
Jon: So you’ve said that these spaces can overlap though, so explain how that 
works. 
The Temple  
Tim: Yeah. This is where we have to start talking about temples because in the 
biblical world, you experience God’s presence by going to a temple. That’s 
where Heaven and Earth overlap. 
Jon: Now there are two types of temples described in the Bible. One is a 
tabernacle, basically a tent that was built by Moses.3  And the other was 
this massive building made by Solomon.4
Tim: And these temples were decorated with fruit trees and flowers, and 
images of angels, and all kinds of gold and jewels, and so on.5  And these 
are designed to make you feel like you’re going back to the garden.6  And 
at the center of the temple was a place called the Holy of Holies, which 
was like the hotspot of God’s presence.7
Jon: Now we can go and be with God again.
Tim: But not so fast because the temple also creates a problem.8  So God’s 
space is full of his presence and goodness and justice and beauty, but 
human’s space is full of sin and injustice and the ugliness that results.9
Jon: So how do these spaces overlap if they’re so different and they’re in 
conflict with each other? 
Tim: This was resolved through animal sacrifice.10
Jon: Yeah. That’s kind of weird. What do animal sacrifices have to do with this?
Tim: Yeah. The idea is this: animal sacrifices, somehow, they absorb the sin 
when the animal dies in your place. And it creates a clean space, so to 
speak, where you are now free to enter into the temple and be in God’s 
presence.11
Jon: Okay, so if I’m an Israelite and I live in Jerusalem, I might be able to be in 
God’s presence. But you said the story of the Bible is all of Heaven and 
Earth reuniting? 
Heaven and Earth Overlap in Jesus  
Tim: Right, so we have to keep going in the story where we come to Jesus in 
the New Testament. In the Gospel of John, we hear this claim that God 
became human in Jesus and “made his dwelling among us.”12 Now this 
word “dwelling” is really curious. It literally means “he set up a tabernacle 01:44–03:20

12. John 1:14among us.” And so what John is claiming right here is that Jesus is a 
temple. He is now the place where Heaven and Earth overlap. 
Jon: What’s interesting about Jesus is that he isn’t staying in this safe, clean 
space.13 He’s running around, hanging out with sinners.14  He’s healing 
people of their sicknesses and forgiving people of their sins.15
Tim: He’s basically creating little pockets of Heaven, where people can be in 
God’s presence. But he’s doing it out there in the middle of the world of sin 
and death.
Jon: And he keeps telling everyone that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.16
Tim: And he even told his followers to pray regularly that God’s Kingdom come 
and that his will be done here on Earth just as it is in Heaven.17
Jon: But a lot of people are threatened by Jesus,18 and they kill him, which 
seems to spoil this whole plan to reunite Heaven and Earth.19
Tim: But we have to go back to a scene earlier on in Jesus’ story, where John 
the Baptist saw Jesus and said, “Behold, this is the Lamb of God who takes 
away the sin of the world!”.20
Jon: So Jesus isn’t just talked about as being a temple. He’s also talked about as 
being the temple sacrifice.21
Tim: Yeah. So the cross is now the place where Jesus absorbs sin to create a 
clean space that is not limited, like animal sacrifices.22 Jesus’ sacrifice has 
the power to keep spreading and spreading and reuniting more and more 
of Heaven and Earth.23
The Future: Heaven Comes to Earth  
Jon: And this is all really great, but it leaves one big question in my mind, which 
is: what happens when I die? Don’t I just fly over to God’s space to be with 
Jesus?
Tim: Yeah, so a few times in the New Testament we learn that Christians will be 
with Jesus in Heaven after they die. But that is not the focus of the Bible’s 
story.24  The focus is on how Heaven and Earth are being reunited through 
Jesus and will be completely brought together one day when he returns. 
So in the book of Revelation, we get this beautiful image of the garden of 
Eden, now in the form of a city, coming to end the age of sin and death by 
redeeming all of human history in a renewed creation. And God’s space 
and human’s space completely overlap once again.2513. Matthew 4:23
