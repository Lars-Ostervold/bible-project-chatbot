Why So Many Sevens?
Jon: The number seven is a big deal in the Bible.
Tim: Yeah. In biblical Hebrew, the word "seven" is connected to the idea of 
fullness or completeness. 
Jon: And that’s something we all long for but don’t often experience. Instead, 
we find ourselves working endlessly, fighting back chaos with no real rest.
Seventh-Day Rest Established in Genesis
Tim: Yes. Now keep all that in mind as we turn to Genesis 1 in the Bible. It 
begins with darkness and disorder, but then God speaks to bring about 
light and order so that life can flourish. 1
Jon: And this happens over the course of six days.
Tim: Each day is marked with the phrase, “there was evening and there was 
morning.” 2 But on the seventh day, something special happens. 
Jon: God stops and rests.
Tim: Right. Creation is brought to its completion on the seventh day. And that 
phrase, “there was evening and there was morning,” it doesn’t appear on 
day seven. 3
Jon: It’s like a day with no end. 
Tim: On the seventh day, God’s presence fills his creation. The land provides 
for all of God’s creatures, including humans, who are appointed to rule the 
world with God forever. 4
Jon: Kings and queens of the seventh-day rest. I can get into that. 00:00-00:21

Tim: But the humans are deceived by a dark power, and they forfeit that rest. 5 
They’re exiled into the wilderness, 6 where they have to work as slaves to 
the land. 7
Jon: Until they die and return to the dust from which they came. 8
Tim: But God wants to restore humanity back to that seventh-day rest, so he 
chooses to give the family of Israel that experience of ultimate rest, so 
they can share it with others. 9 
Jon: But how? They’re in Egypt, slaves to an oppressive empire who is grinding 
them into the dust. 10 
Tim: So God confronts Egypt, and he liberates the Israelites, 11 taking them 
through the darkness and chaos on the way to the promised land. 12
Jon: Now, while they’re on their way, they find themselves in the wilderness. It’s 
easy to get lost; life is a struggle. 13 They are not in the land of rest yet. 
Rest Reestablished with Israel
Tim: But while they’re on the way, God invites them, in the wilderness, to start 
living as if they’re in the promised land. 14 
Jon: How do you practice the future rest in the wilderness?
Tim: Well, God tells them that every seventh day, they’re to stop their work, or 
in Hebrew, to shabat , so that they can rest and enjoy God’s good world. 15
Jon: So take a whole day to live as if that ultimate rest has already come?
Tim: Yeah. This is the Sabbath, celebrated every week on the seventh day. 
But there’s more! The Sabbath is just one of seven festivals that Israel 
practiced every year—each one anticipating that seventh-day rest. 16 
Jon: That is a lot of sevens.
Tim: And there’s even more! Every seven years, the Israelites were to liberate 
slaves, forgive debts, and let the land rest for a whole year. 17 And then 
every seven times seven years, was the ultimate seventh-day rest called 
the year of Jubilee. If anyone had lost their land or gone into debt, all was 
forgiven, everything restored.  
Jon: Wow, so the Sabbath, these feasts, the year of Jubilee, it’s all pointing 
towards the hope of future rest. 
Tim: Right. Now when the Israelites went into the land, they forgot their God, 
and so they forfeited their chance to rest in the promised land. 
Jon: They’re exiled and enslaved again by an oppressive nation, led back into a 
world of chaos and disorder. 18 01:10-01:57

Jesus Ushers in True Rest
Jon:  It’s at this dark point in the story that Jesus appears, and he launches his 
public mission on a Sabbath day. 20 
Tim: Yeah. He read aloud from the scroll of Isaiah, saying that it was time for all 
captives and slaves to be released because this was the year of the  
Lord’s favor. 21 
Jon: What did he mean “This is the year of the Lord’s favor?”
Tim: He was talking about the ultimate Jubilee!
Jon: Ah. So Jesus is claiming that seventh-day rest would come through him.
Tim: Right! He said that he was the Lord of the Sabbath .22 And he confronted 
disorder and darkness in all of its forms, liberating people from sickness, 
sin, even from death itself. 23
Jon: Yet Jesus was killed, 24 so even his work was undone.
Tim: Well, it seemed that way. But notice: Jesus timed his death to take place at 
the end of the week. 25 His body rested in a tomb during the Sabbath, and 
on the eighth day, he rose from the dead .26 
Jon: Oh wait. The eighth day? You mean the first day of a new week? 
Tim: Exactly. Jesus’ resurrection was like the first day of a new creation, where 
God’s light and life broke into the darkness. 
Jon: So because of the resurrection, we have hope in God’s promise of future 
rest. But we’re not there yet. It’s like we’re still in the wilderness where we 
experience struggle and pain. 
Tim: But as we journey towards that ultimate seventh day, Jesus invites us 
to experience a taste of real rest now by following him. Or in his words, 
“Come to me all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give  
you rest.” 2719. Jeremiah 29:10-14,
