  1Introduction
Jon: The story of the Bible begins in a garden temple with a 
couple, Adam and Eve, as God’s royal priests. 
Tim: They are supposed to partner with God to take care of creation. And 
this place where Heaven and Earth are one is filled with God’s blessing.1
Jon: But Adam and Eve were led astray by a deceptive creature 
and exiled from God’s presence. Their vocation as priests is 
lost, and with that, all humanity descends into violence. But 
God promises that a new royal priest will come to lead them 
back into the blessing of Eden by sacrificing himself.2
Tim: So later on, we meet a new couple, Abraham and Sarah. 
God promises that through their family, the royal priest will 
come to restore the Eden blessing, not just for them but for 
all the nations.3 And so it’s this family that grows to become 
the Israelites, and they eventually journey to Egypt and then 
become enslaved under the violent rule of King Pharaoh.4
Jon: So God appoints a man named Moses to represent him 
to Pharaoh and to mediate on Israel’s behalf.5
Moses and the Kingdom of Priests
Tim: Moses confronts Pharoah and then leads Israel out of slavery 
and into the wilderness, where they eventually come to 
Mount Sinai.6 And here God appears to all the Israelites, 
inviting them to become “a kingdom of priests.” 7
Jon: So he’s inviting everyone to be priests, like 
Adam and Eve were priests in Eden. 
Tim: Right. But it turns out, the people are afraid of God, and 
they don’t want to come close to God’s presence.8 And 
so Moses goes alone up to the top of the mountain. The Royal Priest: Moses and Aaron

two being worship Yahweh alone and don’t make idol statues.9
Tim: And Moses sees some really amazing things up 
there. First, he sees God’s heavenly temple, and then 
also a blueprint of it called “the pattern.” 10
Jon: Ah right, the plans for the construction of the tabernacle.11
Tim: Yeah. It’s designed as a symbolic model of Eden, a place 
where Heaven and Earth are one. Then Moses sees something 
else, the pattern of a glorious human figure.12
Jon: The high priest who will work in the tabernacle.
Tim: Right. And only this priest can go in and out of the sacred space on 
behalf of others. He’s dressed in white, he wears a crown and is glowing 
with jewels. He’s an image of the royal priest that we’re waiting for. 
The Kingdom of Failed Priests and a Shining Intercessor
Jon: And yet the man who’s called to be Israel’s first high priest 
is the brother of Moses, a man named Aaron.
Tim: And while Moses is up seeing all of this, down at 
the foot of the mountain Aaron is misleading the 
people by making an idol statue of God.13
Jon: So the soon-to-be high priest is breaking the 
first of the ten commandments. 
Tim: Yes. And so God gets angry, and he tells Moses that he is 
done with these people—he’ll just start over with Moses. But 
Moses stands before God, and he intercedes for the Israelites. 
He even offers his own life as a sacrifice for their sins.14
Jon: And while God doesn’t take Moses’ life, he does 
forgive the people like Moses asked.15
Tim: And so when Moses comes down from the mountain, he’s shining, 
just like the high priest that he saw in his vision! It’s like he’s the 
real priest that his brother was supposed to be but failed.1602:16-03:0710. Exodus 24:9-11,

Jon: And from here the tabernacle is built.
Tim: And then Aaron’s family is installed to the priesthood.17
Jon: But really? Even after this bad start? 
Tim: Yeah, and actually things get even worse. God gives Aaron and 
his sons really precise instructions on how to act as the priests. 
And then on their first day on the job, Aaron’s two sons violate 
God’s commands. And because they’re in a place of great 
privilege and responsibility, God deals severely with them.18
Jon: They die inside the tabernacle. Things are not 
looking good for the priesthood of Aaron. 
Tim: Right. Both Aaron and his sons have failed in their 
priestly role, and this begins to make us think: maybe 
God’s people need a different kind of priesthood.
Jon: Maybe one that’s more like Moses, who 
surrendered his very life over to God. 
Tim: Yes, and while Moses is great, he also fails to be fully obedient to God, 
and so both he and Aaron die outside the land promised to Abraham.19
Conclusion
Jon: So Moses was only an image of the kind of 
priest that God’s people will need.
Tim: Right. We’re still waiting for this ultimate royal priest who will 
intercede like Moses and offer his life for the failures of others. 
Jon: The Israelites eventually make it into the promised land, 
and there they appoint a king and establish a kingdom.20 
Perhaps now God’s royal priest can arrive. 
Tim: And this brings us to King David, and his story 
is what we’re going to look at next.21 03:08-04:01
