The Ancient World and the Image of the Gods  
Jon: So if you lived in ancient Bible times, odds are you lived under the 
authority of a king.
Tim: And many of these kings claimed that they were gods, and they would 
even call themselves the “image of god.”
Jon: Meaning they had authority to tell people what to do, order things to be 
made.
Tim: Yeah. They got to define good and evil. And these kings would often 
make statues of themselves, which in Hebrew were called tselem, often 
translated as “idol” or “image.”  1
Jon: But for Israel, they didn’t view their kings as the god. In fact, they were 
never supposed to even make images of God. 
Tim: That’s exactly right, and that was really unique for that time and culture. 
This was rooted first of all in Israel’s belief that you can’t reduce the 
Creator God down to any one thing in creation. But there’s another reason. 
People aren’t to make images of God because God has already made 
images of himself. 
Jon: When did he do that?
Humans and God’s Image  
Tim: Let’s go to page one of the Bible. And the first person we meet there is 
God. He’s the one with authority over all creation. 2 He speaks, and creation 
obeys. 3 And he defines what is good and not good. In other words, he 
alone is king. But then surprisingly, as the pinnacle of all of God’s creative 
work, he makes humans. And he calls all of them the “image of God.”  4 
Jon: Wait, so he gives all humans the authority to rule?  5 00:00–0:59

4. Genesis 1:27–27
5. Genesis 1:28–30Tim: Exactly. That’s what he goes on to say. He tells the humans to subdue 
the earth and to rule it .6 And so this task that once belonged only to elite 
kings is, here in the Bible, the task of every human being. This was a 
revolutionary statement in its day because all humans are being called to 
rule and to participate in the human project .7 
Rule and Subdue  
Jon: So what does this mean? I mean, how are we all supposed to rule?
Tim: So the picture we get in Genesis is gardening .8 
Jon: Gardening?
Tim: Yes. Gardening. So they rule the earth by cultivating it, by harnessing all 
of the earth’s raw potential and then making something more and new out   
of it. 9 
Jon: So growing food for each other?
Tim: Yes, but that also includes growing families then, which become 
neighborhoods. And then they create communities where people are 
going to work and take care of each other and build businesses and cities 
that will expand to new places and so on. 
Jon: So ruling is really the day-to-day acts of our work and creativity. 
Tim: Yes. We take the world somewhere. This is humanity’s divine and       
sacred task. 10 
Jon: Yeah, and this all sounds really nice. And humans have designed some 
pretty great things, but just as often, we create things that cause a lot of 
suffering and a lot of injustice. So maybe we shouldn’t actually be ruling.
Tim: Yeah, so the Bible addresses this. In Genesis, what happens is that God 
gives humans a choice about how they’re going to rule. So are they going 
to use their authority for the benefit of others, which is God’s definition 
of good, or are they going to turn away and define good and evil for 
themselves and use their authority for self-advantage ? 11 
The Image Shattered 
Jon: And in the story, they choose to define good and evil on their own terms .12
Tim: And so this is the Bible’s depiction of the human condition. So sometimes 
we pull off amazingly good stuff, 13 but just as often, despite our best 
intentions, we act selfishly, and we create evil in the world .14 
Jon: And so we’re stuck as mediocre rulers making a mess of things.6. Genesis 1:28

14. 1 Kings 11:1–8, 12:4Tim: But that’s not the end of the story. So the Bible goes on, and it makes this 
claim that all of this was resolved when God bound himself to humanity 
through Jesus. And he showed us what it looks like to truly rule as               
a human. 15 
Jon: So what does it look like?
Jesus Restores the Image  
Tim: Well, Jesus ruled by serving and by seeking the best for others by putting 
himself underneath them and loving not just his friends but also his 
enemies. 16 
Jon: And that’s not a typical way to rule.
Tim: And not only that, Jesus confronted the consequences of all the evil and 
the death that we have created by our messed up ways of ruling. And he 
takes it. I mean, he lets it kill him. 17 And so when the New Testament writers 
looked back to Jesus’ resurrection, they see a whole new future opening 
up for all humanity .18 
Jon: Jesus is a new way to be human .19 
Tim: Yeah. That’s why they called Jesus the “image of God” or the “new   
human. ” 20 And not only that, they also believed that Jesus’ divine life     
and power is now available to heal and to transform us to become our    
life and power. 21 
Jon: And this sounds really nice, but what does it really look like? 
Tim: So practically, the apostle Paul said it looks like people being filled by 
Jesus’ own presence and Spirit, filled with love and joy and peace and 
patience and kindness and goodness and integrity and gentleness and 
self-control .22 
 He says this is the new humanity that God wants to create in us, so that 
we become people in whom God’s image is being restored, people who 
will move the human project forward. And that’s actually how the story 
of the Bible ends. It’s a renewed world where God is on his throne and 
his servants are all around him. But they’re the ones ruling over this new 
world, taking it into new uncharted territory with Jesus as their healer and 
their guide. 23 15. John 1:14–18
