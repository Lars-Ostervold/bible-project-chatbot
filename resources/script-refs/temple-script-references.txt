Temple: God’s Earthly Home
Jon: If you could go back to the city of Jerusalem during Bible times, the 
biggest thing you’d see is the temple. 
Tim: This beautiful building was designed by King David and built by King 
Solomon, and they believed that it was the home of the God of  
the universe. 1
Jon: Wait. I thought God’s home was in Heaven.
Tim: Well, the whole point of this earthly temple is that it’s the place that 
overlaps with God’s heavenly home. The temple is where God lives and 
rules all creation as king. 2 
Jon: That’s cool. But even Solomon who built the temple didn’t believe that it 
could contain the God of the universe. 3 Right?
Tim: Yeah. The building was just a symbol, and it pointed to the fact that all of 
creation is God’s temple. 4 And that’s actually what the first page of the 
Bible, Genesis 1, is all about.
God Dwells in All Creation
Jon: Really? It says that creation is God’s temple?
Tim: Well, it doesn't need to say it; the whole story shows it. In Genesis 1, God 
creates an ordered world out of a dark wasteland 5 by speaking in a series 
of seven days. 6 Then on the seventh day, God’s presence fills creation 
as he takes up his rest and rule. 7 Similarly, the tabernacle—and later the 
temple—were built and dedicated in a series of seven speeches and seven 00:00-00:48

in God’s presence. 
Jon: Ah, so all of creation is where God intends to dwell. It’s like his temple.
Tim: Exactly. Now, turn the page to Genesis 2 and we get another portrait of 
creation. This one focuses in on the land. And in the center of the land is a 
region called Eden, which in Hebrew means “delight.” 15
Jon: And in the middle of “delight” God plants a garden in which God and 
humanity live  together. 16
Tim: And that’s why the temple was modeled after the garden, filled with 
imagery of gold and flowers. The menorah symbolized the tree of life. It’s 
the place where God dwells with his people. 17
Jon: Oh, got it!
Humans Fail at Their Priestly Role
Tim: And check this out. In the temple, the Israelite priests and Levites were to 
“to work and to keep” the temple in God’s presence. 18 This is exactly the 
job description given to humanity in the garden of Eden. 19 
Jon: So these humans were the first priests. But instead of ruling with God, 
they wanted to rule on their own terms, and they’re exiled from the  
garden-temple. 20 
Tim: And like Adam and Eve, Israel’s leaders also wanted to rule on their own 
terms, and they too were exiled. 21 
Jon: The temple was destroyed, 22 and this left them wondering: Did God give 
up on Israel? Will God bring about a new creation?
Tim: Well, the biblical prophets anticipated the day when God would create a 
new temple with a new priesthood. That’s when God’s presence would fill 
all of creation. 23 
Jon: And when the Israelites returned to the land, they did rebuild the temple. 24 
Tim: But that temple didn’t turn out the way the prophets hoped. 25 In fact, later 
Israelite prophets said that this temple was hopelessly corrupt (Malachi).
Jon: So they’re still waiting for the ultimate temple.13. Exodus 31:1,

Tim: And here we come to the story of Jesus. He said that through him, God’s 
presence and rule was coming into our world in a new way. 26 And he 
presented himself as a new kind of priest. 27
Jon: But Jesus wasn’t a priest, and he didn’t work in the temple.
Tim: Right. Jesus said that God’s presence—his rest and rule—was filling the 
world through his own life, death, and resurrection. Jesus was claiming 
that he was the true temple. 28 And this new temple would expand out to 
include all of creation. 29
Jon: That’s a really big claim!
The Church: Mini Temples
Tim: And it got even bigger! After his resurrection, Jesus said that God’s 
presence would come to dwell in and among his followers so that they 
would become mini temples. 30 
Jon: Communities of people where God rests and rules. 31 
Tim: Exactly. This is the Bible’s vision of the Church, which is described as  
a temple. 32 
Jon: Not a building but people.
Tim: Yeah. Like when Peter says, “You all are living stones built up as a temple 
for God’s Spirit to dwell.” 33
Jon: So at the end of the story, do we ever get a new physical temple?
Tim: Well, not exactly. What we see is a renewed cosmic temple, just like 
Genesis 1. 34 And this new creation doesn’t need a temple building because 
through Jesus, all creation is now the place where God rests and rules the 
world with his people. 35 02:57-03:30
