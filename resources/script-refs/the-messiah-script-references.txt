The Snake in the Garden
Jon: There’s this crazy story at the beginning of the Bible. We have Adam and 
Eve, and they’re in the garden of Eden.1
Tim: And everything in this garden is great. It’s exactly as it should be. Except 
there’s this one tree they’re told by God not to eat from because it is 
dangerous and it will kill them.2
Jon: So that’s it? Avoid this fruit tree and we’re fine?
Tim: Right. It seems pretty simple. But in this garden there is a snake, and it 
starts telling a different story. It says that if you eat of this tree, it’s not 
going to kill you. In fact, it’s going to make you become like God.3
Jon: And Adam and Eve, they believe the snake, and they eat the fruit.4
Tim: And because of this, the goodness of the garden is tragically lost, and evil 
and death enter into God’s good world.5
Jon: Now, why is there a talking snake in the garden? I mean, this thing is a 
problem.
Tim: Yeah. It’s very strange. And even more strange is that the Bible doesn’t say 
why or how this thing even got there.6  It just presents the snake as this 
creature who’s in rebellion against God and that wants to get other people 
to doubt God’s goodness and lead them on a path towards death.7  And so 
whatever this snake is, it’s the source of evil that pervades our world and 
our lives even still today.00:00–01:12

Jon: But there is some hope because right here in the story, God makes this 
really interesting promise to Adam and Eve.8
Tim: That someone is going to come in the future—a son of Eve—and this guy 
is going to come, and he’s going to crush this serpent's head and destroy 
evil at its source. However, during this battle, the serpent is going to bite 
this guy’s heel.9
Jon: So it is like a mutual destruction.
Tim: Yeah. It’s this very strange but beautiful promise. And it’s just left hanging 
there until the next key moment in the story when God singles out this guy 
named Abraham and says that through his family, goodness and blessing 
is going to be restored back to all of the nations of the world.10
Will this Family Crush the Snake?
Tim: As we follow this family, we get to one of Abraham’s great-grandsons, this 
guy named Judah. And he receives a promise that a king will come from 
his line and that the whole world is going to follow this king. And he is 
going to bring peace and harmony, and there will be lots of food and wine 
and milk and vineyards. And it’s going to be awesome.11
Jon: The first king that we meet from the line of Judah is a guy named King 
David. And he is a hero. Maybe he is the snake crusher.
Tim: But it turns out that David is infected with the same evil as the rest of 
humanity.12 He never crushes the snake—just the opposite. However, God 
makes a promise to David that this king is going to eventually come from 
his line.13 But as you go on in the story, one by one, each generation of his 
sons, they’re just total chumps. They give into the snake, they choose evil, 
they go after money and sex and power and following other gods.14
Jon: Things get so bad that they run the nation of Israel right into the ground, 
and the big, bad empire of Babylon just takes them out.15
Tim: And so now there are no more kings to even fulfill this promise.16
Jon: So it seems like the whole plan is lost.
Tim: But during these dark days, there’s this crazy group of guys called 
prophets. And they just kept talking about this coming king and reminding 
us of the promise that he’ll come, he’ll defeat evil, he’ll restore the 
garden.17 Now, one specific prophet, Isaiah, he tells us more about why 
this king is bitten. Isaiah says that the promised king receives this wound 
because of humanity’s evil and that it kills him. But then, all of a sudden, 
he comes back. And Isaiah says it’s because he suffered this wound that 
he can now become a source of healing to other people.18
Jon: But the Old Testament ends, and the snake-crushing king that everyone 
has been talking about never shows up.01:13–01:51

Tim: And this is why when the New Testament begins, it introduces us to Jesus 
of Nazareth, not as some random guy but as someone who comes to fulfill 
these specific ancient promises.
Jon: Yeah. We learn that he is from the line of David, Judah, and Abraham.19
Tim: And he goes around Israel announcing that the goodness of God’s 
Kingdom is here now.20 And he begins confronting the effects of evil on 
people by healing them,21 by forgiving them of their sins and evil.22
Jon: Many people are now believing that this is in fact the promised king.23
Tim: But Jesus began telling his closest followers that he was going to become 
king and bring peace by taking the full effect of humanity’s evil into 
himself.24
Jon: The fatal snake bite wound.25
Tim: Exactly. And so it seems like the serpent wins.26  And this story actually 
would be a tragedy, except for what happens next. Jesus rises from the 
dead.
Jon: And now Jesus has the power over evil and death for himself.28
Tim: And so the rest of the New Testament is then making this claim that Jesus’ 
power over evil and death has now become available to us, to begin 
confronting the effects of evil in our lives.29
Jon: But even still, death and evil are a real problem in our world all around us.30
Tim: And so the story of the Bible ends by describing this future day when 
Jesus comes back and he finishes the job. He destroys the snake once and 
for all, and he restores the goodness of the garden here on Earth.3103:40–05:12
